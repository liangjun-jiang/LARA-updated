<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has done it again.  As a 40 gig iPod owner, I love the shuffle.  Its the go anywhere, do almost anything, store more than music mp3 player. Battery life is great, storage capacity is more than the stated 120 songs, and the sound is INCREDIBLE! ...as is the price.  I used it while excercising and there were no skips.  Easily fits into your pocket and weighs less than a set of keys! The shuffle will fit perfectly into your busy lifestyle. P.S. The required installation software can be a bit of a problem if you already have iTunes on your computer.

<Title>A non-iPod-user's review
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a compact, flash-based mp3 player, the shuffle fills a niche in the market.  Apple's greatest contribution to the mp3 player market was the aesthetics of their players: love it or hate it, you have to admit that the iPod looks unique, and most people (like me) will go as far as saying it looks pretty good.  Before everyone and their neighbor's dog owned one, you could pull out an iPod and make the room stop.  The shuffle continues this tradition.  Apple's sleek, simple design hides a fairly powerful little flash-based player.  It's tiny (although not the smallest player on the market, despite what their ad people may say), feather-light and on the whole, very trendy looking.  The 512 memory is just about the right size for what I suspect is the primary target market for these players: people looking for a small, durable alternative to their iPod for short trips, work-outs, etc.  Other pros:  -Simple, intuitive control interface  -Easy to interface with pretty much any machine  -iPod users can use all their .AAC format music  -No, seriously, this thing weighs next to nothing.  Cons:  -No external LCD.  Apple had to sacrifice SOMEthing to make this product as small and lightweight as it is, and the LCD screen is the first of these things.  While not a problem for those intimately familiar with their music collection or those not picky about what they listen to, many users will definitely not appreciate the inability to easily navigate the songs contained on the player.  -Terrible battery life.  Much like the iPod compared to its competitors (e.g. the Zen Touch), the Shuffle has less than 2/3 the average battery life of comparable features (meaning with no LCD screens).  Again, Apple had to sacrifice something in order to make the product as lightweight and small as it is, and this shouldn't be a problem for the majority of users, as the shuffle seems to be geared toward short trips.  -Like the iPod, you must interface the Shuffle with iTunes.  Now before the pro-iPod army comes and kills me, let me explain: I have nothing against iTunes, it's a great program (as evidenced by Microsoft blatantly copying it with Media Player 10), but I personally despise being forced to use any one application with my hardware.  If Apple had made the Shuffle drag'n'drop compatible, it would have been a much better purchase.

<Title>Sexy, small,  white iPod Shuffle - I like
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own an iPod.  I never felt like I need all the storage.  I would be fine with 120 songs, therefore I ordered my iPod shuffle as soon as it came out.  When I got the package at home, I was in love.  Even the packaging is sweet. I loved the smell of the packaging, the sexy flirty display in the box and ultimately the size.  But wait, how about the sound and the music...  I Love it.  I synced my iPod with iTunes (I only have 40 songs) and listened to it in shuffle mode and WOW... the sound is amazing.  I have found the end of my portable music player search.  Not only does it sound great but its a head turner.  Everywhere I go, people want to touch it, feel it, listen to it.  Stay away!!!  I have to fight them off with a stick.  Now, I walk the streets of New York, shuffled...  Now I drive Shuffled, heck, I even go to the toilet... shuffled.  I'm all shuffled up.  Lets face it, you add songs to your playlist that you love, not bad songs but great songs, and the shuffle feature is awesome.  Its like it picks the perfect songs to follow... Its a virtual dj...  Now, stay away, cause this shuffle is mine.  Till death or technical issues, do us apart.  Yahhhh!!!

<Title>uhhhhhhhh, NO!
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a confessed musicaholic. I could sit and download for hours. But, why would anyone buy this flash memory player when there are other ones with more features AND a display? I will stick to my Iriver any day. The inline recording feature that it has is remarkable. It really is cd quality. Not that I want to rip off the music industry, but with this feature you can record an album, for instance, off of AOL for nothing. It really is cd quality when you record like this. This IPod can't do that. I think the hard drive Ipod is a brilliant idea, and maybe someday I will get one. But for the money, you can buy another flash memory MP3 player, with a display, with a radio, with voice recording (some may find that useful, I don't) and the inline recording. And they look better. Whats with the boring white? Naah I'm not sold on this.

<Title>Don't be taken in
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> Don't believe the Apple hype or the ranting by Apple disciples. Comparably-priced players have a ton more features - a display, FM-tuner (great for the gym), voice recorder, replaceable battery, folders to organize tracks on the player, equalizers, shuffle functions, great ease of use, and on and on... And this player is plagued by the common Ipod problem - when the battery dies the player becomes a paperweight. Steve Jobs once said that the only thing flash players are good for are to sit unused in the back of drawers. Well, his company has made one that will fulfill that prophecy.

<Title>Deserves the 5 star rating, reviewing it for what it is
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No, it doesn't have a display. No, you couldn't get at 512 MB player with a display for $99. The Shuffle breaks new ground in flash memory players not only because it is an equisite player (you gotta hold one in your hand and be baffled at the big sound coming out of such a small piece of plastic), but because of what iTunes has done with it. The Autofill function is awesome, and perfect for what the Shuffle is. I didn't want to take my 40 Gig to the gym for fear of dropping it... the shuffle is fantastic for that. Plus, I can listen to audible books on it and quickly get to them by just starting at the beginning in non-shuffle mode.  This really is just a phenomenal product, and I haven't had any complaints... on the contrary, I'm surprised at everything that I can make it do without the screen. Seriously, I don't miss the screen with this thing. You won't either.  Small, light, inexpensive, impressive performance. What's not to like?

<Content>This is my FIRST time buying an Apple product.  Mainly because they are waaay too expensive.  But the Shuffle is great.  I use it mainly at the gym, or out running.  My Zen Xtra is way to big while lifting weights.  With this puppy, I don't feel like I'm carrying around a tape player that weighs like a brick.    I don't recommend if you're a hardcore music listener.  Casual music listeners/runners/weight lifters will love this.

<Content>This product is not revolutionary by any means as some people would have you believe. It's all hype. There simply are better flash based mp3 players that are equally as small. Have a display, great battery life, shuffle function, fm radio, voice recording, excellent sound quality, and look pretty, and have more codec support, but don't come with all the hype. Creative Muvo TX fm is priced similarly, small, and is much better in my opinion, and also prettier.Don't follow the sheep.

<Title>People Just Don't Get It!
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just because the Shuffle doesn't tailor to your standards doesn't mean it's going to be a failure. The Shuffle is the ideal mp3 player for the active user. When I go to the gym with my iPod mini, I still notice the weight in my pocket and the harddrive is subject to damage when I move. Also I never look at the screen. This is why I got the Shuffle. I don't need a screen BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW WHAT SONGS ARE IN MY MP3 PLAYER! And for 100 bucks you really can't go wrong.  Only Apple could pull off an idea of making the Shuffle's most obvious "weakness" (no screen) and turn it into it's main feature (Life is Random).

<Content>The shuffle works nicely.  Itune is not user friendly.  The battery dies after occasionl to moderate use for a little over 1 year.  What kind of battery do they put in the shuffle.  Normal Rechargeable battery last way longer than that, at least 2 to 3 years minimum.  For a great company and an expensive product, they sure know how to short-change the customer.  Horrible.  Yeah, I'm done with Apple.  That is why monopoly is not good for any company or business.

<Content>It should be 4 1/2 stars but I will give it the benefit of a doubt. I love it.  It is intuitive, very thoughtful and simply designed much like an Apple computer.  But sometimes it would be nice to have playlists or a viewer. 512 MB is about the maximum I would down load into one without the ability to quickly find what you want to hear. I have purchased 2 refurbished Shuffles with no problems for the last 2 years. Just remember to disconnect it the way the instructions tell you to.

<Title>A Poor Introduction to Apple Products
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's not much more to be said about this product.  It does what it advertises.  And with the newest iTunes, Windows support is better and not as completely annoying to install compared to a year ago.  But this cheap player doesn't really have much to offer.  You are locked into using iTunes to "organize your media" which is very annoying for Windows folks.  I guess this is "personal preference" as most people are willing to jump on the iTunes bandwagon.  Other than the software annoyances, the player itself really doesn't impress.  Battery life isn't that impressive compared to most other flash players.  From what I hear, the battery also dies within 1-2 years AND its not user-replaceable.  The biggest problem for most people is that there is no navigational display because Apple wanted to save money on manufacturing.  That's inexcusable.  The headphones that come with it are terrible and should be replaced immediately with something more comfortable/better sounding.    The manual and website are confusing even for the technologically inclined.  The website is terribly managed and you have to walk through several screens before getting to wherever you want to go if you're looking for technical support.  Don't expect to get much help there.  All-in-all, if you want to "look cool" and do the ipod thing, this isn't the player for you.  You probably will want an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EP4TWQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-4646271-3591145">iPod Nano</a> instead.  If you're a Windows user and you want a good, cheap mp3 player, save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one.  As cheap as it is, its not worth it.  iAudio makes some good cheap players that act as a USB Mass Storage device instead of using proprietary software, but you can also sync it with whatever as well.  Frankly, I don't know who this player appeals to.

<Content>The iPod Shuffle is really a pretty good value for $99. It is small, and to the point. You'll want this if you use the Apple iTunes Music store. If you don't, or aren't interested in trying it out, or are commited to a *shiver* Microsoft Windows Media store, then maybe look at other stuff too.   If you do like iTunes, however, the Shuffle is small enough to bring anywhere, and the added capability of using it as a 'jump drive' is very convenient.

<Title>sold out!!!!!
<Date>Tue Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was in the Apple Store on the first day of sales for the Ipod Shuffle.  I would say they were sold out in 5 minutes or less. Apple should have manufactured more of these before their release.  The Apple store I went to had maybe 50-80 Ipod Shuffles for sale. If you thought about the purchase for more than a 30 seconds --you most likely lost out. Most of the purchasers were previous Ipod owners who wanted something smaller/cheaper/more durable. A regular consumer had very little chance of getting an Ipod Shuffle. At least with the Ipod Mini they were in stores for the first few weeks.  The day wasn't a total loss however.  I purchased a Mac Mini with the 512mb memory upgrade which I am very happy about.   The employees did a great job of handling the 200+ crowd. After the first 1/2 hour it calmed down greatly.  Nice store + knowledgeable salespeople.

<Content>I understand Apple is trying to set a "random" list revolution with the Shuffle, and I've purchased one, but I realize there are many times I wish to be able to see how much further to go forward to play what I want.  I can't memorize a 100 song playlist.    I don't know where Apple is going with this, I'm going to return my Shuffle for a Sandisk 512, which is now lower in price and has a screen.  I don't know where Apple is going with this...I wouldn't buy a car without essential gauges and I'm certain you will find it cumbersome at times with the Shuffle.  I don't recommend this product.  I'm sure it has great margins for Apple though.  I need the screen, and you will find you will too.

<Content>I say that this mp3 is great, but only for some things.  I already have a 4th generation and ipod mini, but i bang them around a lot, so when i heard about this new one, i pounced on it.  People can complain about it not having a screen or a radio, but who cares, i never use the radios that i do have.  And as to it not having a screen, i know what songs i am putting on it, and i am only using it to practice for basketball with.  So to sum it all up, get this if you have a larger player, and want a smaller one that you can bang around more.   But if this is your first mp3, i would pass and get a different one.  Also the battery life is very good, i can easilly get about 18 hours out of it.  Overall great player!!

<Title>Superb replacement flash player and complement to iPod
<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the iPod Shuffle as a replacement to my flash player (256MB).  I have a 3rd gen iPod and use a flash player when jogging and at the gym, so my comments are from that perspective.  The lack of a display is not an issue for me, due to my usage of the player.  Prior to receiving and using the Shuffle, I was a bit concerned about the limited ability to navigate to different songs on the Shuffle and the shuffle aspect of the player.  However, after actually using it, I am sold on the shuffle aspect of the player.  Initially, I allowed iTunes to load the Shuffle randomly from my music library; but found that there are a lot of songs that I don't care to listen to when exercising.  So, I started loading songs using the 'drag-and-drop' method.  Once loaded, I switch the Shuffle to play random and I'm good to go !!  I'm only listening to songs I chose to begin with, so random is nice.  Although, playlists are nice; it is extra work to create them.  I left the player on all day yesterday to test the battery life and the battery charge light was still green after 8 hours.  This is the point at which my old flash player (powered by two rechargeable alkaline AA cells) would need a fresh pair of batteries.  As for the sound quality, it's excellent.  Just as good as my 3rd gen iPod and old flash player.  My only complaint about the design is that there is no 'reject' button.  Although the Shuffle has a 'next song' button, I can see the utility of a reject button in addition to the next song button that would mark the song for removal on the next sync with iTunes.  This would make removing songs that I did not want on the Shuffle easier and 'refreshing' it with new music from time-to-time easier.

<Content>This is a really awesome player.  Although it was a bit confusing at first, the iTunes iPod import software was very easy to use.  Comes with a full charge so you don't need to wait 4 hours to use it when you get it.  Extremely tiny!  it's even tinier than the ones in the pictures on the web.  I would say this is a little more than 2 inches tall.  Lanyard cap is very secure.  Left earbud doesn't fit very well, but still sounds great.    Overall, this thing is great.  The no screen is not a problem because unless you have thousands of songs, you should know all your song's titles.  Also, the shuffle feature is great.  It's full of surprises.  You never know what will come next.    A++ player.  This will set the benchmark for all over flash players to come.

<Content>Why do people buy bad products like the Shuffle and then try to justify their purchase with dumb reasons? I like to get my money's worth when I buy things, and to me a portable music player that has no display so you can't even skip to the song you want, is pretty close to worthless. I recommend the Sandisk 512 or 1GB MP3 players, or heck, ANY other Mp3 player that has a DISPLAY, as a better alternative.

<Content>I've had it for 2 weeks now and I love the shuffle.  Seems like most of it's critics are people that don't own it.  This is my first apple product.  The battery life is awesome.  You get 12 hours and most importantly, it's rechargable so you never have to buy AAA or AA batteries.  If you are the type of person that sits with your MP3 player to pick out each song, this is NOT for you.  If you are a person that likes MP3s as background music to other activities, then this is a GREAT low cost solution.  In some ways, it is actually superior to the original iPod.  It's got a better battery life, is smaller and is lighter.  Listen to people that have one, not other people that just seem to hate apple.

<Title>a nice intro to the world of iPod
<Date>Sat Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought one of these for my mom-ever since she saw my blue iPod mini, she's wanted an MP3 player that can hold a lot of music but is small enough for her to workout with.  So when I saw the shuffle at a store, I figured she'd want one. I was right, she did want one.  It looks really cool, it is about the size of your thumb and all.  I had to help with it as Mom works and all and is unfamiliar with MP3 players.  It has a few subtle differences from my mini, including its lack of display.  We had to get used to the Autofill option, that was something that did not pop up when I was learning how to use my mini.  One of the other major snags is that Media Player would not let my mom export her songs into iTunes-she has to redo her music library, which is a pain.  She does like the Shuffle, but I get the vibe that it will only have a constant use until Mom can get the necessary funds to get the green mini.  Overall, it was okay, but I really do like my mini iPod better, and so do my parents.  It was a good starting point, however, and excellent introduction to MP3 players for my parents.  My parents are not computer illiterate, they just haven't caught on to the MP3 player movement yet-they prefer playing Legends of Camelot, which was the other reason my mom likes the Shuffle-it charges while she plays Camelot.  I give it four stars because it is fairly easy to use, but not as nice as its bigger counterparts.

<Content>After having my friends whine on AOL and chats about how cool their new iPods  were they got around X-Mas,I felt cheated. I am a lover of MD and MP3CD. An iPod was not an option do to price and well...I saw this coming I guess. So patiently I ignored those Apple comercials with  U2 and dancers in black shadows.  And rant I did about how iPod doesn't have this or that my MD has or iTunes this and iTunes that for two years! Now finally with this lower price and average storage for my taste,I can say to my friends out there "look what I got!"  It's so tiny. My stick of gum looked big. But it's really slick to use. I put nearly a day and a half MP3's and simular files together for my meditation rutines,and it played for almost a day! I do wish it had more power. iPods lack this feature. They should look into 56 and 72 hour playback like HI-MD then I'd rave more. Sadly too my Realmedia files were useless too! Made me a little nervous,but it still plays most formats. For the price you can get two,but well..iPod is that price isn't it? I'm enjoying using this player it's cute. Apple just look into the battery issue and make peace with Real,that issue is just pitiful.

<Title>PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the worst and I mean WORST Apple product I have ever used! I bought one with my money because I was replacing my dead 3rd Generation iPod. I liked how small it was, and since I only needed 512 MB, it was a good buy for $99 in May 2006. But then only a month later, I was listening to it on the bus and it died suddenly. It wouldn't turn on, but Apple gave me a new shuffle. Once again it died and it wouldn't come back to life. I got a pink nano for Christmas and that is way better than this piece of trash. I don't reccommend this iPod to anyone!

<Title>This iPod is overrated.
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPods are a great line of music players, and I respect that. Sadly though, I was anything but impressed with this iPod. Apple tries to trick people saying "Oh yeah, random is the new order." Anybody who's smart knows that they just said that [...] as an excuse for no display. This would be a great flash-based MP3 player if only they had a display! It's so annoying when you put an album on your iPod, find out about a song you like and then want to know who does it. Then you look down and say "Oh, silly me. I forgot! I don't have display! But that's alright...random is the new order!" Even the new iPod shuffles don't have displays. The iPod shuffle though, is a pretty good player overall. The battery life is decent and the iTunes software is incredibly easy to use. The ear buds have very good quality, and the unit itself is very easy to use. It doesn't need batteries either, but this can also be a con, because it means once your lithium-ion battery dies, then you have to either buy a new iPod or pay [...] to replace it! A radio would have been nice, along with a voice recorder and equalizers. 2 of my family members have Scandisk Sansa M230s that have these features and cost only [...]. The iPod is a great player, but consider other brands as well. Also, I filled this thing up in an hour (not kidding). I get bored of music pretty quickly, and this thing can only hold 12 albums. If I could go back now, I would definitely go for a 30 GB video.

<Content>It does exactly what it says it does (thus 5 stars) but IMO get a Nano instead as it's only slightly more expensive, has many more features yet still gives you the same shuffle feature.  This is a great answer for your parents or grandparents though who want to listen to music while they take their morning jog or walk though because it really is easy to use.

<Title>Ka-Put!
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this two Christmas's ago.  Even though iTunes can be temperamental I loved having this! I primarily used it when I went to work out.  One day, I'm at the gym and I turned it off for a couple minutes to talk to someone.  I go to turn it back on and two lights just flash back and forth.  Then iTunes doesn't even recognize it! It says it needs to be restored.  So I clicked "restore" and then it says it's unable to restore due to an "unknown error."  I look into sending it to Apple to get it fixed but it would cost as much to buy a new one as it would to get it fixed!  I just couldn't believe it was go kaput just like that.  Not to mention Apple's has the worst navigation on it's website.. you have to click through seven pages just to get a simple question answered!

And thats not the only thing before the battery died the ipod would only allow the headphones to play on one earphone.My parents thought it was the headphones..so we bought a new pair after a while it doesnt work again.I'm planning on returning this piece of junk pretty soon and I've been looking at some ipod nanos.Those look better.

<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Aside from having the iPod name, this thing is nothing like it's parent-product.  No screen, not as easily usable.  If you're interested in finding a specific song on your iPod Shuffle, it'll be pretty difficult unless you know your list pretty well.  I'd consider getting the SanDisk 512 Mb (or 1 Gb) Embedded MP3 player instead.  It costs the same, has a screen, FM tuner, and voice recorder.  A much added bonus is that it doesn't use proprietary software (ie iTunes).  Just plug it in and drag and drop your mp3s.

<Title>A great intro into the IPOD world!  
<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Shuffle for a few days, and I love it.  I've thought about an IPOD for over a year now, but I couldn't justify the cost.  Under $100, this is easy to justify, and of course, I can already see how it's going to fill up too easily.  That just makes me want to also get a 20 GB IPOD to hold all my music, and keep this one to work out with.  I personally love the shuffle feature.  I don't care that you don't have a screen, because the simplicity of the thing is really beautiful in this day of complicated user manuals.  This is one of the few truly plug and play products I've bought in the past few years.   This is not ideal for a real techy, unless they have a larger IPOD and just want an additional tiny thing for working out (it truly is the size of a pack of gum!).  It is an ideal gift for someone's parent, pre-teen, or anyone who is not terribly techy, because it is so incredibly intuitive.  ITUNES is also awesome in that regard - easy, easy, easy.   Basically, this ipod shuffle satisfies a particular niche for Apple, to get the non-techies hooked as well.

<Title>The Shuffle is a good introduction to the iPod world.
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been eyeing the hard drive-based iPods for a while now. Although they are fabulous products, I haven't (yet) been able to justify the $299 price. Also, since I'd mostly use an iPod while riding my bike, I was concerned about dropping it.  So, when the solid state $99 Shuffle arrived onto the scene, I considered this would be a good introduction to the iPod. Plus, its price is only a little more than a data-only USB flash drive. I could use the Shuffle for both music and data, I reasoned.  I'm rather impressed with the operation and sound quality of my Shuffle. The size is perfect for popping it into my pocket while I'm out on my bike, and I don't have to worry about breaking it. The Shuffle works elegantly with iTunes, and the battery is long lasting. I like how easy it is to recharge:  just plug the Shuffle into your USB keyboard.  My only significant criticism is that the three-position sliding switch does not have clear detent positions. It's too easy to slide the switch from "Off" to "Shuffle," bypasing the center "Play in Order" position.  Two interesting things have happened since I've owned the Shuffle. Wearing the white earbuds prompts "thumbs up" signs and smiles from strangers -- and now I'm more inclined to buy the 20 gigabtye iPod. Apple has devised some way to make its products addictive.

<Title>Good entry-level iPod
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the first Apple MP3 player that I've purchased.   I was drawn to it by it's size, simplicity and cost.  I don't need the LCD display or any complex controls since I'll be using it while motorcycling and with my limited song library, I figured the 512MB will be plenty for the tunes I may want to carry with me. PROS: I haven't tried the included Apple earbuds yet, but find that this small unit (about the size of a pack of gum) has extraordinary sound when coupled with my Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones.  The iTunes software (included) is easy to use and the online store has an immense library. CONS: The only fault I can find with this player so far is that I find the on/off switch to be difficult to use.  It's just a slider on the rear of the unit and I wish that some form of finger-grip was built into it. ALL-IN-ALL: I'm so impressed with the sound quality that I'm already thinking about the 1GB version (or a regular iPod). You can't beat the deal for the price!

<Content>If you absolutely need to look for a particular song you want to hear, then this is not for you. I have a 4G iPod (with view window) and I never even look at it except to find a playlist. Then I put the thing away and zone out. With a Shuffle, you set up your playlist and load. You can play through the list or random play your music. Of course there are always people who stare at their big iPods all the while, looking for specific songs to play, rotating the wheel all over the place and burning up precious energy. Set up your playlists the way you want to hear your songs on iTunes on your computer, load and you'll be good to go!   Woof, the lights and buttons and switch takes some getting use to...  If you're wondering whether to get the 512 or the 1gig... I don't know if I'd ever listen to 1 gig of music in one sitting before the juice runs out... Believe me, you can get an awful lot of music onto a 512. However if you're also thinking of using the device for file transfers, then the 1 gig would serve both purposes well.   A very excellent 2nd iPod for traveling light. And also easy to lose!

<Title>Simply Awesome, but Not For All
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yesterday I purchased my first MP3 player, the iPod Shuffle. I was extremely excited about this purchase, and when I got it home, opened up the fancy green and white packaging quickly. The minute I saw the size of it, I was amazed. In many pictures and advertisement, the size of the iPod shuffle seems a bit bigger. Its not, Amazingly light and thin, I was perplexed of how music and complex music files could fit into it. I read the little cheat card that comes with the packaging, got myself familiar with the device and got readt to plug it in. I have an iBook G3 laptop Paris 2004 LE edition, and along with the iMac/eMac(some models), it has a plastic 'case' for embelishment. Now the whole point of the iPod Shuffle is that its plug and play, you are able to stick it into your USB port, autofill from iTunes and go listening for up to 17 hours.(thats how long it went for me, Apple underestimates their products battery life) But because of the plastic casing around my laptop, there was no way for me to stick my little buddy iPod Shuffle into my main computer, and only computer with iTunes. Disappointed, I headed over to the Apple Store to pick up the dock, and that flashy sports case. The store, to my amazment, was jam-packed. There were two more iPod shuffles at the counter, and people were fighting to get to them.  I looked around and found one of the helpful employees there. They did not have the docks, or cases. Instead I got a USB re-direction port, just a cord with a USB port and a USB plug, so I could Shuffle. Its a simple problem with a simple solution, but Apple should consider the many thousand people who still have their older products. Just because a company evolves, doesn't mean that all of their customers will upgrade. When I finally got my iPod Shuffle hooked up to my laptop, iTunes quickly filled it up with the 123 (perfect for the product) songs on my library. Autofill is an amazing new feature to iTunes, and its very nice how the iPod can update itself, and not re-load songs onto itself. When I put the earbuds in, and turned the little rectangle on, I was amazed at the sound it had. It sounded just as good as by Bose sound system downstairs. The sound quality is awesome, and some mediocre songs sound fantastic on it. Some new, more comfortable earphones, and your ready to go. Some people here complain about the lack of LCD, well Apple was trying to reach a more leanient part of their customers. I, and I assume many others, listen to their songs in iTunes on the Party Shuffle mode. The price is very nice, and there was no way I was going to buy another iPod for the ridiculous $300 they were expecting. Some people are not as money safe as I, but many are. Apple iPod Shuffle is your own private Radio station on the go, with only the songs you want and the choice to skip a song. Many mention the difficulty that is brought up when trying to find a song. The whole point is not to find a specific song, but to mix it up. Also, a big up for this iPod is the motion. Shuffle, is no skip, unlike the other iPods where if you shake it a bit, the music goes crazy. You can do all the crazy moves the people do in the Shuffle commercial and it wont skip even once. Overall, this little baby is for those who are fine with not knowing whats coming next, and not knowing what their listening to. And who needs a voice recorder, FM radio and other things in their MP3? Their just useless add-ons to a music player. Overall, iPod Shuffle is for people OK with not knowing what's coming, athletes, and people with few favorite songs. I recommend this product to those kind of people. Happy Shuffling

<Title>Yes, yes, a triumph of design
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's true.  This is another brilliant Apple product.  I ordered one for my wife and it finally came this last week.   Kind of like the regular iPod, the Shuffle is hard to quantify.  I mean, it's just not that easy to explain why this product is better than comparably priced mp3 players with screens and Napster compatibility.  But holding that little, tiny thing in your hand is cool, and that's always tough to beat.  The software for iTunes that comes with this is easy to use, and if you take the time to line all the songs up you can get what you want, but that kind of seems to defeat the whole shuffle idea.  I definitely prefer mine with a screen.    I haven't figured out any way to gauge the battery life, and if you have an older computer without a USB 2.0 port you will need to buy a power adapter.   I would recommend this for someone who likes the iTunes model over Napster's and doesn't want to spend a lot of money on their MP3 player.  It's also a way to get a fun little piece of Apple cachet for $100.

<Title>Apple has the MP3 player market sewn up, top to bottom
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My first impression was not about how small the iPod shuffle is (plenty of MP3 players are small), but how light. When it's in a pocket or bag or around your neck, you just don't notice it's there (which will, I'm sure, lead to many people losing their iPod shuffles, or having them stolen, and not finding out till much later). It is, I expect, the lightest way to carry around 120-150 songs that has ever existed.  Like online columnist James Lileks, I've found the iPod shuffle experience educational. He wrote that, "when you have 10,000 songs you are always compelled to see what's next, whether it's better than this. When you have 100 songs, and A) have no idea what comes next and B) haven't heard 60 of them in a long long time, if ever, you tend to listen."  The lack of a screen is fine in most circumstances, if you're just listening as you would to the radio or a CD changer. But it can be a pain if you're trying to find a specific track, or move on to the next album in a set, or simply figure out what that song you never knew you had is called when you're away from the computer. Still, it prods you to enjoy the music rather than analyze it.  What's most striking, after you've used it a bit, is the iPod shuffle's minimalism. Apple obviously spent considerable time and effort figuring out what to take away, rather than what to add, and how to make the remaining stripped-down essentials as easy and basic as possible. Here is everything you can do with it when it's not plugged into a computer:  * Turn it off. * Switch it to regular play. * Switch it to shuffle play. * Check the battery status. * Plug or unplug headphones (or another audio line for the 1/8" jack). * Start music playing. * Pause music playing. * Lock the front-panel controls (so they don't press accidentally), or unlock them. * Go back the beginning of the list of tracks. * Skip to the next track. * Start the track over, or skip to the previous one. * Fast forward or rewind (in choppy increments). * Raise or lower the volume. * Remove the end cap, to pop on the lanyard cap, or to plug the iPod in.  I don't think I missed anything. And neither did Apple.  But that last task is the key. Besides the shuffle's appearance and good sound, its ability to plug in and synchronize with iTunes is what makes it an iPod. That's regardless of whether you buy songs from Apple's store, which I don't, or just use files ripped from your album collection, or those you make with GarageBand, or whatever. Much of the intelligence and power of the iPod brand--more than I realized, especially for this model--comes from that piece of software. Little touches make a huge difference, like the ability to transcode tracks to good-quality 128�kbps AAC files if they are stored at a higher, larger-file-size bitrate--or in an incompatible format--on your computer.  My previous MP3 player is nearly as small, and almost as light, and it has a screen (see photo). But it is profoundly inferior: it doesn't work seamlessly with iTunes, its interface and appearance are clunky, it has been a bit flaky since I first got it, and over time firmware upgrades have actually worsened its performance, even degrading the sound quality significantly. Plus it holds many fewer songs, and was more expensive. I speculated that Apple would own the entire MP3 player market after the shuffle was introduced. Now that I own one, I'm sure of it.  Here's a tip: If you use the Autofill feature of iTunes with an iPod shuffle, set it to pick from a Smart Playlist that excludes stuff you don't want to take along. My "Mostly Rock" list, for example, is set so that it contains only songs where the Genre does not include terms such as Christmas, Spoken Word, Children's, Holiday, and Sound Effects, among others.

I have a creative MUVO player that palyed some mp3 songs downloaded from the internet with no problem but when I used ipod Shuffle it won't work no matter how hard I tried. It may work with CD which I didn't need in my case, my view about this is that Apple want you to buy songs from iTunes so all  apple ipod players are rigid as far downloading different format from the internet If it palys any at all.  Bottom line If you bought ipod shuffle to play songs from the Internet you just wasted your money for nothing!

Charging this iPod by computer is easy, but my friend wouldn't know how so I also bought her a small speaker system with docking (charging) capabilities. A supplied AC DC charging plug would have been nice, but didn't come with the iPod. Bottom line: great little system with very decent sound at a very affordable price!

<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I purchased my iPod Shuffle, I learned that once the battery dies it costs $10 less than a new iPod Shuffle to get the battery replaced.  So this product is basically disposable--once the battery dies, you get a new one.  Also, the headphones are permanently connected, so you can't use your own headphones.  Other than that it's great.

<Title>Software iTunes, not mp3
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great product, but I need to gripe about the iTunes software interface, it's not stable. If you are new to mp3s, then you will have little difficulty converting your music CDs into the apple format... But if you already have mp3s, you'll need to convert it to the apple format to play on the shuffle. Battery life is great. Earbuds are low quality. There is also little bass response. Controls and functions are limited. Wished there was an equalizer to boost bass response, as well as LCD display screen, you can buy a regular mp3 player with these features for much less.

<Title>awful product
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This shuffle is awful.  The first time we had a problem with it our computer wouldn't regonize it and we ended up getting a replaced.  Now the shuffle doesn't let the head phones work except for one ear, we thought it was the headphones and bought new ones but the same thing continues to happen.  You are better getting the newer model in hopes they have figured out the problems with the first one.

<Title>Surprisingly disappointed
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I thought Apple was an oasis of ingenuity and performance in a world captured by the mediocrity of Microsoft. I was wrong. I had problems right out of the box. First off, the unit would not fit into my USB port and the package did not include a extension cord. In my humble opinion, a piece of equipment that is required in order for my shuffle to work should NOT be an accessory. All other players such as MPIO and IRiver include this equipment. Secondly, the software was painfully slow and never recognized the player. I installed and re-installed the software twice with no luck. And I thought this was Apple's strongpoint.   I've never had these problems with other manufacturers and this trashy product is going right back to where I bought it. This experience helps me to realize why Apple never made it big. I never thought I'd say this but "Thank the Heavens for Microsoft".  P.S. The previous reviewer was right. The switch in back is poorly designed and needs a textured surface to grip your thumb while you switch modes. Excuse me Apple but DAAA!!! Have any of you guys ever used your products??? Get out of your ivory towers and figure out how to design a world-class product!!!  Long live Microsoft!

<Title>Great for Sports!
<Date>Tue Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Lots of people have complained about the lack of LCD screen and other features.  But the simplicity of the unit is one of the most appealing things for me.  The lack of an LCD screen is great for those of us who like to run and bike with music and have dropped/broken other portable electronics over the years.  What you give up in features with the ipod shuffle are made up in the simplicity, durability, and smallness.  You can't beat the ipod shuffle for running or biking, you can't even tell it is there it's so light and small!  I would highly recommend this mp3 player to anyone looking for a unit for sporting activities.  If you're looking for a jukebox with all the bells and whistles, then this mp3 player is not for you.  I agree with other reviews that charging and transfering music is easy with iTunes and the sound quality is great.  I also agree that the head phones suck!   Overall, a great player for athletes!

<Title>The iCult has gone far enough
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was never a real big fan of the iPod. Many say it's just because I cannot save 300 bucks to buy one of them. I personally would not want to make such a stupid move as that. The iPod is nothing more than a white plastic fad that will come and go just like many other gizmos of our past (i.e. Tamagachi, Mini CD players, etc.). Personally, I think the iPod Shuffle proves the point that this iPod business is nothing more than a costly cult.  I actually took some time out of my life to try the iPod Shuffle, and I wasn't surprised. It is an overpriced jump drive. For those who do not know what a jump drive is, a jump drive is a USB "key" storage device that can be directly plugged into a USB port to save data and other things. Realistically, the iPod Shuffle does not differ from other USB key players out there (i.e. Ridata OLE3000 MP3 USB Pen Drive WITH DISPLAY, Apacer AS820 MP3 USB Pen Drive WITH DISPLAY AND LINE IN, Transcend JetFlash MP3 USB Player with DISPLAY AND LINE IN, etc.) Keep in mind that the models that I just listed are just as small, if not smaller, than the iPod Shuffle with the DAMN LCD included. They also have those in White if you desire that color.  Let's talk about the most important part of the player; it's battery life. Most of the iPod's listed before had mediocre at-best battery lives (8 to 16 hours compared to others clocking at 32 or higher). This averages at around 12 hours of battery time. Of course, there are several other USB MP3 players that clock higher play times, even though some of them may use a AAA battery to operate. All-in-all, the battery specifications and performance of the iPod shuffle is satisfactory.  The audio quality of the iPod is nothing special. I could never understand why most people would get the iPod based on its audio quality when there are so many other players that can much better audio quality on all fronts. The iPod shuffle is no exception to this paradox. All of the iPods use a SigmaTel Audio processing unit to process the sound, which is alright for a portable device, but doesn't really product great sound like the Creative Zen or iRiver MP3 players. The chipset is also supposed to have bass and treble control, but this iPod locked that capability because of the lack of screen, meaning that your music is going to sound a little better than flat most of the time. The only way to set it is through iTunes, but that still shows its crippling dependency on the computer.  In order to do ANYTHING on this thing, you need a computer. It pretty much has no purpose other than looking pretty without a computer to connect to.   The iPod shuffle, in my opinion, is a worthless buy and the money can be spent accordingly elsewhere.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have never owned an Mp3 player before but because of the low price I decided to buy this one on valentines day. I think the product is great and the sound is great. I hooked it up to my car stero (with an accessory) and transfered all my cds to it. As far as not having a screen, I think that it is not a big deal. If you just put your songs on it in the order you want them why do you need a screen?  I love it and find it easy to use. If you want something simple, small, and easy to use this is for you. Where else can you get an Mp3 player that has 512mb for $99?

<Title>Almost perfect ... almost.
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you don't have an iPod or another MP3 player, this is a pretty good choice for people on a budget. That said, there's just no excuse for Apple not putting a little LCD display on the iPod shuffle so you can see what you're playing and so you can have more control options.  Yes, it's VERY compact, yes the "shuffle" concept is great, but at the end of the day a good MP3 player needs a display. Don't get me wrong. I'm still happy my wonderful wife got me an iPod shuffle ... it's a great MP3 player and it certainly makes work and workouts easier, but Apple should have done a better job with product design. I mean, come on, it's from Apple ... the leaders of cool!

<Title>You can't go wrong for 99 bucks....
<Date>Mon Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the 512MB Shuffle a few days ago (finally)....After waiting for 4 weeks for Apple to ship it....It is great for what it is....A small, cheap MP3 player that you can take anywhere, and uses the great iPod software....It is good for places and activities that you would be afraid to take a regular iPod...The whole point is that it is cheap enough to be expendable....Get a regular iPod, add case, extended warranty, tax etc. and all of a sudden you are talking 400 or 500 bucks.. At that price, you are not going to be taking it to the gym, out in the snow or rain, throwing it in a backpack with other items etc..This you can..It's 99 bucks and small...No need for a case, an arm band, an extended warranty (because of the poor quality of the iPod battery).You can take the Shuffle anywhere, wear it under a coat in foul weather, let it receive bumps and bruises...If the battery dies in 3 years, then so what! It cost you 33 bucks a year....The Shuffle does sound great, and the software for it is nice and simple....Other MP3 players may have an LCD screen, a microphone, radio etc. but their software is not going to be as easy to use as the iPod software which takes only an hour or two to get the hang of....A tiny LCD screen is probably going to be more hassle than its worth....And the whole point is for the Shuffle to be simple and inexpensive....Something to take to the gym or work....You are not going to be taking it on a trip to Antarctica, or storing your whole music library on it, all cross-referenced... That's what a regular iPod for! The Shuffle is for environments where you wouldn't take a regular iPod....It only takes a couple of minutes to install your music on the Shuffle...You can play the songs in order, and skip to the next song in the list...You don't need an LCD for 100 songs that you choose to download to the Shuffle....The only drawbacks that I have found to the Shuffle is it can be easy to lose the cap and lanyard when the iPod is plugged into the computer....The ear buds sound great but are uncomfortable....The Shuffle might not be ideal for audio books that are one, single file....If you go to another song, you will lose your place in the audio book, and the fast forward feature on the Shuffle doesn't go too fast....Do you want to wade through an hour or three of narration until you get back to the right spot on the audio book? I also bought the 30 dollar optional Dock for the Shuffle. I didn't want to be plugging and unplugging into my computer's USB port 10 times every week....The connector on the Shuffle sticks out and looks easy to break off....It is easier and safer to plug and unplug it from the optional Dock instead...It provides a place for the Shuffle to stand, and charge....And I don't like plugging and unplugging something into my 2,000 dollar computer every day....If something is going to break, it will be the 30 dollar Dock, not the USB port on my computer.....

If you complain about the LCD not being there, (hate to say it) but you probably haven't worked out a day in your life. Who fiddles with a tiny screen while they are on a treadmill? Honestly, who needs a LCD if you're actually busy doing something productive? If you need one, suck it up and buy a hard drive based mp3 player. Don't be cheap. Quit complaining.

<Title>The latest news about iPod family
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>**** LATEST update to iPod family **** - iPod & iPod photo lines merged; no more iPod photo 30 GB - iPod comes in two capacities - 20 GB ($299), 60 GB ($399) with color screen & photo support - U2 iPod (20 GB) down to $329 from $349 - with color screen & photo support - iPod shuffle 1 GB down to $129 from $149 - iPod 60 GB down to $399 from $449 - new version of iTunes (4.9) that support podcasts *************************************** This is not a review of iPod shuffle as such - great reviews are available already.  Here is some information that might help in deciding which iPod to go for.  Apple announced a major upgrade to the iPod lineup today (23 Feb 2005).  The biggest advantage is the reduction in price ($ per GB) and improvement in battery life. Another significant change is that USB 2.0 is being emphasized although FireWire continues to be supported. AC adapter is USB based instead of FireWIre and the FireWire based AC adapter still sells as a separate product.   The impact on iPod mini:  > A new model, iPod mini 6 GB is introduced for $249  > iPod mini 4 GB now priced at $199 ($50 down from earlier price)  > Change in colors - now mini is available in new shades of Silver, Blue, Pink, and Green (the Gold color is discontinued)  > Major improvement in battery life - up to 18 hours (was 8 hours earlier)  > AC adapter ($29) and firewire cable ($19) no longer shipped with mini (have to be bought seperately if you really need)  > iPod mini 4 GB and 6 GB now ship with only three things: earphones, belt clip, and USB 2.0 cable > The indicators on the click wheel now match the color of the iPod mini  The impact on bigger iPods:  > iPod 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 30 GB (new product) replaces the 40 GB iPod photo and the regular iPod 40 GB  > iPod photo 60 GB now costs $150 less -- $449 instead of $599  > iPod photo 30 GB costs $349 ($150 less than iPod photo 40 GB and $50 less than regular iPod 40 GB)  > iPod dock ($39), AV cable ($19), carrying case ($29), and firewire cable ($19) do not ship with iPod photo (you may not really need them)  > Now we get three things with iPod photo: earphones, USB based AC adapter, USB 2.0 cable > In additon to the above, a firewire cable continues to ship with iPod 20 GB & iPod U2 edition > iPod photo Camera Connector is introduced - this can be used for connecting your digital camera directly to the iPod   With these changes, there is an interesting $50 gap between:  > iPod 20 GB and iPod photo 30 GB  > iPod mini 6 GB and iPod 20 GB (as earlier)  > iPod mini 4 GB and iPod mini 6 GB  > iPod shuffle 1 GB and iPod mini 4 GB  > iPod shuffle 512 MB and iPod shuffle 1 GB (as earlier)   Price, size, weight, and ease of use are major considerations while buying an iPod shuffle.  If price is the only factor, iPod mini could be a better choice over shuffle.  I have all the models of iPod (shuffle, mini, regular 40 GB, and photo 60 GB) and I find myself sticking to the iPod photo 60 GB since it carries all my music and has a better, color-based user interface.

<Content>At $99.00 it's a great price for this 512MB unit. I was not in the market to spend $300.00-$400.00 for the regular Ipod. I was really impressed with the sound quality of this little unit. I use it while I run and on the train to work.  Pros-  Price        Sound Quality        Compaq size (pack of gum)        Ease of use        Can also be used to store data  Cons- Earphones are uncomfortable/fall off.       On/Off button is flush (sometimes hard to use)       No Display (not an issue for me)       Playback is either sequential or shuffle mode.  So it's the perfect device for working out, traveling, etc. Obviously if the Display is a must have, or your looking to transfer your entire music collection, the regular Ipod is the way to go. (Shuffle holds about 120 Songs)

<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>yes, for 99 bucks the ipod shuffles does seem like a steal, but apple needs to stop portraying their products as simply 'disposable'.  E-waste is a serious issue and the fact that apple continues to produce and create new ipods that have irreplaceble batteries is not helping.    it is not ok that if your ipod dies, u can simply throw it away and purchase a new one "for only $99."  it does not make sense that apple charges you to replace the battery, nor does it make sense that they charge you if you want your ipod 'properly disposed of'.    please visit this site and learn how you can help: www.badapple.biz  i agree, apple is producing some of the coolest products ever, but why cant they do so while taking the problem of e-waste into consideration?

Tech support was no help, and neither was the website.  :(     So, now I'm shopping again.  I will definitely NOT buy another Apple/IPOD product.

<Title>Great sound; decent form factor; minor issues
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 512 in mid-January 2006 when I got tired of waiting for the rumored new Shuffle that didn't come until, well, this week. Now I'll give my current one to my wife and get a new one. But I've enjoyed the original shuffle, though it has some minor problems.  First, the sound is very good. I encode my CDs in all AAC files due to the fact that I think the sound is better than the MP3 or other format. I also encode at the highest rate possible. I still have room for about 45-50 songs on the 512 shuffle. I thought before I bought it I might also use it as a thumb drive, but I haven't for various reasons. The main (really only) use I have for this is while jogging. It works very well for that, though you likely will need an accessory to hold it. That's one of the minor issues that looks to be corrected with the new model.  Another issue is the location of the off/on(play in order)/play shuffle switch on the back. I like the idea of the slider, but its directly behind the other controls. That creats a problem when trying to turn it off with one hand while attached to a belt clip. You can do it, but often you will inadvertantly hit a control as well. Its not a huge problem, though. Likewise, the size of the unit clipped on a belt forces some people to move it around their waist as it sticks straight up. Its going to stick into even the flattest stomachs!  I still like the unit and would buy it again. Forget the lack of a display. If you want that, get the Nano. The purpose of this unit is to shift through 40-100 songs or other files (depending on encoding format) while you are active, whether jogging, walking, going to/from school or work, etc. For that purpose, its great. Even greater if you don't need to clip it on yourself.

<Content>I cannot exercise without it.  It is soo addicting.  However the play pause button died on me about a month ago.  But I loved it so much that I used the previous/next button to play songs.  Now that died too.  Can't play anything.  Im sending mine in as I write this.  Oh the how technology is a double edged sword.

<Content>This dandy little unit has helped me loose about 35 lbs, and get me in the best shape in 20 years....  Hop on the good 'ol elleptical and just crank up the sound and the time just flies.... Better earphones really help get rid of the tinny noise that comes with the ones supplied. Also, with the cartrige addapter, we can get good quality sound on things we really like to hear while driving. For seventy bucks, I give this product an A+

<Title>suits my needs just fine!
<Date>Sun Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Ipod Shuffle. Sure, it doesn't have a display, and sure it "only" fits 100-120 songs, but it gets the job done.   All I needed in a MP3 player was music, and the Shuffle fits the bill perfectly. The sound is great, the storage size is fine by me, it's so light and compact you can fit it into any pocket or purse, and it's user friendly. Love that. Additionally, because it doesn't operate on batteries (rather a charge from your computer) it's got a play-back life of FOREVER. I use mine at least 1-2 hours daily, and I only need to charge it once every couple weeks. It's SO nice not having to worry about batteries!  The only thing that could make it better was if it came with an arm band. Working out with the shuffle is a bit of a pain... If I felt so inspired, I'm sure I could buy an armband off [...] for some astronomical fee, though.  All in all, a great little tool. Very basic, NO bells or whistles, but it gets the job done.

<Title>HORRIBLE SOFTWARE!
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had several problems with the iPod, mostly because of its horrible software iTunes. It messed up the firmware on the device several times, it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes.  The most horrible thing however was that it would mess up your MP3 music collection in a way that can never be undone. I had orgaized my collection in the file system nicely by genre, author, album etc, and this thing messed up everything. I have another mp3 player - iRiver - which I reccommend as a lot better than the iPod anyway - and I wanted to be able to copy things on it from my library. Now i am not able to and have to go back and re-organize the mess manually!.  I do not recommend the iPod and I do not recommend using their software either.

<Title>Perfect workout companion
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I needed an easy to use, lightweight mp3 player for working out at the gym and jogging, and the shuffle is just perfect for that. Its buttons are the easiest to navigate without looking. It's super light and feels like nothing in your pocket when running.  Instead of giving a full review and repeating everyone else's comments, I'll just list off some tips and features (both cool and annoying). In no particular order...  - iTunes is a big part of the package. The shuffle is a real simple machine, but iTunes is what makes it great. Once you have cleaned up your library and rated songs properly, etc, use smart playlists and autofill to fill your shuffle. You'll get a good enough variety of songs on there to last a week of workouts, jogs, and commutes. You can edit what autofill puts in your shuffle if you're not happy. - Set your shuffle as a source in iTunes and you can put songs on it without it plugged in. Then plug in the shuffle and walk away while it's synch'ing and charging. - The indicator lights can be confusing when it's plugged in. It will indicate activity instead of charging progress if the OS sees it as a mass storage device. After you're done filling it, if you're in Windows, go into Windows Explorer and right click on the shuffle's drive to eject it. The lights will now indicate charge progress and will be continuous amber until charged. - There is a real shortage of good accessories right now. Both the weatherproof sport case and the armband are very hard to get (2 month wait). And what most active people really need is a hybrid of the two: a waterproof case that's an armband. It doesn't exist yet. - The slider switch on the back can be hard to use sometimes because it's flush with the body. - Pressing the big button for 3 seconds for hold/unhold isn't quite practical. It is also easy to bump a button when it's not in hold. - Pressing the play button 3 times in continuous play will start the play from the first track. This is useful when you want only up-tempo tunes for working out. Place your workout songs at the beginning of your playlist for use in continuous mode and you can use shuffle mode during your commute, shopping, etc.

<Title>Nice Flash Player
<Date>Fri Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>With my iPod 20GB not currently funtioning and not under warrenty, I decided to indulge myself in the iPod Shuffle as a stopgap between my old iPod and a potentially new iPod.  I really didn't have high expectations for the shuffle, as I thought it was still relatively overpriced for what it had to offer, without the LCD screen, and whatnot.  Boy, was I wrong.  I cracked open the shuffle, and immediately started charging my shuffle and at the same time, I was able to load my songs from my iTunes into my shuffle.  This means that if you have any experience with an iPod or even iTunes at all, you should have absolutely no trouble with the shuffle, as it's basically the same thing.  The shuffle also gives you the option to automatically update, or manually update.  With 14 GB of music on my computer, I choose the 'Manual Update' option of updating my songs, and I drag playlists (created through iTunes) into my shuffle while charging, and once done, I just take it with me wherever I go.  The nuances of the shuffle may annoy people, such as the  shuffling of music or the lack of an LCD screen.  I honestly have no need for an LCD screen because I pretty much know all of my music, and if I had the screen, would probably just browse to my favorites all at once.  And to quell a lot of people's fears of the shuffle, you can actually set playlists and drag them into your shuffle, and keep your playlists playing in order.  The shuffle just randomizes your music, not something I do, but I know people love doing it.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase so far, and enjoy the shuffle far more than my iPod, when it did function.  I mean, do you really need 4,500 songs with you at once when you can just upload maybe 150 with you for a day, and update which songs you want on your shuffle for the next day?  I would reccomend the shuffle to anyone.  If you absolutely have an inherent need an LCD screen, then I would not reccomend this to you, but otherwise, I'm not going back to my iPod because of this small wonder.

<Title>Frustrating Software Isues
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple make a big song & dance about ease of use but I found it just wouldn't register with ITunes on our Mac, despite endless messing about with IPod Updates. At each point it would just silently fail to work or occasionally provide a cryptic error such as "Failed to update IPod Shuffle. (2)". Gee, thanks Apple.  Ironically, it communicates fine with a PC. Once the songs are finally on the device, it works OK.

<Title>Miss or KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid)?
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let's start with the major negative. You already know it just by looking: No screen. You can't see the song you're listening to, you can't quickly find the song you want, you can't look at the clock. It was definitely a risky move by Apple. I'd like to say it doesn't bother me, but it does. I would like to have a screen.  Let's move on for now; we'll get back to the negatives later.  The first thing I thought when I saw the Shuffle was, "It's that small? I could keep that in my pocket all the time." It's truly shocking how small the thing is. I am in awe of the whole thing: An amazingly player with about 16 hours of battery life (my measurement), superb sound (at least as good as the other iPods), and a 512 MB memory that I can use to carry my work from computer to computer.  Let's look at the Shuffle's benefits compared to other flash players: size and convenience. First the size. It's almost half the size and weight of the smallest other flash player. That means it can be a permanent part of your daily life. The second factor is convenience. With other flash players, you can expect to carry around a black usb cord to connect the player to the computer. Take it from me: It's annoying. Apple was able to include the usb attachment on the Shuffle because the Shuffle is so small. That means no cord. Just slip your little Shuffle into your pocket and go. With other players, you need to take a player at least twice as big PLUS a cord. Not so easy.  Back to the negatives now. The Shuffle also lacks a voice recorder. Apparently, a great deal of people spend their time recording conversations. I never have recorded from my other MP3 player, but I should probably start being careful of what I say. This might be an important consideration for some people, particularly spies and the ilk, but I see no need for it.  The other feature the Shuffle lacks is a radio. I wouldn't mind a radio on the Shuffle so I could listen to the TV programs at the gym (they broadcast the sound on unused FM spectrum). I don't understand why Apple doesn't include this with their other iPods, but obviously the Shuffle can't have a radio because it doesn't have a screen with which to see the station.  The Shuffle is a clear winner if you want an attractive, go-anywhere, easy-to-use, inexpensive, great-sounding music player. If you want something more, such as a radio, a voice recorder (again, why?), or a way to manage the 120 to 240 songs on the player, then you have to buy something else.  Personally, I bought the Shuffle because of the size and convenience. I already have a big 20 gig MP3 player, but I wanted something I could carry in my pocket and not have to worry about. I love reaching into my pocket and copying over a file from a friend's computer; when I drive home, I listen to tunes on the Shuffle (through the car radio), then I forget it's in my pocket until I need it again.  I'd still like a screen, though.

<Title>Great Device, cheap and worth the deal!
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great buy, the cost is great, and sound and everything is just as great as an iPod mini or Regular iPod.  It's light-weight capability benefits for athletes like me that like to work out a lot and its sleek design will make people stare in envy at it.  It doesn't have an LCD screen, but who cares?  It's very simple to put the songs onto it too.  You just plug the iPod into the optional USB port or the extension cable that comes with it and an iPod symbol will appear on your iTunes at the left.  Then just go to the library and drag the songs over.  Could it get any easier?  But i definately recommend buying a sports case for it.  It adds color and protects it efficiently at the same time.  Overall, this is a must-have for someone that can't afford the outrageous price for an iPod mini or Regular iPod or for someone who is just looking for a good light-weight deal.

<Title>Great product.
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Shuffle over the weekend and it is great. I bought it for the sole purpose for working out.  The machine itself is light weight, the buttons are easy to use, though the on off button can be a little slick to grip on to.  The sound quality is better than my radio or discman.  I have a PC with Windows XP and Itunes has not had any problems and it makes loading all my cds on to my computer a breeze.  Many have complained that there is no screen, no FM tuner, no recorder. Well, if you want those things don't buy the Shuffle, that seems to be a fairly easy solution. The Shuffle is great if you are looking for an MP3 player and nothing more. If you want more, look elsewhere.

<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I thought I would not like the new Shuffle because it lacked a screen.  Boy was I wrong.  First off, for $99 you can't go wrong.  I now understand the random concept.  Its great.  I have a 3G ipod so this is a great companion product.  However I find myself using the shuffle more than my other ipod.  I can choose to shuffle the songs or I can put my own playlist on it.  I use it while in bed, at school, and walking.  Battery life for me was better than what Apple rates it.  Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.    My only quibble is that it does take longer to load an charge than my 3G, but thats minor.  Some people may say that it lacks an equalizer, but if you select it in iTunes it seems to transfer over for me.  I highly recommend this as a companion for the millions of ipod owners.  It better as a second iPod than a first one, thats what I think.

<Title>Great product, what else can be expected from Apple?
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased the Shuffle based on a couple of factors.  First, I have heard that the Mini and the regular IPOD are fairly fragile, and since I am rough on things personally, and I would mostly take the Ipod to the gym, hiking, biking, running, or on trips or other "high risk" adventures, I thought there was too much potential for me to break the darn thing.  Second, the cost of the more expensive Ipods gave me pause.  Third, the Ipod is not forever, as battery life is likely to die after a while. I didn't want to risk the battery life on a $300 product.  $100 to me seems to be near 'throw-away value' personally.  Second, the Shuffle uses flash memory, which is longer lasting, then the mini hard drive in the regular Ipod.  Again, I thought this was a safer choice for me. All these considerations led me to believe the Shuffle was the best choice.  I know 'merely' 120 songs doesn't sound like a lot, but I tried an experiment with the Itunes software (which I recommend using even if you don't have an Ipod because of its simplicity of use!) and I came to understand that 120 songs is quite a lot.  Sure it would be nice to access more songs, but for my purposes 120 is enough I think.  Plus, Apple has issued an update to reduce the bit quality of the songs in order to put more songs on the Ipod Shuffles!!  I have heard of almost 200 songs on the smallest model.    As to the Shuffle itself, it is a glorified USB drive key.  However, for $99 dollars, I get a virtually unbreakable piece of equipment that I can transport anywhere.   It is incredibly light.  So light you can't believe it, I still can't get over it.  It's like a virtual "DJ es machina."  My only quibble is the switch for 'off' to play is a bit cheap in tactile feeling.  This doesn't feel to soild.  No, you won't feel like it will come off, rather it just feels like its insecure.  However, this is the only moving part besides the volume and play control button in the front.  That control is intuitive and very similar to the regular Ipod.  No problems there.  As to the complaint of a lack of a display, it is somewhat unfortunate. However, with the limited songs I can put on the thing, it doesn't really matter because I know each of the songs on the playlist (it's GOLD Jerry!) and they are all my favorites.  I am not losing anything by not being able to see the songs.  Also, for my purposes the lack of a display is a good thing because it would add a battery loss and also a gain in weight and fragility to the thing, who needs that?  I don't.  As is typical, I plugged in the software (PC user here) and away I went.  I already had Itunes, and the software updated Itunes for the Ipod seamlessly, and I mean seamlessly!  Within minutes I was placing songs onto my Ipod.  After a four hour initial charge, I was using the Shuffle.  The sound is great, it is light and the shuffle feature works like a great eclectic radio station delivering the kind of music I like to hear.  Wow.  I have always loved Apple products, and supported Jobs over Gates, now I know why. Believe me, if your purposes are similar to mine, you can't go wrong with this thing.  By the way, if you are a traveler like me, you may like the fact that the Shuffle charges by being placed in a USB port. Now, I know the regular Ipod can be charged with the additional international adapter from Apple to eliminate this problem, but I like the fact that I can take the Shuffle to any computer with a USB port, stick it in, and begin to charge it.  This is convenience!  In short, I heartily recommend this product.  Apple had done it again.  All

<Title>Brilliant design; limited usefulness
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the sleekest mp3 player on the market and worth the 99$. If you are happy listening to 100 or so songs in random order without being able to find a particular song, this will do. If you want to keep you 400$ Ipod with its fragile hard drive at home while you listen to some music during your workout, this will do, also. Having lost one ipod due to dropping it down a flight of stairs, I am not anxious to risk that again. The ipod shuffle was an investment I made in order to have a few hours of mp3 files with me at all times. I listen to talk and music files constantly (I have almost forgotten what radio is. Oh, yeah, that's that annoying thing with all the commercials and the small playlist of oldies). Think what you will be using this for before you buy it. If you have a big collection of music, save up for the full size ipod. If you do not, spring for this one. If you want something that is sturdy for everyday use, get this. Otherwise, forget it.

<Content>This 512 MB iPod Shuffle is all you really need if you're looking for a simple and affordable Mp3 Player to listen to songs while you're on the go.   No screen to provide distractions - just select the play-mode (in order or shuffle), press play and the songs you have filled the Shuffle with are yours to enjoy. The volume controls are convenient and easy to use.   Think not having a screen to select or see song titles is a problem? It's not. Think about this - when you fill the Shuffle with your favorite tracks, you KNOW the next song is going to be good! It's actually delightful not knowing what song comes next.  Although not recommended, accidentally dropping this Shuffle doesn't make your heart skip beats - because of its small and lightweight design (also no screen to get scratched!).

<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it because Otter Box makes a waterproof case for it and together they make a low priced waterproof MP3 player. The Otter Box is great. If not for the Otter Box and my desire to be able to swim with it, I would choose something else. For the same money one can buy one from Creative. The Creative one has a display, uses standard AAA batteries, allows one to play music by album,skip albums or just find a particular song or album, which without a display the Shuffle is incapable of doing. The switch on the back does not have a good detent to allow choosing between shuffle and sequential play. If you only want to hear music in random order, do not desire to see what is playing, have to use one internal battery which needs a USB cord or special charger to charge, buy the Shuffle. Otherwise, think about a Nano or some other MP3 player.

Since u dont have a screen you dont know what the hell your listening to. This is extremely hard to use because it has no screen. I highly advise that you people out there shouldnt buy this. Apple made a huge mistake inventing this hunk of junk. I also have a sandisk sansa Mp3 player and its great and not too expensive. I highly advise you to but a Mp3 player instead of an Ipod.

Once loaded I was amazed at how good the music sounded and I started to think the product may be reasonable.  Months later my wife bought one for me. I experienced the same frustration with my shuffle. In fact, I did some troubleshooting with the folks at Apple. All six people at Apple started with the 4 R's approach, followed by my USB is defective, then my computer, then my wife's computer. All folks at Apple finally conceded that it was the Ipod. I am about to send my 3rd shuffle back for replacement. My wife got a Nano for herself and it works very well. As for the Shuffle, I would not advise paying a dime for it. After the multiple hours I have spent with tech support, I feel they should have paid me for my trouble for this seriously deficient product.

<Content>So far I am very happy with my ipod shuffle.  Regarding the shuffling complaint, you can download your playlist in the order you want.  The ipod shuffle has two options of playing, one in order and one on shuffle.  So for those who can't stand the shuffling, all you have to do is store the songs in the order you would want and play it on regular mode.  I purchased it for taking to the gym and it's been a great investment.  For those who don't need their whole collection on the go and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a great option.

<Content>I got my iPod shuffle last saturday and I love it!  I have not been able to put it down because it is so cool!  It is the size of a pack of gum and is light as a feather.  At first, I was mildly disapointed with the lack of bass in the earbuds but I found the black foamy earphone covers that came with it!  They drastically improve the sound quality.  I love the whole shuffle play mode as well.  When i am on the computer, i listen to my music in shuffle anyway so that just makes it better.  Dont worry, it is not impossible to find a song on it without a screen.  If you load entire CD's in order on it, you can switch it to shuffle and go through until you find a song on the same CD and then get the one you are looking for.  It takes all of 30 seconds usually.  I highly reccomend the iPod shuffle to anybody even if you dont already own an iPod because i dont and it is working out great!

<Content>Finally, an MP3 player that fits the "pocket". The iPOD Shuffle weighs only 20 grams, costs only 99.00 USD(512 Mb), plays great music and doubles up as a USB (2.0) storage device.  Controls - Intuitive: ----------------------- Front: 	A circular control handles the Volume Up, Volume Down, Skip, Repeat. At the center is the Play/Pause button. All accessible at the touch of the thumb.  Back: 	A sleek slider control for power off, play shuffle mode and play continuous mode, ensures that you don't accidentally switch the player on/off. Also at the back is the battery status button.  Uploading Music - A breeze: --------------------------------- Uploading songs to your iPOD Shuffle is a breeze with the bundled iTUNES, an award-winning digital-jukebox software.   iTUNES:  - Library, a great music organizer. Add songs individually or by the folder. - Drag and Drop the songs from your iTUNES Library into your iPOD Shuffle - that simple. - Search songs in Browse mode by Genre, Artist and Album. The quick search filters the song list as you type which is very fast and effective. - Import/Convert Audio CD into pristine-quality AAC file format. - Burn custom playlists to CDs and MP3 CDs. - Party Shuffle, which keeps a queue of songs at the ready that you can rearrange. - Radio, more than 250 free Internet radio stations. - Also nifty playlists being "My Top Rated", "Recently Added", "Recently Played", "Top 25 Most Played".  Charging and Battery Life: ------------------------------- Plug it into the computer USB port or alternatively via the iPOD Shuffle Battery back (sold separately) and you are ready for up to 12 hours of pure music.  Headphones: --------------- The signature white earbud headphones deliver a sharp sound quality.  I was looking for a simple yet sleek, light, inexpensive mp3 player that plays good music and the iPOD Shuffle delivers just that. Not having an LCD screen on the iPOD Shuffle does not bother me a zilch. I have been using the iPOD Shuffle every single day since my purchase (well almost) and not once has it jumped a song.   Simple is beautiful and Apple proved it once again.

<Title>Handy and helpful
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll admit...it was a risky decision going with such a bare bones player.  But as im getting used to it, im finding i spend ALL of my time on the shuffle setting.  it is nice to use as a continuous 4 hour cd.  not only is it cool, but its TINY.  when i say tiny, i mean like the same length and about 4/3 as wide as the adult index finger.  On the bottom there is a USB plug.  i primarily purchased this item as a souped up USB key.  it is only around 30 dollars to go from 512 USB key to ipod shuffle, so that's a cheap way to use extra space on your USB key for music.  PROS  1. TEENY TINY SIZE.  fits in pocket no problem.  2. Price per gigabyte is unheard of in the flash player market  3. Cable free USB drive capabilities  4. Rechargeable battery gets better than advertised life.  like up to 33% better(no lie!  there are reviews on the internet that agree with me.  I've had mine for a week and have charged spurradically for a total of 3 hours and there is no sign of the battery losing power)  5. The battery charges from USB jacks, so I can charge it at school or work  6. Double redundant hold function and YES THERE IS A SHUFFLE FUNCTION (many reviewers claim there isnt)  7. Lanyard included, so it's extrtemely fashionable and so fetch  8. It's hard to dig up dirt on (so far)  9. I have 120 songs on it and i have room for about 20 more (lots of extra memory)  10. So lightweight that it can hang from the earphone cord plug without falling off.  Who needs a lanyard when you can just use the earphone cord? ;)  CONS  1. The most frequent complaint, no screen (this actually isn't that bad.  It goes along with the "what's coming next" theme.  Also, if a screen had been included, the battery life would be unacceptably low.  You get used to it very fast)  2. No sort of organization or navigational system.  you just load one playlist, and that's the order.  No subfolders.  you navigate by clicking sideways.  3. No extras, like voice recorder, FM Tuner, line in recording, equalizer, etc.  its just a music player, with a shuffle function.  4. Mine took 5 hours to install.  spent 30 mins on hold with apple to learn that i only had one incident of telephone support.  NOTE: the problem was i had a bad iTunes install.  5. Sound begins popping when at the highest volume levels (like a mini speaker system on a super loud setting)  6. Accessories severely overpriced  7. As with all apple products, the casing scratches easily  8. Small size makes it easier to lose  9. ITS WHITE there needs to be an HP tattoo for this or something to make it non-obvious you are using an iPod  I absolutely adore it though.  It works like a charm, and attracts looks when im listening.  I wish apple had designed it like the iRiver players like this   ------------------  I***I ........ .-'-.I       I***I ........(  O  )=-~    I***I ........ '-.-'I       ------------------       The dots are a screen.  The stars are the USB cap. The circle to the right is a mini-click wheel this would give it a nav system and better added features.  They also should have designed it with integrated neckstrap/earphones like the iRiver n10 and the MPIO FL300 (the other two players in the wearable category).  All the cords dangling look really really dorky.  without the earphones it is cool though.  OVERALL RATING: BUY

<Title>iPod Shuffle
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am 12 years old, and just got my first (of many) iPods- the iPod Shuffle. I got it here from Amazon as a gift, and was fast and easy, considering all the hype about them- other places, there are long waiting lists. But anyway, it comes in a smart, small green package, and has these things inside: iPod Shuffle (of course) Lanyard  Earphones Guide to using Waivers, etc. Apple stickers (2) Earphone cover-thingies iTunes cd (do not need to install if you already have a recent version)  It is very easy to install, and was listening in 10 minutes (took me longer because I had to create an Apple ID, but you don't have to if you have one already). It is very light! That's obvious, but it's amazing how light it actually is. It is simpe and elegant, and the controls are easy to figure out. No unnecessary fluff added. It sounds amazing- I have Enya, celtic harp, and classical piano on mine (so far), and it sounds so beautiful- like it fills the rom. My 10 yr. old broither got one (iPod Shuffle) first, and h sung along so loudly it wasn't funny. Of course, he had Linkin' Park and the like on his, so it wasn't as nice. But I digress. It is the perfect choice for children and teenagers, and adults who either a) can't or don't want to spend the $ on a larger iPod; or b) who don't have that much music, or who want a workout iPod or a classical music iPod. i adore the iPod, and every person should have one! ~sedona~

<Title>It's all about Usability
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>On the merits of hardware alone, the Shuffle would be a mediocre MP3 player at best. What makes it stand apart from it's competition is:  1) The usability of the device. No training necessary, no manual required. Press a button and go.  2) Seamless integration with iTunes. Creating Smart Playlists is a snap, synching the Shuffle using a Playlist or manually is effortless.  One can argue endlessly about Apples marketing and manufacturing brulliance / stupidity, but one thing is certain; Apple knows how to create simple, usable products. They have a User-Centered Design group that was in place before anyone knew what UCD was, and it shows in the products that they make (disclaimer here: I'm no Apple fanboy; I'm a veteran of the Apple / Commodore wars).  If you already have a HD-based iPod, the Shuffle is a natural extension for you, either as a hardened device for workouts, or, like I did, as a gift for your spouse, kids.   If you're new to the world of MP3's, I'd recommend the Shuffle as a cheap introduction that you'll surely find simple to use and easy to update with songs from iTunes.  Side note: If you do buy one and have lots (and I mean lots) of Hard Drive space, then encode your current CD's using Apple Lossless. The Shuffle will automatically down-convert to 128bit AAC files when transferring. The Lossless format is truely Lossless, and you'll save having to re-encode the disks later when we're all carrying around Terrabyte players (Moore's Law will probably put us there around 2010.)  Side note 2: Shuffle doesn't HAVE TO shuffle songs; you can play them back sequentially. This makes it a brilliant device for playing back books. Great for adults or for keeping kids quiet on those long car rides.

<Title>Amazing for use at the gym
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't need to hold 20 gig of music.... this iPod shuffle holds about 8 hours of music, which is perfect for a week of workouts.  The best comparison I can think of is that this is like a personal radio station that plays only music you love.  The shuffle is so light, you'll forget you're even wearing it.  Consider it for what it is -- it's not an iPod replacement, but it sure does the job I need it for.

<Title>Great buy
<Date>Mon Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I needed a replacement for my sony sports cd player-that thing was just not gym friendly.  I did some shopping around for other players and happened upon the shuffle.  I have to say that the minimalist design scored with me.  The only gripe I have is the on button-would it kill Apple to put a little bit of a grip on that thing?  The shuffle is insanely easy to use and portable as all heck.  It weighs next to nothing and takes up less space than my pack of trident gum.  While others complain about the lack of a screen, i don't really see the use for that when you're getting your workout on.  this is a great purchase for someone new to the ipod scene and not willing to shell out a couple hundred just yet.

<Title>Perfect and Simple
<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The 512 MB iPod Shuffle has been perfect, and has met all of my expectations. With 512 MB I can store about 120 songs (ACC files, from iTunes, based on 4 minutes per song). It is the perfect companion for working out, running errands around town, killing time before meetings and on my commute, and even while falling asleep at night.   It is lightweight (almost so that you forget it's even there), compact (fits anywhere), the sound is fantastic, the included headphones are fine, the battery life is(in my case) lasting longer than 12 hours on a full charge, and the price is absolutely perfect.   You get what you pay for, and in this case, you get more.

<Title>Beware Windows users!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this little gizmo at Target because I just couldn't wait to get one.  After monkeying around with it for two weeks, and countless hours of reading all the recommendations on the apple support website, I threw in the towel and returned it.  If you have a Mac, it seems to work great, but if you are running Windows, look out.  My computer never would recognize it.  After reading all the discussion threads on the support site, it was clear that there was a design flaw, as nearly every post was a frustrated user with the same problem.  Apple support was great, but in the end, I wasn't willing to invest any more time.    If you're still intent on buying this, I'd check out the support site on apple.com to see if they've come up with an update that solves the windows compatibility problem.

<Title>Even better with a little preparation
<Date>Wed Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As the owner of two previous "real" ipods, I purchased the 512MB shuffle more out of curiosity than actual need.  I was interested in an inexpensive ipod that wouldn't cause me to be paranoid about breaking it or losing it at the gym and I was curious as to how I would respond to the lack of an LCD screen.  I saw one of the best descriptions of the shuffle on another review site.  They called it "like having your own personal radio station playing only music you like".  I think that's about right, because of course you aren't able to predict what will play next on the shuffle.  It's hard to do that even if you have it on regular (non-shuffle) mode, unless you have an excellent memory.  But you are guaranteed music you like, because you programmed it.  And you can always "veto" a song by just clicking the fast-forward button and the shuffle will move onto the next song.  To my pleasant surprise, I've enjoyed the shuffle more than I thought I would.  The (lack of) screen doesn't bother me for what I use the shuffle for -- namely, at the gym.  And I was stunned at just how small and light it was (many of the pictures on the web make the shuffle look bigger than it is -- you really need to see one of these things in person).  But I do think that for maximum enjoyment, the shuffle rewards a little preparation.  While I waited (the four weeks!) for my shuffle to arrive, I took that time to set up a new playlist in iTunes that would have the songs I would want the shuffle to draw from.  I knew that since I was mainly going to use this at the gym, I only wanted fast-paced/high-energy music, so those were the songs I selected from my library to go into the special "ipod shuffle bank" playlist I created.  Then, when I finally got the shuffle, I set it up to only pull music from that playlist.  Apple makes it very easy to do that with a special (and shuffle-exclusive) feature called Autofill.  I think this works better than what happens by default, which would have the shuffle randomly fill from your entire library, because you are less likely to get music that isn't quite right for where you will use the shuffle.  Given that Amazon is now selling the iPod mini -- a much more powerful ipod than the shuffle -- for only $179, I'm not sure how much sense it makes to spend $150 for the 1GB shuffle, but the 512MB strikes me as good value.

<Title>Such a cool device.... never missed the screen
<Date>Fri Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a 3rd generation iPod, and like most iPod users, I've found it to be simply amazing.  Really changed how I listened to music.  The iPod Shuffle looked cool, and the price was right.  I hesitated on the lack of display/screen, but decided to indulge and get one.  Wow, I'm glad I did.  My first reaction... "it's so tiny and light!"  Sure some other flash players have a screen and some other features, but there's some things with the iPod Shuffle they can't touch.  Apple's design continues to be unbeatable.  The iPod Shuffle just feels great in the hand.  The buttons are simple and easy to use.  Then there's the itunes software which is full of great features and ease-of-use.    I gave the shuffle feature a try, even though I was planning to use the iPod Shuffle more to listen to playlists in order.  What a surprise... it's fun!  Kind of feels like a radio station that plays just your favorite music.    The whole thing just works great -- iPod Shuffle + iTunes.  Love it.

<Title>Good bang for your buck!
<Date>Fri Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had been in the market for an MP3 Player for a while until my mind was made up for me when I got the iPod Shuffle for my birthday. I had read about it before but hadn't been considering it because, quite frankly, I wanted to be able to pick what songs I want to hear. (that and the fact that I didn't want to be "forced" to download iTunes to manage my music.) After getting the iPod Shuffle I was pleasantly surprised on all fronts...   iTunes...  I downloaded the program and it was much better than I thought. The biggest factor was that it didn't force me to change the format and location of my music collection. My music still resides in a folder on my desktop in MP3 format. Basically, you can load the music into iTunes and it just references them from their original location. (you can just change the preferences to make Winamp or whatever your default player for MP3s.)   Installing and loading the iPod... Installing the iPod software on my Dell Laptop was easy enough and loading my MP3s onto the iPod from iTunes was also fast and easy. (The iPod just shows up on the left and you drag your songs into it.)  On the road... Listening to my music on the iPod Shuffle has been a pleasure so far! The sound quality is very good considering you can't control anything (bass, treble, etc) except the volume. Navigating through songs is a snap since all you can do is skip forwards or backwards through them. Basically, you CAN control what order the songs play in; you load them onto the device in whatever order you want in iTunes and set the iPod to the "play in order" mode. Or, you can set it to play the songs in a random order, or "shuffle" mode. So I just set it playing and sit back and enjoy the music! (Unless I hit a song I really don't want to hear, in which case I hit the skip button.) And perhaps the best feature - it doesn't skip, which is invaluable when your exercising, or running to catch that train!  Battery life... All I can say is that I've been listening for two days now (and I commute for 3 hours a day!) and the battery still has a green light. (that means the battery still has a good charge.) And I didn't even charge it fully when I got it out of the box.  Appearance... This is the only downer for me - I hate white! I wear a black coat, a black hat, black gloves and a black scarf, and here I am  wearing a white iPod, with its white lanyard and white headphones. (They could have used me in their commercial!) As Mick Jagger once eloquently put it, "PAINT IT BLACK!" A few color choices would be a definite plus.  Size and weight... What can I say; I've seen Cockroaches bigger than this thing! It also weighs NOTHING. These things could almost be seen as a problem because it is probably really easy to lose! Luckily, they include the white neck lanyard, which I always use.  Storage space... I got the 512 meg version and I fit 86 songs onto it in MP3 format. (You can fit more with the AAC format.) When I get tired of these songs, I'll just hook it up to iTunes and replace them with more! To me, that is a lot of music. I don't really understand these people who feel the need for 20 or 30 gigabytes of space on a music player! Are they planning on going to a desert island for a while???  Conclusion... The bottom line is that for $100, how can you go wrong with an MP3 Player the size of a pack of gum, which can hang from your neck and hold almost 100 songs??? You can't! True, you don't have much control over what you hear and how you hear it, but once again, what do you want for $100? The only thing I can suggest to those Apple people is - give us more colors!  UPDATE (after 2 months of use) Problems! When I load my songs onto the iPod from iTunes, according to the playlist they're on there, but when I play the iPod some of them are not on there! A friend who has the iPod mini also has this problem. He has to drag some of the songs on there 2 or 3 times before they actually play! I know it's not the files either because the second time I tried, different songs didn't show up. It must be a problem with the way iTunes communicates with the iPod. This is why I don't like being forced to use proprietory software. BOTTOM LINE - Next time I'll buy the Zen Micro...

<Title>Remove all doubt- the Shuffle kicks boo-tay.
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was worried when I bought the Shuffle- my friends complained about it with numerous insults. Among the complaints were: "There's not even a screen!" and "You can't even pick which song you want- it just shuffles them!"  Boulle.  You can pick the songs you want. There is two ways to listen: randomly or in order. There as easy to access with the flick of your thumb. Yes, you have to cycle through, but that's alright. Normally, the fact you can't pick the songs with a screen would make my rating go down to four stars- but realistically, most $100 MP3 players only hold thirty songs; and while they DO have screens, you still have to cycle through.  Once I got it, people were amazed, but still skeptical. They thought I wasted my money. I got 90 songs more than the average MP3 player, at the expense of having a screen. Mny people told me: "It sucks- how do you know what song you're on?" How? I listen to the song. I'm gonna hear it anyway, so what do I care if I can't see the name of the song on the screen. If I downloaded the song onto my Shuffle, I probably know what the song is called. I don't need reassurance from a screen.  Pros: 120 songs- 90 songs more than most MP3 players this price. Cheap- only $100 iTunes is the easiest program ever.  Cons: No screen.

<Title>Shuffle - A fabulous fad or a flattening flop?
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think that the shuffle can be seen in many ways. It just depends how. For example you COULD look at it and say, tsk, what a waste. I mean, it doesn't have a screen or a replaceable battery, and you can't tell what song is next. OR, you could say, wow! this is light, holds 120 or 240 songs,(512 mb or 1 gb) and looks awesome. and by the way, for the those people who say that you can't tell what is next, you can also go out of shuffle mode... anyway, I tried it, and i liked it!  Pros: light, small, cool color (though I wish there were more), holds a lot of songs for a flash player that light, and doesn't skip.  Cons: no replaceable battery, no screen  so, if you are looking to buy this, give it a try... :)

<Title>Who needs a screen?
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Other reviewers have covered the Shuffle extensively, so I'm focusing on the most controversial feature: the lack of a screen.  As a Shuffle owner, it's become clear a screen is not necessary. The 512Mb Shuffle holds around 125 songs and users have complete control over which songs are loaded. If you have trouble keeping 5-10 albums' worth of music straight in your head, I don't know how you can handle the unintuitive and clunky interfaces of non-Apple MP3 players.  Not having a screen is the Shuffle's greatest strength. It allows an incredibly small and light player at a great price.

<Title>Neat idea--with limitations and glitches.
<Date>Fri Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Dependable people (even if they are my friends and relatives) say they've been very pleased with their iPods. Quite a few _Shuffle_ owners I've talked with, on the other hand, have been less satisfied.   In my opinion, the design is aesthetically and functionally elegant, I love the size of the thing, and it sounds terrific. It plays .aa files from Audible--but won't navigate them by sections the way "real" iPods can. And right out of the box,  mine played a single song and then stuck. It wouldn't advance to other tunes I'd Autofilled. It would only repeat the first one.  The local Apple Store managed to get it to work--for a while. I took it back when it messed up again, and I've seldom used it since I got it back.   Even when it was working right, I found this model to be an  exception to the streamlined ergonomics of other Apple and Mac products. When I first saw it, it looked  easy to use, and I could feel the detents when I pressed the center button or any of the four positions on the ring. That's why it surprised me when operating it proved tricky. Maybe the button functions, especially advance and fast-forward, wouldn't seem uncertain if they'd worked correctly from the git-go.   "Gave it to my mother-in-law" might be a new way to give a product a low rating. That's what I did, but she kept it just a couple of months and never tried it. I took it back. At that time, it would still play, but I set it aside until today. I just loaded three Audible.com files for a long bicycle ride, thinking it wouldn't matter if I couldn't advance from one book to the next.   When I was a teenager, I soldered together a "hi-fi" amplifier from a Heathkit and built myself a speaker enclosure. I've built a few computers recently, and I used to work on my airplane engine--and lived to tell it. Yeah, I'm trying to imply that I'm a reasonably competent gadgeteer. I'm pretty sure my iPod shuffle problems aren't my own fault. It won't play at all now, and the battery definitely _is_ charged and the books are loaded.   The Shuffle has been the least satisfactory of four MP3 players I've owned. Maybe I got a lemon. I wouldn't hesitate to buy a Nano, but for today's ride, I'll load my books into my Rio Cali.

<Content>The iPod Shuffle is compact, easy to use and a great option for people who do not need all the features of the higher end models.  The only problem I have encountered is that you can only download songs from itunes, not other sites, and itunes does not have many of the classic rock songs I wanted to download.  I wish there were more sites compatible with the iPod to download music.  Other brands of MP3's have more options for downloading and that is something to consider.

<Content>Our 11 year old daughter won the Shuffle at a school fundraiser raffle. Out of the box the Shuffle was dead and required an hour and a half phone call with HP to determine it wasn't working. HP exchanged the Shuffle under its one year warranty. The Tech Support person was patient and helpful.  I will add, our daughter does not abuse the Shuffle and uses it only sporadically, often when we would go on longer trips.  After having the replacement Shuffle for 7 months it, too, has gone belly up. Again, an hour and a half phone call to HP that involves deleting ITunes and downloading the current ITunes software version. This is a process we had to go through twice this time to confirm the Shuffle was dead.   On both occasions, calls we've made to HP has required only a minute or two wait time so Tech Support gets high marks from us. Still under the warranty, HP sent us another refurbed Shuffle in a very tiemly manner and we return the dead Shuffle to them.  Our daughter loves the Shuffle when she uses it but two dead Shuffles in 7 months doesn't instill confidence in the long term reliability of this product. Maybe we've just been very unlucky but a recent column in the Chicago Tribune confirmed our experience. Independents reported a 15% failure rate with IPods in general.

<Title>Not for podcasts
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this specifically to use for a podcast player but the software makes it so you have to load the podcasts on manually. They won't "Autofill" because podcasts all come marked "skip when shuffling" because somebody assumed you only want to shuffle music. &lt;shrug> The podcasts will play on it, it's just not nearly as easy to load the thing as it ought to be.

<Content>Bought this recently for my girlfriend because I was tired of her stealing by Nano to go to the gym. I usually hate going with the crowd, but the crowd is right on this one. These things are easy to use, and well built. If I was shopping for myself I would have probably bought a Zen Nano for the display screen, cheaper price, and expandible memory.

<Title>Great invention!!!
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have nothing bad to say about my shuffle. It's so much nicer than carrying around my CD player and CDs. It doesn't matter to me that I don't have a drop-down window to select a song. If you don't mind not knowing what song will be played next, this is the MP3 player for you. Especially because you can get this at a great price.  I have to admit that I didn't think I would have so many songs on my iPod so I have to take off some songs to make room for new tunes but that's alright.  Being able to fit this into my pocket is such a convienence!

<Title>Great Music Player
<Date>Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Ipod Shuffle. It is great for a number of reasons. The sound quality is wonderful. The device is simple and efficient to use. The battery life is excellent. It is very small and light weight. It is great to play songs in a particular song order and in shuffle mode. I like listening to Podcasts with my shuffle connected to my car stereo during my commute to work because there is no screen to distract me while driving. The price is very affordable as well. Also, the Ipod Shuffle works very well with Itunes, which alows the user experience to be good. I recommend upgrading the standard earbud earphones to the Sennheiser PX100 headphones. They work great for me when I listen to my Ipod Shuffle at home. Anyway, the Ipod Shuffle is worth the money.

<Title>The perfect inexpensive companion for active people!
<Date>Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What the Shuffle offers is a flash drive with no moving parts, so it can't get broken as easily as other iPods or MP3 players.  It also has intuitive controls, and it's the size of a stick of gum or a cigarette lighter.  Perfect for running, at the gym, or easy to use in your car (don't need to look at a screen when connected to your stereo).  True it does not autofill podcasts, but it does play them well.  It has a random or "in order" mode, so you can either create playlists or enjoy your music in shuffle mode.  Plus, it's inexpensive.  Great for kids who need a 1st iPod, adults who don't want complicated tech items, and people who want to move while wearing their iPod without worrying about damaging a $300 player.  It's also more discreet for commuters, and easier to replace if stolen in a crowd situation.  What's not to love here?  I couldn't live without my Shuffle.  You get all the reliability and great design of Apple at a low price point.  It's the eMac of the iPod.

<Content>From an Ipod user who is very experienced, I love this little guy. I didn't want a screen or repl. Battery, I wanted a great USB player for travel and the gym. For those detractors that don't like the lanyard, buy the rubberized ones and replace it. I got color coded ones for the gym with a bayonette clasp and it's perfect. Shuffle is a great feature for a USB player and it's apple cool. You want a screen get a mini, you want a great player for the gym or light travel this is the one.   Non IPOD users will like it more than experienced ones.

<Title>astonishing quality and performance
<Date>Wed Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There's a lot of things to love about this product - the size, the impeccable style, the price, the cool factor. It's cheaper than most 512K players, and far lighter and easier to use. The controls are so intuitive that I can operate it with gloves on in the dark! My previous player, a Virgin model, was so clumsily engineered that even after a year of use I still had to look at it to operate it. The simplicity of the case equals classic style. All those colorful, knobby, nintendo-looking MP3 players out there feel like props from a bad sci fi movie; outdated and silly looking a month after you buy them. The shuffle is classic, simple, elegant, timeless design that will ALWAYS look smart and sleek. But you're not buying it solely for looks (maybe to be looked at though) - this is the one you want for portability and durability. For walking, biking, exercising, this is the one. Almost weightless, easily transported, no lcd screen to scratch or hard drive to fry.  If you want to carry your whole music library around, no, this isn't for you. But if you want 8 hours of tunes that weighs less than a slice of cheese, and delivers striking quality, this is the one. The biggest hurdle is the price - even though it's cheaper than most 512k players, it's only half the price of a new Mini that will store 8 times as much and come with firewire and ac adapter and allow you to build playlists. If you want bang for buck, go for the new Minis. But if you want the smallest, lightest and most felxible, go random! Actually - go ahead and buy both!

<Content>It is really great.  Simple to use, and so small, yet holds more than enough songs for my needs.  I use it at the gym, where the small size really is a benefit.  With 120 songs, I can go two weeks before I have to reload or listen to the same song twice.  Also, the 12 hours of batter life means I only have to recharge it at home on the weekends.  Beats fooling around with CD's or a larger bulkier MP3 player.

<Content>I'll admit, as a guy, I'm not really interested in this product. I want the bigger, better iPod that can fit thousands of songs on it. I also want all the extra features. The iPod Shuffle has none of those things. However, I purchased one for my wife, and I must say that sometimes I'm actually jealous of it. That sleak, simple, little Shuffle just begs to be held and listened to. For what it is supposed to be, the Shuffle succeeds marvelously. And people might complain about the lack of a screen, but I believe that most who actually get a Shuffle find that they don't miss it much at all (mostly since we're only talking about a hundred or so songs here anyway). Highly recommended, even as a second MP3 player for those currently with hard-drive-based models.

<Title>Nice size, slow transfer, bad bookmarks
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Three stars may be a smidge low for this player, but since it's touted as Audible-ready, and many (non-apple) sources claimed bookmark - or at least resume - features, I got one. I intended to use it primarily to listed to audiobooks in MP3 format, and as a replacement for my dying usb key drive.   Let's start with the bookmark/resume function.  It works...sort of. Press pause, the power off. Power on, press play. It starts right where I left off.  Unfortunately, if I plug it into a computer (to charge it), it starts back over at track 1. Not a problem, except that without a display, you can't check to see where you were in the book, which means listening to little snippets along the way until you find your place again. It's a bit frustrating - I imagine it might drive someone to dastardly acts if they accidentally did this in a very long track.   Next - transfer speed. Yes, it's technically USB2.0, but it may as well be USB1.1 for the speed of most transfers.  Audio is painfully slow - less than 1.5MB/sec (USB1.1 speed) - with iTunes. Direct explorer transfers are little better, with several tests maxing out my transfer speed at just under 2.4MB/sec.  So this is a USB2.0(480Mb/s) drive with a max speed of 19.2Mb/sec. Dissappointing in an era of 120Mb/s usb flash drives and 160Mb/s cardflash units.   Size and function. Nice. Very Nice. It could have been a tad shorter, and maybe a bit narower at the connector end (it doesn't quite seat flush on my Dell M70 laptop due to the case), but it certainly is portable and light. Navigation is super simple. I have big fingers, but haven't had a problem with the nav or slider switch. Though I agree with outher that a ridge or recess might have been nice on the slider, it doesn't feel like I need "too much" pressure to move the switch.   Finally, audio quality. Good. Not great, but good.  There is a noticable background hiss which is directly proportional to the volume - nearly silent at zero, and audible in most soft passages in program material. I listen with Shure ec3's, though, so I hear  hiss on almost every player I've tried. The variable aspect of it is a bit troubling, but not a killer.   This is a fun toy, and decently priced for the capacity. If you're going to drop in some tunes for a workout, or the commute, it's probably a great choice for under $100.  Depending on your patience, I'd recommend looking at another option for audiobooks, though - when it works, it's smooth, but when it doesn't, the lack of display can be frustrating.

<Title>3.5 Stars actually - Good for what it is
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>my dad got so syked over this thing.  pretty low price, great company.  what more would you want.  i thought the shuffle was ok, but it was the mini i had my heart set on.  well i had my birthday recently (2/28) and guess what?  got an ipod shuffle.  don't get me wrong, i liked it but again i wanted a mini.  so i tried it out.  overall, it is good for what it is.  Definately better than a Rio or RCA Lyra or something similar to those.  i have a lot of music on my itunes (just short of 1000), but half of it i don't listen to (about 480).  I get all my songs unto it of course, but i can actually get 135 songs on it instead of 120 like it says on the box which is pretty cool.  Like everyone else, i wish it had screen so i can get to certain songs.  If i want to listen to something Jimmy Eat World but i over listening to Blindside, it will obviously take me a while to get there, so i switch to shuffle which speeds up the process of getting to JEW... sometimes.  A lot of times i go through at least 20 songs just to get to Jimmy which can really be a drag, if you know what i mean.  Overall, it is a good mp3 player.  if your on a budget, but don't want to get a piece of crap Rio, go ahead and get yourself an iPod Shuffle for yourself or your kid.  but later on when your music collection builds up your going to want to have at least a mini.  Honestly, i already want a mini!  i'll probably just save some money for a mini and end up giving my shuffle to my little brother or a friend or something.  Again, good for what it is, but i would recommend a iPod mini

<Title>Cannot share MP3 library with friends thru Shuffle
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought a Shuffle and then realized that I cannot transfer music from my friends into my Shuffle or vice versa.  When I plugged the Shuffle into someone's else machine/iTunes, it said the Shuffle had been initialized from a different machine/library, and asked if it's ok to delete all the files in the Shuffle.   Fine. So I went ahead and delete the original files and copied some MP3s from my friend's PC. The catch was that I got to keep those songs only if I don't plug the Shuffle back into my own machine. Once I plugged back into my own laptop, iTunes deleted everything I had copied from my friend.  To me that's a ridiculous constraint from Apple, that a "mobile" device cannot be used to transfer files?! I mean, why shouldn't I be able to get music from my friends and copy them into my own library (especially music ripped from CDs we paid for)??  So the hack I'm using now is to format 30% of my Shuffle for DATA and 70% for music, copy as much of my friends' files as possible in the DATA partition, copy the files from the device into my iTunes library, AND THEN copy the music into my Shuffle. Hell of a work for something I shldn't have to be doing in the first place...  On top of that, I can't use both my work and home PCs to load the Shuffle, since they'll just cancel each other out, and it's too much hassle for sync'ing up my libraries in my different PCs just for this...  Other than that, the thing looks nice and is featherweight and all.

<Title>The little stick of fun
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The most amazing thing about the Shuffle, bar none, is its weight. Actually, it's weightlessness. You don't know that you are wearing it. If you pick it up, it feels like a piece of plastic holding air. At .78 ounces, that's the equivalent of 20 small paper clips.   The first time I held one in my hand, I knew I had to have one. Never thought I could convince my wife to spend three H's on a big iPod, and with a cell phone and a PDA already, didn't need another weighty device hanging off of me.   Enter Shuffle.  I've had it for the past few weeks. The lack of a screen is a small minus. Sometimes it would be nice to know what's coming next, or find a particular track. But it's easy enough to skip if you hit one you don't want to hear -- which is rare, because after all, it's your music.  Sound quality is fine. Battery life is OK, too, about 10-15 hours.   Now, for the quibbles. Charging the Shuffle is a pain. You have to have it plugged into a USB port. I don't know about your desktop, but mine is on the floor, and it's a pain to plug and unplug. It's no problem on the laptop. Also, it takes 4 hours to fully charge. That's weak compared to the competish. (It's like, who cares that you have USB 2.0? You could USB 0.000001 and still transfer the songs in 4 hours.) There should be a quick charge option, an adapter, or something similar. You can get a docking station, but that defeats the $99 price point. Sony's offering a similar enough player with 70 hours (!), although it's a bit heavier and doesn't work with iTunes.  Transferring songs is also a pain. There are hacks using the Shuffle in disk mode -- others here or on iPod web sites can tell you how to do it -- but directly uploading songs from Shuffle to computer is made difficult as a bar (albeit a low one) to piracy. I'm sure Apple is trying to keep the record labels happy, but it should be easier.  Anyway, the last few weeks I've rediscovered my music collection -- another plus of the Shuffle. Although you can set up playlists, I prefer random. I've listened to great tunes I forgot I had. Old Santana, Marley, Zeppelin and U2 mixed with a little Green Day turns my grocery shopping into a groovy concert. And I've had probably 20 people ask me what's hanging around my neck. (19 positive, 1 jerk who joked that it looked like an alarm for elderly people for when they fall and can't get up).  Final thought -- get the 512, not the 1 Gig. There is no point having more music (16 hours) than battery life (12 hours) without a screen. 120 songs is just fine 99 percent of the time.

<Content>Yeas and Nays  Yeas:  The iPod Shuffle:  Light of weight  The lanyard -- allowing the listener to wear the Shuffle around the neck is hard to beat  The Shuffle is sturdier than the Nano I have  It has an ease of use and simplicity in that use  The Shuffle has a long battery life -- using my Nano is like driving a vehicle with the air conditioning, stereo, and bright lights running while seeing the gas tank needle plunging toward empty  Sound is incredible in the AAC format  The sound in the Shuffle is preferable to the Nano for audio books  Shuffle can be permanently "docked" in iTunes (Each Shuffle I have is listed and all the items I have loaded onto each one. I can change the programming for each Shuffle so it is ready when I connect the Shuffle to my computer) -- I cannot do this with the Nano and hard drive iPod  The response is speedy when using the controls  No protection is needed as it is for the more fragile Nano -- however, the Shuffle Sport Case is very handy as a shield against the elements  No connecting cable is needed to program the Shuffle or to charge it  My place is saved when I pause play or the Shuffle shuts down -- not so with the hard drive iPod I have  Nays:  The earphones that ship with all iPods hurt my ears after a short time using them. I purchased a set from Philips that features surround sound and are much more comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The sound that comes out of them is phenomenal.  No display   Additional Comment...  Just guessing, but I wouldn't be surprised if the available space on an iPod Shuffle 1GB is greater than the available space on an iPod Nano 1GB, due to the formatting and extra bells and whistles of the Nano. I have ordered an iPod Shuffle 1 GB, as I've heard it may no longer be in production. When it arrives I can check the available space between the two.

<Title>Happy Commuter
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I enjoy the commute to work now that I have my iPod Shuffle and an FM adaptor/tuner. Let's just say that I'm not a fan of the local radio stations morning shows. Both the iPod and the tuner together were less expensive than the "fancy" iPods and if I lose these I won't cry nearly as hard. Knock on wood.   It doesn't bother me in the slightest that there isn't a display because I use the iPod in my vehicle. I figure the last thing people need is another distraction while driving. I can get it ready in the driveway and never touch it again until I store the chewing gum sized iPod anywhere. It's so small!  One negative is that the shuffle setting isn't random, and resets itself to the beginning each day. But the regular play setting saves where I was in the playlist and with over fifteen hours of songs I don't have to hear the same song for weeks.  I'd give the product a five, but... The downloads I buy are not compatible, and I refuse to be price gouged on the iTunes website. So I started buying more CDs after I got the iPod.

<Content>I used to wear AM/FM radio headphones when I ran in the morning but they were too heavy and awkward and limited me to radio. I started using a CD player walkman but it was too heavy and clumbsy and I broke several when they fell during my workout. I then tried wireless headphones and the sound quality was awful. I finally broke down and bought an MP3 player, I chose IPod because it was cheap and was likely a quality product since its made by apple.  I couldn't be more happy with it. It fits the bill perfectly. It's so light, I don't even know I have it, so no worries about it falling and breaking or interupting my workout. The sound quality is incredible. The absence of LCD is not important to me, I can't fumble with an LCD screen while I'm running, besides, I only load my IPod with songs I want to hear. If I do want to skip a song, it's super easy because the folks at apple have made the controls very simple. For my needs it's perfect.

<Content>I didn't set out to buy an iPod shuffle, and fankly, I didn't think I'd have any use for it. I already had an old 64meg MP3 player I never used, and besides, I had a portable CD player that played MP3 CDs. I don't buy music on-line; it's more expensive than CDs and is of lower quality. I prefer to rip my own MP3s afrom my CD library. And the shuffle feature- who needs that?  Well, I was wrong on just about all counts. Somehow a friend talked me into buying one when we were at a local computer store, and since then my iPod Shuffle and I have been inseperarable. It's so tiny I carry it everywhere, and the USB recharging function means I'm never far from a recharger at work or at home.   What really struck me was the sound quality and volume form this little stick of gum. I have no idea how they cram enough battery capacity in there to do it- but they do. I can listen for days without recharging it. And the shuffle feature? I keep it on all the time. The surprise of not knowing what's next- or even what songs iTunes put in it the last time I reloaded it from my library- makes it more interesting.  I still don't buy music on-line. But I do love my little iPod Shuffle.   One caveat: The supplied phones are dreadful. They have poor coupling, and if your ears aren't precisely the righth size they'll either fall out or hurt. I'm replacing mine with some high-quality in-the-ear phones.

<Title>Be Careful
<Date>Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just recently received my Shuffle and have been totally frustrated since. For whatever I have been unable to install the shuffle onto my PC. After several hours of trying, I went to the Apple support site and learned that there are countless other people out there with the same problem and no one seems to be able to find the solution. Before buying this product I would suggest spending some time looking at the Discussion Board on the Apple Support website.  I think mine is heading back on the next UPS truck.

<Title>Ipod Shuffle is da Bomb!
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had been saving up for a while to get an Ipod mini, I was $50 short, but went to the apple store anyway. I saw the new Ipod shuffles for only $100, and I decided to buy one, it was probably the best purchase I ever made. Only 2 minor things that could have made this better. First of all, a small LCD screen, I like to know what is coming next, and second of all, I would have liked the USB 2.0 port a tad mor pronounced, I had a small amount of difficulty plugging it into my computer due to the size, I had to unplug the printer and the modem in order to charge it.

<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've never owned an mp3 player and decided to purchase the Ipod Shuffle because it was less expensive than the other competing brands.  I love it, the lack of an lcd screen does not bother me at all, it's compact, it's great for the gym, walks, hiking, cycling and most of all the sound quality is great.  It's so light and not intrusive when you work out.  I just love it!!!  My only problem is finding the right headphones/earphones.  I did find an earphone that fits around my ear- those little earbuds always fall out of my ear, so I cannot use the earphones that came with the shuffle.

<Title>Shuffle is OK, ear buds & iTunes are awful
<Date>Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I like the iPod Shuffle, in spite of the lack of a display. I bought it to have something to wear for running, and for workouts at the gym. I have major problems with the ear buds and with the iTunes program that came with the iPod Shuffle.  The first huge problem was that iTunes for Windows simply didn't work on my Win XP Dell Inspiron 1100 laptop. It barely works on my Win2K Pro CAD workstation at work, but when ripping a CD, I can't do anything else at all on my workstation. It's not a slow machine, Apple just can't seem to figure out how to communicate with the driver software. Is there tech support? No, there are just some "discussion forums" that are staffed by Apple fans who want to help others out. From all the complaints I'm seeing at those fora, iTunes for Windows (4.7.1.30) really is quite bad.  My workaround on my home laptop is to rip the songs from the CD's into MP3 format using Windows Media Player, and then tell iTunes where the folder is that Windows Media Player created.   So that allows me to have some songs to play on the Shuffle, right? Sure, but the ear buds absolutely STINK. I've bought cheap ear buds that are far better than these oversized solid plastic things that Apple provides. I'm not a small guy, but these ear buds simply don't fit in my ears. If I smile, or grimace during a workout, the ear buds just fall out. It is virtually impossible to wear them while running.   Apple should do better than this. For $99, I should bloody well get good high-quality ear buds with the iPod Shuffle. The only reason I gave the Shuffle 2 stars at all is that the player itself seems to work well. The controls of the little lightweight thing are very intuitive and obvious. The only control that wasn't obvious was the "HOLD" function, which allows you to disable the volume and fast forward controls. This is a great feature, since I did accidentally fast forward to the next song when leaning on a curl bench at the gym. Nice touch, the "HOLD" function.  Apple, make some real ear buds for this product and get iTunes working correctly with Windows machines, and you'll have a market-killer.

<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have always been a huge fan of Apples design first approach, and this player doesn't disappoint.  While the lack of a display may be a turnoff for some, I rarely notice that it's not there as I use the shuffle while running/working out. While this player will not cause a revolution in the industry, the convience, simplicity and size of this device makes it a perfect MP3 player to use when at the gym or flying on short trips.  Pros: Distinctive Apple Styling convient storage Light weight/ small size Simplicity of use iTunes  Cons: Internal battery No display Must charge from USB port.

<Content>I am in graduate school and felt like a grandad when it came to the cell phones and ipod scene on my campus.  I got some birthday money and sadly enough, decided to jump on the trendy bandwagon that is Ipod.  I could not be happier with my purchase.  120 songs is perfect for what I am looking for in terms of storage space.  The software is easy to install and easy to navigate for those of us who are computer illiterate.  The small and compact design allows it to be stored and carried easily.  The buyer also might want to purchase the carrying case to keep it from being damaged by the elements or by basic wear and tear.  An excellent buy for the Ipod hopefuls!

It's not ideal for people with long commutes or huge music libraries, but perfect for people like us. We still prefer to keep our thousands of CDs and listen to them through regular speakers when we're at home. The shuffles come out for lawn mowing or workouts, that sort of thing.

<Title>A Soul-Like Device to Listen to Soul
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Aside from this sleek music box, which my 3-year old daughter thought was a whistle, is the freely available software called iTunes. Although I occasionally buy $0.99 songs from the Apple on-line store, I prefer to purchase original CDs from my local Borders, Barnes & Noble, Wal-Mart, and Amazon.com. Then I promptly transfer their contents over into my iTunes library, which is an amalgamation of all my eclectic taste. Finally I create smaller playlists virtually asunder from the rather large admixture that resides in one of my 200-G hard-disks. These playlists do not take up much extra space; their contents really reference the songs' real locations in the repository.  When I plug in my iPod Shuffle to the USB port of my computer, which is also the source of re-charging the battery inside the device, its contents are expected to be replaced by whatever playlist I wish to listen at work, while exercising, or in the comfort of my home. An FM transmitter, a direct connection to a set of speakers, or regular earphones do a swell job in bringing music to wherever I maybe. The Shuffle's greatest strength is in its feather-like weight that I don't even feel I'm carrying as I jog or walk.

Anyway its sound quality is really good for just a small flash memory player.

<Title>Wow!  So addicting!
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I already have a 4th gen B&W iPod and a nano, but I snatched a used shuffle in an eBay auction just for kicks.  Just like many others, I once thought "What is Apple thinking? Who wants an mp3 player without a screen???"  Well, I definitely took back that thought once I actually tried playing with the shuffle I got.  It is really amazing!  The sound quality in the shuffle seems a lot better than those of other iPods; it has richer bass and the trebles just sound so realistic.  I believe the reason for this is that the shuffle uses a Sigma audio chip instead of the PortalPlayer chip in all other iPods.  Not having a display actually makes this device quite addicting.  I had a good time shuffling through songs.  It's more fun having to listen to the first few seconds of a song to recognize it than just seeing it pop up on a screen.  For its price, Shuffle is still a very high-quality item.  Apple also designed the cap covering the USB port with internal latches, to minimize the risk of it falling off.  I wish USB flash memory makers would examine this, because I hate the caps falling off my USB drives!  Overall, this is simply an amazing product!  My original intention was to play around with this for a short period, then sell it off.  Scrap that, I'm keeping this!

<Title>Just got mine. This is what I think of the 'Shuffle'
<Date>Sat Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, the name iPod "Shuffle" is misleading. You can choose whether or not to have the songs shuffle or play in the listed order you've chosen. You can do this from the playlist in iTunes or on the iPod Shuffle itself by clicking on icon that has two arrows going in a circle.  Finally got my iPod Shuffle after one week and a day delay in delivery but so far I'm very happy with it. Here's a breakdown of pros and cons.  Cons -It cannot hold tens and thousands of music like its sister counterparts iPod mini and iPod.  -No external charger. You have to leave Shuffle plugged into your computer or laptop to charge. But actually, this is a blessing in disguise. I usually leave my computer on for hours and this is a convenient way to charge your shuffle and even better when you are traveling and  you can charge with your laptop on the go. My iPod Shuffle is charging this moment while I am editing my playlist. ;) Charge out of the box for me took about 3 hours or less to fully charge. -No screen but I really didn't care since I knew the list of the songs and the order because I put it together. In addition, I KNEW this didn't have a screen when I bought it.   Pros +Lightweight, lanyard is excellent for traveling and you won't believe how small it is until you see and feel it. +Absolutely no skipping from the Shuffle. You don't heard those grinding noises you hear from hard drives on the shuffle between song changes. +Looks very durable compared to iPod mini which can be very fragile. +Sound quality is very good from the Shuffle. I like the earpiece. The sound does not vibrate outside of the earpiece whic h is good. +Charge time was rather fast especially on a USB 2.0 port. +iTunes software is awesome. It was so simple to use. The quick start in the manual is not long and to the point and can be all be read in 10 minutes or less. Easy to understand and you'll have songs transferred quickly and using your Shuffle in no time.  +USB 2.0 transfer speed wasn't too bad. Not as fast as firewire but its no slouch in transfer speed. There is only 512MB of space in my Shuffle so USB is fine (transferred and filled up the entire 512MB of space very quickly) since I won't be transferring 20GB or 40GB of songs which would be better suited for firewire.  One more thing. I don't know why people complain about the slide button on the Shuffle. It is not slippery (unless you are eating  potato chips or grease food while using the Shuffle) and I had no problem switching it off/shuffle/continuous play. I actually like carrying this thing around in my pocket since it's so small and you can put it away easily without worrying about being too fragile. The cap is solid and won't fall out easily like those Sandisk flash drives.   I really regret not getting the 1GB. I love this thing.   Here's a brief overview of the quick setup step.  1. The first thing you do is install the software that comes with the iPod shuffle which installs the iPod software and iTunes. 2. After installing the software, plug in the iPod shuffle into your USB port and let it charge for 3-4 hours. The yellow light indicates charging and green light indicates full charge. 3. Make a playlist by pressing the "+" button on the iTunes and drag or add your songs to the playlist. 4. Choose your playlist from the drag/drop down list and then click "Autofill" to transfer the songs into your shuffle (plugged to the USB port). 5.iTunes will let you know once the transfer is complete, unplug and play your music.  If you really need a screen to look at the song that is playing or hate skipping through songs to find the one you want to listen to, get the iPod mini. If you need something that is much smaller but extremely portable, easy to use, great battery life, durable, excellent sound quality (without skipping), and in budget, get the Shuffle.

<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Since the iPod shuffle lacks a display, I wouldn't want this to be the only MP3 player that I own but I think it's the perfect compliment to any existing iPod. I love the fact that I can drop it in my pocket and I can't even tell that it's in there. Now I have access to my music all the time no matter where I go. I was worried about being able to go back and relisten to a section of an audible book if I couldn't hear what was being said but you can just press and hold the back button and it rewinds a few seconds at a time so no worries there. If you really want to listen to something in order you do have that option but even on my larger iPod I nearly alwasy listen to my playlist on shuffle mode. I also use disk function to shuttle documents that are too large to email between work and home. I absolutely love this thing.

<Title>Great for what it is . . . . 
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The shuffle does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It plays 120 songs and is more affordable than the regular Ipods w/out all the bells and whistles.  If you want something that has everything, spend more and get the regular Ipod.  If you want something that is easy to use and not expensive, buy the Ipod Shuffle.    I have both and I love each for different reasons.  I use my regular Ipod for traveling or around work/home because of the high capacity and the variety it gives.  I use my shuffle for when I'm going to the gym or other places where I'm worried my $300 Ipod would get lost, stolen or ruined.    I did want to mention that for anyone looking to buy the Ipod Shuffle and already has a regular Ipod - the transition is smooth.  I was trying to find an article online on how the two worked together with Itunes but wasn't able to find anything.  I already had Itunes loaded and set up to use my regular Ipod.  I got the Shuffle, plugged it into the computer - loaded on the updated version of Itunes (I got this off of Apple's website, the one included with the Shuffle was old) and now they both work with my current Itunes account.  I just plug in whichever I want to add or delete songs from and I'm set.      I'm glad I got a Shuffle.  I'm sure there is something out there that is better for the same price - but heck, I already have an Ipod and an Itunes account loaded with songs so it made for a smooth transition.

<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle rocks! I know the title sounds negative but I just put it there cause of the commercial song... I bought the shuffle at my local (sort of...) Apple Store. I brought it home...didn't work...brought it back and got a non-defective one and it worked. I put 53 songs on the thing and I loved it! But one night I was charging it in a portable charger and it...broke. Took it back, found out the charger was messed up, so I got a new IPOD and it has worked ever since. It plays my now 65 songs flawlessly *without skipping* and is simple to use.   I know everyone hates the idea of *BAM BAM BAM* no LCD screen but who cares? I mean you can navigate songs on here quickly and if you a put a song on your ipod you must have to like it, so it doesn't really matter what order the songs play. Seriously, this rocks...maybe just charge it in your computer instead of the regular charger...:)

<Title>more pros and cons
<Date>Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Buy a Shuffle if you want to listen to music at work, at the gym, at the park, etc.  It's great for everyday uses like these, mainly because it's so small and light.  I keep mine in my pocket all day at work and it's never a hinderance.  It works seemlessly with iTunes.  You can create a playlist for your Shuffle or you can have iTunes upload songs at random from your library.  The playlist function is great for people who like making mix tapes.  In this sense Shuffle can be a lot more fun to use than a bigger ipod with a large data capacity.  The shuffle function works pretty well.  Out of the roughly 120 songs it'll hold at a time (I'm talking about the half-gig version) the Shuffle is ok about not repeating itself over the first few hours.  That's not to say it never happens.  Once in a while, it seems to have tunnel vision -- going back to a few songs before others have been played at all.  But when it happens, you just skip to the next song.  A few other minor details.  I wish Shuffle was able to transition between songs the way iTunes does.  Instead, there's a noticable pause in between tracks, which is moderately annoying when you're listening to an album straight through and the songs run together.  But I'll live.  Shuffle also has a Hold function although the simple interface might lead you to believe otherwise.  Press the Play/Pause button for 3 seconds and the Shuffle will go into Hold mode, meaning all the buttons are on lock.  Another thing: the Stop mode is tricky.  Basically, turning Shuffle off is the stop mode.  When you turn it back on, sometimes it picks up where you left off, but sometimes it starts at the beginning again (if you're using a playlist.  obviously you couldn't tell if you were shuffling).  I haven't figured out how to control that yet.  Overall, the Shuffle has been a great purchase.  Having so much music at your disposal without any size or weight burdens is a beautiful thing.  You will pity others who are carrying portable cd players.  Consider buying a bigger digital music player, though, if you travel a lot and don't have your computer nearby to recharge and reload your Shuffle.

<Title>SuperStar Suffle!!
<Date>Fri Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently recieved an iPod shuffle from the Easter Bunny and think it is GREAT!!The iPod shuffle is small and compact. Great for athlete's to use while working out or just to lounge around the house with. The Ipod Shuffle also includes a neck strap to use to keep your hands free while doing things around the house like cooking or cleaning. One of the let downs of this iPod is not being able to pick and choose the song you want to listen too. It is also very easy to loose around the house so I suggest you to keep it in a secure place. The last down fall is the shuffle can hold a max of 120 songs which is why the cost is much less then a reglar iPod or a iPod mini. The Ipod Shuffle is hands down a 5 star product.

<Content>it works fine for a while,but after a few weeks if you play it  too loud the speakers blow out. There's no video display so you have to sit there and keep skipping to find the song you want.  Sometimes if you skip to often the thing will shut itself off. If you put in your binder during the school day like i do the headphones will break.  Don't waste your money your better of spending the extra $50 on a mini.

<Title>I would recommend it.
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I personally own a Shuffle. It's not the best MP3 player, but it's not the worst. The Shuffle is very light and portable, just like all other iPods. Sure, the memory isn't the greatest, but don't take the 120 song limit seriously. I have currently 144 songs on my Shuffle, with room to spare. I personally like the Shuffle mode. However, when I want a specific song, search through by turning on the non-shuffle mode. My Shuffle broke after only a few months of having it. But, this was only after I dropped it a few hundred times. Luckily, I still had my warrenty. Apple was very quick in sending me a brand-new Shuffle. If you're new the MP3 player world and want a small MP3 player that is light and just simply plays your music, try the Shuffle.

<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my ishuffle for 1yr and 2 weeks.  The battery no longer holds a charge.  To get the battery replaced is $65, almost the cost of a new shuffle. Is the shuffle worth an extra $65 a year to have a battery replaced? I don't think so.

<Title>Yes, I own one.
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yes, I own the iPod Shuffle 512 MB and I would just like to tell people who want one about it.  First of all, I don't see why people keep complaning about no screen.  With only 120 songs, you can memorize the order.    Pros:  Cheap        Durable (I accidentally slammed it really hard on the driveway and the only thing it did was turn off.  It still works fine)        Simple  (Not only is it minimalistic in accessories and  working, but it is dead easy to connect it to your computer and get songs on it wiht iTunes.)           Long battery life.  ( I have worn the battery out all the way) Cons:  Not a lot.  See the Pros.  The only thing I don't really  like is that it doesn't have a screen, and that, as I have said before, doesn't really matter with only 120 songs.    Conclusion:  The 512 MB Shuffle is a great choice for anyone who wants a low price MP3 player.  The only thing I'd say is don't buy the 1 GB shuffle.  If you need a 1 GB, buy a Nano.

<Title>Unbelievable
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Having never had an mp3 player before I was very excited about the ipod shuffle. However, it quickly became a complete disapointment. Only a day after purchasing it, it stopped working. It flashed the amber and green lights over and over and would not work. I took it back to the tech guys at the  store and they made a joke about how many ipods they see a day that stop working. Nevertheless, I decided to use my warranty to replace the shuffle with a new one. After using it for a week the same exact problem occured. There must be a bunch of lemons at the store where I bought it. I can't explain it. It's ridiculous. Also, even while it was working it had the tendency to play the same songs repeatedly in a row. It's a waste of money. The only reason I gave it a star is because it has great sound and really pumped me up when I was running with it...once. What a tease. Who knows, maybe you will get lucky with it. Apparently some folks do. I say don't waste your time...or at least buy a warranty.

<Title>What's Up With the Bad Reviews?
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sound: Very good, and it can get very loud. (I don't like it loud, but some people do) Usage: Ridiculously easy. Just slide a bar to turn it on or off. Battery: Lasts for 12 hours. (I've only had to charge it twice so far, and I've had it for about 2 months) SHUFFLE????: It's not exactly an ipod that shuffles. It plays them in the order you downloaded them and it gives you the CHOICE of having it on shuffle mode. Computer Use: It is soooooo easy to update. Just plug it into your computer, and on itunes click on update. (Of course, you need to add the songs first.) Screen Issues: So many people hate how there's no screen. It doesn't matter, because you only have 120 songs. If you want more, buy a nano, but.....I'm warning you...... IT'S EXPENSIVE! It is about twice as much as the shuffle. Size: you've probably heard this, but it is smaller than a pack of gum. (Thicker than a nano, though.) Overall, it's great for people who don't need many songs. You guys would love it!

<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've only had my iPod Shuffle for about 2 days, and I abousoutaly LOVE it! Here are 3 pros and 3 cons  Pros: 1. 120 songs- I don't even have 70, so it's great! 2. Shuffle or Normal - I can just switch it back and forth 3. Great integration with iTunes- Piece of Cake to sync songs  Cons: 1. 12 hours of battery life- Why can't it be longer? 2. Cannot use proteced WMA files- What if MSN Music is your main download service? 3. (no, it's not no screen), When wearing the laynard, the earbud cord sticks down too far.  By the way, I really like the no screen, because it gives me a challenge, what song it is.  And you CAN change the order of the order of the songs for it in iTunes

<Title>Not so bad...not so great
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iPod Shuffle for free through a fantastic deal with my bank about six months ago. Two weeks ago, it stopped working. I decided to review the little thing before I bought another player, and tried to make the review as unbiased as possible as I paid nothing for it.  Pros:  -Size: The Shuffle is really small and is shaped conveniently. There are no curves or corners that would make it difficult to push down your jean's knife pocket, where I usually place mine. The plug hole is on top, and the USB cover does not come off easily (there is no way you'd lose it while jogging or working out). I've dropped the poor thing a couple of times and it's gotten through just fine.  Design: The white, uniform design of the shuffle place it close to the (if not on) top of most flash-based MP3 players. Nothing to complain about here!  Weight: Not so light as you wouldn't feel it in the palm of your hand (which wouldn't be a good thing in my opinion) and not too heavy to make you waste calories, the Shuffle weights just as much as it should.  Compatibility with iTunes: The latter being an extremely popular software, most will appreciate its compatibility with the Shuffle. Although I have never used the function where iTunes fills the Shuffle with random songs, I have appreciated the fact that it updates the play-count on the iTunes music library and that its music is as managable as iTunes' is.  Cons:  -No Screen: I have actually never cared much for this. My music library exceeds 120 Gb's now and is still growing, and when I fill my shuffle I know exactly what I fill it with. After a few listens I get a hang of what song plays when, so I am (almost) never lost. The absence of a screen is bothersome however if you fill it with music you don't yet know well.  -No Drag & Drop Functionality: This is possible when using the Shuffle as a USB drive, but not with music. Music copied to the device using drag & drop does not appear in the Shuffle's playlist.  -Bugs: A common software bug found with the Shuffle is noticable after every format (restore). The iPod won't function properly and won't let you copy music unless you do the following:  1. Restore the iPod and when choosing settings check the "Fill my iPod with music automatically" box.  2. While iTunes is filling the iPod, go to its settings and allocate a few megabytes to its USB drive funtionality. 3. Now cancel the auto-fill and fill your iPod with whatever you want. Although some people may have not faced this bug, it is very common and is unfortuantely not resolved by Apple yet. When facing this problem, I was only saved with user comments I found on the Apple forums and other websites.  4. Earphones Quality: Comparing the iPod earplugs to my Sennheiser PMX 60 headphones, a single listen was enough to tell me I would never pick the iPod's again. The sound is muffled and the trebles are not rendered well. I recommend spending a good 50 bucks on a fine pair of quality headphones.  ***  I have not much to complain about my dead Suffle as I paid nothing for the white little stick, and it sincerely did a fine job during this short while (an average of 5 hours-per-day for 6 months). I would, however, not recommend it to those looking for flash-based MP3 players: a six-month lifespan is simply too short (although mine may have been an exception) and there are much better players (by iRiver and Creative specifically) out there, with screens and drag & drop capabilities, for almost the same price. Most of them don't look anywhere as classy as the Shuffle, but afterall everything has its drawbacks.

<Content>Anyone looking for a cheap mp3 player should at least give this a look. It's very cheap for its price, much cheaper than most others, and is very, very, very small, not to mention lightweight. I can barely even tell there's anything in my hand when I hold it. Thanks to its low price, I managed to be the first kid at my middle school with an iPod. Of course, other kids had other mp3 players, like those nice little SanDisk ones, but they still got jealous over my iPod, even though it has no screen. And that's no big deal to me. I know my albums well enough that I can just switch to the in order mode and find my desired song, no problem. It shouldn't be too hard to remember the basic order of the 10 or so albums you can fit on this. Overall, if you have a hundred buck and want a nice, inexpensive mp3 player, here's two words of advice: buy this!

<Title>Try It. You'll Like It.
<Date>Sat Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I haven't been good about keeping up with the latest trends in portable electronics over the years, but my Sony Discman (manufactured 1993) is finally starting to die on me so I decided to see what this iPod craze is all about and get my feet wet with Apple's most introductory model: the iPod Shuffle 512mb. I must say, I am an instant convert.  Every aspect of the design of this player displays the seamlessness and perfection that can only result from thousands of hours of product research. It is a small, unassuming piece of plastic that essentially has controls for play, skip, volume and manages to play 10 times as many songs as my old 2-pound Sony, which will be sorely missed by the way. My earbud headphones come in a plastic case that takes up twice as much space as the actual player. And, of course, the most important part: the sound quality is incredible. I am just floored by how great the music sounds. The true test of time will be if this thing is with me as long as the Sony (probably not since it uses an irreplaceable rechargeable battery).  Don't waste your time with any other brand of MP3 player. Apple has cornered the market by staying ahead of the pack in terms of storage capacity, innovative design and reasonable pricing. You just can't mess with perfection.

<Title>Overall great product...but a few complaints
<Date>Sat Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I agree with (almost) all of the positive statements you will read from other reviewers; it's a great product for $99.  But I have two complaints - warnings - for future purchasers:  1.  The earbuds provided simply do not stay in my ear -especially during exercise (my primary reason for buying the product).  A solution that worked for me are EarJams made by Griffin Technology and sold by TigerDirect via Amazon for about $11.  I have also used and recommend 'The Plug' earbuds by Koss.  You can buy at Amazon for about $13.  Also check out the 'Sparkplug' earbuds by Koss.  Looks like it comes with a white cord and costs about $13 too.  2.  Could not get the Shuffle to work with the front USB ports on my Dell computer.  Works fine with a rear USB port - but not as convenient.  Ideal solution would be to buy the Apple Dock Connector - but feel it is overpriced at $30.  For about $6 you can get a white 6' USB2 extension that will do the job for you (check out Eforcity.com).

<Title>Using a Shuffle with Audible audio books (and for a runner)
<Date>Sat Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought two 512mb iPod Shuffles, one for my wife and one for me.  She wanted one for running, and I wanted one for listening to Audible books and some music.  For a runner: My wife runs about an hour every day, with our dog, so the small size was perfect for her.  512mb gives more than enough memory space for a runner, unles you're into ultra marathons.  The salesman in our local Apple Store even talked me OUT of the 1mb version -- runners like to manage their music and the 1mb capacity means shuffling through too many songs.  The lack of a display is no problem, since you don't normally scroll through songs while running.  5 STARS  For Audible books I have a bunch of Audible books on my computer and decided that an iPod would give me the chance to catch up on my listening.  I agonized about getting a Shuffle vs a Mini, and finally decided on the lower cost and smaller size of the Shuffle.  Here are my thoughts:  1. A 512mb Shuffle has plenty of space for both books and music.  I loaded the unabridged version of Tom Clancy's Red Rabbit (20+ hours) and another 40 or so songs, and still have space left over.  2. Load your Audible books onto the Shuffle first so they are at the beginning of the play list.  Then when you play in sequential mode it will start right at the last bookmark in the book. This works fine. Play your music on the shuffle mode (it skips over Audible files).  3. Not having a display is a minor inconvenience, but the size and functionality of the Shuffle make up for it.  So does the price!  3 1/2 stars for playing Audible books.

<Title>Awesome 'shuffle'!
<Date>Sun Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I decided to get an ipod in early January. Being 12 years old, I  didn't wan't to spend too much money. That's why I decided to get a shuffle. I ordered a 512 MB shuffle from the apple website after figuring out that it wasn't in stores yet. Three long weeks later, it came!  I bought some songs on iTunes (all of my CDs suck and online music is cheaper that CDs) and plugged the ipod-stick into the keyboard. It appeared instantly in iTunes, and I autofilled it with the twenty-odd songs I had purchased. Later, I changed my songs to a certain order that I could memorize.  I currently have 74 songs on my shuffle and I love it! It is so easy to hang it around my neck and take it anywhere. The headphones are a bit uncomfortable but the sound quality is great. The headphones fit me well, so they don't fall out very often.  The battery life is okay. It would be better if it was, say, 18 hours like the new mini, but I can live with it at 12. Actually, the battery seems to last more that twelve hours. I went to Cancun, Mexico recently and I took it. I listened to it almost nonstop on the planes and buses and the battery indicater still was green when I got home five days later. It is annoying to have to plug it into the USB port on the back of a computer to charge. It would be so much easier to have a dock thingy that plugs into the computer or the wall, but I'm not going to spend $30 on that!  The lack of a screen is only a minor setback, if you memorize the order of your songs and know all of the songs on your ipod (you should, because you can only have 120!). It is a bit tricky to slide the off-on-shuffle switch. It is much too easy to slide right past normal order mode to shuffle mode (I almost never use shuffle mode).  I love to show off my shuffle. Some jerks think it is stupid (but I think they're jealous) but most of my friends think it's so cool.  I highly recommend the ipod shuffle to anyone who wants an inexpensive MP3 player to play a smaller collection of songs. It is great for someone who excersises a lot because of the flash drive (no skipping!), and a screen isn't really required for excersising. I also recommend you get one from macmall.com, because they're only $94 and come with free speakers and an FM transmitter.

<Title>OK, but terribly PAINFUL earphones
<Date>Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple's lawyers ought to review the design of these HARD earbuds.  Really bad!  If you wear these for an extended time, your ear canals will be quite sore...and any slight movement of your head will remind you.  Get earbuds you like (try some first), too bad they'll likely be BLACK while the iPod default is WHITE.  Also, some earphone draw more power...my nice Sony Noise Reduction over-the-earphones (A must for flying) couldn't give me the volume I wanted....  The machine is fine, although it does not put out much volume.  It would be nice if the ITunes software could equalize all the songs to the same loudness level.  I found I had to frequently adjust the volume - perhaps no fault of Apple.  It's ok...it's cool (now anyway - everyone gawked at it on a recent international trip), and it fits in your pocket when not being used.  Battery life is not bad.  I charged it up in an electronics store when it died... 5 minutes in a handy laptop USB port gave me about another hour of playing time.  Wahoo!  It's good for me, an adult.  I like it.

<Title>I'm impressed...
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I decided to buy an iPod shuffle because I was getting tired of listening to the same music over and over again on my current   MP3 player.  I was shocked at it's sheer lightness.  Heres a few things to compare it's 'weight' to everyday objects (about .90 oz)   2 nickles, 1 penny and 1 quarter; 3 quarters and 1 penny; 1 cd + 1 dime / penny; 10 pocket tissue pack (15 pack, 5 used); 1 - 1/2   full lip balm; 1 car key or 1 remote for my car; 1 AA battery or 1/3 the weight of my empty leather wallet (3oz)!  The size is a little smaller then these keys going up: CTRL (command key on a Mac), SHIFT, Caps Lock, Tab and also the key   above that. Unpacking was pretty easy.  What I got was: 1 shuffle with USB cap (protects the USB plug, has two balls inside to   attach to the iPod shuffle unit, 1 cool necklace lanyard, a pair of the famous iPod earbuds, 2 packs of black pads for the buds,   2 white Apple logo window stickers for advertisment I guess, iPod and iTunes for Mac/Windows Installer CD, Users Guide   (recommend you read!), and other papers.  Once you install iTunes and iPod installers it asks to register your iPod with it's serial number.  Tip: instead of squinting on the   iPod, it's also on the retail package.  I'm not going to go into loading music or anything to the iPod.  It took about 10-15   minutes to copy 130 songs on my USB 1.1 port.  USB 2.0 is faster but I don't have it on my PC.  As for battery life:  It came pretty   well charged, the battery light was green when I pressed the indicator.  I charged it some more for about an hour before I   used it.  It hasn't gone below green for me yet.  I only charge it maybe less then 2 hours a week - no lie.  And I use it about 2-3   hours a day.  iTunes is cool.  Just plug in your iPod, iTunes will open, and click Autofill.  Autofill automatically selects random songs for a   playlist of your choice, and adds them to your iPod so you never get bored of listening to the same music.  I listen to songs I   haven't heard in years, and some I have never heard at all.  As for the quality of the music it plays - it's just great!  I don't HEAR the difference between a CD player and my shuffle!  The   default ear buds really stink though.  They are really huge and painful.    It does come with pads for the ear buds, but I lost one   after a few days because they don't like to stay in place.  Please don't wear them to promote your iPod... there are better   headphones out there!    Speaking of promoting your iPod, the included lanyard is pretty cool and handy.  I used it to take a long stroll around town   and it worked great until a huge thrust of wind started to whip it so I had to hold it until the wind slowed down.  But my friends   demostrated how easy it is for someone to just rip it off your neck.  To attach the shuffle on the lanyard, just take the USB cap   off and replace it with the cap on the lanyard string.  It's really that easy.  I love having a flash drive where ever I go.  Inside iTunes you can specify how much space should be reserved for file storage.  I   usually keep about 10 megs free.  If the earplug cord accidently comes out, the shuffle is smart and pauses itself.  To lock the buttons, hold down the pause button until the orange light blinks off.  Tip: in shuffle mode press play three times to rerandomize the randomized songs, in play in order mode, the same goes back to the begining of the playlist..  CONS:  The slider on the back and the USB cap likes to scrape the dirt from your fingers, and makes the buttons really look ugly   so I usually clean it with a toothpick every now and then.  In windows, the iPod folder is hidden from view unless you enable   windows to show hidden files/folders.  So if you want to play your music on a machine without iTunes, you have to enable the   hidden files.  Interestingly enough, on a Mac, these files and folders are not hidden.  Also no EQ settings, but I never found a   need for them yet.  I never really used them before and the sound I hear is near perfect anyways.  Windows 2000/XP or MAC OS X only needed for iTunes.  That's a serious draw back...

<Title>No One To Bother You-Your Own Music Whenever You Want It
<Date>Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently returned from an airline trip from Hell. The movie was one I had seen several times, the music selections were for my teenage nephew who adores rap and my seatmate would not shut up about her African violets.   Never again, I promised myself and thus the Apple 512 MB iPod Shuffle became mine!  I love music, all kinds of music even some rap, but I have a great stereo at home and in my car. All I needed was something fairly simple, something I could download music onto easily. The iPod Shuffle fits the bill.  The ease of use advertised is as it is- the CD is very clear and most everything is uploaded for you-you provide name, address and credit card and you choose the music.  The iPod Shuffle comes with everything you need in a teeny. tiny little box. Earbud headphones, lanyard, and USB cap included. The Earbud headphones provide superb sound quality.  The lanyard hands freely around your neck, but I am thinking seriously of buying the arm clip. The 512 MB model holds up to 120 songs; supports MP3, MP3 VBR, AAC, Protected AAC, and WAV  Up to 12 hours of battery life, with approximately 4 hour charge time. USB 1.1 and 2.0 compatibility through integrated USB connector  Compatible with Mac OS X v10.2.8 or later (Mac OS X 10.3.4 or later recommended for use with low-power USB ports) and Windows 2000 with SP 4 or Windows XP Home or Professional with SP 2.  Compatibility is necessary, and most everyone, even neophytes will be able to comprehend this message.  The iPod music store, iTunes is one of the easiest downloads- the CD takes you completely through the steps and provides an i-Tune desktop icon.  Just click on the icon, and you have a complete music world at your footsteps. So much to choose from, and I found that I quickly filled up my 120 song limit. However, it is just as easy to delete songs and add new ones. If you are taking the iPod on a trip, you can charge the battery by plugging the i-Pod into the USB port.  iTunes also gives you a list of celebrities and what they have sorted on their iPod. Tom Brady, the New England Patriot Super hero is also a kindred soul in his music likes, U2, Kenya West, and Bob Dylan. As I type this review I am recording a new favorite Amos Lee onto the iPod Shuffle. Really, if it is this easy, anyone can have fun with this iPod. Buy it, Highly recommended. prisrob

<Title>Easy to use - great sound
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>We bought two of these for our daughters (11 and 14 years old).  Very easy to use - plug in the software, load some music into iTunes, and transfer to the Shuffle.  That's it.  The kids love it.  It holds more than enough tunes for their needs - they change the songs all the time anyway.  The sound on these things is wonderful - I frequently use one when I go on a run, because it's so light.  After years of running with a Walkman (or Diskman) that skipped everytime I took a step, the Shuffle is a delight.  Before the Shuffle, we used Diskmans and had to contend with scratched CD's and a mountain of dead AA batteries.  The Shuffle is a welcome change.    My only problem is finding them - they're so small.  I wish Apple would come up with some way to page these things when they get misplaced.

<Title>Why do you think it is called ipod SHUFFLE.......
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So many people have been bashing this mp3 player for not having an LCD or other form of viewing device to see what songs you have.  Honestly, I do not think any of these people have actually looked at the name of the device.  There is a reason they called it the ipod SHUFFLE. The whole idea is to throw some songs in there, and just let them play, in the SHUFFLE mode.  If you want to see your songs, then dont get a SHUFFLE because the songs will be SHUFFLED.  Seriously, I cannot believe people actually call that a con for the player.  Its purpose was always to only allow people to play songs randomly.  Why critics keep comparing it to other devices is beyond me.  Use your heads people, its the ipod SHUFFLE, it shuffles songs. Shouldnt be a surprise unless you're as thick as a piece of lead.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This Thing is worth every cent..... I don't have to pay for Itunes I just copy and paste my songs from Limewire to Itunes and from Itunes to Ipod. It is small, portable, lightweight and has a usb cable adapter included it fits 120 songs and with perfect sound. If the CPU didn't recognise the Ipod is probably because 1. your Itunes is not up-to-date and you need to download the correct version from the internet 2. you are using a 1.1 USB port 3.your computer doesn't have microsoft service pack and if you couldn't find a way to not pay 0.99 cents per song then think outside the box. Kaza, Imesh, Bearshare, Ares, Rhapsody etc. I'm a computer technitian and I loved this thing so much I'm listeningh to it while I write this comment.  Don't waste your money on another 512mb mp3 and buy Ipod shuffle.... you don't need a screen eventually you will memorize the order of your songs.

<Title>Best value no matter what.
<Date>Tue Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: -Virtually endless batts...if you use it for 60-90 min a day (gym, in my example)> You can almost forget to charge it.  It lasts for a week. - Great sound.  I blasted the original headphones, though.  But the sonys are coming soon.  But It does have a great sound. - No weight!! And I mean it is weightless.  Cons: - Well, no display, but for the gym, or running or cycling you don't want to search around for songs, anyway. - Still more expensive than most 512 mg MP3 players with fm and voice recorders.  Great buy overall.

<Content>I bought an iPod shuffle about a month ago. I love it!! I take it everywhere with me. I am careful about the battery, and always charge it before going anywhere.  Way lighter than my prehistoric CD player, plays just the right amount of songs, and the superior sound quality make the iPod the best peice of equipment I have ever bought.  Thanks, Apple!!!

<Title>Simple, small, and durable.
<Date>Mon May 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got an iPod shuffle well over a year ago, and it still is kicking strong. It spends most of its' time in the car for use instead of the radio or CD's because it's like your own radio station, except for that you choose what it plays and there are no commercials. I particularly like it because it's so simple - there is little to worry about breaking or malfunctioning, and the low price allows me to take it everywhere I go without worry of theft or damage. It's also very easy to flip through sonds in the car without looking at, as opposed to a regular iPod. It also seems to hold up well in New Mexicos' heat and a variety of other environments (including airport security).   Unless you really want a screen, go with this. It's a great buy and it leaves you free to enjoyyour music - not be overprotective of the medium it's sorted on.

<Title>Novelty gismo that has run its course
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For those of you who is considering buying this here is my experience with it. I bought this a year ago and for the first 6 months I would have given it a 5 star rating without question. I didn't care about the lack of display and not being able to select my songs. I was sold on its size and the fact that I didn't have to worry about damaging it by dropping it and hitting it somewhere. I didn't care about paying 99 cents per song on iTunes. I knew what to expect going in.  And now I'm just annoyed at this. It doesn't charge appropriately. I think the internal batteries are dying and someone said I should send it to Apple to have it replaced. I'm not going to bother. Just the concept of sending something back for a replacement part doesn't sit well with me. It is a big hassle (considering postage and trip to the post office) for me. I would just as well discard it. Also, my shuffle doesn't play certain songs. I've downloaded Sophie Ellis-Bextor's "Groovejet" from iTunes and pasted to my shuffle 5 times and the shuffle still does not play this song. It plays every other song in the drive. What gives? So annoying! I could probably paste it 99 times and have one other song in it(100 song total) and it still probably wouldn't play it. Also, my shuffle nowadays plays a few songs and stops. It's not a battery issue in the sense that if I reload it, it will still play those exact same songs. It seems like there is nothing else to read(play) from then on. This shouldn't be since I filled the shuffle with songs to the max. This didn't happen to me in the first 6 months. Oh well so much for technology. I may next go for iPod Nano but if that has the same problems after 6 months of use I won't bother. Hope I can find good constructive feedback for that product.

<Title>It's a good, little, and convenient player
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound quality is excellent and the shuffle is perfect for what it's built for.  Unfortunately, 512 MB and 123 songs just aren't enough for me.  I will be upgrading to a larger (probably much larger) iPod soon.    When I first got the shuffle I was thrilled.  I don't have to carry around a CD case anymore, and I can pick and choose songs.  So, instead of having to carry around over 99 CDs, I just choose the one or two songs off them that I want and load it onto my wriggly size iPod.  What a beautiful thing.   The only reason I didn't give the shuffle five stars is because now that I have an iPod I'm taking it for granted and want something more.  What can I say, I want to be able to load ALL my music onto my iPod, not just what I currently listen to most.

<Title>Green light means stop
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been an Apple fan since the very first Mac 128 came out in 1984 and I've owned tons of Apple products over the years.  Most of them have been really great and overall, I'm a big Apple advocate.  But not this time.  The Shuffle's design is once again both simple and elegant.  I run with my shuffle and love to turn it on, put in shuffle mode, hit play, then head out.  Nothing to look at; no play list to make up; it's great - when it works.  It seems I have had a lot of problems, especially if the battery runs out.  I've had to reformat the Shuffle a couple times, it's been replaced by Apple (with a refurbished one) once, and just last night, I've run into a new problem where the green light comes on and nothing happens.  This is the first time green means stop.  I followed all the instructions for troubleshooting the Shuffle on Apple's web site, including reformatting again, and no luck.  If I try to contact Apple either by phone or on-line chat, they look up the serial number.  Now that my Shuffle is 3 months out of warranty, they won't talk or chat at all.  I'm not happy.  So am I giving up on Apple?  No, but I'm not buying another Shuffle.

<Title>Bang for the Buck
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I already had a 4gb ipod that stores hundreds of albums and it's great but since getting the shuffle I find that I use it more than the other. Its light weight is really nice, you can put it in your shirt pocket, use the lanyard, or strap it to your arm. It may be small but you can still download a days' worth of listening.   In January when I bought it, the shuffle costs 95 bucks and now you can have it for less than 70, with free delivery from Amazon. Buy a cheap Y-adapter audio cable from Radio Shack or similar and you can hook it up to your home stereo and play it through its speakers. A lot of bang for the buck here, getting a portable player than can also double as a stereo component.    One note. I did have a problem with the original unit's failure to hold a charge but returning it and getting a replacement was very easy and fast through Apple. Sometimes seeing how a company deals with a problem is the best test of all.

<Title>Big hype, lousy performance
<Date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the Shuffle over a year ago. As an engineer, artist, and designer, I found the design of the Shuffle to be very inelegant, clumsy, and impractical. Sound quality is good. The software is one of the best on the market. But there are lots of problem with this thing: 1) The lanyard is cheap and ugly. Mine broke in 3 days. 2) The headphone is below average. Mine went bad after 4 months. Ringing on the left side.  3) White color looked dirty after a few weeks of use. 4) On/off switch on the back very difficult to use if you have wet, oily, or very dry fingers.  5) The USB connection rusted after a few months because I use the Shuffle during workouts. 6) Sometimes the unit just doesn't work/reload when connected to the computer. It takes several tries at times.  7) No belt strap/armband. 8) Battery life is good (I get about 9hrs. on a full charge), but  if the battery goes bad (life expectancy 2 yrs, they say), expect to throw out the whole Shuffle because replacing the battery would cost as much as buying a new Shuffle.  And my biggest gripe:  IT BROKE DOWN AFTER 11 MONTHS (ie. 1 month before warrantee was up). But I was backpacking oversea and couldn't mail it in on time. It simply stopped working. The green light came on, but no go. The navigation/play button stopped working. Apple didn't want to deal with a unit that was out of warrantee regardless of when it broke. So, $100 went down the drain. Imagine going thru life if you can only count on things working during the brief warrantee period (mine didn't even last that long).  It's pretty obvious Apple rushed out the Shuffle before it was ready--and didn't even bother to improve it over the pass year. I'm very disappointed and annoyed at the sloppy design and craftsmanship. I won't be buying another ipod any time soon--probably never--not when there so many better mp3 players out there.  As the saying goes: You burn me once, shame on you. You burn me twice, shame on me.

<Title>Love it
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i bought my iPod shuffle for a very specific use, listening at the gym or on a bike. for for me size and the interface were the reasons i bought it over a Mini (dont even get me started on other brands, none of them have a usable interface) At first, i missed that there was no screen, in that some times a song comes up i dont recognize and it would be handy to see what it is. But I can live with that. I can always check on iTunes what it was.   But what i really love is the deceptively simple interface is even better than i thought it would be. I knew having large well placed buttons would make it easy to navigate with out looking while i was working out, but they are much more tactile than i thought. I wore my ipod under my shirt, and even thru clothing, it was very easy to feel the buttons and navigate. there was no fuss at all to control it.  which exactly what i want when i  working out. All other mp3 players have tiny little buttons all over the place with no rhyme or reason. As designer, i find it funny how they miss boat with trying to be "cool" but unusable. where as apple makes it usable first, then look good.   the lack of screen is a minor issue for me, the interface that much better than any of other players on market that do have a screen.  another good thing is it is FLAT. i hand tthought about that untill i had it for few weeks. Beig n flat means it is more compofrtable whether it it is worn hanging around my chest, on my arm band or even in my pocket. one other brand of mp3 which looks cool, made me envious untill i realized it was a triangle extruded. those corners would be poking me why i work out.   the ear buds are probably weakest part. volume is outstanding and quite surprising given how small it is.

<Title>Don't believe the hype - the iPod is awful
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My iPod stopped working after two weeks, but I hated it before that. Obviously, it has no screen, but what is worse is that it communicates the information that should be on a screen with combinations of green and orange lights you are expected to memorize (it comes with an INconvienient pocket reference card). Next, the on/continuous play/shuffle play switch - it's supposed to slide, but it takes some effort to start it, and once it's moving it tends to go right past the middle setting. How about some texture on a switch like this?! It's perfectly smooth, I'm glad I'm not arthritic. Then there is the Apple software that you have to use instead of transfering songs directly to the player. The type of thinking evidenced by this and in the iTunes software itself gives you security that things will work a certain way (I suppose), but takes your freedom: Extremely frustrating. Finally, there is a built in battery that at some point will need replacing by Apple. Apple will charge 99$ for this last I checked - and that's as much as you spent on the player!

<Title>Much more good than bad
<Date>Sat Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overview:  I have the mother of all iPOD's, the 60GB iPod Photo, but due to the size of it, I found that it was a bit heavy for dog walking and trips to the gym.  It was at this point I thought of purchasing a 2nd iPod, the Shuffle.  I have owned it for three weeks now and I love it!  Pros: -Inexpensive-Just $99.00 and you can shuffle 120 of your favorite songs. -Size-The size of this little guy is infectious.  It is amazingly small and light and almost like not even having a player with you at all. -Simplicity-If you are familiar with iTunes, the Shuffle is a breeze to operate.  There is no wasted space and no wasted buttons. -Durability-The Shuffle seems to be very durable because it does not have an LCD screen.   -Sound Quality-Item sounds great.  Just as good as my iPod Photo. -Versatility-Ability to play songs in order of playlist or shuffle.  You can also download playlists, or have the player randomly choose songs from your playlist. -More Versatility-This item can also be used as a 512MB Jump Drive!  One of those will cost you $50, so you might as well buy the shuffle! -Minimalist-the fact that the item charges directly from your USB Port saves clutter and cords.  Cons- -Lack of Accessories-This is Apple's new catch:  We will make it inexpensive to lure you, then we will try to sell you expensive accessories.  iPod and Apple accessories are horribly overpriced, but are very imaginitive.  This item does come with a tie for around your neck, but no arm band.  There is also no protective cover. -More Lack of Accessories-The Shuffle charges off of the USB interface, but the way the item is designed, it does not fit into my USB drive (because of the casing around my USB ports on the PC).  I'm not sure how common this is, because it fits easily into my laptop, but it's another way for them to sell you an accessory such as the dock ($30) or a USB extension cable ($20), which I purchased.   -No digital readout-I don't think this is a big deal at all, but some people do.  If you take this for what it is, that should not be a problem. -The switch on the back is difficult to move from OFF to Shuffle to Direct Play.  I'm not sure why they did not put any grooves on this switch to make it easier to move.  Overall:  I love this unit due to the size, weight and sound quality.  I use it in the gym, walking the dog and on short trips.  If you want a simple solution that interfaces with iTunes and don't need more than 120 songs to shuffle at a time (or 240 with the 1GB), this is your ticket!  Be aware that if you want an armband and need to get the dock, your $99 Shuffle just went up to $160, or darn close to the $199 it costs for the 4GB iPod Mini which holds 1000 songs.

<Title>A great inexpensive iPod
<Date>Sun Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my iPod shuffle for a week now and I love it! It connects right into the a usb socket so you can charge it whenever you use the computer. One thing people say is that no screen is a bad thing. THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE SHUFFLE IS EXACTLY THAT - SHUFFLE!!! It's also great that you can play your music in order. I do admit that when you first get up in the morning, it's difficult to slide the on/off buttons to playlist/shuffle. The buttons are also easy to navigate through in the dark due to it's simplicity. Apple also offers good accessories but they are quite expensive. Overall, I think Apple's first shot at a flash player is an instant classic and is dominant over others as the "big" iPods are dominant over hard drive players.

<Title>ITS ALL YOU NEED

<Content>most of these reviews are to petty and particular... If your busy and hate to fumble around with all sorts of sound equalizers, controls, wires, settings, etc. this is totally for you. This sort of thing that will entertain you for hours with its small convenient size you'll never skip a beat. Who needs a huge ipod that holds a billion songs when you only have about 100 songs that you just cant live without and are always listening to. Seriouly i have the 512mb one and for someone who really doesnt want to fork over a whole paycheck on a music player its a pretty good investment. And if your a student like me you would really like the feature that lets you use the ipod as a flash drive. Say your working on your pc at home, typing a massive paper on Eisten's theory of relativity and your printer suddenly explodes, you run out of floppy disks and CD-R's but ahhh you bought the ipod shuffle! You plug it into you usb port save the 30 page paper onto it, print it at your friends house and soon get and A+ your paper winning the nobel peace prize and getting all the hot girls!

<Title>Compatibility issues
<Date>Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I know that the majority of users haven't experienced any problems with the iPod Shuffle, but I have been unable to get mine to work correctly on my PC. The software won't install properly and the computer doesn't even recognize the iPod at all. I have an iPod mini that works on my PC with no problem, and I know that everything on my computer is configured properly for use with the Shuffle, but I still can't get it to work. I was on the phone with an Apple customer service rep for almost an hour the other day, and he couldn't figure out what the problem was, either.   Apple is going to send me a new unit, so hopefully the new Shuffle will actually work. However, I have heard rumblings Shuffle users have encountered a variety of bizarre configuration problems that haven't been present in the other iPod models.   I think the Shuffle is a great device in theory...very compact and affordable. (It does look like a tampon or a pregnancy test, but I'm willing to look past that if I'm ever able to get the darn thing to work correctly!) My advice is to hold off on buying one for a few months...hopefully Apple will figure out what's causing these problems and will correct the error in future models.

<Title>Great mp3 player for exercising.
<Date>Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The shuffle is not going to win everyone's approval because there is no display. This however is the only shortcoming, and shouldn't detract from the otherwise wonderful functionality that it offers at an agreeable price.  I use my 512 Shuffle for exercising. For this purpose, it is doing just fine. Because it is light enough to drop and hang off of your earphones, because of it's sturdy hard drive free construction, and because it is very small and will fit into the tightest pocket, this mp3 player is the perfect biking/running companion.  Unless you run multiple marathons one after another, you will not go through 512 megabytes worth of music. Unless this is going to be your everyday mp3 player, you will not be rummaging through a playlist looking for a particular song. In that case, get an iPod with a HD! The flash players (Muvo) that are competing with the Shuffle that offer a screen give you a 2-5 second advantage in determining the title of a particular song! Big deal. You STILL DON'T GET to scroll through a playlist to look for a song. You'll still be pressing fast forward just like me. Only go that route if you really want the FM radio.  This is the perfect exercising companion. For when you don't want to hear the traffic and don't care to hear commercials. If you want a workhorse mp3 player for your everyday excursions during your commute, your lunch breaks, get a full service mp3 player. Otherwise, for your running/biking companion, get the cool looking, incredibly light, high quality Shuffle.  5 stars.

<Content>because this system requires that you use Itunes.  I have tons of music on Napster which Itunes would not convert so that they could be used on the Ipod Shuffle.  If this was my first mp3 and I had bought all my music on Itunes, then I would like it better.  I'm buying another Rio (which I had for 3+ years and am only replacing because it fell into a puddle of water).  Wish I had known now what I didn't know then.

<Content>Okay, so first of all, when I first got my ipod shuffle, it was Christmas day, and I knew that I wanted an mp3 player but I wasn't quite sure what kind. I was thrilled at first, but when my mom tried to set it up on our computer, it took a really long time to download all the software and 'register' your ipod. Why the heck do people have to register thier ipods!!!! It's stupid in my opinion. Anyways, my aunt had also sent us itunes gift certificates, and because she sent them from the U.S., they didn't work in canadien itunes stores! We eventually figured out wat to do by using my mom's old american email address. So everythings doing just fine until both me and my sister's ipod wouldn't show up on our computer! Why can't apple let us se a different program to upload songs to the ipod!!! Second, why doesn't it show in the manual that your supposed to eject your ipod before unplugging it!!!! Like wth!!! It's stupid. I guess ipods aren't made for Windows. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted, even if the ipod didn't have that problem, it still wouldn't have a screen and a better battery life. I will probably go to a creative zen now if my ipod continues to spazz out on me. I hope this will help people who are considering the shuffle for it's sleek design and cheapness, it's really not all that it seems.

<Title>You get what you pay for
<Date>Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Do NOT buy an ipod shuffle. I've heard that Apple is phasing out this model, which explains the reduced price.   One of the main reasons is faulty firmware in the Shuffle. I've only had mine a little over a week and it's already dead. And believe me, I've tried everything. There's a bad habit in Shuffles to go into "blink" mode, which means bad medicine. Once a Shuffle unit goes into blink mode, it becomes next to impossible to get itunes or Windows to recognize it. That means no song downloads, no updates, not even any Windows based tech diagnosis.  Apple is offering replacements, but the S&H for the return is $[...], and even then there's no guarantee that the replacement will work any better. My 5 year old Intel audio player is more reliable than this.. thing.  Stay far, far away from the ipod Shuffle. I was optimistic, but for only 70 bucks, I guess it was too much to hope for.

<Content>I bought this item from an Apple store and connected to my computer, however my computer did not recognize the ipod. Went to Apple's online customer support page. Man, the page is flooding with Ipod shuffle breakdowns. This item is the most breakdown-prone unit among ipods. I went back and got my refund. These are not durable and solid players.

<Title>Great iPod
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This iPod is so cool.  It is really small and can easily be in your pocket at all times.  It is also really light.  The sound quality is a really good.  The only bad part about it is that there is no LCD.  It is worth paying $99 for it.  I use it more than my 15GB MP3 player since it is so small.  The only problem I had with it was when I was renaming some songs from a CD with iTunes.  You have to make shure that you don't put any periods in the song name.  If you do, whenever you want to play the song the iPod will just skip over it.  Overall, this was one of the best $99 investments I ever made.

<Title>Great Device...Worth the Price
<Date>Sat May 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Do you remember when walkmans came out? They were a must have for anyone. Same thing for portable CD players. Well MP3 players are the new Walkman, and I can't figure out how I lived without one. The IPod Shuffle is a darn good product. It is designed to be a portable source of music that doesnt require a PhD to figure out, and doesn't cost half your paycheck. Having resisted the IPOD craze for 2 years, I finally found something that fits my needs exactly.  Good Things:  1. Low cost: I don't know about you, but $100 for this and the software is well worth the money. Instead of dozens of CDs everywhere, everything is neatly organized on my computer, and my Shuffle lets me download what I want, when I want, in the space of two minutes, and take it anywhere I want to go.   2. Portability: This thing is unbelievably small and light. It fits in a pocket and you forget its there. Perfect for the gym or jogging, perfect for just sitting in the book store.  3. Ease of Use: This thing is incredibly simple to use. Play, Pause, Volume Up, Volume Down, Track Forward Track Back. Shuffle Play, Playlist Order Play. That's it. No scrolling through endless menus, no struggling to learn the functions.   4. Compatibility: USB port to upload and download music, acts as a charger, simple as that. Software is incredibly easy to use, and very well organized.  Negatives: Some feel that 512MB is not enough for a player and don't like not having a display, and while a FM tuner would be nice if I wanted a radio I would get a radio. It really depends on your personal tastes.  512MB is about 100 songs, or roughly 9 hours of music at a shot. Battery lasts 12. For those who want their entire catalog at their fingertips, then the memory and the the lack of display is a negative, but I don't miss it. I like being surprised by what the next song is.   All in all, for what it is meant to be, it is great. It's great as a primary player and great as a way to dip into the world of IPOD without shelling out a fortune. Postscript: One Month later, one negative: Loading from another ITUNES Set up you cant transfer to yours due to Flash Memory. A bit annoying that.

<Title>cool gadget, ear pieces not reliable
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got an ipod a few weeks ago.   Software worked fine with WXP (SP2) Device really easy to use. Took it on a trip to Argentina.  Great on the airplanes. The right side of the earphones shipped with the unit developed a buzzing sound after a week.  Don't think it was caused by misuse.  I'll try returning it to Compusa for a new unit.  Problem is the earpieces.  The neckstrap and ear piece cords tend to tangle easily. The on switch picks up dirt.  But these are minor concerns. Recommend the device highly.  My laptop is dual boot (WXP, Linux)  Under linux you can mount the device and see all the files.

It is a good mp3 player that everyone should buy. People who have an ipod are gonna buy this, then people who don't have a ipod. I have a Ipod Photo, but i brought an Ipod shuffle, so it is more portable. This is great to bring it to school or even colloge. I would suggest people buying this.

<Title>Very small, very light, no delicate parts, no display.
<Date>Wed May 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Latest model of iPod is iPod shuffle which is just like any other flash memory based mp3 player which fit into USB port of PC and also act as flash disk to move files from one PC/Mac to another. But unlike regular flash mp3 player, it doesn't have display screen to show you song name or duration, doesn't have fm radio, doesn't do recording of audio, and doesn't need AA or AAA battery. It costs US$99 for 512mb version and US$149 for 1GB version. Disadvantage of this model is it is screenless and you have to hear song to figure out which one it is. Advantage is it is tiny, no moving parts, internal rechargeable battery and can be worn on bicep during your gym or jog routine and can be worn like necklace during your work/travel and there is little on body of iPod shuffle which can get damaged during rough use.  I got iPod shuffle 512mb and I am suitably impressed. As name suggests this is supposed to shuffle all songs you put inside it and then play it randomly and hence no screen to allow you to choose songs. You can play songs in sequence too. On front it has circular dial which has play/pause button, rewind and forward, +/- volume. On back side of player you can find OFF, Sequential play and shuffle play button and battery status button. It doesn't have STOP button, you just switch off the player. On top end of iPod shuffle is earphone socket and on bottom you have USB connector. Compared to hard disk based expensive iPod, shuffle is very light at 22gram.It is of same size as pack of chewing gum and you will never notice it in your shirt pocket. It comes with white earbuds with 2 set of foam covers, lane yard to hang iPod on neck and disk containing iTunes software for your PC and Mac. It works with any high powered USB 2.0 pc connection to transfer files/songs and charge its internal battery. It takes 4 hour to fully charge iPod which will play audio up to 12 hours. Since there is no LCD screen to drain battery you would get entire battery juice playing only music. Unlike other iPod, iPod shuffle can talk to only one PC or Mac at a time and can't use music files from multiple PCs. So you may need to have your entire music collection at one PC. You can then use manual selection of songs to fill up iPod shuffle or use its Autofill function to give you surprises; it can empty the iPod shuffle and fill it up with new collection of songs from your PC. You can set aside part of 512mb or 1gb as disk area to move files from one PC to another PC. You can't use iPod shuffle to shift music from iPod to any other PC but this limitation can be easily circumvented once you study how and where iPod stores your music.  1GB version iPod shuffle costs $149 but if small size is not a priority then have a look at iPod mini which now goes for $189 for 4GB version and has all display functionality. Not having display can be often frustrating when listening to audio books where files don't start with name of audio book.  All iPod models will play AAC and MP3 files but won't play WMA files. You can convert them to AAC files before transferring them to iPod. It will also play audioble format and wav files.  The Bottom Line Go for this if you want something for less then $100. Avoid 1GB shuffle, instead go for iPod mini 4gb for US$189.

<Title>Couldn't Live Without It
<Date>Wed May 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my iPod Shuffle for about 4 or 5 months and it's one of the best things I've bought...I'm a total music addict and my mom's happy cuz we don't have to turn on the radio every time we get in the car...I just use my shuffle! And don't belive all those other reviews that say that the software dosn't work with Windows...we have 3 windows computer and it works with each one. It lasts more than 12 hours and holds more songs than it says too. It's also CHEAP$$$! Over the years I've spent most of my money on CD's but the shuffle was still sheap enough that I could get it. and not to mention the iTunes idea it brilliant. Who wants to buy a whole cd for $12 when half the songs on it you don't like? Just go on iTunes and pick out the songs you like. It's so simple. My whole family loves it cuz I'm not blasting music all the time and my dad likes it so much he steals it from me and puts his own songs on it (even my computer-challenged dad can figure it out...now that's saying something). lol. It's a great product that every music lover should have.

<Content>My shuffle worked and sounded great for about a week, then it went belly up.  I got this odd flashing light combo and when I checked discussion boards online it didn't sound good.  I then spent about 2 hours online with Apple support to have them finally say that I'd have to send it in.  (And that no, there were no problems with the Shuffles.)  Thank goodness Amazon was so good about me returning it--they even paid my postage.  I then went out and bought a Nano--no problems so far.  I would never recommend a Shuffle to anyone!

<Content>Good price, great sound quality, and an easy unit to figure out even if you've never before owned an Apple product. Yes it (and iTunes) will work fine if you have a Windows PC. Some of us don't have "thousands of CDs" or favorite songs, so if your favorite songs number more in the dozens (up to 250 in the 1GB shuffle) then this is an excellent choice. Also, it's good for younger kids, who tend to lose things. You won't go beserk if  a $70 product disappears as you might if it was bye-bye video Nano. The only disadvantage may be that this product encourages introverted behavior--but as one of the people in the world with a distant expression and white earplugs attached to head, I now think sometimes that is a nice place to be.

<Title>5 square inches of perfection
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you're looking for a feature-heavy mp3 player on which you can store copious amounts of music with the ability to easily switch among artists, albums and genres as your mood strikes you...keep looking. The iPod shuffle is an extremely bare-bones unit with the most basic controls. But for what it is, it's sheer perfection.   As other reviewers have noted, this unit has no display and it doesn't separate tracks into subfolders based on artist, album or genre; instead, it stores all tracks in one directory, all in a linear fashion in the exact order in which you load them on your Shuffle. You can give the Shuffle a bit of predictability by reordering the player's songlist in iTunes, sorting alphabetically based on artist, album or some other field. This will allow you some control when the Shuffle's random mode is turned off, as you can hit fast forward until you find the track, artist or album you want...not terribly difficult if you have some idea of the order of the songs. Otherwise, put the player on shuffle and enjoy your own customized radio station, per se.  I've found the Shuffle most useful for keeping in my backpack so I can pull it out whenever I need some tunes to pass the time. Walking to school on a sunny day? Perfect. People in the library too loud? There ya go. Want to listen to a podcast but you're getting ready to run out the door? Just load it onto the Shuffle and it goes with you. And this player is so lightweight that it doesn't load you down, plus it's relatively inexpensive so you don't have to be so paranoid about carrying it around.  Speaking of podcasts, some people say this is a horrible device for listening to them. I disagree. When you turn the unit off and back on it picks up where you left off, or if by chance you lose your place you can hold down the forward button to search through the track until you find your place.  My only complaints about this unit are: 1) it takes a relatively long time to update, and 2) as far as I can tell you can't update it on multiple computers without completely erasing it every time. In other words, if I load the Shuffle at home then want to add a song or two at work, I can't do it; it erases all existing song files then makes you repopulate the Shuffle (but it does warn you before it does so). That just means it takes a bit of planning ahead, but with these minor quibbles aside, the Shuffle is, in the end, a very fun and handy toy.

<Date>Wed May 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Ipod shuffle because I needed a small MP3 player to use at the gym.   So far I am not disappointed.  It would have been nice if it included an armband but if you don't wanna shell out the $30 for one it does fit great in the pocket of your shorts or shirt and since it's the size of a pack of gum you should hardly be able to notice it.   The sound is great with a good pair of headphones, I didnt bother using the ear buds that come with though.   The basic design of the shuffle is it's best feature.   There are only 4 buttons and and on/off switch.  The buttons on the front are very large and can even be pressed through your clothing if you don't want to take the unit out of your pocket to fiddle with it at the gym.    Battery life is awesome, I havent seen it go below green yet even without recharging after 4 or 5 uses in a row.    Being able to play either ACC or MP3 encoded songs is also a huge benefit if you have alot of songs in both formats like me and don't want to convert them.    All in all this unit is near perfect.

<Content>I had a shuffle for about two weeks before I sold it.  My reasons for selling it (and buying a Creative Slim Muvo 512) are pretty simple.  I really thought I wouldn't mind not having a screen or any other options like that.  After a day, I eventually realized that I had paid a premium just because of the way the ipod looks (which is very nice, indeed).  After switching to the Creative Slim, I was relieved by my decision, realizing how many features the shuffle was lacking.  Get this if you need ABSOLUTELY NO FEATURES besides play, pause, forward, backward, and volume.

<Content>Very easy to load music into. sounds great.  2 things that could make it better  1> on/off switch, a little texture, or grooves to make it easier to slide it. I end up trying to get a fingernail between the unit and the switch to slid it open.  2> the earbuds keep falling out, maybe I have small ears. it takes a few times having them fall out, and putting them back in to get them in so they stay. On the commercials, they show people jumping and dancing- I dont know how they keep them in their ears!  Others comments about a lack of display and not knowing what song is next-what difference does it make? Presumably,you loaded it with music you like, I like the randomness of it,not knowing what is next. I only put songs on it that I like, so I dont care what is next.

<Title>I love my Shuffle
<Date>Mon May 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A friend gave me an iPod Shuffle, but what I really wanted was an iPod Mini.  However, after a few uses I've determined that the Shuffle meets my needs more than any other iPod could.  My CD collection is relatively small, so after ripping the entire thing to my computer, it took up less than 4 gigs.  So no problems storing them all there.  In addition, for most of the music I listen to, song length averages about 2.5 minutes, so I can cram 150 or more songs onto the Shuffle at once.  It's surprisingly fun to rip and manipulate your music collection using iTunes, and even more fun to shop for songs you haven't heard in years and thought you'd never hear again.  The Shuffle's main advantage over the other iPods is its size and weight.  I wouldn't want to slip the other iPods into a jeans pocket or bag for fear of breaking it, but the little Shuffle has no moving parts and weighs about the same as a molecule, so I don't have a problem stuffing it into my pocket.  I like the fact that you can create a playlist and play the songs in order.  There's no screen, so you can't find what you want quickly - but if you made the playlist, why would you want to skip songs anyway?  Just fill it with songs you love!  My Shuffle replaces a 13-year-old Sony Discman, and I am so glad to get rid of that antique piece of junk.  No more carting around a big book of CDs for me.

<Title>Not far from perfect
<Date>Fri May 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple was aiming to produce an elegant, tiny personal digital music player with only one standout feature (shuffle play) and they succeeded almost perfectly. It's amazingly compact and lightweight, simple to use, and hassle-free except as noted below. Battery life is excellent. The i-Tunes software that comes with it is the state of the art in flexibility, functionality, and ease.   There's no compelling reason not to buy this, but here are a few cavils to consider:  * The on-off switch needs a groove, notch, bump, or something to make it easier to grip. I have to squeeze the unit to get traction on the on-off switch. Annoying.  * After powering it on, I almost always have to press the play button twice before it decides to play. Why?  * In my experience, this requires USB 2.0 on the PC platform, and I get uneven results on the five different USB 2.0 ports I've tried. On some, the performance is great. On others, it is very slow. I have never gotten a USB 1.x port to see this device.  * The headphones are uncomfortable and prone to falling out. Inside-the-ear headphones are not a one-size-fits-all item, because one size does not fit all. Chances are good you'll be purchasing replacement headphones, as I did.  * For how much is Apple going to gouge me when I need a replacement battery? (Begs question: is this actually made to last? Begs further question: is anything made to last any more?)   * I wish they would produce this in other colors. I could see it in black especially. Someday, man may yet learn to dye plastic.  Cavils aside, if you're looking for a simple, no-nonsense personal digital music player, this is a great choice.

<Title>the good machine
<Date>Tue May 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great device for those who might consider an iPod or iPod mini overkill for their intended purposes.  I didn't want to store my entire music collection on a portable device - I use an external hard drive for that - and I wanted something that was painless to refresh with new tunes, ideally using the iTunes interface.  Additionally, I needed something light, easy to use, and sturdy for bike rides, trips to the gym, etc.  The 512Mb device holds between 80-120 songs, depending on the bit rate of your music files (I rip at 320kps, and have put about 90 songs onto the device).  Hey presto - iPod shuffle!    Additionally, I love the way it handles audiobook files - if you load an audiobook + songs onto the device, it will only play the audiobook files when you have it set to "linear" mode; you can switch to "shuffle" mode to listen exclusively to your music.  It also bookmarks Audible files, so you can start up right where you left off.   On the downside, the headphones aren't that great - they're uncomfortable, and they sound pretty bad.  No surprise there, really, I've never purchased a portable music device packaged with a decent set of headphones.  I think they might be fine for listening to 128Kbps music files, but I've found that they lack clarity, and don't cut through the ambient noise at places like the gym, or through those sounds in my head when my invisible friends speak to me through the fillings in my teeth.   All in all, though, I'm very happy with this little device. Pick up one of these, add an armband, get on your bike, and prepare to sport a really bizarre tan line this summer!

<Title>Almost perfect!
<Date>Fri Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned my iPod shuffle for a couple of months now and it still works pretty good. The only major thing that is wrong with it is that there is no LCD screen to see what songs are playing. Don't let the name fool you . . . you can listen to the songs in order. This iPod is perfect for someone with a small music library. I am upgrading to either a 20 gig iPod or an iPod mini but I recommend this to any music liver that is still on a budget!

<Title>iPod shuffle: very nice
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my Ipod shuffle at my local PX(post exchange) on a army base in Japan for $86 and I went home very excited that I just got an Ipod. When I got home and tried it out on my laptop and PC using a USB hub but nothing worked. I searched on the web and they said I had to have a "High power USB port." I knew my hub was high powered because it pluged stright in to the power. So I took it back and got another one and that one worked just fine I was very happy about this. I saw on PC magazine thatthey found out that the iPod shuffle had the best sound quality, I was happy about this to. I might add that I had a very hard time finding this at the PX and I was consitering to buy it off-base but I was worried that it would be all in Japanese. No worries all the software it comes with(iPod update and iTunes)is eather downloadable off the internet or bialingual.

<Content>I understand what the other iPods are capable of doing and how much they cost.  But this has a certain function that I need.  This is my third iPod and I use it only for one genre of music - Christmas songs for the season.  Therefore this works perfectly for just those tunes I want to listen to during the holiday season.  This way I don't have any Christmas songs on my 30GB or 20GB.

<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hi All, I think this is the best option for a budget user($69.99).The sound quality is good compared to creative product and it is very sleek.512 MB is suffiecient space and I think 120 songs is good enough at a time.  Plus -sleek -Good back up fo battery -Through Itunes you can actually load play lists of your selected songs etc.  Minus -No FM -Can Only be charged through USB port.I mean if you intend to go to a remote place and do not have access to PC/laptop then it is difficult to charge the ipod.  Worth taking it as I saw no defects in the product as pointed by some users earlier in the reviews.

<Title>iPod shuffle is the way to go for an affordable on the go flash player!
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have an iPod mini, it is almost invincible, it hasn't got one trace of scratches or wearing. It is great , but it is now discontinued, leaving it almost unreplacible. I never really want to take it places in fear of it getting stolen or damaged, so i bought this Shuffle. It is light weight, very affordable and sleek looking.The good points are the sleek small light-weight travel size, the long battery life,easy computer access, and a very large capacity for such a small inexpensive flash player. The only downsides are the slightly fragile plastic, the combinations of buttons are required to use hold, and the plasic shows some finger oil once you holds it, but none of that is very bad.Buying a case along with it will ensure it's safety, i would recomend the Marware sportgrip shuffle case($10, at marware.com). The iPod shuffle does not have a screen, but you really don't need one for 120 songs, as long as you like all the songs you put on it, you'll do fine without the LCD. That is the whole reason of the Shffle, so you can just turn it on a listen to all your songs without constantly clicking it and taking it out, just hit play and let all your song play without haviong to get it out every 3 minutes. If you are looking for a 2nd ipod or a cheap on the go player, the iPod shuffle is for you.

<Title>No Screen and NOT the Cheapest
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't understand how the iPod Shuffle almost overnight became an instant hit, totally dominating the flash MP3 player market.  First of all it is not the cheapest.  Players in the Creative Muvo NX/TX Micro... whatever lines are still consistantly cheaper per Megabyte.  Furthermore with the NX/TX lines you also get the USB "thumbdrive" functionality, without having to worry about losing the little plastic cap at the end of the Shuffle (My friend lost his in 2 weeks and now just has some plastic wrap to keep out dust and etc.)  Furthermore, with the Muvo's you get a SCREEN and Muvo TX FM you get FM radio and voice recording.  Finally, on the Muvo's you can get almost 20 hours of battery time off of one AAA battery (compare that to 12 hours on a proprietary Apple battery - and how many recharges do you think that will last?  1 year before you have to spend $30 to get a new one?)   In the end, the hard drive based iPods are beautiful, but this Shuffle is merely an example of corporate greed, that cheapens the iPod brand.  But it goes to show how many people are just brand-slaves.   If you want an iPod, get a real one (even a mini).  If you want a cheap flash based player, there are many better ones with better value out there, e.g., Creative MuVo, Samsung Yepp, iAudio U2, iRiver...

<Title>I'm cool!
<Date>Thu Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my iPod Shuffle almost 2 months ago and have no regrets. Before Shuffle, I had no intentions of buying an iPod but one day my floppy drive on my laptop broke and decided to buy a pen drive instead. While searching for one, I decided I wanted a pendrive integrated with mp3 player.   I was about to buy the one from Sandisk until I learned it needed a cable to connect to the USB port. I don't want to carry a cable in my bag everyday!   So, I decided I'd rather use iTunes than carry a cable. :)  At first, I didn't like the idea of not having an LCD display nor FM tuner. I was thinking if I could get used to not having those features and realized I hate the LCD light in my Sony CD player because it is too bright (I listen to music before I sleep) and it consumes too much battery. Also, I never listen to the FM. Then, why did I want those in the mp3 player? Because others have it, therefore I couldn't imagine one without it.  I must confess, I chose it also because of its simple design. I don't own any other products by Apple, but I always loved their minimalistic design. Am I shallow? Probably, but I'm happy with it.  I had never used iTunes before buying Souffl(I named it that way, hehe) but it is very easy to use and so far I had no problems with it.  I can live without it, but life is easier with it because I use it everywhere and it is more practical than carrying a floppy disk.   Then why 4 stars? Because I wish it included a pouch to protect it from dirt and maybe it will prevent the earphone cords from tangling.   I recommended it mostly to students and athletes.

<Content>What an awesome little device!  I love it!  It does exactly what it is advertised to do.  I can't believe how great the sound is and how SMALL this thing is....  3.5" x 1" x 3/8".  It truly is the size of a pack of gum.  It is so light too...probably weighs one ounce.  I completely filled mine up with songs and it does hold about 120.  It is easy to use and if you have basic computer skills, you will find it very easy to figure out how to transfer songs to it.  The only negative I have experienced is that the ear buds are rather uncomfortable...they are very hard plastic and they hurt your ears after awhile.  The little soft removable foam covers that came with it don't stay on and they don't make a big difference in comfort anyway.  But otherwise...I just love it - especially for the price!  Great design, great sound, great price and tiny as can be.

Good design and nice looking but I regret my purchase because I don't want to feel limited in any way.  Also, sound with the included headphones isn't good.  AND IT ISN'T TRUE THAT IT'S 512MB!!! Total Capacity is: 511.197.184 bytes and that means that the real capacity of the Apple iPod Shuffle is 487MB. Dear Apple people: Please don't think we, users, are stupid. Do not lie to us. Shame on you Apple!  Buy a Creative Zen instead (or anything else)

<Title>Ipod, The Cheap Way
<Date>Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>MP3 players have really come in a long way since they were so popular a few years ago. It seems like everybody wants to buy one of these agdgets. but the prices are just too steep for just so many to afford. Apple definitely has known what it is like. With the mammoth success of the Ipod MP3 players, many people who want those MP3 players get them anyway they can. Although it has been a great ordeal, many just want a little more convience in the price, and also the size. Most of the Ipods are about the size of a walkman. Well, there is one that could be better, but is a good value for those who want the MP3 craze of their own.  Apple's Ipod Shuffle, is a more compact size MP3 player who want not just the convience, but the price as well. The device can hold as many as 100 different songs that can be downloaded from the internet, or burned to the computer from compact discs. The device is a little trickier to operate and is a little more of a hassle. One reason, is that it has a very short battery life. Only 12 hours of musical playback, where other MP3 players like Rio or Sony can have their devices with double, and possible triple the length of battery life. Another disadvantage is there is no LCD display. Unlike the other Ipods that show what is playing on the Ipod, this one makes it seem like a mystery to others who want to just guess on what the song is on the player.    All in all, the Apple Ipod shuffle isn't really all what is said it was cracked up to be. For those who want the MP3 craze, I honestly suggest you pass this one up, and consider with the Ipod Mini, or another MP3 player. This one is shuffled out of tune.  Price: B+  Easy To Operate: C  Convience: B-  Overall: C 1/2+

<Title>Ipod Shuffle Problems
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When my brother (he's 7) said that he wanted an Ipod for his birthday, I suggested that he should get the Ipod shuffle as opposed to the nano, because the nano wasn't exactly child proof.  So when he got it, I started to get it ready on our Emac computer.  Then when I tried to get the shuffle into the USB port (the top comes off the Shuffle and reveals a thing to go in a USB port)  It could not go all the way into the port.  I looked through the instruction manual for help, and one one page in the middle, in small print it mentioned that if I couldn't get the Shuffle into the USB port, I would need to purchase a Ipod Shuffle dock or a USB extension cable.  My dad and I were angered beyond belief that something like this wasn't on the Shuffle box, and that we had to wait after we purchased the shuffle to learn about this.  We ended up having to buy a USB extension cable for $30.  I advise anyone looking to buy this product to see if the shuffle can fit it your computers USB port.

<Title>A great complement to the IPOD
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just purchased the 1g version this weekend and love it! I have owned an IPOD 3G (20gb) for over a year. It holds my entire music collection and then some. As a frequent flyer and train rider, there are many times when I just could care less what I listen to. I simply want to pass the time while travelling. In addition, I am over 50 (and you know how good your close vision is without glasses at that age). The Shuffle simply lets me plop down on my plane or train seat and press a button...voila! music! Nothing to look it....just listen. Before embarking on a trip, I simply download the songs that I want to my shuffle, charge the unit, and grab it as I am going out the door. What I have done is create a series of playlists on Itunes, each with a good mix of music. This makes loading the Shuffle even faster...I just pick the playlist that I want and go! One recommendation however: Although the bass response is better than on my 3G IPOD (even without any equalization controls), the included earbuds still are inadequate. I use a pair of Sennheiser 100's (nice and compact and come in their own folding case). The combination of the Shuffle and and these headphones give me a superb listening experience. The Koss PortaPros also provide very good sound with the Shuffle. One suggestion: Many users have indicated that the on/off switch at the rear of the unit is difficult to manipulate. I placed a small piece of white adhesive tape on the switch. This gives my finger a bit more "traction" when sliding the switch.

<Content>I DID love my Shuffle. But now it has exhibited a VERY strange trait that has made it almost unusable. The thing reads as if it has 512 mbs of music on it, when in fact, it has only 150 mb of music on it.   Other than that its good but this is probably my 7th MP3 player and this has NEVER happened before.   This is really poor; I have only had it for a few months.   I am very disappointed.

<Title>Great player, but some big negatives
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is a great little MP3 player.  First I must say I have the iPod mini (which I think is by far the best MP3 player around), but I use my friends' iPod shuffles a lot.  I must say for some people buying the iPod shuffle is a great use of their money, but for others it is a total waste of money.  The iPod shuffle is for you if you: -like the shuffle mode -want to listen to it when you work out -like to listen to whole CD's, no skipping songs -don't mind not having a display The iPod shuffle is NOT for you if you -want to always have total control of what song is played yet -will put more than 50 songs on your iPod shuffle -want to put audio books on the iPod shuffle -mind not having a display One way to see if you will like the iPod shuffle is play a CD on shuffle mode.I hope this review was helpfull for you!

<Date>Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Very very disappointed in this! I have had a series of problems since I bought the Ipod Shuffle less than a month ago. Every time, I try everything but the answer is always to restore it, meaning I lose all the music.  I have spent too much time dealing with it. It is also a problem that you can't load music without iTunes; it seems that the benefit of these flash MP3 players should be their flexibility to load music from several location and in several formats.  The instructions say that you can also set it up to load music from several computers by putting it in disk mode, but I didn't find this very intuitive. In general, from the time I purchased it in the store to the times I had all these problems, I didn't find the service satisfactory, and the instructions are cumbersome.  But worst of all, I simply don't trust this little thing. Too many times, it turned on (when disconnected from computer) and simply wouldn't play. Out of nowhere. They changed it once for me; but basically I could never trust it again since it did it again: it refused to play songs!  My time is worth more than this and I am purchasing something else.

<Title>Very Good Device (In Spanish)
<Date>Wed Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Estuve sondeando comprar un flash mp3 player por un rato, me iba a decidir por un Sony, pero los comentarios sobre lo dificil del software que utilizan me asutaron, decidi compar el IPS y no me arrepiento. Tiene un exelente sonido, y por lo menos a mi no me importa que no tenga pantalla, pues generalmente lo utilizo para introducir mis cds. La razon por la cual les doy 4 estrellas es que los earbuds con los que vienen, podrian tener mejor sonido. Utilice el Ipod con unos audifonos de Panasonic y el sonido fue simplemente ASOMBROSO, bajos profundos y graves increibles para un equipo tan pequeo. En general estoy muy conforme con mi compra, el software es bastante facil de utilizar y el equipo se porta muy bien con mi computadora HP. Estoy conforme. :) Julio 2006: El equipo se sigue portando de maravilla, buena duracion de bateria!!! (mayor duracion de la que apple dice)

<Title>GUIDE TO IPOD SHUFFLE AS A SECOND IPOD + Breaking News
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>BREAKING NEWS: the 1GB shuffle is now only $129 (late June 2005).  The delta to the 512MB is now only $30 for double the songs.  In my opinion, this makes the 1GB model a more compelling buy.  This review is for current regular iPod owners that might be attracted to buying an iPod shuffle as a second player. I own both a 40GB iPod Photo and a 1GB iPod Shuffle.   Initial reactions out of the box:  Out of the box it is as simple as any other iPod and its documentation is simple yet effective. Loading the songs (on a USB 2.0 PC) is slower than the regular iPod charge, which is blazingly fast. It takes several minutes to load the 120+ songs on the 512MB model. The autofill menu is simple and lets you choose from your library or from one of your playlists, either in sequential order or at random. I'd personally would have liked more flexibility (e.g. load from several playlists).   When loading it is useful to select the option to reduce high-resolution MP3 into lower rates. The Shuffle supports AAC and MP3 files up to 320 kbps, which is much more than what most people use (also supports MP3 VBR files). However, if you do use higher resolutions, there is an option to load everything on 128Kbps AAC.   Sound quality:  Once I have loaded it fully, I have tried it with several types of speakers and earphones. I first tried it with the standard white iPod ear buds which are very convenient, but come across flat, similar to any iPod. I then tried it with a pair of BOSE Acoustic Noise Canceling headphones. The results with the BOSE headset are pretty good; you can not tell a difference from a regular iPod. The music comes across well defined and bass comes across rich and full. This is at the same level as regular iPod, but I somehow expected a less full sound. Finally, I tried it on a set JBL Portable OnTour speakers and again the iPod shuffle stand up really well related to its 40GB iPod Photo sister.   I used the shuffle for a while and I can tell you, the sound quality is pretty good. Apple has done a great job reproducing the same high quality sound as in any iPod, which is much better than many MP3 players out there.   Synchronizing both players:  I focused on Synchronization with iTunes, synchronizing both my regular 40GB ipod Photo and my shuffle intermittently. I didn't notice any interoperability issues. You can own both and synchronize both and not have any issues doing this. Please remember that iTunes does not allow you to synchronize two regular iPods into one iTunes library (I guess to provide some protection to the music), unless you buy one of the 3rd-party software programs out there. In this case (regular iPod and Shuffle on one iTunes) both players can synch with no issues.   Usage models that best fit each player:   iPod Shuffle:  - Exercise at the gym. It's so light and convenient you won't go back to a regular iPod.  - Trekking, walking, jogging, outdoor sports.  - Short flights. Even with just how easy is to operate a regular iPod you still have to go through a little procedure to get it out, select your music, put on your headphones, and look for where to put it (challenging if you are in coach). You can easily board a plane with your lanyard and turn it on as soon as you can.  - Reading books in the park, your house. Why bother carrying the big iPod if you are basically going to use if for background?   Regular iPod:  - Long trips (e.g. transcontinental or to South America) - you are likely to listen to different types of music in your library within the trip.  - Parties (you do want the flexibility or changing your playlist if the mood of the party changes!).  - Listening to specific songs or albums not in a list. Don't even try on the shuffle - the lack of a screen will definitively frustrate you.  - Car trips.   Use Smart playlists to make shuffling a better experience.  Use Smart playlists. You can easily organize your library by genre, personal rating, time of publication and many other parameters (or several of them at once). If you have a large music library you can easily build smart playlists for "Top rated Rock", "My top rated Songs", "60's Latin" (Bossa Nova lovers) or "90's Soundtracks". Then when you autofill your iPod shuffle simple pick the music that suits your mood and you are ready. Changed your mind in the middle of your flight? Simply use your laptop to reload from a different list.   Definitively a winner as a more convenient second player. If you like suffling on a regular iPod, don't even think about it and get it as a second player for those occassions where being light is worth the loss of flexibility.

<Title>Awesome Player!
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I may be a simple kinda guy for saying this but this iPod Shuffle ROCKS.  I was blown away by how good the sound quality was.  It is small which is a plus.  Unbelievablely small.  This is my first mp3 player and if you are a beginner in all things mp3 than I highly recommend this product.  It was simple to get started.  I had to wait 4 hours for the shuffle to charge but after that it is awesome.  iTunes is great and i was able to download all of my favorites from my CD collection to iTunes and then to my iPod.  You read all of these other negitive feedback but I had no problems what so ever.  AWESOME!

<Title>Windows XP? Walk Slowly Away from the Shuffle.
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I admit it. I fell for the Ipods. They are clean, elegant, and have a certain hipness that I usually run the other direction from. After getting and using the regular Ipods, I stared too long at the spinning wheel and ran down and picked up a 512 Shuffle. A flash-based player seemed to be the perfect addition to the family.   I loaded my tunes and went for the most miserable ride of my computing and MP3 life. I have used all manner of MP3 players from the early RIOs with 32 MBs to Archos jukeboxes and a few in between and have never encountered anything remotely as vexing as the Shuffle. As an example, I scrounged around for an old MP3 player for a kid's bus trip. I unearthed a Nomad which fired right up and played flawlessly after years of inactivity. In contrast, I have not been able to get two steady weeks of use from my Shuffle. It will freeze up and force a reinstallation of Itunes, it requires reformatting more than Madonna, and to top it off, there is the usual Ipod/Itunes digital management issues. According to the Apple discussion boards, a large number of people are experiencing problems with the Shuffle and Windows XP, which I of course am using. Along with around 80% of the computing world. Sure, it's cute, sure it's hip, but if you are just looking for something cool to wear around the neck, grab an old puka bead necklace.

<Title>Another great Apple product
<Date>Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Personally I have no intentions of buying this device because I already have a 20GB iPod (which I have used flat out for the last 3 year with no problems) but I recieved the iPod Shuffle with a 15" PowerBook that I recently purchase. What can I say about the iPod Shuffle but it's another quality product you would expect to get from Apple. It's small, compact, like all Apple products it's easy to set up, the battery life for the shuffle is exceptional and the sound quality is outstanding from such a minimal product. I think this iPod works so well because of its minimalism, it has the most basic of controls, basic set up (just plug and play) and like the others in the iPod family it intergrates with iTune so well and easily. If you want a cheap and decent quality mp3 player this is definantly the one to get.

<Content>I love it.  I gave 4 stars because I would buy the 1G instead.   It was easy to use, the sound was excellent and was easy to wear with the optional armband I purchased (the armband is overpriced but nice to have if you are active or workout with it). It took all of 5 minutes to setup and found my iTunes files immediately.  Great product but I would recommend that you pay the extra $30 and get the added 1G space.

<Title>Misleading statement
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A comment from one user says you can go to a web link and get an ipod for free. This is not true, I went to this web link and followed the instructions, surveys etc. Then they want you to sign up and buy services from sponser websites, i e  visa , discovercard, netflicks, disney movie club. This alone would not be to bad, but they mislead you on the first sign up page saying you only have to choose two products, after you choose two of the sponser products( which are not free.. of course) then they say you will be sent the ipod, but only after you sign up for two more products on page two. (did not do this because the products you sign up for will eventually add up to the price of an ipod. It goes on from there to page three, with two more products.(checked that page out without buying, and the only services to apply for are a few credit cards not worth having.  If you go to this web link, be prepared to shell out some bucks and your personal info(which of course is not that personal these days any way.   I suppose you could just buy the ipod shuffle for around 69.99 and you would be about 250.00 ahead in the long run without all the hassle from false advertising and the traditional bait and switch.

<Title>Top Ten Reasons to Save Your Money
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The problems with the shuffle are endless. 10. If you can get it to work...     some computers have serious problems with recognizing it.      Thats after the endless hours of updates,support,and rigging 9.  Once you get it working (kind of) you'll find that shuffle     likes  a small amount of your songs.  Repeats them over and     over. Even after you skip them. 8.  If you put the thing in your pocket (where else) the      controls will respond to your movements.  Like a camera     phone taking pictures in your pocket. 7.  You can only use it on the computer you install it on. 6.  Ear buds are one step above the Dollar store. 5.  Battery's life expectancy 6 months.  Price a new one. 4.  itunes is more of a commercial than it is useful.     slows my computer up. 3.  The daily emails to buy buy buy. 2.  Quick Time Pop-ups. You can't run itunes with out it. 1.  Its white!

<Title>Great!
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, of course I have to rate it 5 stars. I would never admit that I made a bad choice by buying this iPod shuffle - which I didn't, unless it really sucked, then yeah, maybe I would.  Anyway, I've had for at least 8 months now. It's great. I got some nail polish on it, so now the key pad is a bit dirty looking, but I managed to get most of it off. It's easy to clean. It hasn't run out of power yet - well, it might have something to do with the fact, that I've plugged it into my computer, before the batterie is even empty! :P So, all in all, it's a great mp3 player. I would recommend it now especially, since the prices are dropping.  P.S. THe only thing I'm missing, is a screen. I might want to get a proper iPod sometime, because this doesn't have enough space for my music.

<Content>It's cheap, it's easy to set up and use.  Plus it's so little and light, I sometimes forget where the music is coming from when I'm using it.  I don't mind the random shuffle aspect since I like all the songs I've entered.  The suprise of what song comes next is a plus as far as I am concerned.  It's added a soundtrack to my life.

<Title>So good I want another one
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband received this as a gift from his office for doing a good job on some project he was working on...so it's actually more his than mine (that's why I want another one).   Now, I'm not a very technically savvy person, yet this is fairly easy for me to use. All you have to do is load your CD's on to it using the Apple software from your computer or you load songs from Itunes . It takes no time at all and it stores a ton of songs (120 I think). As for the unit itself, it couldn't get any easier. There's one switch that either turns it off, on, or shuffle. Then on the front has the volume, skip and pause buttons. Very easy and basic.   I personally don't really need a fancy display window or anything like that because I like all the songs I put on there. I admit, if for some reason I did have a hankering to listen to one specific song it would be rather annoying trying to scroll through and find it, but that's a rarity with me.   It still amazes me how small this thing is. It's almost too small in fact. I'm not the most organized person in the world and it would be very easy for this thing to get lost; heck, I loose packs of gum this size all the darn time...then that's $70.00 out the window. So far, it's been pretty durable even though it's so small, but I can see the possibility of it breaking as being pretty high.   My only complaint about the unit itself is I wish it came in different colors like the other iPods do. But hey, that's just a cosmetic thing.  The unit as a whole works great and is pretty affordable for what you get out of it.

<Content>Before you buy any Ipod, make sure you have a high speed USB port also called USB 2.  I bought my Dell Dimension 8200 desktop PC in Feb. 2002 and I thought my computer would be fine.  I was wrong and after an hour trying to get the PC to recognize the Ipod I called the Apple help line.  The solution was to buy a USB 2 card here on Amazon for $20.

<Title>It so...small...yeah...
<Date>Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>That's pretty much the first thought I had about the Shuffle when I got it as a gift. Had not I had some inside information that I was to be getting an mp3 player previous to this point, I would have said something in the lines of WTF?  Yes, I am that off-track when it comes to what's new and hip and I was also of the opinion that paying a hundred bucks for a piece of plastic that plays music is something that would never kick off. Oh yeah. So when I held this so-weightless-it-almost-floated-away-on-the-wind device, I was shocked, to say the least. Yes, the iPod is smaller than a pack of gum. As to whether it's more fun goes back to how much you like your gum. I like gum.  The largest complaint about the Shuffle (as The Seashell Soft-Shoe Shuffle inevitably goes through your mind) is its lack of a screen. You can't pick which song you want when you want it. You can't start at song no. 35 and go from there (unless you want to spend an hour pushing next, next, next) and you can't see what song you're on and what's about to come next. However, Hell will freeze over before they can fit screens onto something so small. Now, the iPod Nano has an LCD display, but is it smaller than a piece of gum? And is it more fun? I don't think so.  The price of the tiny fit-into-your-pocket size and non-existent weight is the lack of the LCD display. Other than that, the Shuffle more than makes up for this one prob with high sound quality, the AAC thingie and of course, the price. I have since changed my mind about mp3 players. I mean, as one comedian said, imagine walking out of your house each morning to the accompaniment of `Hail to The Chief' blaring in your ears. Now that's the way to start your day!  The advertisement isn't quite accurate when it claims that the iPod will help you make new friends. I haven't made any yet. Still waiting though. It does not guess your mood. In fact, it's pretty stupid at times. After Enya's `May It Be' the last thing you want to hear is Rhapsody's blaring `Emerald Sword'. But that's my problem for having such a wide and diverse selection on my pod, from classical to Jpop to new age. The iPod will not take you anywhere. You will be taking the iPod around, not vice versa, I assure you.   However, the good thing about the iPod is the fact that it holds a ton of songs, and with the Shuffle feature you are guaranteed a new and different Playlist every time you listen to it. No more listening to same order of songs anymore, no more humming the next song before the one you're listening to has finished. That is, unless, of course, you want to; the Shuffle has an Un-shuffle feature (it's not actually called that) and you can listen to the songs in boring, playlist order whenever you want to. The best part about the Shuffle feature is the fact that you get to listen ALL of your songs. I mean, when you have 150 songs, how many times do you get to listen to the whole selection, or just the ones at the end? With the Shuffle feature, all your songs get equal treatment.  What I don't like about my iPod is iTunes actually. It's annoying. I've heard a lot of hate going for windows media, but I prefer it to iTunes any day. Why? Well, imagine plugging in your iPod because its battery needs to be recharged and ending up with every song on it wiped off. Why? Oh, because you moved your music file. Move one file anywhere and all of a sudden iTunes gets freaked. I applied the `update my iPod automatically' because that's what was recommended and now I can't get it off! If you think you can just put songs on your iPod and then delete them from your PC, you got something else coming. They have to stay on your computer indefinitely. Which means if you lose a file accidentally, or your hard drive gets messed up, so will your iPod the next time you connect. Every time I connect now, I offer up a prayer that somehow nothing will happen. I've got the hang of it by now, but it drove me INSANE at first. No offence, Apple, but iTunes SUCKS!!!  Other than that, it's easy to use, the Smart Playlists are catchy and whatnot. I've had a hard time trying to organize the songs in exactly the way I want them to, but I can't find out how. If you arrange them by artist, it's by alphabetic order, and the same goes for he title, etc. I want to have all my Jpop next to each other, my Enya next to Mckennit and so on, so that I can listen to it un-shuffled when I want to, but I haven't found an easy way to do that.  All in all, for a iPod you can listen to while it sits unnoticed in your jeans pocket, this is the pod for you.

<Title>Good audio device, too big to be a flash drive
<Date>Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first saw the ipod shuffle, I thought it was pointless and didn't think it would sell well because of the lack of lcd screen. But once apple dropped the price of the shuffle I decided to get one because it was so cool looking and doubled as a flash drive......  For me, the  shuffle because when I had my ipod mini, Every song I owned was on it and could never decide what to listen to. When I used the shuffle mode on it, I would just skip through most of the songs because I wasn't familiar with them and never the songs a chance! So I just stuck with the same 20 favorite songs love over and over again.........  Now with the shuffle, I can either create a playlist and play them in order or in shuffle mode. OR it can randomly choose songs to put onto it. Since it would be a hassle to scroll through the songs I like with the shuffle, I would be more encouraged  the songs a chance, and even enjoy most of them!  Shockingly, my favorite thing about the shuffle is what I hated about it the most when I first saw it; the lack of lcd screen. You see this device was created for use in "active" conditions, like exercising working out etc. It's flash based so it doesn't skip, and when your in the middle of doing something active, you just let the songs play without having the need to choose songs or have something as delicate as an ipod scratch up or even worse, have the internal parts break. The great thing about the shuffle is that it doesn't scratch as easily (as the nano and non-mini hard drived based ipods) and even if it does, your not looking at it much due to the lack of lcd screen. It even comes with a nice neckstrap to wear!   I also admire the lack of screen on the shuffle like it because I listen to music a lot in the dark and can't to drain the battery with a light turning on while scrolling through the songs. That cut my ipod mini battery usage to maybe 50 percent or even more per charge!  Some people complain about the 12 hour battery life versus the (up to) 14 on the Ipod nano and 30 gig ipod video. I think the lower battery time contributes to the smaller size of the shuffle, but 12 hours is half a day which is fine for me! This contributes to the smaller size of the shuffle resulting a smaller battery. Most flash based mp3 players use a replaceable AAA or AA battery, but I know one where the the battery life is only 4 or five hours on it, depending on the usage! I heard some offer up to 20 hours, but I prefer something internal because I won't have to go through the hassle of buying new batteries or expensive rechargeable batteries, that don't last as long as regular batteries per charge...............  This leads to one bad thing about the ipod shuffle but it depends on the consumer; Like all ipods it has a non-replacable battery.  I hated this when I first bought the ipod without knowing that, but the interface on the device was so user friendly, I didn't care after that. I haven't had an ipod that completely drained yet, but I personally would rather upgrade to a new ipod then send in my old one for 50-100 dollars (not sure how much it costs, but I do know it went down in price recently) to get a refurbished, different one (unless the ipod was personalized). And with the shuffle costing about 70 dollars (as of this wrting), I estimate I will get at least 1.5 years out of it and just buy a new one if this still make it.   The flash drive functionality is somewhat disappointing. Yes it works on any XP enabled PC (you need to tell it to save a certain amount of memory to store files through itunes first) but it's too big to be a flash drive. My USB slot is tucked inside of the bottom front tower behind a cover that flips down. The shuffle doesn't fit all the way inside and I thought it was defective when itunes didn't detect it. So I plugged the shuffle into the USB located in the back of the tower and it works fine. But I have to use this USB extender I bought to keep it plugged into the front. So this means I can't go to any computer and expect the shuffle to fit inside of the USB slot unless I want to bring the USB extender with me, which kind of defeats the purpose of the flash drive functionality. I can get a flash drive the size of the extender!  Finally I'm going mention about the shuffle and its integration with itunes. The reason why I think it works so well is because if I bought a non apple flashed based player, It would most likely integrate with windows media player, and I would either have to drag and drop each song onto it, or it would automatically transfer my wma songs onto the device. For maybe 10-20 songs this is okay, but for up to 120, it's too much of a hassle IF I wanted to do playlists. With itunes, it's a snap to create a play list and I could drag it into my shuffle directory, Or I can drag albums onto it. This is what makes the shuffle and all of apple's digital music players so brilliant, it syncs up with an easy yet to use interface that appeals to casual and hardcore users.  So I give it 3 stars. good audio device thanks to the painless itunes interface and integration, flawed flash drive device
