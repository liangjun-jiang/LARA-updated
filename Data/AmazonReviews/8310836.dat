<Title>Creative Zen 8 GB is the bomb!!!
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been waiting for the device that could keep me from having to buy an I-Pod. This is the device. The only thing the I-Pod has it beat on is memory (and I imagine that will change as new models come out).  It plays more files, has as good if not better video playback and I don't have to use I-Tunes to deal with my product.

<Title>hmmm...pretty good
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So far I really like this product. It has plenty of space for all the music that you actually listen to and still have space left over instead of paying a hundred more to carry around music you never listen to. I think it has good features, though i dont use them. The interface is simple but it seems to be a little slow scrolling through the menu. this really isnt that bad cuz its like a .1 second delay. disregard that bc its no big issue and will not dtract from the products quality. The materials are good. The buttons feel a little cheap but not bad overall. Overall awesome mp3 player. The software that comes with it is very annoying and stupid. Just use a different program to transfer and there are no problems.

<Title>Other than freezing up, a great player
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like the dimensions, screen display, and sound. The recording function works very well, too. The only problem I have is that the screen occasionally goes black and the player freezes. It stops responding to anything and I have to let the battery drain. Once it's drained and I recharge it, it seems fine. I can't find a reason or pattern for the freezing. So far, it's happened 3 times in a month (once after I unplugged it from the charger, once when I tried to play a song I'd listened to already and once when I tried to turn it off). I sometimes wonder if I should have gone with the iPod just for the stability.

<Title>Sound Quality is Superb
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first player I've ever owned for more than a month.  I know some people look for good video playback on players (which this one has), but my focus was sound quality.  And I'm amazed at how this player produces such an incredible sound, even with the packaged earphones.  I'm convinced that this is the player to keep for the next few years.

<Title>Was the perfect anniversary present for four days...
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>**Update: decided to take advantage of the GREAT Amazon return policy and got a new one overnight.  Has worked fine for a week.  Also purchased the clear case (good) and the AC power adapter (an absolute must).  Features, screen size and quality, and control scheme all rate very high. **   I agree with pretty much all of the features and benefits mentioned by other reviewers and let me add my annoyance at the short USB cable - apparently they assume everyone has a USB hub on thier desk these days.  Wife loved it for her anniversary present (I bought this as a delivery vehicle for an edited version of our wedding video) and was enjoying having her country music collection for her commute...for four days.  I gave it to her on Friday, on Tuesday it died. Won't power on, no charging light shows when plugged into the USB cable, nothing.  Tried all the reset operations recommended on the Creative website, no joy.  Called Creative support and after going through giving them all their requested information as well as telling them all the things I'd tried, my cell phone dropped the call.  But guess what - as soon as I hit the redial button, I got the "we've gone home" message (just after 6pm Oklahoma time).  So, I don't know yet what to say about the product reliability or the helpfulness of thier support staff - I'm hoping for the best, since feature/function-wise this was the pick of the crop and my wife really liked it.  I'll update this when I have a resolution.

<Title>Why people buy Ipods?.
<Date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a mp3 player user since 1998, when you had to assemble your mp3 playerusing PC parts, then I bought the first Rio player, the first creative, the first archos, the first Ipod.   This is the best deal ever in a mp3 player.  The sound is outstanding betas the Ipod 10 to 1.  The use is so easy and flexible adaptable to what you really need.  I adujsted the menu to show only the functions I use. The browsing of artist, album using the letter at the right of screen is exactly what I need.  I  am creating a library of SD cards with my favourite music ( just as I did 20 years ago with cassettes) , so I can selct which 4 GB of musci I will use additional to the 8 GB of the player.  So far, because of my SD cards library, the virtual capacity of my ZEN is 36 GB, soon I expect I will have my complete colletion of mp3 in SD cards, classified as I want.   The quelaity and color of the videos and pictures is the best in the market, but the screen is too small to me.

<Title>creative zen review
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i bought the creative zen 8GB mp3 player recently. i love the fm radio feature. the stations come in surprisingly clear most of the time. the battery lasts a pretty good amount also. good sound quality. i really like the earbuds that came with it. very small and light. holds about 1600 songs if there aren't any videos/pictures on it. but has room for additional memory card if wanted. i also like that it is compatible with napster. very convenient. but you have to sync up to the computer every couple of days to update. (small drawback) the only thing that i don't like too much about this product is the fact it sometimes turns off unexpectedly and for no reason. it doeasn't happen all that often but it's still irritating. overall, though, i think this was a very good buy. i would definately recommend this little guy.

<Title>Very Good player
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had read reviews about problems with battery life and freezing, but I also read very good reviews so I was scared if the player would be bad or good. But after it came, I charged it for 4 hours before first my first use. It was automatically a hit for me. Very good player. pro- sound quality!, design, screen, interface, size, sd card, battery has been above 90 for the last two days of use ( not continuous!)  con-back light turns off only after hold, cant add to playlist, but you can make them.  PS. other people said it froze on them, I have the same firmware. It only froze once, my fault, when I was installing the software AND adding songs when I abruptly disconnected the player.

<Title>Good Sound - carry a paper clip. 
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My new Creative Zen (8gb) sounds great with other earphones. Updating the firmware was quite easy to do - download the program from the Creative site, attach the Zen to the computer via the USB cable and run the program. Easy. Adding music was quite easy - I used Windows Explorer. Then I tried using the SD card to play music. I was able to do so. However, I accessed the menu system while playing an MP3 from the SD card. The system locked up requiring me to find a paper clip to stick in the reset hole. Now I am leery of using the SD card unless I have with me an object to push the reset button. Locking up the player during my first 5 minutes of use is not a good sign.

<Title>Few flaws, many pros
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>IMPORTANT NOTES FIRST:  YES, it is iTunes-compatible, and YES it is compatible with Yahoo! Jukebox, BUT ONLY THOSE TRACKS THAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED AS "BURNABLE". In other words, you will not be able to transfer your Subscription or Stream tracks to this device, which is only fair (for that, you have to have Yahoo! Music Unlimited To-Go, which is an invite-based service and thus uncommon). Needless to say, you can import tracks from any CD quickly and painlessly, and/or copy any wmv/mp3/mp4 or whatever that you already have on your hard drive: the device is browsable with Windows and all you need to do is copy/paste to the right folder.  Now for the review.   THE GOOD:  ++ Compatible with an amazing variety of file formats, without conversion, unlike iPods. Whatever is not compatible the software will convert for you if at all possible. This is a HUGE plus for the computer-illiterate.  ++ Great sound quality, a bare minimum requirement for a music player.  ++ Sleek looks, IMO superior to the trite iPod-like, spin-wheel design. It certainly got more looks and comments than the iPod I had previously. Also, it's more pleasant to hold in your hand: small but not too tiny, and very sturdy/solid (which, if you'll handle it 8-10 hours a day like I do, is a huge plus).  ++ The included software is fantastic. It's fast, reliable (never froze), and lets you manage files and create playlists quickly and painlessly. Basically, anything you can do with the player's built-in software you can do with ZEN Media Explorer from your computer. So, go for it.  ++ Many complained about the interface, but I actually like it very much. The built-in software is easy to understand and utilize. The buttons are a tad tricky, but all you need to do is play around with them for ten minutes before you're able to find them blindly by just sticking your hand in your pocket (something you certainly cannot do with iPods, whose interface is more visually-driven).   THE SO-SO:  ++/-- The SD expansion slot is both a pain and a pleasure. Yes, you can basically make this a 16Gb with an SDHC card for a few bucks--but it's true that only SOME content will run off of it, and that while you are playing content from the SD card you cannot navigate the built-in flash memory. So, caveat emptor... but if you know what you're getting there's no reason to complain. How many times do you really browse your music while you're already listening to something else anyway?   THE BAD:  -- Perplexed about battery life info: "25 hours of continuous listening"? I don't think so. More like 10-12, which is on par with similar devices.  -- The shortest USB cable ever bundled. Buy a cheapo extension from Monoprice right away, unless you already own a USB hub. Otherwise, your player will lie on the floor or, worse, hang by the cable while it's being charged and sync'ed, neither of which is good.  -- The joystick buttons make a slightly annoying clicking sound, not when pressed but when released. However, this does not happen on my friend's ZEN, so maybe I got a "bad" unit?  -- AWFUL packaging! What were they thinking? Not only is it one of those impossible-to-open blister packs, but if you use scissors it's relatively easy to harm the contents... not the player, thankfully, which is in full sight, but the manuals and CD and bundled cables. So be careful.   OTHER THOUGHTS:  ** BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR! Apply it immediately. The screen will collect dust (and thus scratches) within hours, like any LCD. ** BUY A CASE OR SKIN! Piano-black finish is attracted to fingerprints like flies to s__t. ** 8Gb is perfect for the serious music listener with varied taste. Buffs and pros want to go for 16Gb. Occasional listeners will do well with 4Gb. Media moguls, of course, need not apply: that's what the Vision is for.   Overall, one of the best entry-level portable music players on the market. The price tag may well be the deal-breaker here: it is cheaper than any other brand music player, and it does the same things AND, in my opinion, more and better. Support by Creative is also famously good, so I see no reason not to buy a ZEN.

<Title>Good when it is working
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen is a very good mp3 and video player.  You have to convert every video to 320x240 wmv format, which takes as long as the video length to convert.  My main qualm with the player is that it has a penchant for restarting sometimes when it is attached to my computer.  One time it turned itself off when it was charging and subsequently never turned back on (it had basically a full battery).  Pushing reset of the power button yielded no result.  So I sent it back to Creative and got a "new" one.  This "new" one had the battery warning on the back in French (it came from the RMA facility in Stillwater, OK).  The day after I got it back, I (stupidly) decided that it would be a good idea to update the firmware.  Upon restarting for the upgrade, the player got to a state from which it has not returned.  Upon startup, it displays the initial creative screen and subsequently goes blank.  There is supposed to be another Zen screen followed by the ability to actually use the player.  In other words, it does not turn on again and is unusable.  I have not seen any real difference between the firmware versions on the player (I have updated it many times).  My advice would be to stick with the version you have.

<Title>The reviews aren't exaggerating, unfortunately
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The reviews aren't exaggerating.  I consider myself rather tech savvy and thought that perhaps the bad reviews were from people who didn't really know how to be careful with complicated hardware.  But I was wrong.  This is a beautiful player with a lot going for it, except for the fact that it's extremely buggy.  The first one I received had the "white screen" bug -- it started at white screen right out of the box, nothing I did could make the display change, and Creative was completely unable to fix the error.  I sent it back (to Amazon -- see my postcript below), and received another one.  The second works much better than the first, but goes to white screen when I "lock" and then "unlock" it again.  I have to turn off the player, then restart it to reset the display.  Bottom line: I really want to like this player -- enough that I will try it a bit longer and wait for one more firmware update (if it arrives).  But it sounds like many of the problems are hardware rather than firmware.  I fear that it's a lemon, which is disappointing.  Purchase with caution.  P.S. Five Stars for Amazon's customer service!!  It's so nice to know that I have protection from getting burned by Creative's manufacturing problems -- something that will keep me coming back to Amazon as a regular electronics customer.  ***UPDATE*** And it's not good news: 24 hours later, I try it out again, and it won't play music.  It just freezes.  Not good, Creative Labs.  Not good at all.  I will give it 48 hours -- if there is not a firmware upgrade in that time, I'm back to Ipods.  Man, I really want to like this player, too.

<Title>disappointed
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, I purchased the Zen (8gb)from Amazon. Their service has always been outstanding. I feel that Creative didn't make a good player because I had to return the replaced Zen because it also stopped working. The first one stopped responding while I was trying to charge it for the first time. The second unit broke in two weeks. Both had the same problem: little blue light on the power switch comes on, and the screen does not turn on. I researched a lot before buying this product. Too bad it's got problems. I would buy it again if I could finally get a non-defective product.

<Content>I bought this because it had the exact options I wanted in the price range I wanted.  The reviews looked good and the problems with locking up seemed to be few and far between.  I was wrong.  I received the ZEN and, after charging for 4.5 hours, I started loading music into it.  As soon as it finished loading, it shut itself off and never restarted.  I've now returned it and went with the Ipod because of it's better reputation for reliability.

<Title>My best effort for a comprehensive review
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, I'll try and be as comprehensive and thorough as I can be.  I've got the 8gb Zen and I've had it for about a month and a half now.  Currently, I'm using the 1.13.01 firmware and that clear case with key ring that Creative sells.  Given that this is a music player first and foremost, audio quality is priority number one.  While I do not consider myself an audiophile, sound quality is nevertheless important to me.  The Zen comes out with honors here.  The sound right out of the box is fantastic.  However, it can get even better with the equalizer and sound options.  Hey, after all, Creative has just a little experience with computers and audio equipment and they get it really right here.    I've listened to other players that are on the market and I must say that I believe that the Zen is near the top if not at the top in terms of sound quality.  Also, there is talk that they will be introducing X-FI to their players which is just going to put them head and shoulders above the rest.  Battery life has improved.  Initially I was not getting the advertised 20 to 25 hours playtime, but with the firmware updates, this has improved greatly.  Not sure if it's at 20 right now, but its acceptable.  The Zen easily gets me through a couple of days before needing to be recharged.  The included USB cable is, uhm, convenient if you are traveling and using your laptop?  Maybe?  Fortunately, Creative is not using proprietary stuff here and I just switched out that USB cable for a longer one that I already had and I'm doing just fine.  There are actually two schools of thought with how Creative implemented the SD Card and I've become somewhat on the fence with this.  First, I know that a lot of people would like to see the SD Card fully integrated (which is where I was), not all features are available for the SD Card.  However, as a portable flash drive, it is great!  Drag and drop with no hassles with the ability to still use it as extra storage for videos and music.  And if 4gb, 8gb, or 16gb is not enough for you, just wait.  Creative is coming out with a 32gb - don't know when though.  The other features are nice and I can't complain really about any of them.  There's a FM radio, Calendar, Clock, Organizer, Contacts List, Microphone and plenty of customizable options.  I just wish it could work better as a PDA (alarm and modify daily tasks) and then I would be completely satisfied!  But hey, I got this for playing music not as an organizer.  The included software is really easy to use.  Drag and Drop if ya want!  The video converter works well, but may take a while to convert your video to an acceptable format.  I just watched Battlestar Galactica: Razor on my Zen and it looked and sounded great!  However it took over an hour to convert and put it on my player.  There are other programs to use.  All in all, I have been more than happy with my Zen.  Great, size and looks and sound quality is top notch with some nice features added on.  There are somethings I would improve, but those do not keep me from enjoying my player.  It does everything I ask of it.  I highly recommend this one.  If you are considering the Apple Nano, take a look around.  There's a reason the Apple Fan Bois are squirming.  There are better options around and this is one of them.  Lastly, just remember, get your hands on one and decide for yourself.  The vast majority of people that are happy with something are not going to come to the forums to brag about it.  That kind of distorts the image more than just a little.  There have been bumps in the road, but Creative is really good at fixing stuff and I'm sure whomever wanted to rush this out in time for Black Friday and all that stuff has been fired...

<Title>Main memory can't hold many small photos but SD can
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In general I like the player. Works well for music and videos and you can fill up the full memory with these type of files.  For me, I wanted my Zen 8 GB to hold tens of thousands of photos of small photos. I found out you cannot do this! If you use small photos (say 640x400), they typically take less than 100 KB space each. On a 8 GB unit, you should be able to hold somewhere around 80,000 photos (give or take). But I found that the unit could only hold 8,000 to 9,000 photos before complaining it had INSUFFICIENT memory. This is despite the fact that the Zen (and the provided PC software) says the unit STILL HAS MORE THAN 6 GB FREE MEMORY! With many small photos, my 6 GB "free memory" also CANNOT be used to store any music! So, if you load lots of small photos, you cannot use anywhere near the units memory capacity!  If you use high-resolution larger photos (a few MB each) you CAN fill up the entire 8 GB of memory with photos but who need giant photos on a small screen (i.e., it is useless). Also, you can only put a few thousand large photos on the unit and I want TENS of thousands.  After about 4 rounds of Creative tech support, I gave up trying to get these photos in main memory. Tech support claims there is NO LIMIT to the number of files or folders that can be placed on the machine and that many people are putting this many files on their machine. I went through numerous rounds reloading firmware, formatting, clearing memory etc., but the results did not change.  If there is even ONE person using the Zen 8 GB for tens of thousands of photos (and using all of the main memory) let me know by writing your own review. Maybe my unit is defective, but I honestly think there is some kind of design problem limiting the number of photos if they are small.  Next, thank goodness for the SD/SDHC card slot! I am VERY GLAD it does NOT integrate with the main memory, because the SD card CAN hold as many photos as I want, limited only to the maximum memory of the card. If the SD card was integrated into the main memory system, it too would probably be of very limited use to me.  For someone wanting zillions of music files, it would of course be better to have the SD memory look like the main memory. To each his own :)  A nice firmware upgrade would let the user be able to choose whether to use the SD slot as it is now OR to extend the main units memory and be able to use all the nice features that entails.  For those that don't know, files stored on the SD slot cannot use all the nice features that are available to files stored in main memory.

<Title>MUCH Better than the Microphoto!!!!
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to have a MicroPhoto Zen 8 GB but it was stolen so I replaced it with this. This is so much better and easier to use! Navigating the player is intuitive and you really don't need to read the manual to understand how it works. The sound quality is amazing and I really love that I can expand the memory with an SD card.  The battery life is not spectacular and the face scratches easily, so I suggest you get a case to protect the face and a spare backup battery if you know you're gonna be using this a lot. Also, if you leave it plugged into your computer for too long, it may freeze up but that's what the RESET button is for.  In all, a very good product!

<Content>an excellent media player, if you have the time for it. i am one of those people who likes the convenience of itunes and how its so user friendly. the  transition from an ipod to the zen was a painful process im afraid. the problems are not limited to that of the Player, in fact my problems lie almost Entirely with the software that must be used to transfer music to The player.  Creating playlists is not what it used To be with itunes where one can just drag a song to the list. now you must find the file on your computer, make sure its not protected, then see if the file Is supported on the player. the video converter is decent however time consuming but it doesnt Support real player files!!! this devastated me due to my collection tv shows in real player format, so unless you want to Spend an extra 30 to 40 $ on a shrink program due to all Your real player files, dont buy this player. i also cannot put music files that have been bought from itunes music store because they Are 'protected'. this Fact is extremely depressing because a Large amount of people out There are buying Loads of itunes files under the impression That they can use them on other music players.  much of the unfortunate things that have occured might be easily Solved, however not being a very patient person, i couldnt find the various solutions.

<Title>Awesome MP3
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I especially like the ease of navigation, the size, and the ease of loading files.  I use it to listen to recorded books while driving in the car. I use a cassete tape adapter connected to the headphone port. It is compatable with downloaded books from my local library, and books loaded from CD's. It was the only unit I found to use SD memory chips which I use to store books. What a fun way to carry around my favorite pictures of my grand children. I am still learning about other features and uses.

<Title>The Good Outweighs The Bad
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just received this product refurbished yesterday and so far, I am very satisfied with it. I will update this review as necessary (some of the experienced problems may not arise until a few weeks into use). There are many reviews that report freezing, but these issues seem to have been alleviated with the later shipments of the Zen and the firmware updates. So far, I am very satisfied.  The Good -size: credit card sized, light weight -performance: excellent quality audio and visual output -software/interface: both very easy to use -battery life: almost as long as advertised -problems so far: none  The Bad -software/interface: converting video takes a little time  ---  Three Week Update  -no freezes, no news, that's good news

<Title>Good MP3 player in small package
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Small & beautiful Mp3 player. I had initial jitters as it did not power on. Then I was able to use the Charger of Motorola Bluetooth headset charger for charging this device overnight. After that this has been a great MP3 player. I need to use the PC for creating all the playlists. The free audiobooks was not a good option.  I am happy with the MP3 player. I was able to convert some videos to wmv format with Zen organiser & my wife saw the movie in the player.  We are happy with the player now.

<Title>Good product, bad software
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The overall product is fine, but the software that supports the player is not strong enough to perform its functions.  I would not recommend purchasing this product until Creative solves the software problem.  This player is relatively inexpensive in comparison with other players, so if you are software savvy and have the patience to deal with frozen screens and constant resetting, then this could still be a good option for you.

<Title>Full of Features But Has A Major Flaw
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>About a month ago, I decided to buy a MP3 player. I'm a college student who is very tech savvy and wanted something very portable, and after much research I bought the Creative Zen 8GB because of it's immense features and beautiful screen. However, the honeymoon did not last long.  The Creative Zen does give a lot of bang for your buck. It's relatively cheaper than the competition and comes with FM Radio, voice recording, and has a beautiful 2.5 inch screen for video viewing. The audio quality is extremely good and you can even customize the equalizer. The Zen is highly configurable, as you can reorder your menus and it even has a programmable shortcut button so you can go straight to your playlist, your videos, or even the date and clock.  But the Zen has major flaws, specifically with Microsoft Windows Vista. I run Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate on my Dell laptop, and I prefer to use Windows Media Player 11 to sync with my music since the bundled Creative Music software is, to say the least, primitive and ugly. At first, the Zen works fine: I synced all my music with great ease and the album art transferred over. However, after multiple syncs, the Zen would occasionally lock up and turn black.   As other reviewers have noted as well as many other frustrated customers in forums, the Zen has a major syncing problem with Windows Media Player. Although this can simply be solved by resetting the device, it becomes cumbersome to constantly restart your device everytime you connect it to the PC. Another proposed solution is to stick with the Creative software, but it feels outdated compared to the simple Itunes or the sleek Windows Media Player.   On top of the Vista problems, the Creative support is laughable. The website does not even acknowledge the problem, let alone provide a solution. Despite the software and firmware updates, the Zen still does not function well. I tried every solution, from using the recovery option to formatting my Zen to reloading my firmware and nothing worked. In many forums, the Zen in general has many problems, not including the sync problem.  You may say that I'm extremely picky, giving a score 2 stars just because of the Windows Media Player. But I had high expectations, and after owning an Ipod before this (which gave me absolutely no headaches), I have come to a conclusion that this product isn't worth the hassle. The player itself is a treat; the shoddy software and its incompatibility with an universal program such as WMP is unacceptable. After a month of using the Zen, I plan on returning the player soon.

<Title>Creative Zen MP3
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first MP3 player. I wanted something to take on trips and use at the gym.  The software is easy to use and I copied CDs in a matter of minutes.  The sound is great (although I am using different ear phones than what came with the player).  The size is good for me; it is small enough, but not too small.  I purchased a separate accessory package that includes chargers, cases and screen cover to protect the player.  So far I am very pleased with the Zen.

<Title>Better than iPod?
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my mom, therefore I just spent a few hours teaching her to rip cds, and sync music.    I have owned three iPods (a nano, a video, and an original one).  This is a more feature-packed device than any of my ipods.  For many, it will be a better choice.  Features: Zen beats iPod in the features department.  The screen is better than the one on the new Nano (same resolution, but larger).  The display eye-candy factor is better.  It includes a very good recorder and a strong FM tuner, which are missing completely in the ipod.  Accessoies: The zen doesn't even offer a dock.  iPod kills zen in the useful accessories competition.  You can get any imaginable accessory for iPod.  If you want a player to do more than drive your headphones, don't get the zen.  Ease of use: Ipod gains an edge here.  Both are easy, but ipod is easier.  Ipod will probably always win this battle because itunes is very good software.  Podcast options in itunes are easier.  Options like picking playlists and videos are easier in itunes.  The itunes store is far superior (although I prefer to buy most music on discs).  I had a couple crashes when initially setting up the zen due to conflicts with WMP trying to access the player at the same time as the Creative update software.  I had to soft reset the device twice while messing around with it.  This kind of thing doesn't happen with iPods because iTunes does it all, and it is designed for iPod.  Zen relies on compatibility with WMP, which is not Creative brand software.  Because I bought this as a gift for an older person (my mom is almost 60), if I made the purchase again I would buy the ipod nano.    Form factor / controls: Ipod has a slight edge here too.  The click wheel is a lot easier to use than the 5-way nav + play button + menu button + up button on the zen.  Ipod is slightly more pocketable.  The zen is quite a bit larger, but both are so tiny and pocketable that it hardly makes a difference.  Price: Zen is widely available for about 25% less than the iPod.    Conclusion: If you want a super-easy to use, super slick device: iPod is the best choice.  If you are less tech savy and computer software drives you nuts, ipod wins again.  If you want a richly featured device and are willing to put up with slightly awkward desktop software, the Zen is the way to go.  If I buy another player, I think this one would win for me because the FM radio and recorder would be very useful, and I am patient with computer hickups.  As a gift for my mom, I wish I had bought her the iPod.

<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I charged it fully and installed the software before attempting to use.  When I plugged it in to the PC upon prompting from the install software, it briefly brought up a screen asking to update firmware or clear the memory.  However, it was frozen on that screen.  The screen then went black and now I  can't turn it on at all, whether or not it's plugged into the pc.  Seems like it would be nice if it worked.

<Title>Great iPod alternative
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, what a great player! Easy navigation, great looking video, great sound quality, and easy setup. I find the screen to be far superior to the iPod's screen and the feel is very comfortable.  I would recommend buying headphones. The ones that come with it are pretty useless. The USB cable that comes with it is also very, very short (maybe a inch and a half long). Since this is the only method of charging the Zen, without purchasing a third party adaptor, I would recommend getting a longer USB cable or power adaptor.  At first everything went fine. Then I got a message telling me that there was a firmware problem. I e-mailed create, and they answered the next day and resolved the problem. Since then the player has been flawless.   I love the fact that you can use any software to get your music and video from, personally I don't care for iTunes. I love the recording and FM tuner and the programmable button. it makes life very easy. You can also use Windows Media Player to Sync.

<Title>Not bad! As long as its not defective
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was really nervous about buying this after seeing all the people who got defective units. Mine isnt perfect, but it is better than most.   When I first used it, it froze twice within the first five minutes which freaked me out. I reset it and it worked okay after it. Ive had it for over a week now and have only had to reset it 4 times (2 after uploading music). Now im not saying this is good, but it isnt enough to make me cry (yet).   THE ACTUAL PLAYER This thing is SMALL, and LIGHT, more so than it looks in the pictures, but in the good way. The screen is bright and colorful, and i like that you can change the wallpaper. Coming from apples click wheel, there is nothing better or easier, but the 5way button pad does a good enough job.   Complaints 1. After you select an artist it doesnt let you bypass the album screen. this bothers me for several reasons. 1. you cant see a list of all the artists' songs. 2. if you dont know which album an artists song is on, its a pain to find. 3. if you have songs by an artist that arent labeled under an album, you wont be able to find that song unless NONE of the songs by that artist have album names with them.  2. I dont like that the buttons ont have backlights. You cant see them at night (the screen doesnt light them up either) so you have to feel around and sometimes press a wrong button  3. It takes too many clicks from the main menu to get to a song  4. No fm recording  5. The the data on the sd card slot is seperate from the main menu. this is a BIG p.i.t.a. but I only have movies on the sd which reduces the annoyance  6. The clock always sets itself at an incorrect time.  DEFINITELY not perfect, but if you get a functional one and can deal with the above issues then it really is a neat little mp3 player

The cretive website troubleshooter determined that the unit must be sent back for repair. Because I purchased this device online, I could not take it back for an exchange as I would have been able to with a brick and mortar store. So I had to box it up and pay the postage to ship it back. Who knows how long it will be when I receive it back. Bottom Line... Very Disappointed.

<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I don't buy electronics without doing my homework.  I have been buying Creative Labs MP3 players for several years, since they were more the size of graphing calculators.  My 22 year old has had one for 5 or 6 years now and still loves it despite it's bulkiness.  I bought my daughter her first one last year, 1 GB and so tiny I was afraid it would be lost immediately.  She loved hers as well, with the exception that in fact, it held about 350 songs and for some strange reason that isn't enough!  She wanted an IPOD for music only but recognizing they were wildly expensive she said she would buy it herself after Christmas.  Not content to let her waste her money, I researched and found this honey.  All the major reviewers loved the Zen 8 GB, both for its sound, its video and its style.  I debated between this and the 16 GB but the latter was difficult to find, and since she told me she didn't care about video AND it accepts SD Cards for expansion, I settled on this.  She is completely agog over this machine.  She has well over 1000 songs, the latest Harry Potter film downloaded and two Harry Potter audio books download and there is still more than 1.5 GBs.  She intends to take the books off and put them onto SD cards for long trips in the car.  The picture quality and clarity is absolutely remarkable, and while the ear phones that come with the machine aren't great, as my 27 year old said after listening to it, the sound is darn good even with a cheap pair of earphones.  It was worth every penny and is such an amazing alternative to an IPOD.

<Title>too many bugs
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So I got his about a month ago and it worked alright. There were certain songs that when played would cause the player to freeze and I'd have to restart it which was a pain. The weird thing was that only certain songs caused the player to freeze, these songs had been purchased from the online wal-mart store adn were WMA formated. go figure. So then one day I was installing a firmware upgrade and because the USB cable was so short I had to rig something on the back of my comp. for it to sit on, but unfortunately the player fell off and the cord came out mid-installing. now whenever I turnit on it instantly freezes no matter what. Im so sick of dealing with all the bugs on this system. Also i had about 1700 songs on it and going trhough them all with the little buttons was a PAIN!

<Title>Much research and Creative fan
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After much research and being a Creative buyer for a long time, I decided on the Creative Zen 8gb.  I was looking for something compatible that had enough memory to use for music, photos and videos.  I also liked the ability to use a memory card.  I had a Zen V Plus 4gb and the new Zen is so much better.  The screen is bigger and brighter and the controls are so easy to use. I would recommend that you buy the Creative charger with it.  I tried many other chargers that claimed they worked but didn't and wound up wasting my money and throwing them away.  I bought some Creative speakers (I-Trigue 200) and use these at work (they sound great) and the unit can play for 16 hours without a recharge. I also bought the PCMICROSTORE Zen Snap-On Crystal Protective Case Cover, the ZEN Clear Case, a Case Logic Large Pocket, the Zen armband (for jogging) and the Koss KSC22 DVD Sportclip Headphones.  The PC Micro case fit perfectly, is thick enough to protect the unit and has cutouts for access to all controls. If it had a lanyard with it it'd be perfect. The Zen clear case is good too, but you can't plug in the speakers when it's in the Zen clear case, although you don't have any problems with the headphones.  The Case Logic Pocket is neoprene and has a great lanyard which I took off and put on the Zen case and it works great.  I carry the unit back and forth to work in the Pocket and can use either one around the neck, I would highly recommend both.  I don't like ear buds (and the ones that come with the unit aren't that good) therefore the Koss headphones.  I also put a screen protector on the screen after reading some of the other reviews.  In summary if you're buying this unit you need to consider the additional costs of a case, screen protector, charger, headphones and for exercisers, the armband.  I would recommend all and am very happy and satisfied with my Zen.

<Title>Faulty product - buyer beware.
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was foolishly an "early adopter" of the product, purchasing one in September 2007.  I have perpetually had the following problems:  Freezes most of the time when playing video; Fails on firmware updates; Fails when transferring media; White screen (locks up) when booting, and resetting it does not fix the problem; Battery life is A LOT less than advertised.  I have tried everything suggested on their support site, many times, with no success.  I have given this thing more chances than I should have and am finally sending it back for replacement.  However, I am not optimistic that the replacement will work any differently, as I am convinced that it is flawed in design.  I am not the only one to have these problems. I strongly suggest you check the forums on the Creative Labs site before you buy.

<Title>So far so good. (30 days out)
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Overall, I am VERY pleased with this product. It lives up to its ideal of Zen-like simplicity, much like Apple's minimalist approach. The navigation and feature set is a pleasure for viewing music and video. My only point of disappointment has been in its handling of some video. I rip video to .avi (divx compatible format) using FairUseWizard Light, and the Zen handles it fine. However, longer form movies and TV shows go out of sync (audio / video) after a while. I've remedied this by running avi's through AVI Splitter, a freeware app that lets me break it up into smaller pieces (I set them to 15-20 minute pieces) so there isn't enough length for the sync problem to exhibit itself. I'll experiment with the zen's preferred format, which is WMV conversion and see if sync is better. But I mention this issue because .avi is popular. I bought a silicone skin 3-pack, which gives nice shock absorption and protection, but picks up dust. Also recommend a transparent screen protector - the clear sticker kind - for total protection from scratches on the viewing area.

<Title>A few annoyances
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have now had the Creative Zen for about a month.    What I like about the Zen:  (1)its looks (very stylish and "with the times") (2)the screen (clear!) (3)the sound (crisp) (4)the size (perfect).  (5)the alarm (it turns the player on automatically at your set time) .. but no snooze. (6)the ability to drap & drop  However, there are two annoyances that I have found with it that make me give it only 3 stars -- an "average" rating.    (1) it does not have resume play.  So when the Zen turns off, so does the place you were at in your music.  ESPECIALLY if you are in shuffle.  It turns back on a completely different song, in a random place.  I don't like this, because when I'm in my car, when I leave and come back, I want to continue listening to what was just on, more like a CD.  (2) it tends to freeze A LOT when importing music and syncing.  I have had to push the restart button at least 50% of the time I am loading new content.  It doesn't get rid of anything when it has to be restarted, but it's a pain to have it constantly freeze and then have to restart it.  Because of these two issues, I am not sure if I would recommend the Zen to anyone.

<Title>Not good enough
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for 200 dollars when it first came out. The first one was a lemon, returned for an exchange to give it a second chance. The bottom line is that creative software sucks. I hate itunes, which is why i got this. But the software is abysmal for this. Creating playlists on computer is a hassle, you have to browse your folders by album title to find the songs. 5 min ago i was adding songs to a playlist, but it wasn't saved, so when i went to look at another playlist, all the songs were lost. Should have asked me to save first, since the "ok" button at the bottom didnt at first to appear to be the save button. Incredibly flawed. Firmware updates practically every 2 weeks(slowing down now) in which some dont finish installing, forcing you to reset the player. Like i said, the software is horrible, with features that barely surpass drag and drop, in fact it would be easier if i could just use explorer to add files manually- thats how pathetic it is. Creative definitely has the resources to include decent software for this by now, and they have just not come through. I don't recommend this. The player itself is slick and has a nice screen, but there are definitely players out there that make putting music on your player less of a chore. Until creative finds some intelligent programmers to replace the amateurs  that they have now, i would look elsewhere.

<Content>This is a great product by Creative especially if you know how to use the EQ. Headphones are adequate,the screen is the best for the price point I watched 30 Days of Night and it was Bangin. I use it mostly in the Gym  where you need something to take your mind off of everything while you work out.

<Title>Does everything: tiny yet packed
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got my Creative Zen this week, and have been nothing but impressed. It is a sleek, solidly built player. The #1 thing to me is audio quality, and the Zen is a Ten there. I've been using an iAudio U2, and it sounded great; way better than my daughter's Nano. This is just as good if not better.   What I was looking for in a player: First, good sound. Second, good battery life. Third, a nice screen for video and photos. I was tempted by the iAudio 7, because of that great battery life and my knowledge of their sound quality. But they're irrelevant in terms of video. The Clix is highly thought of by the techie sites, but it is weak in terms of space (still waiting on the 8 GB) and display (2.2 inches vs. the 2.5 of the Zen). So as a confirmed Apple apostate, when I saw the Zen, with its awesome audio, brilliant video, and SD slot, I knew it was "the one".   It seems a little odd to me that a player can claim to "support" multiple video formats, yet I have to convert almost all of them. And the Zen software seems to convert everything to WMV. But I guess that is just the normal fallout of all these format wars. I have yet to find a video or audio format (including audiobooks .aa, which I haven't seen mentioned as specifically suppported) that I can't (eventually) get on the Zen. And the bottom line: the video looks vivid, the audio sounds awesome.   I synched up with Windows Media Player, cuz I'm used to it. It mostly worked, but there was some weirdness; songs that appeared under an artist, correctly, didn't appear under that artist's album. I assume that synching with the Zen Media Explorer would work better. But with the ability to drag-and-drop, or even delete and create folders, directly from Windows Explorer, these glitches are easily fixed.   The key to me is the SDHC slot. With SD cards gaining in capacity and dropping in price, this seems like the future to me. I'm betting the next generation iPod will jump on this bandwagon. I've seen complaints about the SD-card implementation, which sees the card as sort-of a separate device. But I actually like browsing on the card BETTER than elsewhere, because I can structure things there like I want. If you know how to create a folder, and drag things into it, you won't have a problem. Just keep it simple: a Music and a Videos folder, and only WMA/V and MP3. I can see monster "playlists" of video and music, organized by cheap, tiny SD cards. The ultimate in modular expandability.   It is a bit slow to boot up, but that is minor, to me. The battery life is average. But it's easy for the Cowon iAudio 7, with a screen half the Zen's size, to have that awesome battery life. A brilliant, color-rich screen like the Zen possesses must come with a cost.   In sum: This is an awesome player--well-built, feature-packed, with unlimited SD capacity.  P.S.  Works great so far with Amazon Unbox. The video is very good, the audio has a little crackle-and-pop; but overall, not bad at all, and easy to load. (No conversion necessary, although Unbox doesn't yet list the Creative Zen as an approved player.) However, the .amzn files aren't recognized on the Zen's SD card--easily worked around.

<Title>If you have iTunes, this is for you
<Date>Mon Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently sold my iPod Video 30GB because iTunes has always been buggy for me and I had to purchase a separate Video Converter, just to watch my videos on the small screen. Most of the time my Divx or MPG files cannot be converted properly into the Apple video file. The video will either be all green or blank. What a shame.  Also Hard Drives are a thing of the past. Flash Memory is definitely the way to go. With Flash Memory, there is a less chance of failure or bad sectors on the hard drive.  I have decided with Creative because of their easy usage of copying Music files into the player via USB. Creative has their own "ZEN Explorer", which allows you to drag and drop files. Very easy. No hassles or waiting for iTunes to run or crash.  The Creative Zen program also comes with a Video Converter for FREE. Of course it converts the movie file to WMV, which you can choose from Normal, Good, or Best quality. You can transfer the file directly to the ZEN player or you can copy the WMV files to a SD card and play videos from there.  I have tested a 2GB Mini SD Card, 1GB Micro SD Card, & 4GB SD Cards. All works great and easy to remove and swap. Removable SD Cards!!! Everyone has SD Cards now a days.  I am truly impressed with this player and charging the player from my car and at home is flawless.  After many months of searching for the next MP3 player (Samsung, iPod Nano, iRiver, etc... ), this is definitely worth the money I paid.   So if you have problems with iTunes and do not want to go crazy for iPods, then this MP3 + Video is definitely for you.  Good luck in your search for your next Music player.

<Title>Compact, great sound
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>One week, and little time to explore the Zen's various functions. But I immediately filled it with songs. About 1,700 mp3 files left me with around 500 mb of memory remaining. The sound is much better than my old Dell MP3 player and better than my wife's Ipod Nano. The display is the best I've seen -- like you're holding a tiny HDTV in your hand. I feel it was a great deal for $199. Battery life is great, but I'm only listening to songs -- no video yet.  CONS (minor, really): 1)Slow to boot up (oh well). 2)The included software CD took nearly an hour to download (my computer is by no means slow), and dumped more than 100 mb of stuff onto my hard drive, including FOUR new desktop icons. I have no clue what any of it is. All I wanted was music, and to load mp3s I simply dragged and dropped the files from my hard-drive to the player. They moved quickly and quietly. So what's with all the software? 3) The Zen comes crammed with about 75 needless (yet quite vivid) sample photos and several strange songs. I killed them all to free up memory. 4) The USB cable to connect the player to your computer is not even 5 inches long. My computer sits on the floor, so my Zen would have to sit on the floor, too. I decided to use my old Dell cable instead. It's 4-feet long. 5) The FM radio is a nice touch, but as far as I can tell it only self-programs stations by scanning the dial for strong signals. I'd like to be able to manually program stations into the presets. Maybe I missed that function.  Cons notwithstanding, I love the new Zen already and look forward to using it for photos and video.

The Zen is smaller than I expected and the screen just looks great, bright colors, nice interface, excellent sound quality, easy to use... the only thing I regret is not getting the 16gb :(  I'm glad I didn't get the iPod..

<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the ZEN a couple of days ago and am completely impressed.  I have had a couple of others (Zen V Plus - stopped working and Sansa Connect which had poor battery life and slow response) but I like the ZEN so much that it prompted me to review it.  This is the first thing that I've bought that impressed me enough to rate it on Amazon.  The sound is incredible, plus it works very well with both Rhapsody to go and Yahoo! Unlimited.  It is packed with features too.  The display is bright, colorful and quite vivid.  The only thing that I would rate down on it is the lack of a dedicated volume switch -- but volume can be easily accessed via the "Shortcut" key so I still gave it a 5 because Amazon doesn't allow 4.5.  Besides, the iPod doesn't have a volume switch either.  I don't have an iPod, but from what I've seen this blows it away AND unlike iPod, you can use this with online music services and play iTunes unprotected files!  Definitely worth the money - just buy yourself a good set of earbuds (VModa Vibe is great or if you can afford it the Ultimate Ears Super Fi 5 is superb!).

<Title>Zen may challenge iPod.
<Date>Sat Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Zen soon after it's first availability.  Upon opening the box I was impressed with the simplistic layout of the unit.  The customizable shortcut button is a nice touch.  While not labeled, the unit does have dedicated volume control via the up and down buttons on the d-pad around the center square button. During audio playback, you can view the album art and even change your personal rating of the song in play for creating playlists based on song rating.  The included synchronizing software is easy to use and files quickly transfer to the unit from my laptop.  I have used the video conversion program with mixed success so far.  Thirty minute episodes and music videos transfer easily, but I am currently 1 for 3 on full length movies.  I do believe that WMV or DivX movies at 320x240 will not require conversion.  Sound quality is wonderful and equal to that of an iPod.  I personally prefer the menu layout compared to iPod and others as the menu is completely customizable.  For 8MB of flash memory, being only slightly smaller than a credit card, and the extreme light weight, you CAN NOT beat a Zen.  I would recommend a case fo the Zen.  I am in constant fear of scatching my screen!  BY A ZEN!

<Title>very disappointed
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first ordered this product I had such high hopes for it because it seemed to offer so many features for a reasonable price. I had heard that the SD card did not integrate with the main memory but I was willing to live with that. However the player was riddled with many other problems. First, after I installed the software it would not recognize the player when I connected it to the USB and the problem should not have been with my computer because I downloaded all the updates from Creative. Second, on more than one occasion the player would freeze up and when I tried to turn it off before sending it back to Amazon it would not shut down. I actually had to send it back while the power was still on. Finally, there were a few times when music was playing but the player would not respond to any of the buttons. I could not stop the music or switch back to the menu.      I understand that every manufacturer produces a defective product from time to time but I have read  several other reviews both here on Amazon and over on Cnet that claim similar problems. I don't think I will be giving this player another chance because the odds of getting another defective product seem relatively high.

<Title>Small and Sleek, but SD is designed poorly and does not work as advertised
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item based upon Creative marketing that it worked with Amazon Unboxed, Audible, and the SD card slot would "expand my media library" so that the 8GB core memory would not be a limitation.  Well, Amazon Unboxed and Audible do transfer to the unit and play on the core 8GB memory only, but will not transfer or work from the SD memory slot.  So, if you expect to be able to run protected videos or audible books from the SD card slot, you can forget about it.    Unprotected MP3's do run from the SD card slot, but they are not integrated with the units software for playlists.  So, you have to manual browse folders on the SD card and play one song at a time (no queuing or creating a play list).  The moment you navigate away from the song playing on the SD card to look at the list of other songs, the playing stops.  So there is no browsing through your songs on the SD card while playing a song.  It works, but the SD interface is sloppy.  I talked to Amazon about the issue with the Unboxed videos not playing on the SD card and they said they Unboxed player has to transfer the files to the device.  If the SD memory showed up as part of the core memory, than there would be no problem.  Also, they said if the unit allowed you to copy/cut from the core memory and move/paste it to the SD memory from the device, this would allow the videos to play.  I could not get a response from Creative on this issue after 2 days of phone calls and emails.  I so much wanted this device to be great, and it is so close but the SD card limitations make it really nothing more than an 8GB flash players.  I need more room than that.  I recommend reading the forums on Creative to see the list of complaints about this very problem.  Creative has come out and said they plan NO firmware updates to better integrate the SD card with the core memory or core software to allow protected video or audible to play from the SD memory.  It is a slick, small device that has so much potential, but the SD limitations make it useless for a user with a large video and audible library.  If you only have unprotected audio, than this device will work for you.  Thanks to Amazon's generous return policy, this item is on its way back for a refund since it did not work as advertised.  People are also reporting the Napstet to Go does not work on the SD card slot as well, but I do not have this service to confirm it  I gave it 3 stars, instead of 2 because it does work with the core memory, looks good, is small and lite; but I am very disappointed in what I feel is deceptive advertising from Creative where they hide the limitations and imply that the SD care will offer you an endless media library while working with these paid services.  .

<Title>Great MP3 Player!
<Date>Tue Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have both an iPod (the Mini)and Sansa mp3 players in addition to my new Creative Zen.  I really like the easy operation and intuitive controls of this player over the other two.  The screen resolution is superior to both of my other players and the software is easy to use.  I've paired mine with a set of Shure E500 earphones and the sound is phenomenal.  The Zen definitely sounds beter than either the iPod or the Sansa.  I haven't really used the video function of the Zen yet, so it's hard to comment about that.  However, from the aspect of an mp3 player for music, I couldn't be happier.  I'd recommend it over a Nano any day.

<Title>Great Player!
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think this player is awesome. I've had it just for a little while now but I have not had any issues with it so far and it works great. It does collect finger prints but I don't care much. I like the whole functionality of the player. I've had the RCA H115 for a while now and this is much better, in every way, than the RCA. The screen is beautiful! The colors pop off the screen and the motion of video is smooth with a crisp picture. I like the radio, too. I read that someone said you can only set presets by the auto scan..... not true. If you hit the play button in radio mode, it takes away the preset mode and lets you tune manually so you can set your own stations. I just hit random buttons to figure that one out because I knew Creative was smarter than that. And there are "dedicated" volume buttons while in music, radio, and video mode. Just hit the up, volume up, and down, volume down, buttons while in one of the modes that has audio. I have not used the organizer yet, no need for it so far. The time display is very convenient, my old player didn't have the time and I had to pull my phone out every time I wanted... the time! I have not used the SD slot yet but plan to really soon. I'm gonna put video and pics on the SD and leave the 8 Gigs for music. I don't see why some people are disappointed, its memory expandability! I like that the user can choose what shows up on the menu. The included Creative Zen explorer software is good. The only thing that I don't like is that you can't drag and drop folders into other folders with the "explore media" (I think thats what it's labeled) menu. You have to do it in "removable media" mode. Why is this bad, I did a few CD ripping's and then imported media, with the import media button, of the same artist and tried to put the imported album into the already existing artist's folder and it wouldn't let me. I had to go into the properties, choose the "show as removable media" option and then go back into the player shown as "removable media" and then do it. Sounds like a long process but not too complicated, just a little annoying. Now that I know this, its a lot easier. Hope it helps someone out. So overall for me it's a great media player, function, ease of use, quality, and enjoyability!
