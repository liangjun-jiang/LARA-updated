<Title>Tailor made for lap swimming
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been using my Oregon Scientific MP3 player for a month now (the 512MB version), and I absolutely love it. Swimming laps is now a really fun experience, and the sound quality is great once your ears are submerged. Plus the player is tiny, buoyant and it clips to your swimsuit.  But here's a tip: You must wear a swim cap to keep the earphones stored in your ears. Also, don't bother using the earbuds b/c they drown out the sound (pun intended).  I would advise using the OS player exclusively in the pool. It's not good as an all-purpose MP3 player b/c the bass quality is subpar out of the water.  Plus, uploading songs into the player is more difficult than say an iPod. But all the effort is worth it if you like swimming to music.

<Title>On the bright side, I wasn't electrocuted...
<Date>Sat Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...On the down side, after six months of proper usage, water has seeped in, the display is no longer visible, the unit doesn't work, and the USB plug is rusted.    I was initially pleased with my purchase.  I solved the loose earbud problem by adding Jabra EarGels.  I paid attention to the Oregon Scientific guidelines for the player-surface swimming only, for half an hour, and was careful about a tight seal after charging.  However, after four months, the display had water in it.  The player continued to work for another two months before quitting entirely.  It has taken over six weeks for me hear back from Oregon Scientific on how to send the product back-and there is no guarantee they'll fix it.  So I have switched to an iPod Shuffle and an Otterbox waterproof box.  It's big and bulky, but I'm betting it's a far better investment than another Oregon Scientific product.

<Title>Great waterproof MP3 Player - bad earphone adopters
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great product.  For those who need all the motivation they can get to do their laps and are craving some music, this product will please.  I bought a couple of Speedo waterproof radios a few years back and thier reception went from bad to horrible within a month of use.  The MP3 player allows you to listen to music of your choice underwater, clearly. Loading music is a snap, and the player displays the artist and song in easy to read font.  Like many reviewers have mentioned, the adaptors for the earphones don't stay in your ears as you swim unless you use a swim cap.  I found the swim cap annoying, so I swapped out the waterproof earphone adaptors from my useless Speedo waterproof radio I somehow never threw away -- and voila - the perfect product!!! Now I have to come up with a new excuse not to finish my laps.

<Title>Very disappointed
<Date>Sat Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was very disappointed in this MP3 player since it's the most popular waterproof available.  I followed the instructions, but found water in the screen after two uses & rust-colored water coming out of the holes in the ear buds.  The third time I tried to use it...it wouldn't even power on.  The player is difficult to use because each button performs multiple functions.  Even with the manual in front of me, it's confusing to operate.  The buttons are small and VERY difficult to push.  The water ear buds are uncomfortable & don't stay in place while aqua-jogging.  The screen is hard to read even when it's illuminated.  The clip comes off so easily that it's almost impossible to clip the unit to anything b/c it just pops off.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone for any reason.  Fortunately, I've recieved a full refund from the vendor.  Thanks to the suggestion of another reviewer, I've learned about Otterboxes.  I'll be buying an iPod Nano as soon as Otterbox markets the box to fit!

<Title>Shame on OSI!!!
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Good idea, but a flawed design...and ridiculously poor customer service!  The volume level and sound quality are poor, but it was so great to be able to water walk/dance with my own peppy music mix!  So I kept the unit anyway.  Like other reviewers, I could not tolerate the size of the ear bud covers, so I used the unit without them, being very careful not to get the headphones wet, but one of the headphone speakers blew anyway (it developed a very annoying buzz/rattle).  That was in July, and it's now October.  I have called OSI customer service at least 7 or 8 times in this period, OSI has the worst customer service of any company I've ever dealt with!  They promised twice to send me the replacement headphones, but failed to notify me that they were on backorder, so I had to call back repeatedly.  They told me that they had gotten a shipment of headphones, but they were rusted, so they couldn't send them out.  Since they couldn't get the headphones to me, they finally sent me an RMA to exchange the entire unit.   That was 3-1/2 weeks ago. Last night, I got a package from OSI...I was so excited!  But it the replacement speakers from July, but now I have no unit!  OSI customer service says it'll being going out today, but I have lost all faith in them.  My bottom line recommendation.  Buy this mp3 player at your own risk...and don't expect it to work well, and don't expect any product support for it.

<Content>Unit is easy to program but I have had nothing but problems with the ear-phones from day one. I was sent replacement rubber cups that protect the phones from water but they too come off. This design is not well suited for our ears, much less water, thus it is just a glorified expensive MP3 player and does not perform as advertised, water proof not with those ear-phones SHAME ON YOU O.S. take this unit off the market. I do not recommed this unit as water proof no way !!

<Title>I should have read the reviews
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i am very dissapointed in this product, it seems to be a sturdy little unit and waterproof, so far, but somebody forgot to tell the manufacturer that this thing is supposed to play music.  the supplied headphones are so poor that i cant hear any music or my mpg books when swimming or in the hot tub and there is no way to use your own headphones as the unit will no longer be waterproof.  i listen to audio books as mpegs and there is no bookmark featrue also turn it off and it wont remember where you left off so you spend many minutes trying to find your shut off point.  and remember the only way to recharge is to connect it to a usb cable on a computer.  try to use the oregonscientific website, yea right, its impossible, all Glitzy music and eye candy and not helpful at all. the company is not interested in your problems with the product.  the only way possible to use this product is if i can figure out how to re-solder and seal new head phones into this unit so i can actually hear sound and then use them in the hot tub only, unless i can find a pair of water proof ear buds for swimming. actually i'm wondering if this company can be sued under "Rico" for 'bait and switch',  bottom line "dont buy this worthless device"

<Title>Attention: DO NOT PURCHASE! OUTRAGEOUS! A rip-off!
<Date>Sat Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I definitely agree with Larry. The same things happened to me and the customer service keep saying that there is no complaint about the product. When I uploaded some songs, it said that the disk was full and after unplugged it from the computer it was completely dead. I went to the shop and they gave me another one. This one worked properly for a few times and then water leaked inside and it stopped working again. I went to the shop again and then I started having a lot of problem with the customer service. They wanted to charge me half of the price of a new one for the repair (around US$80) and it was still under warranty as I have purchased it only 2 months before that. Beside that, the sound is really, really poor and the earphones, like the rest of the unit, are not waterproof at all and they don't suit your ears. They keep falling. You cannot swim with them, unless you wear something to hold them like a swim cap. The problem with the sound is really from its earphones because I've tried with another ones and the sound was much better but you cannot use your own earphones on the water because the design doesn't allow you. And believe it or not, the only difference between normal earphones and this one is that those ones have rubber covers that keep falling all the time.  Conclusion: Very expensive, very uncomfortable, not waterproof, very poor sound. The customer service is the worse I've ever seen. A rip-off!

<Title>Handy small size but NOT WORTH THE MONEY!
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the OSI 512 MB Waterproof Mp3 player about 6 mos ago. The player has been totally waterproof so far. I have taken it in pools, hot tubs, and saunas with no problem. Although I am satisfied with the waterproof capability, I am dissatisfied with many other features. First, the headphones are of very poor quality, the sound is almost tinny and the ear pieces have repetedly shocked me, which has caused me to be wary of actually using the player. Another major downfall is that you have no ability to make playlists - the music is automatically arranged alphabetically, which makes it difficult and time consuming to find specific songs. Also, the player will not save your place when it is turned off, so you can't pick up in the middle of a song, and it is useless to try to listen to audiobooks. When uploading files, the drag and drop navigation is easy, but the limited file capacity is frusterating. Just a few m43 files basically use up all of the memory space. The warranty is a joke and OSI's customer service is horrendous. Navigating through the equalizer modes is complicated and cumbersome. Overall, I am extremely disapointed with this purchase. I doubt I will ever buy another Oregon Scientific product again. Right now, I am only using the MP120 through the FM Transmitter in my car due to the poor sound quality and the earphone-shocking-issues. I am currently waiting for my i-pod 20GB to arrive and wishing that I had purchased that in the first place. If you are thinking of buying this product PLEASE consider it carefully, it is definitely Buyer Beware on this one.

<Content>After read many negative reviews, I took a leap of faith to buy this mp3 player.  It turned out better than I expected.  Please do not buy this thing if you're planning to use it without wearing swimming cap.  The headphone won't stay till. The reason I gave it 3 stars because the headphone hurts my ears after using it for more than 45 mins.  Overall, I am glad to buy this mp3 player.  It keeps my workout more entertaining.

<Title>Don't buy it, even if you think it will be ok.  
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read the bad reviews and knew what I was getting into but thought it would be ok.  I was wrong.  After two uses, the headphone connection started to go bad.  If you tighten up the headphone bottom unit, to prevent water from getting into the unit, the headphone connection does not work.  In my case, I loosened the headphone bottom unit just a little past extremely tight, to get the headphones to work, and water leaked into the unit.  I have an extended warranty but it will not cover water damage.  Nothing like a $100 paperweight.  Having to remove and re-tighten the headphone bottom unit (to charge or download music) is this products downfall, because the headphone connection will go bad, like in my case, or you will not tighten the unit enough, again like in my case, and water will ruin the unit.

<Title>It's OK.
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using mine for a year or so, and I like it. I did have to add some earbud caps that came off an old waterproof player in order for the earphones to stay in my ears. It works fine, but it is not terribly convenient to organize your music. There doesn't seem to be any way to set it to shuffle play, and the only way to organize a playlist is alphabetically by name of song. So I'm constantly having to rename my songs in order to get them in the order I want. I wouldn't buy it again, but if you get a good deal on one, it might be worth a try.

<Title>It will last you 3 months tops
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I swim almost every day for about 30-45 minutes. I thought it would be really neat to try to add music to my workout so I got MP120 as it was the only player under 100 at that time. First thing I noticed about MP120 was that the headphone wires were too much in the way and needed to be tucked under the swimming cap or wound around the goggle strap. Second and far more annoying problem was that the ear buds would fall out whenever I immersed in the water or tried to do a flip. So if you are only planning to use a kick board, this player may be great for you, for free style, [...] stroke, butter fly, or flips, I wouldn't recommend it.  After about 3 months, the water started getting into the ear buds and I noticed corrosion in and around the headphone speakers. It wasn't long before the left speaker started buzzing and the sound was seriously degraded.  The customer support for Oregon Scientific is absolutely of the worst kind. Long wait times, false promises and no records of previous calls are all too common. I called three times just to get a request in for a replacement ear buds. The person took the request, and said they would ship a new replacement free of charge since the product was still under the warranty. After three weeks I still haven't received anything. I tried calling the support again and after about 40 minutes of waiting I got to the same person I talked to the last time, however he had no recollection of me and was not able to pull anything on his computer, so he took the order again. I called again 6 months later and asked if they could try shipping the replacement since I haven't received it, but this time I was told my product is no longer under warranty and that I would have to buy a new MP3 player. Nice.  My next set will be Finis SwimMp3 Player which I have heard is superior in many ways.  Update (April 4, 2007): I did received a call from Oregon Scientific tech support on March 28 with an apology and a claim that they are commited on improving the user experience. I got the new set of ear buds the other day, and they seem to have a better design. For one, they don't fall out anymore and the sound is better. On the older set, the sound would degenerate when the cap was placed over the buds. The new head phones don't have this problem. I'm willing to give them another try.

Apparently all they are interested in is taking your money and sending you a rather expensive plastic paperweight, as it can be used for almost nothing else.  Build quality is also very poor (it is made in China).  Shame on Oregon Scientific for selling such a piece trash and then not even answering any of the customer queries for return or replacement.

<Content>I got this as a Christmas present and I love it. I had tried 2 attempts at waterproof music in the past (a waterproof case for a regular mp3 player, and a waterproof radio made by speedo), and both were miserable failures. It works really well for lap swimming.  I have 2 suggestions for improvement- wish the volume went up higher, becuase sometimes the earbuds come slightly out of my ears and it's hard to hear.  Also, the cord to the ear buds is too long and drags in the water, I have to tuck it into my suit.

<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this product at J&R for around $149.00. I got it because I wanted something small and light with a FM tuner that could be used for running. I also had an impression that OS was a good company. It was my first MP3 player purchase.  I hooked up the device and installed the software on Win 2k with no problems. I loaded up a couple of albums pretty easily. The digimusic software provided with it is reasonable good, albeit somewhat slow.   However, my first indication that something was up when I charged it for about 4 hours and it didn't indicate a full charge. I took it out for a run and within 5 minutes the unit shut down and stopped functioning completely. I tried to get it to work by plugging it back in, but to no avail. I ended up returning it to J&R for a full refund.  I didn't get much time to play with all its features, but here's a quick set of pros and cons. Overall, I am glad I did not get stuck with this unit, of course, I haven't found a good one yet to replace it.  Pros 1. light 2. nice design, seemingly sturdy 3. one year warranty (rio is 90 days) 4. supposedly water proof (1 meter), a salesman tried to say it was for 'divers' 5. good strong clip (but tight) 6. rechargable battery  Cons 1. it broke 2. the sound volume is ridiculously low, you couldn't hear it unless you turned it way up. I wonder if at its max whether I would be able to hear well with traffic. 3. it comes basically in two pieces and to plug it in/charge it you have to unscrew the smaller bottom part. The headphones are built into the bottom piece, which you have to leave off if you want to use other head phones.  4. The water proof earplugs don't really work well. 5. It comes with a bizarre pouch, but no arm strap. 6. The screen is really small and hard to read. The radio is hard to manuever around in, in either the preset of freq mode. 7. I played with RIO forge player and found its features much more intuitive and useful than the OS player.  8. charges (slowly: 3 hours) via USB, no external charger and does not charge when your computer is off 9. the buttons are really, really small and hard to press

<Content>I use it for deep water aqua running and I think it is great. Good sound, easy down loading and makes the workout go by a lot faster. Since I have not gone swimming with it yet I can't say about the ear phones staying in but they stay in fine with aqua running. If you adjust the ear phones like the directions say I think they will stay in fine and keep the tie on the ear phone string to prevent them from swinging around. My player has been working wonderful since I got it and I recommend it to anyone that wants some good music for water exercise.

<Title>Finally!  I can swim with my own soundtrack.
<Date>Sat Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>While I was a little hesitant to buy this particular product thanks to the negative reviews posted here, I did it anyway as the price was the most reasonable for an MP3 player that you could swim with (most are WAY more expensive) as well as the fact that both of the bad reviews were from people who had pretty clearly gotten "bad" equipment.  Knowing full well that Amazon (as most reputable places do) had a 30 day money-back guarantee, I figured the worst case scenario was I would have to pay for some shipping and Oregon Scientific would get yet another bad review.  Well, I am here to say that not only did my MP3 player work, it worked WELL beyond my expectations.  I will admit that there are certainly better sounding MP3 players available out there, but I bought this for one purpose and one purpose only: to swim laps with.  For this, it is like a dream come true.  Many were the days that I had to swim with no music at all or with music that I could only really hear when I was between laps.  Those days are finally at an end.  Thank you Oregon Scientific!  Yes, the earbuds are a bit of a pain, but wearing a swim cap can remedy that quite easily I think.  I haven't really had any bad experiences myself as I cut and shaped the earbuds per the instructions.  All in all a GREAT product for what it is intended: to alleviate the monotony of lap swimming.  It is also lightweight and holds a TON of music.  Yeah, the buttons are a bit small and there are some other things, but honestly; to pay a little over a hundred bucks for an MP3 player that holds a half gig of music and NEVER skips and can be used in the rain, there is NO WAY you can do better.

<Content>I have had my mp3 for about a month now.  This is my first one to own.  All the options of the player are great, the equalizer, scroll, and many more.  The amount of songs I can put on the player, depending on size, is good. The things I disliked were the time it takes to charge the internal battery(about 2-21/2 hours), which you can only do with a computer.  This may be normal for MP3 players, I'm not sure since this is my first one.  Another thing was how many times I have had to reset it, about 7-9 times, since I've had it.                                        Thank You,                                        Kevin

<Title>Great for swimming
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player is very light and easy to wear -- it does not interfere with my swimming at all.  It's very easy to use with my computer -- it just appears as another hard drive to which I can copy my MP3 files easily.  It recharges automatically from the USB port and the battery lasts several hours on a single charge -- long enough for a good workout.  My only minor gripe is that the earplugs don't stay in my ears all that well -- they tend to slip out if I don't seat them properly.  The rubber plugs over the earphones can be changed but Oregon Scientific don't offer any alternative sizes or shapes.  (Which is why I gave it only 4 stars.)

<Title>Could be a very unfortunate purchase
<Date>Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had some problems with keeping the ear buds in while swimming, and then later keeping the rubber covers on the ear buds (that problem manifested itself after 2 months of medium, but constant, use). I am also completely unimpressed with Oregon Scientific's customer service: I have had trouble getting in touch with them, and when I did reach them, the person I talked to was unsympathetic and accusatory (to the point of being belligerent, and some might consider, rude). A product that caused  problems after the 30 day grace period for returns (but well with in the 1 year warranty), and then poor customer service, are why I gave this unit such a low rating. You can read further if you are interested in specifics.  I purchased my Oregon Scientific MP120 in May. During the first two months I had some problems convincing the rubber covers of the ear buds to stay in my ears while lap swimming (two to three days a week for 15-20 min.). The instructions indicated that I could cut the rubber covers to "fit firmly" in my ears, but no further instructions than that. I whittled the covers down a bit, and even tried holding them in with a swimming cap, but I was still having some trouble keeping the earpieces in for more than a few laps at a time. I still enjoyed listening to music while swimming and found the problem a minor nuisance. However, I did try to contact Oregon Scientific to ask if there was something more that I could do to adjust the ear buds. Each of the two phone calls I made, after waiting 10 minutes on hold, ended with me giving up. Roughly two weeks ago I sent Oregon Scientific an e-mail asking for better instructions for adjusting the rubber covers, and asking if they had replacement covers. That way, if I tried some major adjustments, but ended ruining the covers (the sound underwater is nonexistent for me without them) I could purchase new ones. I received no response. Within the last two weeks a new problem has developed: now the rubber covers refuse to stay on the ear buds. They slip off and I spend too much time searching for them in the pool. I also was starting to notice that the ear buds were abrading my ear to the point of causing a scab (keep in mind I have been swimming with these things for three months, so I assume it it gradual wear and tear). I decided to call Oregon Scientific again. After waiting 10 minutes to talk to a human, the human I got was extremely unimpressive. I explained the problems I was having. The only thing he could offer was to replace the unit, and told me that, based on what I had told him, that would not correct the problem. He also told me the ear buds only came in one size. When I asked about replacing the rubber covers, he went off the phone to consult with someone, and then told me that he could send me another pair. I had to ask him the cost, he did not offer that they would be sent free of charge. He agreed with my assessment that the ear buds might be too big for my ears, and at that point suggested that I should return the unit to wherever I had bought it from. When I asked if I should return it to Oregon Scientific, since it had been over 30 days, he said that the best they could do was replace the unit, that this would probably do me no good, and that I would have to deal with  whomever I bought it from, not Oregon Scientific. He was extremely blunt, and offered me no other options or even sympathy. When I asked to speak to his manager he told me that his manager would say the same thing he did. I told him I understood that but still would like to speak to him or her. He then said that if it were him he would have done everything necessary to test the product within the 30 days. Okay, but I would still like to speak to the manager. He made another accusatory remark, and once I again I repeated my request. This time he complied, but came back and said the manager was busy. I asked if he had a voice mail where I could leave a message. No. I left my number with the phone rep, and did not hear back from Oregon Scientific that day and am not confident I will ever hear from them-- I hope to be surprised.   I am willing to give Oregon Scientific the benefit of the doubt-- that I got a bad apple phone rep. But, considering how long I waited each time I called them, getting no response as yet to my e-mail, and then not even getting sympathy--  let alone help-- for my predicament with their product, I feel that the buyer should beware with regards to Oregon Scientific.
