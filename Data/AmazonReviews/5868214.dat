<Content>i purchased this player on july 9,2007 and recieved it on july 11, it is a nice player every thing worked right, i had problems getting the album art on the player, you really have to buy some good headphones because the headphones that come with it are not that good and don't get loud enough in my opinion i have two good suggestions for headphones, (radioshack pro 35a $20.00 rich deep bass great headphones for the price) (philips he592 these are in ear style headphones that i purchased at a drug store called cvs these won some kind of award they claim to be surround sound they are also around $20.00 these headphones really make a differece in the sound of the player

<Title>Pretty good for a cheap MP3 player
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had a chance to use it for a month, and remembered to update the firmware to the latest version from the Archos website. (N.B. you really should do this first, after saving the files, because I found that the internal disk needed to be reformatted after the firmware upgrade).  The unit behaves as advertised and the UI is reasonably snappy (when it's not waiting for a 2-second disk spin-up). The OLED display is almost usable in bright sunlight, but adequate everywhere else; photos are a bit grainy on it. I bought the unit for its bookmarking capability, which works exactly as it should. The separate charger input is very handy when not around a computer -- the power jack matches the plug-and-voltage of many wall-warts being made today. File write speed to the unit is about 1 MB/s, not unreasonable.  Biggest complaints: The firmware sometimes falls down on certain files, seeming to "hang" while reading them for a long time. Archos decided to make this unit run on closed-source firmware, so future fixes for this misbehavior are highly unlikely.  I gave it 4 stars because it does nearly all of what's promised, for a cheap package; and because I have the perspective of using some truly badly-designed personal electronics in the past.

<Title>Repeat Archos buyer
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We had purchased an Archos DVR in the past and loved it, so that is why I chose this brand for our MP3 player.  I also have a Sanyo and have had problems loading song titles properly.  There have been no problems with the Archos...other than purchasing better headphones, which seems to be a problem with any player we have ever bought.  Great product for the price!

<Title>The Nifty Archos 104 4GB MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>A small, affordable, general purpose MP3 player comes to mind if you were to ask me to describe the Archos 104.  But this baby is not be so ordinary when it comes to performance, and reliability.  Underneath this "chic" design is a easy to use, and quite capable player.  The sound is good with the built in equalizer.  The quaint color display is a very nice touch when using the menu / folder driven file system.  This unit will even display jpeg photo's if you wish, or store data files like a jump drive.  However, I prefer to stick to the main purpose of this device, which is to play music.  I would prefer a slightly larger H.D. storage capacity over the 4GB, but there is a fair amount of music you can store on it.  The same can be said for the built in rechargeable battery life of apx. 13 hrs.  Note: you have the option to charge through an optional AC converter, or to use the included usb cable to your computers usb port.  Either way, the unit is charged up in about two hours.   The main attraction for me in choosing this model was it's price, versatility, quality, and ease of use.  I can still interface it with earlier Microsoft windows operating systems, and would not trade mine in on another model / brand.  I really enjoy using this player.

<Title>Disappointed in product
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had purchased this item a few years ago and my son had no issues with it, yet when I bought the second one I was really shocked it has so many issues. If you buy this item buy directly from Amazon, so if there are any issues with the firmware, you can get it replaced.Otherwise it is easy to load music onto it, has a great lit screen.If only Archos would fix the firmware issue it would be the only mp3 I would purchase.
