<Title>Pretty good for the price...

<Content>The only reason this system does not get Five stars is because it does not decode DTS (no biggy right now but next year the next generation consoles will come out and ps2 and the next Nintendo console will be DTS exclusive, probably pro logic 2 as well). Also, when a dvd player is connected via RCA cables, the max volume gets loud enough, but you can't push it for more.  I have not tried to hook up the dvd player via coaxial digital input, that may help with the volume level. Also, I have heard that by buying better speaker wire (like 16 gauge) can help you pump up the volume.  I wouldnt recommend this for a living room. You need to spend at least 300 to get something loud enough for a larger room (buy a Yamaha, theyre awesome).  However, for a bedroom or apartment or dorm room, this is pretty good.  A nice feature with this unit is the ability to replace speaker wires and even speakers. Many cheaper systems (under 200) have wires built into the speakers such as the Sony 420 watt HDDw660's subwoofer.  I should also note that on the most pwerful bass setting, this system thumps almost as well as my yamaha (but not quite).  For a test dvd I typically use the following 3: 1)the  beach sequence of Saving Private Ryan (every time an artillery shell drops on the beach, my subwoofer producers a nice loud boom, and the camera shakes...now to me, it's timed so perfectly it's almost as if my subwoofer booming is what is making the camera shake, nice touch here, even the expensive Sharp sdat1000 [500 list price] can't produce bass like this), 2) Black Hawk Down- rangers and delta entering 'the Mog'. It's awesome to hear "RPG!" being yelled then FEELING the bass from my sub.  The end of this movie is also good for testing bass, go to the part where the Little Birds are doing their straffing runs all night long, its great, 3) The Eye- a little known Japanese horror movie that has the creepiest audio in any movie ever, forget the Ring; forget the Grudge. I use the part at the beginning with the old lady in the hallway saying 'im freezing', its pretty awesome on this surround system and its comparable to my yamaha (sorta). Bottom line, if you can live without DTS decoding, this is a good system for only around 150 or so.    I should note that this system just feels and looks well made, especially when compared to other cheaper systems.  The speakers seem as if they are built well and have a nice weight to them, they dont feel cheap and plasticy.  Even the receiver seems quality. It has oodles of inputs and outputs. All cheaper surround systems have to skimp somewhere. This RCA system only skimps on DTS decoding and max volume level (which should be rectified with larger wires). Most cheaper systems skimp on inputs/outputs and the quality of the speaker package (Sony, Sharp, etc.).  I'd much rather have a system that lacks DTS and doesnt go to "blow my speakers" volume level.

<Title>Solid System, Great value
<Date>Mon Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this system for a few months now, and ive had no problems whatsoever. Setup was easy enough, you can adjust the levels on the individual speakers for just the right sound, theres a nighttime setup to minimize disturbance to your neighbors. And if there isnt enough bass for you, theres a plug for a second subwoofer. I scare my friends when they watch movies and something explodes - great! All for 149.95, no shipping on a 36 lb box...insane!

<Title>Six months of use and then it stopped working
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>We thought this would be a nice system and we enjoyed it for six months but then it stopped working. When it is turned on, the system turns off. We took this system into the authorized repair center and they can't fix it and told me to call RCA. I tried that and all I hear is a computer recording. There is no way to speak with anyone. The warranty is useless.

<Title>Similar Problem
<Date>Fri Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>We have used the system for 7 months, and now the receiver doesn't turn on.  Will try getting a hold of RCA, but unless I get lucky, there is no way that will happen such as with the other reviewer.  Could just be the receiver though, but the speakers are not quite worth $140 on their own.

<Title>Endless problems.
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased one of these and had to return it because the unit would freeze while playing or would refuse to turn on. I found through an internet search that many people have had this problem. I later purchased the RCA RT2390 and it is almost the same unit, with a better subwoofer and no receiver problems.

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had read all the reviews before placing my order for this RCA Surround Sound system. Despite the few negative remarks that are there, the attractive price and product image compelled me to give it a try. I am pleased to say that I have now set up the unit in my home and the performance certainly exceeds my expectations. My opinion is as follows: As I had suspected, it does get a bit complicated to properly connect multiple components that have different capacities requiring different types of cables [optical vs. component video; DTS, digital coaxial, versus analog audio, etc.]to this- and frankly any other- Surround system, so the negative reviewers may have just had bad setups. You can't always easily tell because this RCA will work, to some extent, even if it is not properly set up and the user manual is rather vague on some complex issues. Additionally, there are two minor drawbacks:  1. The receiver does not have any Component Video jacks so I had to get S Video cables; unless you own very expensive HDTv or Plasma, etc, from which you would want top performance, S-Video technology works just fine and still offers a much better picture than the standard coaxial cables. 2. There is only one headset jack and it is located in the front of the receiver. Since I use a wireless noise cancelling headset all the time, I had to get an adapter to make the Audio L & R fit into the one micro jack. For people who need to connect more than one headset, they had adaptors [splitters] for that as well. Although the adaptor only cost about $4 at Radio Shack, I would have preferred to see more than one headset jack, and at least one on the rear of the unit as wireless headsets have their own wireless receivers that must be connected and I don't find front panel jacks particluarly attractive/decorative on anything.   The only other issue was that the video cable that was supposed to be included in the box was missing (and I hate repackaging and returning this kind of item because it would be a big hassle). To my pleaseant surprise, Amazon immediately resolved  the problem(that's the great service we shop here for)and I just went and bought a cable at Sears. Overall, considering the $145 price that includes speakers and cables, the functional features, and the quality sound of this unit- compared to other units that are two or three times as costly and up- I give this product 4 stars. One star was deducted for the inadequacies of the user manual and the missing cable. In closing, the missing features described above may actually be blessings for those who live in apartments or who have peripheral equipment/components that are more than a few months old, because, unless you live in a football field, you most likely do not need a 1000 watt system, and if your TV and DVD player do not come with optical video, etc., having those features on your surround receiver will most likely only make everything malfunction or fail to function altogether.

<Title>True piece of garbage!!!
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this "system" less than 6 months, and it's already pooping the bed.   I bought this for it's optical input for use with my Mac G5 (didn't want to put out the cash for Logitech Z-5500...ended up buying them anyway), and at first it sounded great. Decoding digital movies was pretty good, and every day analogue was fine.   But under 6 months and this thing just stops working, freezes, is all I can say it does, forgets it's settings, the remote ceases to work...  Do yourself a favor and avoid this junk.

<Title>Do not buy this item!!!!!
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item for my mother for christmas...and i do agree, good system.....for the price. I prefer the Kenwood we have downstairs. But anyway...we had this for about two months and it worked fine. Then when my mother went to use it, you'd turn it on and nothing would happen. I dont know what happened to it...but i definitely agree RCA did not think this one through.

<Title>Do Not Buy This System
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this system for a "great price" and it was great while it worked...then about a year afterwards it would lock up and not function.. Then finally it stopped working all together. I did an online search and found that this is very common with this system. Do the research and you will find the same. Save your money and buy another system after you do the research!
