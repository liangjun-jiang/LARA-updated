<Content>Is iPod, iTunes, iTunes Music Store A Monopoly?    In the basic sense of the word 'monopoly', Apple has one in the iPod ecosystem.   There are multiple definitions as to what constitutes a 'monopoly.' There's Microsoft's Windows. Apple's iPod ecosystem. Merriam-Webster's definition. And the legal definition. Has Apple created a monopoly?   Yes. What goes around, comes around. Apple's iPod ecosystem, which includes the ubiquitous iPod, iTunes on Mac and Windows, and the iTunes Music Store, is truly a monopoly.   Or, nearly a monopoly. Or, could be proven to be a monopoly. Or not. That's how law seems to work these days.   Thomas Slattery sued Apple Computer, claiming the iPod is configured so that it will only play music from iTunes Music Store and not music from other online stores.   In short, Apple is facing a number of federal and state antitrust claims, and a California judge has ruled that the plaintiff (Slattery) in this case has met the qualifications which assert a "tying" claim.   The case may now proceed as a monopolization claim under the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and other claims for violation of California's antitrust and unfair-competition laws.   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates must be smiling. RealNetworks CEO (former Microsoft employee) Rob Glaser probably helped himself to another jelly doughnut.   The judge noted the basic facts: Apple has an 80-percent market share for online music sales, and more than 90-percent of the market for portable hard-drive music players.   According to Merrium-Webster (the only authority who would comment), there's a non-legal definition for 'monopoly`:    Main Entry: mo�nop�o�ly  Function: noun  Inflected Form(s): plural -lies  Etymology: Latin monopolium, from Greek monopOlion, from mon- + pOlein to sell  1 : exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action  2 : exclusive possession or control  3 : a commodity controlled by one party  4 : one that has a monopoly   If Windows is a monopoly at 90-percent of operating systems on PCs, then Apple can have a near-monopoly on portable music players and online music sales with the iPod's ecosystem.   But a monopoly does not illegallity make.   The issue is how Apple wields that monopoly and both the plaintiff and the judge in the California case think Apple may need to loosen the iPod's ecostrings.   It's the whole 'closed system` perspective that seems to continue to haunt Steve Jobs and Apple. Granted, the iPod ecosystem works very well. No one else has bettered the mousetrap.   That's the point. It's a trap. Mostly. Once you buy an iPod, you're pretty much obligated to use iTunes if you want to listen to music on said iPod.   Once you start with iTunes, you're just a click away from the iTunes Music Store, and, if you're an iPod owner, that's pretty much the only store from which you can buy tunes that will play on the iPod.   Except Wal-Mart, or Tower Records, or Sam Goody, or Target, or... you get the idea. There are alternatives, but online it's mostly iTMS or nothing if you're an iPod owner.   For example, you can't buy music on Microsoft's Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that's not Apple's fault.   Then again, Microsoft is not the monopolist when it comes to music on PCs. It's an also ran. A runner up to the crumbs left by Apple's stampede.   The lawsuit, and others of similar ilk, have a case, though with many holes. While Microsoft abused their monopolistic position by forcing manufacturers to pay for Windows on every PC shipped, and to bundle software (illegally, it was determined), Apple doesn't really 'force` iPod buyers to use iTMS.   That's the difference, and it's a big difference. The problem is that you can't use other music from other online stores employing DRM (digital rights management) not compatible with iTunes.   Whose fault is that? Apple's? Yes and no.   Posted by Tera Patricks at 9:35 am on Monday, February 6 2006  Category: News * Reader Comments (26) * Email It  Page 1 of 1 pages  Reader comments...  Jeff says:  The remark about Microsoft deliberately modifying Windows to make Quicktime shaky is not completely true. The Quicktime plugin developers did not fully understand what they were doing, and were relying (unknowingly) on an undocumented side-effect. When that changed, they had problems. That was definitely Apples fault, not Microsofts.   The whole "why won't Apple license Fairplay" issue needs to be considered from a real business perspective. Does anyone know for a fact that Apple haven't said to anyone "Sure, you can use it, the one-time cost is $1,000,000,000"? (Long term, thats probably not an unrealistic figure)   The courts cannot mandate a price for a company to sell its IP. That would set a precedent that would bring down the US economy.   You might as well sue Microsoft for not "making Steve Jobs an offer he can't refuse". That'd probably be the responsible thing for Microsoft to do, where responsible == return the greatest profit to MSFT shareholders.   Hell, Apple are already being hauled over the coals for charging 3rd party manufacturers a fee per unit for using iPod-compatible connectors. No-ones suing over that price-gouging, because they can't. Its not illegal to price your product exorbitantly - if you can't afford to make iPod-compatible hardware, thats *your* problem, go make parts for some other mp3 player.   Market forces are supposed to sort this one out. Your new widget appears on the Dell player instead, its an instant hit, people drop the iPod in droves, you get to sleep "on piles of money with many beautiful girls"   The one counter to all of this, that I'm aware of, is the "inter-operability" argument. That Apple should be forced to open its IP up, so that its competitors can inter-operate with it, in the same way that the EU forced Microsoft to show the Samba guys its internals.   But this is not the same situation - the iPod can already play MP3. The only thing it won't do is support "someone elses file format" and thats a function of the business deal between two third parties, the other vendor and the music industry.   If the courts rule that Apple has to change its ways so that Microsoft and Sony can broaden their markets whilst maintaining their current contracts, then they (the courts) have sunk to an amazingly corrupt new low.   Posted by Jeff on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 11:58 am    ian Johnson says:  Not a fanboy, however apple built a working system and a good interface to deliver. No one is required to use either one. You can still buy CD's and play them on your a CD player. Should cassette- er 8-track manufacturers sue them for making CD's inoperable in an 8-track slot? You probably can't get the new Britny Spears on 8-track, and there's probably a recording of "Pac Man Fever" on cassette that will never make it to CD. It's called out with the old and in with the new. It happens. Don't cry because it just makes it that much harder. Primus came out with a Brown Album on vinyl long after LP's were much in vogue.  This is like the "Coffee is Hot" model with McDonalds. Based on these relatively simple premises:  1. Coffee is hot.  2. If at all possible avoid spilling it on yourself.  Nobody forces coffee to be hot. It's just better that way. Do not commandeer a cup of brew unless you feel you are sufficiently able to navigate the liquid as it cools down, into your mouth.  If you don't know how to load your iPod with songs that you got like your "Pac Man Fever" cassette. Get out your old Walkman. And return the iPod for someone more capable. If you want to buy a PossiblyWillPlay (TM) player and load it with songs you can only find on the iTunes store burn them on CD in audio format, after all you own a copy of the music, then use your Windows Media this or that to import the CD. As long as you bought the music you probably won't be reported to the RIAA for putting your Pat Boone iTunes original collection on your iWinKyoob player.  And to Adam, anyone can put their music on iTunes, even Purple Grandma Deathkill Emo, and apparently keep every penny of the sale from their "Knitting with Satan" EP. See this on Digg   Ok Ok, I'm sort of a fanboy and this is mostly a rant, but more importantly I believe that when you dumb stuff down for the least common denominator, everything starts to suck. -Hey world, someone come up with a cooler idea for music distribution and delivery format and I'll buy it. And in the meantime please keep the whining to a minimum.   Posted by ian Johnson on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 2:50 pm    iDJ says:  Didn't `WE' choose for iPod and iTunes? Aren't `WE' the millions of people that made the same choice? Didn't `WE' kill the the `others'.  Apple made something that WE love, because of the looks, the feel and it's easy to use too.  That's what WE want and WE made this monopoly!   `WE control iPod'   Posted by iDJ on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 4:07 pm    Jason says:  "For example, you can?buy music on Microsoft?Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that?not Apple?fault."   Actually, that IS Apple's fault. They won't allow iPods to play any DRM'd music but their own through the iTMS. And when anyone has tried to make their alternate legal service work with an iPod (like Real), they got sued by Apple.   The iPod is technically capable of supporting WMA and the associated DRM. The portalplayer platform they're all built on is used in other players that do. Similarly, other players could be made to work with Apple's FairPlay DRM - there's no technical hurdle, it is only that Apple refuses to license it.   Long story short: Apple holds the keys here and it is only their decisions that prevent interoperability (with either players or music stores).   Posted by Jason on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 10:25 am    Fred Winston says:  Nope, Jason. That's not it. It's still not Apple's fault that Windows media audio, even with DRM, won't play on iTunes. It's the DRM from Microsoft that's at fault. Not Apple. It's not an Apple licensing issue that other DRM'ed music won't play in iTunes. It's the fault of those that have proprietary DRM. The defacto standard for DRM is, of course, FairPlay. From Apple.   Posted by Fred Winston on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 11:25 am    adam says:  Fred -  it's equally the fault of apple that music bought from iTunes won't play on other non-apple devices.   defacto doesn't mean anything in this context.   Posted by adam on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 12:10 pm    Kai Cherry says:  Wow. That's all I can say here...after being `hung up on' by a fellow Mac user for picking `the wrong side' in this non-debate. The fact is, it feels good to be on top, some of us have a deep `love' for Apple.   But love is often blind. Apple has an effective monopoly on the Online Digital Music (and soon, probably video) market. This is a fact.   Apple has an *overwhelming* market share of the Hard Disk digital player market...and likely the flash market too. All of this in about 4 years time...from nowhere. Sound familiar?   Alone, these two things are perfectly alright. But the vertical integration in these two markets, and a lack of interoperability, and fairly aggressive tactics to break interoperability are a problem.   And let's not kid ourselves here: *Apple* benefits from this far more that the music rights holders. In the beginning, many, many large artists were not playing along, but the fact is, if you wanna move music online, there really isn't anywhere else to go.   What's really...weird...is that these same points people are using to defend Apple's position are the same one's Microsoft proponents were using. The difference is, by the time anyone stepped in to do anything about it, it was far too late. Everyone lost.   This is an emerging market. You can argue up one side and down the other about inferior competitive products or whatever, but if someone made a music store that sold songs for a nickel less per, worked with iPod/iTunes, and still had DRM...there would be more places to shop.   Or what of the higher quality audio and video people clamor for? Not gonna happen.   As well, if other folks stores could sell players that could play Fairplay DRM music (and lets be honest...this `they can sell in mp3' is a strawman; no Major Content Provider is licensing non-DRM music/video...stay with reality) then there might be room for some new emerging and compelling players out there.   The likely remedy here tho would be that Apple would have to adopt or support another technology; the burden would be on them to interoperate with the rest of the market. And that market uses Helix or WMA DRM.   As it stands, there is a wall there, and there is no way to penetrate it. Think about 5, 10 years from now. What if somehow, Apple was bought, or was no longer "the Apple that we love".   If it were *any other company* would this be "ok"? Seems to me that when it was, it wasn't. All I'm sayin'   Posted by Kai Cherry on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 12:49 am    John says:  Just a thought, but one can turn around and, looking the other way note that tunes bought from Steve only play on (portably) an iPod. That's more of a tie that binds....   Posted by John on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 1:56 am

<Content>to anyone thinking of buying this ipod i would suggest otherwise this is the only ipod i have ever owned so i can not generalize and say that all ipods lack good qualitybut, this does. I had by ipod for no even a year (and took good care of it, not dropping it, carrying it in a protective case) and it died. Just randomly died one day the ipod with the sad face and the exclamation point came up. So thank God i had a warrenty, i got it replaced for free. Everything was great i got it replaced in July 2006, it is now October 2006, and the new one died yesterday. Same thing as the last a "hardware problem". However, now my warrenty is up so in order to get it repaired, i will be charged, and im sure by december it wil have broken again. That is not a chance i am willing to take. As of now i have promised myself to never again purchase a ipod. I am now lookin to purchase either a Philips 30gb mp3 player or a Zen mp3 player, hopefully i will have better luck with either one.  if you purchase this item, good luck =]

<Title>An Outstanding and Very Reliable Music Player
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my third iPod, and just like the one's before it, it has delivered consistent performance and high quality sound. The iPod is a great looking player and the color screen adds a wonderful dimension for viewing photos and album art. I never have to worry about developing or printing photos anymore; instead I load them onto my iPod to share with friends and family (it's a lot easier than carrying around a photo album).  I've owned this particular player for a over a year now, and have never had any technical problems with it. I used to use it on a Windows computer before making the switch to a Mac, and I experienced seamless integration with both operating systems. It is very, very easy to put music on it with iTunes. The iPod has the most simple, easy to use user interface of any music player on the market, and the click-wheel makes navigating menus, photos, and music effortless.  Another important point is sound quality. I have listened to my iPod through ear-bud headphones (included Apple ear buds), in-ear headphones (Ultimate Ears), over-the-ear studio headphones (Sony DJ Headphones), and desktop speakers (Klipsch 2.1 Multimedia Speakers). No matter what the medium the iPod delivers consistent, quality sound, even at high volumes, with minimal distortion. The entire frequency range is heard through the iPod, which is particularly important to me.  There is a reason the iPod has taken off in the past few years, it consistently delivers great sound and features through an elegant and intuitive interface.

It is hard to find hardware and accessories for it because they don't make it anymore. I would definetely advise to NOT buy this product. Used ones can be good if they come at a good price.

<Title>AWESOME MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 20GB Photo Ipod uses a superb audio computer chip that surpasses the current IPOD classic model and previous IPOD video models.  The bottom line is that I previously owned  The 5th generation 30GB video for 18 months. I replaced it with the 4th generation 20GB photo IPOD it sounds better in my car and on my bose digital sound dock. I purchase an MP3 player for sound quality not looks. Hopefully apple will improve the audio computer chip for the current IPOD models. Until then if you want CD quality sound you cannot go wrong with the 4th generation 20GB photo IPOD.

<Title>piece of you know what...
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'd give this latest ipod less than one star if I could.  I've had two in the last week and they've both been pieces of crap.  The first one worked fine for a few days before it just wouldn't turn on one day.  This was about three days into it.  Thankfully Target took it back with no hassles and gave me a replacement.  I figured I'd just gotten a dud.  I mean hey...it happens with even the best brands.  I got it home, loaded it with music and again it played fine for a day or two.  The first time I went to charge it after the initial charge before I ever played it, it froze.  I unplugged it from the charger and it was frozen on the select language screen with the LCD lit up, which won't go off until the battery dies I guess.  Here's hoping Target is as cool about taking this one back.  I defintely won't be getting one of the same kind.  Maybe I'll pay a little more and get one up, or even better my money back.    I think it's because this is the first generation of the affordable color display.  Apple defintely has some bugs to work out of this sucker.  My first ipod still plays great so I think it's just this particular model.  Still, what a disapointment and a hassle.

<Title>Apple iPod 20GB Review
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the new iPod but now it comes standard with a color screen. The normal iPod's now come in a standard 20 gigabyte form and the high-capacity 60 gigabyte form. The 20GB holds 5,000 songs or 20,000 photos or 15,000 songs or 25,000 photos for the 60GB. This new iPod is a little bit larger than the original though, 4.1 x 2.4 x 0.63 inch weighing 5.9 ounces. But, they have upgraded the battery life from 12 hours to 15 hours, which is nice but I would like to see an iPod with a little more life. These are the supported audio formats: AAC (16 to 320 Kbps), Protected AAC (from iTunes Music Store), MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps), MP3 VBR, Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4), Apple Lossless, WAV, AIFF / Frequency response: 20Hz to 20,000Hz. Here are the supported photo display formats: Syncs iPod-viewable photos in JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, PSD (Mac only) and PNG formats. The accessories that comes with this device include: USB 2.0 and Firewire 400 (with Firewire cable, sold separately), Composite Video (with AV cable, sold separately), and headphones. So all together this looks like a very good iPod. I'm probably not going to buy it though because I already have a 20GB monochrome screen iPod and I don't think I need another one with a color screen. But if you are a first time iPod buyer I would recommend this or if you need more room to store yours songs get the 60GB. It's a great deal and especially now you can't resist it (20GB iPod Photo now same price as old monochrome iPod, $299.99)

<Content>Well!! Well!! Well guys. What we need is a sleek, perfectly designed, aesthetically pleasing, great sounding player for music. Thats what the latest iPod Photo is. Photos? thats a goodie. Well what I am trying to say is, you cant compare it to any other MP3 players in the market. iPod is in a league of its own.  A device that does one thing perfectly and for long, is what we need. Offcourse we could have a camera on it, a voice recorder may be, AM/FM ow thats a must!!, Cell phone? Make it an organizer....How about a microwave? Yea Rrright... I have played with most of them.....iRiver, Zen, Sony...The all in one paradigm of thought, eventually leaves us with none in one. Being a hardware designer myself, I wouldnt buy an all in one device. Take the iPod in your hand look at it, play it, use it...you will realize that this was created by a buncha cool dudes with passion for design, looks & music. They certainly had problems in their earlier versions. This device shows that they really have made an effort to overcome them to please you. Not merely make it a 'throw in more' competition. I think I see a remarkable betterment in the quality and fedility of the music output. A 20G can hold a lot of songs in its stomach. I wouldnt use it for file storage because you can assemble a 100GB pocket disk that requires no battery, power or recharging for $150. So, I wouldnt go for more than 20GB iPod. No wonder it is so popular.   So, Go for it!! You'll enjoy it.

<Title>This is a great product! 
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great product. It's the new and improved iPod 20 GB, same price ($300). Runs up to fifteen hours, which means I can listen to it a few hours a day and charge it every three or four days. Things you'll probably need for this product:  1. A case. Definitely. It could fall or get dirty quite easily.  2. If you like to go for rides on bike, or drive a lot, you'll need a remote control. You can easily and quickly push the buttons to skip or go back to a song.  3. A recorder. If you attend a lecture, or if you're still in school, you can easily record stuff and go back to it. I bought iTalk. Crystal clear, and good. But make sure your earphones are out when you record stuff.  I like playing games in color (the four games: bricks, solitaire, parachute, and music quiz. In music quiz, you try to identify songs that you already have stored on your iPod), and being able to put the album pictures on my iPod. Plus, I can put photos on my iPod and look at them wherever (as long as I have my iPod with me.) If I go on a trip with my camera, and run out of space, I can quickly put the photos on my iPod and then take more pictures. I can take up to 20,000 pictures, so space is not a problem at all (up to 5,000 songs). Plus, I can also put a slideshow on. The scroll wheel is easy to use, although not at first. If I put my iPod in my backpack, there is a "lock" button at the top, so that even when the buttons are pressed, nothing will happen. Volume control is easy.  This product is great; I reccomend it to anyone who wants an iPod.

<Content>The color iPod is the best electronic item I have owned so far... and I've owned a lot. To summarize:  - The Click-wheel is awesome, simple and superb to use - The color screen is great, clear and bright - The sound quality is quite good, though the headphones could handle bass better - iTunes is equally simple to start with, has good enough capabilities. Handling audiobooks is slightly counter-intuitive - The battery life is close to what's reported, though using the backlight and skipping through songs drains it significantly - One capability I seriosly miss in the iPod is song search capability. That would be the icing on the cake.  So far, soooo good. Can't have enough!

<Title>Buy the protection plan!
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Make sure you figure the cost of the protection plan when determining whether the iPod is a good deal or not.  Mine failed two weeks after the warranty expired.  My options?  Send them the failed iPod and $255 + tax and they send me a used or refurbished model with a 90 day warranty.  Basically they just want you to buy a new one.  Had I known that up front, I would have passed or at least made sure I bought the protection plan.  I got exactly 1 year out of mine and now it would cost me more to have it serviced than to buy a new one, so it is completely worthless.

<Content>What can I say, I have a soft spot for small milky white high-tech objects.  20 GB seems like a lot, especially after I put 680+ songs on it and it only took up about 3GB. The photo part isn't that useful because the fact that the screen is very small. It seems the battery last as long as 16 hours because I've played it all day and it's half gone.  It's a great buy.

<Title>Pretty Good, could be better
<Date>Sun Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did a lot of research before I finally decided to get an ipod. I was considering a zen touch, but the color screen, touch wheel, and photo capabilities sold me on the ipod.  I ended up getting an ipod HP version which is now discontinued but it is the same as the regular apple ipod.  Overall I'm pretty happy with the unit, and have had no problems as of yet after a month of constant use.  The photo capabilities of the unit come in really handy on trips, and then showing everyone the photos after.  I have no complaints about battery life yet, but that may change.  So far I use it several hours a day and have to charge it every 7 or 8 days. Having USB 2.0, all my 14gigs of music loaded under 15 minutes, but I may try firewire, unfortunately there is nothing supplied for firewire connectivity when you get the ipod, it all costs extra.  Music sounds pretty good, but not the best, it doesn't sound as lively or as full as other mp3 players I've used, even with some of my mp3s that are coded at 320kbps.  There are equalizer controls which helps the audio out but I'm also using a pair of $30 headphones, so I doubt I'm getting the best sound out of it.  One thing that was an annoyance is that you have to have all your mp3 tags in order if you want it to show up correctly in the player, the most important being genre, artist, and song title, sorting this out takes some time depending on your collection.  Personally I would like it better if it gave you the option of sorting music out by filename.  One of the gripes I have about the ipod is that it does not support drag and drop for music, this must be done using itunes.  It's not really a problem, but it just adds that much more of a hassle.  I do like how the unit can function as a mass storage device in both USB 1.1 and 2.0, this has come in handy for transferring large files.  Another issue with the ipod is that it scratches easily and is not very hardy just by itself so you definitely want to get a case of some sort, especially one that protects the screen. I personally like silicone skin cases, which is what I have. I think the ipod should have come with a case or protection of some sort.  This leads me to my last gripe, it seems most of the ipod accessories are unnecessarily expensive and over priced and every little thing is extra so this may have to be factored into your budget depending on what you want as far as better headphones, protection, and connectivity (firewire). All in all though, it's a good machine, I just hope it lasts and continues to live up to its hype.

<Content>I just purchased the iPOD Color and the Bose Sound dock...what a great combo! I love the clarity of the music.  Only problem is that my iPOD Color just froze on me, in the middle of a song screen. I tried all the tricks on the Apple support site to reboot it, nothing worked. I worked on it for an hour or more. I am going to return it to the store for an exchange. I will also follow a person's advice here and purchase the extended warranty. Are the iPODs known to be problematic?

<Title>iPod 5 Stars but iTunes 2 Stars
<Date>Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am using the new iPod Photo 20 GB (as you know Now iPod and iPod photo are same)  for past 15 days and this the best thing ever happened to me in music. It will change the way you listen music either on the go, in car or at home.  iPod: Good: 1. Greaaaaaaaat Sound 2. Look smartest among all portable players 3. Simple and excellent navigation (Best part is click wheel) 4. Good (Not Excellent) battery life 5. Lot of accessories available 6. No need to buy USB flash drives Can be Improved: 1. Changing the Genre form iPod itself (Without iTunes) 2. Deleting photos/songs/playlists from iPod itself (Without iTunes)  I think above 2 things can be incorporated without any increase in the cost.But pros certainly overpowers the cons.  iTunes: Good: 1. Ripping the audio CD can be done virtually without any loss in quality. Many other rippers don't preserve id tags (Containg Title, Artist, Genre etc.) of songs when you rip to MP3 format but iTunes does. 2. Very fast in transferring your songs/photos to/from iPod. Bad: 1. If you delete a playlist then their is no option to delete the songs permanently from the iTunes/iPod Library. Lets say you have 100 songs in a playlist. Then you make a new playlist (Using "On The Go Playlist" feature of iPod) of 70 songs. Now you want to free your iPod of the remaining 30 songs, you can't do it directly. You have to select them one by one from Library to delete using iTunes. 2. iTunes have no feature to remove songs from iPod which are not there is any playlist. 3. DO NOT TRY TO BECOME SMART BY USING KEYBOARD WITH iTunes. It sucks.  With such a nicly crafted product (iPod), I didn't expected such a bad interface software from Apple.  Also apple accessories (From Apple Store) are too highly priced when you can buy many of them from eBay at one third of the price at Apple store.  But overall a good exprience.

<Title>I owned a Dell DJ-30, but sold it and got this
<Date>Sat Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great MP3 player.  My only drawback is that I didn't purchase it sooner. I originally bought the Dell DJ-30 because it was cheaper and had 10GB more storage.  However, I change my mind too much, and have yet to really use more than 13GB.  Plus, this has a color display and it is soooo much easier to use than the Dell.  I thought I didn't want to get into the monopoly of iTunes, because I usually buy Musicmatch, Walmart, and Buy.com music files, but iTunes has all you need and more.  They have pre-release singles, and Podcasts are truely a cool thing.  I recommend it.

<Content>This a great product (yet again) from Apple. If you own a Mac (like I do) this works real smooth. I was able to sync my contacts and calendar too apart from all my music and podcasts without ANY hassles.  The colored screen has a more than decent resolutions and it syncs with iPhoto to make literally ALL your snaps available for viewing anytime. With 15 hours of battery life for music this is perfect.  It uses the same cable to charge and sync. It can also charge using your computers USB port. Not many people talk about this but I really liked the sound quality that my iPod delivered using the headphones that came with it. One downside I feel is when the noise level increases in my surroundings I have to take my iPod out, unlock it and then change the volume. No easy control on the headphone for it!!!

The earphones provide fine quality although some discomfort in the ears occurs after an hour or so. I haven't tried storing digital images on the iPod directly from my camera but will report on that later. Overall, I can't find anything wrong with this unit. I also feel that ordering through Amazon.com was a good move as it saved me approximately $40 and delivery was prompt.

<Title>I waited a year researching and jumped at the $50 off the color iPOD.
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple 20 GB iPod Photo MA079LL/A was originally $300 and since its now on sale at $250, I finally bought this model after looking at various mp3 players for a year.  Now I'm a PC person and was originally afraid of compatability. I use the new  iTunes 6. Apple seems to constantly update the program with new features (like improved Podcasts support) Old version is in the box on a disc, download the latest when you install your player.  At first I thought hey I want to use Real Player or Window's Media player with my ipod.  But I find it helpful to keep what's on your ipod and what's on your PC in separate programs because once the tunes are on your ipod you can erase them from your PC to save space.  And iTunes 6 has many functions that customize your ipod player that just arent' available in other PC based mp3 players.  Then you can set it up to automatically rip CDs as soon as you put it in the drive. The ACC encoding available in iTunes and Real player sounds better with smaller files than WMAs. I consider myself a golden ear and while no player will match a Home Theater/ Audiophile experience, I found it difficult to distinguish WAV files from the Apple codecs ACC and apple lossless using the included Ear Buds.  Using my $100 earphones did sound better than the earbuds but I can't be isolated at work.  The iPOD is capable of sounding better with pricier earbods. Just remember with isolation earbuds you can't hear the phone or people yelling at you!  Why buy an Ipod Photo for $250instead of Apple 30 GB iPod with Video Playback Black for $300? The Ipod Photo is a 4th generation player, the video model is the 5th.  I would go with the new Video if you focus on photos since the screen is slightly bigger. Also if you have more than 30 GB of songs on your hard drive and need to carry about 30 GB than pay the extra $50.  But using mixed waves, MP3, and ACC, I have 1000 songs and its still not half filled. I would not buy the nano because if you like music, 4GB will not be enough storage for you.  Now why buy an Ipod instead of a Zen, Iriver or Sandisk? In my opinion the hardware feel and software quality of the iPOD is superior to these makes, but try them out yourself at a store.  They are not significantly cheaper for identical features either. If you use Napster, and Rhapsody to GO  (fill up your player for a monthly fee) you can't use the iPOD at present.    Rhapsody claims you can still buy $0.99 songs for iPOD but Apple's itunes store includes the CD art to display on the color screen. Yes the iPOD can drag and drop album art in itunes using ACC (best new codec), that are displayed in full color on the screen from right here on Amazon. But I don't think old MP3s can display the album art which is why some people say it doesn't work.  So I am very happy with the iPOD...

<Title>What other reviews may be hiding.
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When fully functional, Ipod's (any of them) can be your best friend, but unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world, so expect some drama. The 20 gig photo Ipod comes with many flaws, and I say this having returned the first one I bought because the screen froze. I was worried the next one I got would have the same ill fate, thankfully it didn't crash on me but it does still have alot of problems. For one, you can't always successfully upload photos, sometimes it updates without even putting the pictures on the Ipod you assigned it to. Deleting photos is also a major issue, some times I have to plug in/out and update the ipod at least 10 times before it even puts the pictures on it. You may also encounter an error while trying to do so. Most Ipod users will encounter the "do not disconnect" error that doesn't seem to leave your screen even after updating it. It may go away as it did with mine after a month or so, but chances are it will stay, as most people I know have the same issue. Another big problem with the Ipod is it's inconsistency to turn off. Resetting the Ipod may help solve the issue but it's an annoyance. Pushing and holding the play/pause button won't always do the trick, making me click in and out of menus and repeating the hold process to make it work. Uploading the music was never a problem, this is a great little machine, that is if you can deal with all the problems it brings along. Battery life is also a big lie, as the Ipod will NOT last 12 hours, not even close, you would be extremely lucky if you could get 6 hours on an Ipod. It takes pretty long to fully charge this but I can live with it, after all it holds thousands of songs that I can flip through whenever I want, and I never have to delete anything. You can hook the Ipod to big speakers if you are at a party and don't like the music they're playing, it's that simple. Overall this is a great thing to have if you listen to alot of music, not to mention it's small and can fit in your pocket. If you'r frustrated at first, it's perfectly normal, just get use to it and work your way around the little bugs that may and probably will come with your Ipod. Good listening.

<Title>Apple's Greatest Creation
<Date>Fri Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I got my ipod 20 gig for Christmas, I was overjoyed. I could finally listen to any of my music library, at the flick of my finger, and I wouldn't have to lug my CDs around with me. Last, and best, was that I didn't need to have that bulky portable CD player that had absolutely NO skip protection. Not only is the ipod convenient and useful, it is also a cool thing to show off at school or just when you're out. Everybody turns their heads when they see somebody with an ipod. But, as with everything, there are a few minor glitches. Here they are:  The "chrome" back finish scratches EXTREMELY easily. I read that in other reviews and quickly found that out. So, I would suggest buying a case for it. The screen scratches too, but not as easily. You can buy screen protectors for it.  Sometimes, when I leave my 'pod off for like a day or something, I try to turn it on, but it doesn't. I check for the hold button, but it isn't on. I then try to hold the pause button down for like five seconds. A non-backlit screen comes up with the apple logo on it. Further holding it down and the ipod comes on.  That's about it for the glitches. Not much, eh??? I truly love this product. It goes with me everywhere. I know you will like yours, too!!! Signed -- A girl

<Title>BUYER BEWARE: 5 iPods dead within a year!
<Date>Wed Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My iPod 40GB died within TWO MONTHS of its initial use as Christmas present.  The hard drive quit working and just makes little clicking sounds.    My husband's 20GB iPod died within SIX months of purchase.  His locks up his computer and won't hold files or play music.  He has been sent to "email support" but reformatting the hard drive and reinstalling the operating system hasn't helped, so we don't expect much good from that.   Our father in law went through 3 iPods within a year.  Similar issues.    These are lovely and useful devices, but TERRIBLE PRODUCT RELIABILITY.  None of us used the product while jogging or doing anything else strenuous to the devices.    Two of these iPods were refurbished by HP.  It took us TWO MONTHS to get support, getting bounced back and forth between the wrong phone lines (an IVR disconnected me before I ever got to a human being on one of the "support" lines), the Apple store (who said they don't support their own product at all - you have to go to HP for that, even though it bears an Apple logo!), and then their HP "support" phone line who, by the time I found them, said, "Sorry, you're out of warranty."    An industry insider suggested that we replace our iPods with the disposable Shuffle - not much functionality, but at least it's just $100 down the drain every year or so -- rather than $200 to $500!    Buyer beware.  These are disposable devices.  Handle them like glass and don't expect them to last.

<Title>iPod Moves to All-color Line-up
<Date>Mon Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Passionate iPod users know at least one thing about the iPod line-up, and that is they are always changing.  The new full-size iPods have moved to an all-color line-up, and that is a good thing.  The new 20 GB iPod with color display is 0.06 inches thicker than its 20 GB monochrome-display predecessor.  However, after a little use, the small increase in size does not seem significant.  Plus, the bonuses are rich.  This 20 GB iPod with color display has a battery that lasts three hours longer than the previous 20 GB with monochrome display.  That brings the total to approximately 15-hours, which is great as it allows you to use your iPod longer in every day circumstances before charging, while also giving you the power needed to fly almost anywhere in the world, on a single charge.  Compare this to some of the earlier iPods that had only eight hours of battery life.    What does the color screen add, for you might ask, "I'm listening to music, why a color screen?"  Well, album art is one benefit.  The iPod displays the album art, when playing songs, which helps create the feeling for the album.  Furthermore, iTunes works with iPhoto on Mac and Adobe products on PC, in order to transfer your photo libraries to your iPod.  You can then view your cherished photo libraries on the go, which might come in handy when you're telling the story of that huge fish no one seems to believe.  However, the best part of iPod with color is that you can buy the optional photo adapter, plug it into the dock connector on your iPod, and transfer photographs direct from your digital camera via USB.  This allows you to move potentially gigabytes of photographs to your iPod, while on vacation, freeing up the memory card in your camera.  This is truly a time and money saver!  You can return from vacation with thousands of images that would have never fit on your camera's memory card alone.  Finally, you can view slideshows of photographs, and even display them on television, with optional A/V cables sold separately.    Why has the storage not increased on the $299 model, when switching from monochrome display to color?  Apple is obviously choosing to give you the features of a color display without increasing price, rather than increase the size of storage on the base iPod at this time, and it is a good decision!  20 gigabytes is an ample-size iPod, for almost everyone.  Few people have more than a few gigabytes of music, and that leaves you with several more gigabytes for photos, backing up files, and future-proofing.  However, if you do have more than 20 gigabytes of music, and you want to backup some of your computer files to your iPod, you might choose the 60 GB model, although it is even thicker in size.  However, that is going to be a select group, for 20 GB truly shines, and it is ideal for almost everyone.  A good value, at this time, is the now discontinued 30 GB iPod photo, which has identical features and dimensions as the new 20 GB color.  The 30 GB can still be found at the time of writing this, for between $330 and $350.    Mac or PC?  This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC.  However, on a Mac, you'll immediately enjoy the synchronization of iTunes, your contacts, iCal calendars, Backup software, and of course iPhoto.  On PC, you will have iTunes, but you'll need a third-party application from Adobe to sync photos the right way, while, you can find some shareware on the Internet that will allow you to sync other information, addresses, etc. that you might be interested in trying out.  Finally, Podcasting!  The newest version of iTunes is 4.9, and it features Podcasting support.  Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day.  Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world.  Check them out, and this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box.    Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well.   It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way.  There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like.    Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer.  The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive.  It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience.  Enjoy your iPod experience.

<Title>Believe the hype
<Date>Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have used three different iPod models since they were released a few years ago. They keep improving with age. What's great about this model: 1. previously, I had problems with battery life dissipating after a month or so of use (and I use mine hard; it's on at least six hours a day), but that hasn't happened with this one. I find that I get right around 15--fifteen!--hours of battery life on a charge. However, if I go two or more days between use, the battery runs itself down to almost nothing; 2. the vibrant colors are a wonderful change. Compared to the iPod Photo, the old black-and-white models look positively antiquated. The font on the Photo is updated as well; 3. to my untuned ear, I cannot tell the difference between what I hear on my earbuds and the CD the music came from. Sound quality is, as always, excellent; 4. the price drop. I paid $399 for my last 40g model and $299 for this 20 gig product, which is far superior to its predecessor. I don't need 40 gigs of space, so I was happy to make the compromise to save $100;  5. picture quality on the iPod is quite (surprisingly) good. It's like carrying an entire photo album with me. I have over 2,200 songs and 1,300 photos stored on my machine and it's little more than half full; and 6. it's frighteningly easy to use. I--a fairly competent computer, etc., person--have had a few glitches (see below) but nothing major. For the most part, you install the software, load some CDs on your comp, plug in the iPod, and go. I talked my mom through this process over the phone in under 15 minutes--this from a woman who asked that I "explain that whole e-mail thing again" to her.    What I'm not crazy about: 1. I'm not sure how the album art is stored; namely, why some have it and others don't. Anything downloaded from iTunes will have it, and some stuff from my own music collection does, too, but I can't figure out a pattern and have been too lazy to research it. Less than half of my music has album art to display without me manually adding it to iTunes; 2. I know that the "random" feature is the result of a complex algorithm and has, in fact, been proven to be truly random, but my iPod has a propensity for picking certain tracks while never playing others; 3. to lower the price, Apple's skimped on the accessories that come included with the iPods. In this model, no dock or case were provided as when I bought my 40g b&w model; 4. the displays on iPods scratch ridiculously easily. I recommend picking up an iSkin which is a colorful jacket that fits over the iPod and comes with a screen protector that works really well. Apple sells these for about $30 but they can be had on eBay for a third of the cost; 5. no way to delete songs directly from the iPod and no way to load photos onto the machine. Both of these things must be done from a computer; and 6. I hate being tied to iTunes. The software itself is good and improving all the time (the new version with PodCast capability is wonderful), but it's simply the fact that I don't have a choice in the matter. If you have an iPod, you HAVE to use iTunes, and that's irksome.   A quick word on Apple's customer service: if you register your iPod with them, you can request repairs or replacement parts for accessories at (usually) no charge within a year of purchase. So when your earbuds begin to fray (and they will), you can get a new pair simply for asking. I've done this four times with no problems, free of charge. They even ship new parts for free via FedEx. Whoa.  If you've been going back and forth on whether to buy one of these or not, I heartily encourage you to do so. They've never been more affordable or, well, awesome.

<Title>I Finally Got One!
<Date>Mon Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My best friend has a mini which I instantly fell deep in love with and when I got a new windows machine I started loading some music into itunes and before long I decided I too would like an Ipod.  Well, I'm not as well off as my friend so I saved and saved for a 4GB but just as I got enough for the mini the price for a color screen came down $100 so I got on my hands and knees and begged mommy and daddy and finally I had the $300 dollars for a new baby.  I got on apple and amazon to compare prices and it ended up that amazon was $30 dollars cheaper so I used the extra 30 to buy a decent case to protect my treasure.  It took no time to get here (Nebraska) and took less than a hour to get my 2500 songs and 500 photos. I am so happy I waited for a color screen it is beyond cool. I play solitare with the backlight most of the time when I listen to music so I obviously don't get 15 hours but I bet I could.

<Title>My first iPod
<Date>Fri Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've waited a long time to get my Pod. When the first photo iPods came out, I felt they were too expensive and my music collection was not extensive enough to warrant purchasing one. But now that have over 1500 songs on my iTunes and a growing collection of digital photos, I couldn't resist getting this latest iPod.   Basically I like it because I'm from the Sony Walkman generation where you could only play one cassette tape at time. To be able to carry around my entire music library and photos is truly a revolution for me.  That being said, the few problems with this Pod revolve around issues of navigation. I think you have to go through too many clicks to get such functions as song rating, the back button to the current song, accessing the shuffle function for a particular playlist. I also feel that Apple should use graphic navigations that is it well know for. That is to say, I would like to see graphic icons for the Music, Photo, Extras, and so forth.  For those of you considering buying the 20gb color iPod, I would say do so for the following reasons:  1. You' re on a tight budget, but don't want something as small as an iPod mini or Shuffle. (Keep in mind, you're going to spend about another 50 or 100 bucks buying accessories like a case, car adaptor, a dock and a memory card reader to store your photos directly from your camera.  2. If your music collection is between a 500 and two thousand songs, the Pod would be useful as you grow your collection. There's no point getting a 60gb Pod if your music collection is not large.   3. You also take lots of digital pictures.   4. This is your first Pod. Like me, this won't be the last Pod you'll get. So it makes for a good entry level MP3 (and photo) player.

<Content>I finally found out why almost everyone who has one,loves his/her iPod.I have purchased 4 flash memory and two HD based mp3 players,and the second I held this one in my hand,it was an epiphany."This is what everyone is raving about!" It feels almost silken in your hand.It's operation is completely ingenious.The sound is incredible.And downloading tracks from iTunes or my vast CD collection couldn't be easier.Even the supplied earbuds are comfortable!! really!! I must have smaller than average ears,because until now,earbuds really hurt.A lot. Anyway..I'm hooked now,and I can't imagine not having an iPod.What was I thinking???? Live and learn.BTW:This is not to say that the manufacturers of those other mp3players made lousy products.They were all fine,in their own way.But this one is simply the best I've heard/handled/used.Really.

It was a long frustrating experience.  I will be returning this and will buy my player from Sony.

<Title>Best of the Ipods
<Date>Sun Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This truly is the best of all the ipods. With at least 15 hours of battery life, over 5,000 songs and thousands more photos, and many other great features it rises above the rest. A bit overpriced but as i found it is well worth it. I recommend it only to big music goers.if your music library has over 800 songs I'd recommend this. I do not recommend minis. For the simple reason; price. At the apple stores Ipod 20 GB Photos are priced $300, while a 6 GB Mini is priced $250! Its a rip off. For an additonal 50 dollars you get 14 more gigs of space(roughly 4,000 more songs). Plus the Ipod Photo has a color screen for a more vivid experience. The new ipod photo is well worth the price.

<Title>Works Great, won't sync with PC
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Ipod Photo almost two weeks ago and spent 3 hrs with Apple tech support tyring to get it to synch with my Windows Xp machine.  Finally they said it might be defective, so I exchanged it for a new one at the store.  The new one synched up fine the first time, but now the computer won't recognize it and it does nothing during the sync.  I love the device otherwise when using it, and I wouldn't need to synch it very often for new music, but I would like to download the podcasts daily and I can't.  My sister has one with the same issue.  I would love for it to work, but I feel Apple doesn't have a good solid synch mechanism for the Windows world.  If I can't get it running with one more call to tech support, it's getting returned.  Update, 8.29.05:  I went out and purchased a new USB card for my computer and this corrected all the problems I had with the Ipod. I'm glad my issues are corrected, but I'm still miffed that the Ipod is not robust enough to be compatible with older USB ports.  My old ports are version 2.0 as is the new card, but the new one works and the old one does not.  The Ipod is a great product, but Apple needs to make it more compatible.

<Title>Third iPod in our home--I think I've got it right this time!
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My first iPod was an iPod mini.  Our second was an iPod mini for my husband.  Now, for our third iPod, my husband bought me this.  I should tell you that I am a cheap person and the fact that I have allowed us to buy 3 of these units is absolutely embarrasing and border line crazy for me.  (My husband got this one engraved so I couldn't return it.)  So why do I need 2 iPods?  Well, I started with the mini because I figured that 1000 songs is more than enough.  But it really isn't.  First of all, I had a lot more music in my CD library than I realized.  Second, there is a lot of free music to be had on the internet.  And I am talking about LEGAL music.  Amazon alone gave me access to free MP3's that I love.  Then in turn, after enjoying this great new music, I needed to buy a song here and there from these great new artists.  It adds up!  Then there are books to listen to and podcasts and you get the picture.  I am about to take a 3 hour trip and I have borrowed a book on CD from the library and have already loaded it onto my iPod so that I have it for the road.  No I will not keep it and copy it.  I just don't want to take a library item on the road and risk losing it or forgetting it.  My point is this--you might think that you don't have enough music to fill this up.  However, the iPod will change the way that you listen to music.   Take whatever number of songs that you think you would want on your player and double it.  If it is over 1000, consider the iPod rather than the nano.  Anyway, when I got my new iPod, several friends asked if they could buy my mini off of me.  Well, no!  I still use my mini for running and working out.  I have no use for the shuffle and the nano is beautiful but really--do I actually need 4 iPods in the house  I have tried other MP3 players.  I don't consider myself to be completely incapable on a computer but I could not figure out how to make them work with the computer.  I ended up returning them.  The iPod might be more expensive, but I love it and I can't imagine going to a different brand.  And to that point, my friend has a Rio.  Her husband set it up for her, then went to Iraq.  She wants to add more songs but can't figure out how to do it and therefore, hasn't used her Rio nearly as much as I use my iPods.  I really love using both of my iPods.  It has changed the way I listen to music!

<Title>SONGS, PHOTOS - ALL IN LIVING COLOR
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought 2 Apple 20GB IPOD Photos.  I am very happy with the color screen and easy to organize menus.  The software makes updating, managing, and using your IPOD a breeze.  My only real complaint is that the button system is a little slow to respond.  I sometimes end up hitting the play button 2 or 3 times because the IPOD is slow to respond.  The color display is KEY and having the album art on your IPOD is a really cool feature.  The only downside to that feature, however, is that if you don't get your music from ITUNES, you have to manually add your artwork for EACH SONG!!!!  When you have 3,000 songs, it can get a bit tedious.    Overall I am very satisfied with the IPOD and would only stick with apple as I am sure they will hammer out those types of problems in newer versions of the software.

<Title>Great product, but too easily scratched up
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my iPod for a couple weeks now and am very much enjoying it.  For the most part it works as expected, which is to say extremely well.  The iPods have garnered a great reputation over the years and it's clear why once you start using it.    The color screen is very clear and works pretty well for showing pictures even if it is fairly small.  The click wheel makes volume changes and menu navigation a snap and is very intuitive for volume adjustments.  Synchronizing the iPod to a PC is painless.  By default it just launched iTunes if it wasn't already open and started synchronizing the iPod to what was on the computer.  Accessing the iPod like a drive on your computer does require the changing of a setting in iTunes, but this is easily done.  There *are* a few problems with them that Apple really should address with the iPod though...  1. The click wheel works great for most functions, but for moving through your photo thumbnails it is *way* too sensitive pretty much forcing you to use the |&lt;&lt; and >>| buttons instead to move through your pictures.  2) Turning it on is all too easy and keeping it turned off is cumbersome.  I've completely drained my battery twice now by accident because I forgot to use the use the hold switch to disable the click wheel buttons after holding the play/pause button down to turn it off.  A simple, recessed on/off button would be a lot quicker and easier.  3) Most importantly though, these things scratch far too easily for such an expensive product that is designed to be carried around.  The underside is shiny and immediately begins accumulating fingerprints, and the screen seems to scratch just from looking at it.  If you're interested in keeping your iPod looking new, plan on a screen protector and/or case of some sort.  That aside, I'm very happy with my iPod.  I suppose the new Nano would have been handy since it's more portable but the standard iPod with its larger storage capacities is still pretty small and can better serve as a backup drive which makes it a great value in my opinion.  If it weren't for the durability issues this definitely would have been a 5-star product in my book.

<Content>The I-pod is amazing.  I am still figuring out I-Tunes though.  It would have been nice to have an instruction manual or a tutioural when you first download the program.  I immediately put it in a case to protect it (it can scratch very easily).  I haven't put any pics on yet but am interested to see how that works.  All in all I'm glad I got it and I'll be suprised if I ever use all the memory!  I don't rate it a 5 because of the software and the FM transmitter doesn't work as well as it should so I can't use it everywhere I bought it for.

<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you go to the contour design website, you can see pictures of the contour case.  It looks deceiving once you have th case in your hands, because they provide you with this plastic clear sleeve you are supposed to put on your ipod before shoving it into the actual case.  Well, even though that plastic sleeve is thin, it is just thick enough to make the ipod too fat for the case.  When you push the ipod + sleeve into the case, the sleeve starts to bunch up and creates waves that cover the screen.  These waves are not usually noticeable when the ipod is on. Additionally, once you get the ipod + sleeve into the case, there's no coming out.  I had to shove it in the case pretty darn hard. If you plan on never taking your ipod out of the case, which is difficult when u dock your ipod or use a tunebelt or anything like that, go ahead and get this case. I, however, should have gotten the contour showcase instead.

<Title>iPod Color: It's NOT Music to My Ears
<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Color is anything but music to my ears. First off, I had the unlucky misfortune to open my 20 Gig iPod Color package just as Apple's CEO was unveiling the iPod Video at a press conference, Wednesday Oct. 12. The computing press had recently been told that there was no video iPod "on the immediate horizon." Apparently, Apple pulled a fast one on all of us.  The release of the iPod Video wouldn't be so disappointing but for the fact that the new iPod Video features cannot be obtained by a firmware upgrade to existing Color iPods. Fortunately, for those lucky enough to have held out, the new iPod Video will reportedly offer 10 Gig more storage for the same list price as the now obsolete 20 Gig iPod Color. Unfortunately, for those of us who tore open the packaging in the day or week leading up to Apple's announcement, no such luck will spare the disappointment. Unlike a major software purchase, which many manufacturers will upgrade free-of-charge within a week or even a month before/after a new version release, recent iPod owners are not, it would seem, eligible for complimentary upgrades.   None of this news would have been quite so bad if the iPod I received as a gift yesterday simply worked. Having just completed an update to iTunes 5.01, I hooked up the iPod Color for the first time only to discover 700-some songs into the initial sync operation that nearly 2/3 of the remaining library cannot be copied to the device because of the dreaded "cannot copy/read/write" error. Thus, I begin a long and futile search at Apple.com only to realize that if I opt instead to call Apple for tech support, it will cost me my "one free incident" in the one-year warranty. I opt instead to go in search of consumer tips on the 'net, only to uncover mixed results. Apparently, a Firewire connection might fix this problem, but, alas, Firewire is now deemed an "accessory" in an ironic decision by Apple to drop out-of-the-box support for its Firewire-enabled Mac customer base (Firewire is faster than USB 2.0, whereas USB 2.0 is not offered on OS-X compatible last-gen G4 Macs, which is why the decision to render Firewire-enabled, but non-USB 2.0-enabled Macs incompatible with the contents of the iPod Color box seems ignorant at best, and calculating on Apple's part at worst). Ironies aside, it is nearly 2 a.m. and I won't find a single gadget store open. Regardless, I find others who report that the use of a Firewire cable didn't solve the read/write error after all. Neither, some claim, will a reset, restart, reformat, iTunes upgrade or firmware update. All the confusion aside, in the five minutes I spend listening with the included headphone buds, I note that the headset cord is already beginning to short (this used to be a common thing on AM/FM headsets in the 1980s, but I figured they would have licked the problem by now--like, NOT!).   Consider: If consumers had this sort of difficulty driving a brand new car off the lot, would they tolerate it? Cars have lemon law and gadgets have--gamble with your wallet? But of course, we have been conditioned by the computer industry to accept what in any other consumer product category would be intolerable. No worries, though: At any given time, the next big product is in development even as so-called current generation computer technology debuts. No wonder there is so little  time to work out the bugs!  In fairness to those who have had many years of enjoyment with previous incarnations of the iPod, though I've been using iTunes for a long while, this is my first experience with portable MP3 players. As such, I can't speak for anyone else; this review simply reflects MY experience with the product. It should be noted, nevertheless, that I'm anything BUT an Apple-hating PC user. I've owned Apple computer products, in fact, exclusively since 1995. Consequently, it is with great dissappointment that I recommend readers of this review to save their hard-earned money. It's difficult to appreciate the iPod's ingenious user interface, after all, when basic out-of-the-box functionality is lacking. Not that anyone interested in an iPod should despair, though. By next week Apple will probably announce the "iPod Deluxe," which will undoubtedly come complete with a robotic GPS-enabled base station that will enable the iPod Deluxe to do everything but scrub your kitchen sink. (It will order pizza, act as a smoke detector, give you the weather forecast and charge your cell phone at the same time, though!) Not to single out Apple, by any means. Innovation, in general, is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it drives new sales and attracts new customers; on the other hand, innovation trains once-, twice- and thrice-burned consumers to hold out for a bigger and better product announcement, never confident enough to sink a hefty chunk of change into what, in as little as five minutes, may be supplanted by a next-gen product that does more, does it faster, and does it for less money.   Bottom line? The iPod MA079LL/A is NOT music to my ears. I can only hope that others have better luck, for luck is what it seems to boil down to.

<Title>I Love this Thing!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought mine yesterday and I absolutely love it. I am getting ready to start a new job and my itunes at work had 1200 songs in it and I didnt want to lose them so I bought this puppy and bam now I can take my songs wherever I go. I also had 1850 pictures in photoshop and bang they are in the ipod too. All this and its only taking up about 6gb. Wow there is so much more I can put on this thing. I looked at the new ipod video, it was about 50 dollars more and had 30gb but I didnt need that much and the Griffin itrip for it was another 90 bucks. I got my ipod and griffin itrip for 300. I spent the extra 50 bucks and bought the extended warranty. Just in case. I love this thing and look foward to many hours, days, weeks, and years with this. Run out and buy it now cause its well worth the money.

<Title>I love my iPod!!!
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing.  The first night I purchased it, I stayed up until 4 a.m. downloading music ----- when I should have been studying for the Bar Exam.  LOL!  It's so easy to use.  I did a great deal of research prior to going with the iPod, but I am very, very happy with my choice.  I had heard all kinds of stories, but believe me, IF I CAN USE IT WITH EASE, ANYONE CAN!  I was mostly impressed with the quality of sound ---- aside from the ease of use.  Kudos to Apple for this wonderful product.  Another great thing is that I had all of my music collection at my fingertips during lunch when I sat for the exam!!!  Talk about a stress reliever...

<Content>The iPod is nothing short of a miracle. My 5000 song collection fits in the palm of my hand? with the griffin kit, can be played in the car off of the stereo? My God. Have had it 48 hours and wish I had gotten this sooner. (but am glad I waited as the new color screens are now out) This is nothing short of amazing. And they say Apple makes computers??!

<Title>I'm a convert!
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had never understood why I saw all those people walking the streets plugged into their iPods. Then, I bought my husband the 20gb iPod Photo for his birthday. Actually, as soon as I checked on out in the store, I got curious.  Two weeks after giving my husband his birthday gift, I treated myself to the same model.  I love it! Downloading is easy. Sure, we're locked in to iTunes, but the selection is great! I simply bought a prepaid card, and got busy buying music. As a fan of audiobooks, I used to carry my CD player and a bunch of CD's to listen to the books. Now I have the entire book, and over 100 songs on my iPod...and still have used less than 1 gb.  I'm hooked!

<Content>This iPod rocks.  I have had no problems with downloading any type of music regardless of the host.  I love the features.  I have also purchased an Altec Lansing speaker system which also charges and a Griffin iTalk for voice recordings.  I plan to also purchase the camera interface so that my iPod will store my digital photos when I travel, beats having to lug a laptop to store photos.  I love the quality of sound, the simplicity of design packed with so many features, and the available accessories to make this little white box so have to have.

<Title>Great IPOD!!!
<Date>Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this IPOD and I love all of the features on it but the only thing that I was very upset about was when I got the item I noticed that there was a scratch on the window of the ipod and you only see it when you turn the ipod on and off or when you shine light at a certain angle. As soon a I bought this IPOD I put into a case that it is completely protected but the scratch was already there when I took it out of the box. Please be careful when you buy IPODS. Make sure you take it out of the box very carefullly and also have a case to put into as soon as you buy one.  This IPOD stores 5,000 songs, the battery life is 15 hours, it stores pictures and the music sounds great! I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have that stupid scratch on the window. Good Luck to all who want to buy this IPOD. I highly recommmend it!!

<Title>A few surprises - not such a great product for us old folks
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I finally decided to buy an iPod - I decided to get this model because for the price of a Nano, if I could get one, I get a color display and 20GB of storage.  My first reaction is that it is much heavier than I had imagined, to the point where I'm not sure I'll really use this for listening to audio books while I go on walks, which is my intended purpose for this product.  I now understand the appeal of a Nano.  I wish I had actually seen one of these and held it before buying it.  A surprising, and really nice feature is that it can store photographs and display them (with an additional AV cable that I have now ordered) on a television in either NTSC or PAL format.  I can see getting a lot of use out of this feature when travelling in Europe.  Apparently the iPod can load photographs directly from a digital camera.  I find the documentation and user interface to be difficult and confusing.  If you regularly need reading glasses you may find this device hard to use.  The documentation itself is produced in a very faint font that is hard to read.  I have to think the Apple will eventually come out with products that are friendlier to people over age 50.  This model, at least, has an interesting "click-wheel" interface that is not really explained in the user manual and was not obvious to me.  Some simple controls, like an on-off button, would be really nice.

<Title>Quility mp3 player but.....
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For a good while...I've been searching for a mp3 player. First, I looked at a creative, but a friend told me his bitter experience with it and decided not to take a chance...I went to the darkside and got an iPod. At first, I loved it, it felt great, iTunes worked great on my PC, the sound quility was impressive, and the screen looked real sharp; even on the simple screen you get when you play music it looks great...but you know the old saying, nothings perfect, and this applies to the iPod.       The First thing the irked me was that the screen sratches....real easy...and to make that worst, you don't get a case. So after three weeks of merrily owning my iPod, I noticed a nice  sized strach on the screen, sighed, and bought a nice case(it better of been...it was thrity dollars), and that helped me sleep at night, knowing my iPod would last for a little longer       The second thing was that it wasn't compatible with Yahoo! music engine, I couldn't put all my favorite playlists onto my iPod as subscription music...so I had to buy it. Boy did that suck. I thought abot returning it to get one compatible with it, but had owned it for a month and gotten rather attached to it, so no big deal, I moved on and just decided to spend an extra dollar or two.       The thrid thing is no FM radio. Such, some of those annoying iPod freaks will say 'you can have 5,000 songs...why do you need a radio,' well some of us don't and te radio is nice to have just to check in on your favorite game or just listen to something else. Nothing big just saying.        So, if you are looking for a mp3 player, just remember, its  alot of money and is an investment, just a car or hosue, (just not as big) so just make sure to shop around and find the one right for you. If you don't mind spending more money, then an iPod is great; it'll last you, but...if you have Yahoo! music engine, are stubborn and want to get a case with your mp3 player, or don't want to spend more money on getting radio, then the iPod might not be right for you.

<Title>Using iPod for storing pictures is not a good idea
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was traveling to India in August and decided to get a mass storage device to store my digital pictures on. After comparing many different ways of doing it I went with an iPod. My philosophy was that I could bring music and listen to it on the airplane, and when returning home from India I could use it as an mp3 player. The price was also much better than the competitors who only focused on storing pictures.  My first problem with iPod was when I tried to transfer music to it. I always thought that Apple products were user friendly, but I just couldn't figure out how to transfer the music files to the iPod. I eventually had to ask a friend for help. Transferring music from your computer to your iPod is what you do all the time, so I don't understand why it's not more obvious how to do that. Like a big fat icon would be nice.  So the day before departing I started filling up my iPod. I thought I'd fill it and then delete music as I needed space for my pictures. But here is another example of how Apple's user-friendliness is just plain stupid. It turns out you can't delete music unless you hook it up to a computer. How crazy is that? So I ended up having a very small amount of music when I left, and basically I couldn't use my iPod for what I wanted...listen to music.  Once in India I hooked up my camera to the iPod to transfer pictures. I had about 700 megs of pictures to be transferred. About 45 minutes into the transfer the iPod just stopped. For no reason it decided it was done. I wasn't sure if the pictures had transferred correctly. You can't brows the pictures if the transfer was interrupted, so I had to start over again. But here is another major problem with the iPod:  The batter is barely strong enough to transfer 1 gig of pictures. And it takes well over an hour to so. So if your transfer was interrupted you have to wait until the battery is fully recharged to start over. It takes easily 5 hours to recharge the battery. This is nothing you want to do while on vacation.  The endless heart stoppers doesn't end here. One time on my trip the iPod decided to freeze. I was browsing through my pictures when it suddenly just froze. My heart stopped for a minute I am sure. I didn't know what to do and left it to drain the battery. Once the battery is drained (overnight) it crashed, and when I turned it on again it rebooted. No loss of pictures luckily. From thereon I didn't use the iPod for anything else than transferring pictures. No browsing, no listening to music. I couldn't afford losing pictures on this trip.  Recharging is also very flawed. There is an icon that indicates how much juice you have left. I sometimes left it to recharge over night and in the morning it was still only 50% recharged. Sometimes it would indicate fully recharged, but after turning it on jumping down to 50%. And while transferring the charge would drop in to the red, and once done it would go up again. Totally unreliable and flawed part of the iPod. You just don't want this to happen while on vacation.  I don't suggest anyone getting an iPod to store pictures on. You need something reliable when you're serious about taking pictures. iPods are for listening to mp3s and nothing else. iPods are unreliable so if you decide to get one, don't put stuff on that you value. And if you made the mistake of purchasing an iPod already, I would suggest you have backup plans in case your iPod conks out...which happened about 5 times in three weeks for me.

<Title>Very good, but also very flawed
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As much as I love my iPod, the product is blighted by a multitude of intrinsic flaws which detract from the overall experience.  First of all, let me say that this thing is truly beautiful.  An elegant white case with a phenomenally detailed colour screen, the iPod is without doubt the most fashionable MP3 player on the market.  Now I've said that, I must also comment on its flaws.  Firstly, the battery life.  My previous MP3 player was a Creative Zen Touch which boasted a battery life of over 24 hours.  The iPod, by way of comparison, has a meager 15 hours.  This limitation, to me, is the most significant flaw of this product.  Another problem lies in the iPod's navigation system.  Imagine that, while playing a song you decide to flick through the menus, perhaps to look at a photo.  As soon as you've left the now playing menu it is impossible to return to the now playing list.  That is, you can still skip through the songs, but you have no idea what's next on the list until you've heard it.    That said, the iPod is a very good MP3 player; probably among the best available.  If you can live with its flaws, I recommend the iPod wholeheartedly.  Just be aware of the issues with this product.

<Title>KICK ASS!
<Date>Tue Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Very nice. Resoulution is kick ass, and the video out on it is also, again, kick ass. The sound quality is great, and I love how small it is. I used to have a Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Extra, OMG! its a brick, and it was only 20 gig as well. The screen was so dark I could never read it. The transition is crazy. I downloaded itunes a year ago, and then installed the Ipod software within 10 min, and in another 20 min, all my songs were instantly on the ipod, much nicer that the drag and drop feature on the Zen Extra. Also, the fact that you can use it as an harddrive for your normal data is UBER COOL! I can carry all my word and powerpoint documents on the go! The Battery life is spectaular. Ive used it for 2 days for about 4 hours a day, and its only 1/2 used. Great job apple, your work is awesome!

<Title>A great machine
<Date>Tue Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm not a Macophile, do not own an Apple computer and have never bought anything from Apple. Until now. This is a great machine and is far superior to the junk it replaced.  One of the main factors in my decision to get this particular iPod was its ability to also downoad and store photos from a digital camera (which requires the camera connector, sold separately). It works very well in that regard. Just don't get the idea that this iPod is designed to display those photos; the LCD screen is no bigger than that on your camera.  My other criteria was that it play MP3 files, and it does that just fine. I imported my entire MP3 library (over 5000 files) very quickly and uploads files to the iPod itself quickly, too.  My only peeve with the iPod is that it uses the same port to charge as it does for USB connection (though it does charge via USB also, albiet slower) so that if you want to charge and, say, downoad photos simultaneously, you're out of luck.  Other than that, this machine is almost flawless.

<Title>Ultimately, recommended
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've encountered quite a few problems using the iPod, in particular in regards to the establishment of a good connection between the computer and the iPod. Sometimes iTunes didn't recognize the iPod (while my computer did identify it) and on other times, the songs download was stopped due to freakish errors. I sort of solved these problems (I hope) by installing the newest versions of iTunes and iPod-updater, switching between several USB slots and some prayer. The iPod works fine once it's loaded with songs, though it really bothers me that it doesn't know how to relate to hebrew song titles, so it ignores them completely (meaning, it shows blanks where the song title should be). Also, a lot of the problems may be resolved, at least temporarily, by resetting the iPod. So, overall I'd recommend it, provided you have the patience to deal with its inevitable quirks and malfunctions (plus it looks really cool...).

<Title>After my son's Shuffle, my wife & I bought 2 20GB Color iPods
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, we received a free Shuffle iPod from opening a new checking account in the new state we recently moved to.  I tried it out and put some songs on it.  I was hooked!  I gave the Shuffle to my son and bought 2 20GB Color iPods for my wife and me.  We love them and put our music, audio books, podcasts, photos, and files on them.  This thing is great and sounds fantastic.  I think our CD collection may be dead or in storage after we load them to iTunes.  :-)  I can only recommend this and really believe it is a great value for the money.  Enjoy and have fun.  By the way, be sure to have the latest version of iTunes loaded, the latest version of the software loaded on the iPod, don't try loading your music via USB1.0.  This really needs USB2.0.  Just some helpful hints for those who don't follow the directions like I did... it will save you some heartache and time in the long run.

<Title>Good... no... AMAZING
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Storage space: 20 GB is good enough for me (5,000 songs anyone?), and it really isn't worth spending about $100 more for a 60 GB iPod (15,000 songs...whoa) or something else, unless you have a massive amount of music. Trust me, for most people out there, 20 GB of space is fine for both music and pictures (25,000 pictures, according to Apple anyway).  Sound quality: If you've been reading articles on the iPod, whatever they say about its amazing sound quality us 100% true. It's kind of hard to explain how good it really is, but for a basic idea, let's just say that it beats any other mp3 or CD player by a lot.  Photo viewing: Excellent screen. I see all my photos clearly on my iPod. The color and photo feature are definitely a very nice touch. It makes it more convenient to show people pictures from a vacation or other things like that. If you're on a vacation and the memory on your digital camera runs out, you can transfer your pictures to your iPod so you can take all the pictures you want. Of course, you'll have to buy an extra adapter, but it's worth it.  Additions: You also get to keep contacts, notes, and view a calender or the time on the iPod. There's also a handy alarm clock too. You get some games, too, which include solitaire, brick, parachute, and music quiz. Looking for your music won't be a problem either. The iPod keeps everything organized, so finding a certain song will be a breeze.  Cost: It's true, iPods are a bit on the pricy side. Whether you're going to get one or not is your choice, but it's obviously the best mp3 player on the market. While it is $299, it's got more storage space than the iPod nano, which is only 4 GB when you pay $249. Basically, there's only a $50 difference between the 20 GB photo, and the 4 GB nano that has color but no photo viewing capability. If you're debating on getting a previous generation iPod, you'll save money but it's always better to get the current generation.  What does it work better on? PC or Mac?  Well, the Mac has everything for it but you'll have to install some Adobe stuff for transferring photos to the iPod. It's not that big a deal.  Durability: It'll definitely withstand a few falls, but you should avoid that. And watch out, because it scratches easily. Getting a case is recommendable.   By the way, the click wheel is so addictive.

<Title>The sound of iPod
<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't actually own an iPod, though I want one, so I cannot comment on durability, scratchability, reliability, or any other time-determined thing. What I can say is this:  1. The look good, feel good, are small, and are generally better in all physical aspects than my current mp3 player (a Zen xtra 40 gb)  2. The SOUND: Many people say that the iPod doesn't sound as good as other players. I own a Zen (renowned for their good sound-- Creative makes the Soundblaster Audigy II soundcard, which is extremely popular). I listened to a 128kbps mp3 version of Miles Davis' 'So what' on an iPod in the Student Stores of my school, and was surprised at how good it sounded (I used my own headphones, a pair of Sony's that have good sound quality). I then listened to the same song with the same headphones (and allegedly the same formatting and kbps), and it also sounded good. I revisited the store, and can still not really tell a difference between the iPod and the Zen.  I wrote this review because I bought the Zen because it was supposed to have better sound quality than the iPod. It might, it's just not a noticable difference on a pair of 20 dollar sony headphones.  Apparently, there have been some quality gripes about iTunes' variable-bitrate mp3 encoding sound quality, so it might be a software thing, not an iPod thing. This can be circumvented by using another program (like windows media player) to write the mp3, and then use iTunes to do whatever else with it.  Anyway, a quick summary: the iPod sounds as good, at a quick glance, as a Zen, which is pretty near cd-quality on a 180 dollar Sony stereo system (by far not audiophile equipment, but enough to make the zen sound really good).

<Content>The iPod is an awesome investment.  It beats carrying around bookcases of cd's.  Plus it can show pictures.  I love everything about the iPod.  One suggestion, try to get an iPod case before you buy one, and put it in the case as soon as you get it.  The back is pretty, but it gets scratched easily.  Again the iPod is great.

<Content>I love iPod. I really do. But does Apple really need to make them out of such flimsy scratchable material? During the time I opened the box and drove to a local store to buy a case for it, the chrome was scratched. Frankly, I was disappointed in the cheap quality of the exterior of this player. For this price, Apple should include a case, or improve the quality of the faceplate and rear-plate of the device.   I do however, like how it works. Synchronizing with iTunes is a snap. Finding and locating songs was easy. So far, it works perfectly with Audible, and my online radio subscriptions.  I give the iPod 4.5 stars. But the quality of the exterior was disappointing. I recommend all iPod users transfer the iPod directly from its retail box into a case to avoid scratching the soft plastic or the 'chrome' rear-plate.
