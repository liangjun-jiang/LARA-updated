<Product Name>iRiver H10 20 GB MP3 Player/Recorder Red
<Title>A Well Made Appliance That Will Follow You Everywhere
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the iRiver H20 a month or so ago, so that I'd have something to keep me occupied between classes (other than studying Calculus - who goes to college and actually studies?).  I'm quite amazed with the amount of abuse that the H20 has withstood thus far.  Every day, it gets tossed into my duffle bag along with a couple textbooks, my lunch (which is somehow always damp by the time I get to it), a binder, and various pointy objects.  When I'm at home, I use it whenever I'm washing dishes, lifting weights, and doing just about anything else.  Thus far, the screen hasn't scratched, the translucent rubber sleeve that comes packaged with the iRiver hasn't torn or allowed the shiny red exterior to get scratched, the moisture from my aformentioned damp lunch and from washing dishes hasn't killed it, and even the jarring from being inside my duffle bag doesn't seem to have affected it.  For anyone that has even the slightest idea how to use a computer, the iRiver should be a snap to use.  The iRiver does come with a cd that contains Windows Media Player 10 - and it can come in handy . . . sometimes.  But, the easiest way to manage your mp3 collection is the simple, older-than-dirt, drag-and-drop method.  You can create folders and subfolders directly, so you'll know exactly where your music is if you decide to pick a song by browsing the folders instead of picking an artist.  If you have USB 2.0 and a computer with a sufficient amount of RAM, then you shouldn't have any problems putting files onto, and removing them from your iRiver.  One thing to mention, is once you select a file or group of files to add\remove from your iRiver, wait until the selected action has completed before attempting another.  If you start one action and then try to start another while the other is still in progress, the later action takes precedent and your computer really begins to lag while it holds the first action on the backburner.  This isn't the fault of the iRiver, but there is only a set amount of bandwidth that your USB ports can handle.  But just like with any product, you learn how to use it to its peak efficiency so that you get the most out of it and don't waste precious time.  Basically the only thing that comes with your iRiver other than the disk with WMP10 and the rubber sleeve for your iRiver, is the power cable and the USB connector.  Although these are in reality two different cables, you must connect them together in order to recharge your iRiver.  The cable that connects your iRiver to your USB port can be used independently.  The power cable hooks into the USB cable.  From past reviews, you may have heard that the power cable doesn't want to stay connected unless you go to extreme measures (like "taping the cables together").  I'm not sure where the person who said that got it.  It's possible he got a defective one, because mine seems to work just fine.  The power cable stays hooked into other cable without a problem.  The iRiver also fully recharges (from a dead battery) in right around 4 hours (give or take).  Don't expect to receive your iRiver with a full battery.  Mine came with about 25 minutes of battery life when I took it out of the box.   All in all, H20 is quite a machine.  I've found it to be reliable, and well worth the $270 I paid for it.      *whispers* get the red one . . .

<Content>I really like this Iriver H10 MP3 player/recorder.  It's so convenience for me when I have recorded my lectures everyday and until now I still go online searching for promotion from amazon.com to buy the other one.  I hope that everybody who buy stuff from amazon.com always get same nice and convenience customer service as I did.      I look forward to get more interested stuff from amazon.com

<Title>Adorable, great sound, great vaule
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, for everyone who thinks that only the iPod has style--take a look at the iRiver. It's sleek and sexy as well as being fairly light. The controls are easy to use and figure out. The only gripe I have is that the power button should be recessed so it isn't so easy to turn it on and off if the player is in your purse or your pocket. It does have a locking mechanism so no harm no foul.  The playlists can be generated through Windows Media or you can generate a quicklist on the fly. I would suggest using Media player unless you are just compiling a list of a few songs.  The sound quality is excellent! And the headphone provided are OK considering they are the freebie type. The radio and voice recorder are also excellent--and there aren't many MP3 players that include both at this price! Ahhh and the battery life is really good! It lasts for about six to seven hours for me.  Overall, this is a great player, with a great look, great sound, and excellent value. If you don't want to get locked into the iTunes monopoly and want more flexibility with services such as Rhapsody, Napster, or Yahoo Music this player is for you.

<Title>Fine for music, not audiobooks
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iRiver series has some great advantages for music. It offers gapless playback, avoiding two-second pauses when listening to a complete album (which can ruin continguous transitions on albums such as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon). And many reviews suggest it offers higher fidelity for complex sound.  One downside: This is one of the only players not supported (at least explicitly) by audible.com, favored as having the largest library of downloadable audiobooks/ebooks. There are some ways around that, such as third-party software that requires being a bit more tech savvy than you might be. But if audiobooks are your thing, an alternative (such as the Creative Zen line, or the industry-leading iPod) may be preferable.

<Title>A fantastic player you shouldn't hesitate to buy
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I heard of the H10 before it even got released, for I used to own an iRiver SlimX 400 CD-MP3 player that was just perfect.  You couldn't ask more from a CD-MP3 player (it was absolutely thin and even had games!).  I had seen the H10 while downloading firmware updates for this player, and when it was nicked in the subway, I made a quick decision and bought one of the first red H10s sold.  PROS: I could talk and talk about this all day.  They are, mainly,  - Battery life | it's better than expected, and way better than an ipod's.  It will certainly last you enough to listen through a whole day uninterrupted, or a long transcontinental flight, and to go back home and charge it.  With normal use (3-4 hrs a day) I can use it for about a week.  It does depend on whether you use the screen for pictures or changing settings really frequently or only sparingly.  - Sound quality - Buy sound-isolating earphones like the Shure e2c and it'll be bliss.  But the bundled earphones are really good anyway, they're the Sennheiser mx400s, which have a relatively loud sound, balanced bass, treble, etc., and are way better than iPod bundled phones.  Besides they're black, which reduces the risk of being a crime victim.  - Design - I absolutely love it.  Beautiful little chromed details are great, and the red is astounding.  Don't be fooled by the photo here in Amazon, the touchpad is light grey instead of black.  - Compatibility - You can play almost all kinds of music files without a hitch.  You can buy from any music store aside from iTunes and listen easily.  - Ease of use - No installation required!  (ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS XP).  You can use to sync with Windows Media Player, as I do, and then it will just copy all your music files and the images in any folder you specify, optimised for the device.  Choose Automatic Sync to do this.  If you'd prefer to drag and drop the files just use the "Emergency Connection" setting: reset the player, then connect the player, and finally press the o button while turning the player on.  This will make the device appear as just a new hard drive.  Copy your music to the "MUSIC" folder and you're ready to go!  - Case included - It's one of those translucent silicon cases so popular with iPod.  I don't like it, but it's really safe.  - Easy interface - Way easier than other iRiver products.  - Firmware updates - iRiver allows you to download improvements of the player's features.  They erase all your files, but you can resync it with your computer and you're set.  Any annoying things on the player can be solved by this (and my SlimX experience tells me they will).  - All the extra features: record from FM radio, SRS-WOW really improves sound...   CONS Really few, but they include:  - Has a tendency to crash - A LOT.  If it stops responding, just do not touch it for two minutes (as in 120 seconds).  If it doesn't budge, use a paper clip to press the Reset button and that's it.  No settings or music are lost.  It can be quite bothering, though, to need a paper clip that often.  This will likely be fixed with firmware updates.  - Case doesn't identify Play, Forward and Back buttons - To use them with a case, you have to either look at it intently or memorise their exact location.  There's no little plastic bump or something that tells you where a button is.  This makes operation without seeing the player difficult for the first few weeks.  - Picture viewing is average: pics will either appear pixelated (if compressed automatically with Windows Media Player) or take time to load (if loaded as-is).  - Awkward charger - If you want to charge the player, you need to connect a special cable with a proprietary plug into the device, and then plug a "black brick" AC charger to the cable itself.  This means that, if you're going on a holiday, you need not only the bulky charger but also a second cable with the USB plug.  What's with the proprietary charges?  Why can't we just have standard power inputs in consumer electronics?   And now, my warranty/support experience.  I can easily say that this has been the best warranty and support experience I have had in my life.  After a couple of months of using the player, the hard drive had a failure.  Living in a high altitude place, and subjecting the player to an 'intense life', this is perfectly possible.  I was totally and absolutely depressed, since I live in Mexico and had purchased the player on a trip to the States.  No company (Sony even runs TV adverts remembering you of it) honours an American warranty here, so you buy their heavily premiumed items here.  The H10 is sold in stores here for well over $500.  I just thought it was a lost cause.  I was going to stash the H10 in a drawer and go off and buy the overpriced Mexican version, when I decided to call iRiver Support (USA) in my free time through Skype.  An American rep answered the line in about five minutes (if it's hard for you to understand reps from India imagine someone who knows English as a second language and is speaking from a computer).  He asked some brief questions and then emailed me a recovery files with instructions.  When that failed, I just emailed it through their nice customer support web system, and within a couple of hours I had a RMA number to return product.  So far so good!  I called again and asked if there'd be a problem to have the replacement shipped to Mexico on my expense.  No problem!  They specified to send the player without any accesory or instruction manual.  So, I DHLed the player to their offices, and it arrived there on Friday December 23 in the morning.  Well, imagine my surprise when, on December 24, I was greeted with an extra Christmas present: a brand new (didn't say refurbished anywhere) H10 player, in its box with all the new accesories: headphones, case, etc etc etc.  Best of all, it had arrived through UPS Expedited Next Day, something that probably cost about $60 USD, and with all taxes prepaid (probably $30 at least).  I was amazed at the efficiency (they probably dispatched the replacement in a couple of hours at most) and by the kindness of doing something they didn't promise in their warranty policy.  Just because of that, I can tell you: buy from a company that cares about its customers; especially now that Apple is ignoring consumer plight regarding the badly designed Nano screens (here in Mexico they are outright refusing warranty, benefitting from the difficulty of suing and the lack of regulation).  I have known iRiver cares because of the release of all those firmware updates for products they have, after all, already sold.  But this makes it perfectly clear.  Buy a fantastic product that has great looks and is made by a good company, the H10.

<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought this for the wife at christmas, loaded up around 1k songs quick enough, but some songs would suddenly just not play, eventually you wouldnt be able to play any and i would have to "recover" the drive (i.e. wipe it and re-sync the music). This happens like every week now.  Have emailed to IRIVER 3 times now over 10 day period. No reply. They provide no telephone number that i can find.  Going to try and return it to Amazon now, at least they give good customer service.  It may well be that i just have a bad drive, but Iriver dont seem to care about it.

<Title>Frustrating
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, first off...I ordered this item in November, and got it in January.  They ended up sending me two and charging me twice.  The picture says it is red and black, but it is red and silver.  Which made me mad.  Then, it isn't even recognized on my windows system, so I download the hardware they ask me to, and it doesn't help.  Now I've had this IRIVER for about a week, and I haven't been able to get any songs on it.  I read the instructions, and it was not clear whatsoever.  It skipped around to different things and didn't stay on track like, "1. plug it in, 2. insert disk"  It would go from "1. plug it in, 2. FM radio keys"    It was hard to follow, and I have kept messaging tech support for www.iriveramerica.com.  They made me sign up for an "ebox" because they only would email me directly through their website, it kept going down, and the messages have trouble sending.  I have gotten one response from about 4 emails.  Now, I sit here with my iriver.  It has no songs, and it won't hook into my computer.  I tried recording some songs onto it through its recording mic...but I had a few bad recordings, and can't even figure out how to delete them.  I really wish I didn't buy this product.  It is not user friendly.

<Title>I really wanted to like it, but....
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just ordered this iRiver from Amazon about 2 weeks ago. I did a lot of research about which mp3 player to buy, and despite mixed reviews I decided to go with the iRiver H10. Overall it was OK. I returned it to Amazon after a few days. The second day I had it, I tried connecting it to my computer to download more music, but Windows Media Player didn't recognize it. I checked all the cords and requirements, and they were fine. After some online research, I discovered that this is a common problem that iRiver hasn't figured out a solution to. I emailed the iRiver website (which I read is notorious for ignoring customers), and never got a response. I tried resetting the player, and mysteriously it worked again.      At this point, I was willing to give the iRiver another chance. However, the next day the screen froze and I had to reset it yet again. Now I was pretty annoyed and I decided to return it to Amazon. I liked the iRiver's design and menus, but Windows Media Player was not my favorite application. Since my computer had iTunes, I had to rip all my cd's again. It was just not worth the hassle. I'm not sure whether I would recommend this mp3 player. It could've just been mine that was defective, but from what I read from online there are a lot of problems with these players and almost nonexistent support from the iRiver website.

<Title>Great Value But There Are A Few Quirks
<Date>Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned Iriver machines since the late 1990s/early 2000s and I must say I have always been pleased. After owning a small 512MB MP3 player for a number of years I figured it was time for a replacement. So I figured I would list some Pros and Cons to this little machine.  Pros:  1. It costs a lot less than most MP3 players in its class, in addition it is a great value compared to most 5GB and 6GB MP3 players, this DOES have a 20GB capacity.  2. This MP3 Player plays all types of music (WMAs and WAVs to MP3s)and can do playlists you make on Windows Media Player.  3. It has many features you don't usually find; it can do picture shows, has a radio (where you can also pre-set your favorite stations), can record, read text files, has a clock/timer/and alarm.  4. You can customize the way you listen to the music. It has shuffle function, a number of ways the sound comes across (From Hard Rock to Rap).  Cons:  1. I had a few problems uploading music from the computer onto the device. For instance I would recieve an error message in addition it would somtimes freeze and I would have to restard Windows Media Player in addition to the player.  2. The player occasionally freezes and needs to be restarted using a paper clip through the little button on the top of the device. I have had this happen a few times and its a bit annoying.  3. This is a minor problem but if you download albums that are called the "Greatest Hits" the player will mesh them together (no matter if they are by Blondie or ZZ Top).

<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>since everyone was getting mp3 players (mainly ipods) i decided to research them and get one.  after comparing different brands models etc, i found that ipods are the worst ones.  yes they work fine, but for the cost....no.   Pro- 20+g ipod is $250ish +, where my 20g iriver was $146.  there were many many more that i was looking into that were all around $150.   Con- cant delete items off the device, no video (but its a mp3 player not a dvd player so that point doesnt count. if i wanted to watch videos i would of looked into a video device.)  so if you want an affordable and all around very nice mp3 player look into irivers.

<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Good bang for the buck! So far pretty good at doing what I wanted. Hooked it up to my old auto cassette player with one of those cheap adapters and walla: tons of music to enjoy. I'm sure there are fancier units for a much higher price.  Not one for reading/following instructions but had it up and running within an hour after charging. It's been relatively easy to navigate the knobology. Can't understand why the docking intreface on all these mp3 players can not be standardized. It must be APPLE and their proprietary cultural ways.  That's the only con I've found so far..As far as I know there are limited docking venues for the Irivers.

<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is excellent for the price.  The software is standard Windows media player.  I used the latest media player without any problem.  The hardware interface such as the touch-screen type buttons work well.  Over all, it is a good buy for storage size and well constructed piece of hardware.  It only supports USB 2.0.  USB 1.1 is too slow to transfer a huge amount of MP3 files anyway.  If you do not have USB 2.0, buy a USB 2.0 PCI card and install it in your computer.  It is worth it.

<Title>Don't waste your money!!
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am the unhappy owner of several H10's and initially there were no problems, but the closer they got to the end of the one-year warranty, the more problems they all started having.  Problems include freezing up for no apparent reason, scrolling in Chinese, and the most irritating is when the "system files are missing" and you have to reinstall the firmware and redownload ALL of your music.  The company doesn't believe in customer service - you can't get through on the phone and they take days to respond to email.  I have returned two because the hard drives crashed and it took 3-4 weeks to get them back, and then one of them crashed again as soon as I got all the music redownloaded and I had to return it and wait another 3 weeks.  I have a problem with one that has now gone out of warranty and iRiver told me they won't touch it and to look for a repair shop online.  So save yourself alot of headaches and time, not to mention money, and don't buy an H10 player.

<Content>Regretfully, I bought an H10 20GB some time ago.  Within the first couple months it died so I call iriver and made arrangements to send it back.  It took several weeks to get it back.  The one that came back was dead out of the box.  I spent about 3 days trying to reach iriver to send this one back.  The guy I spoke to told me that this item was seeing a lot of defects and returns.  That was about 1 month ago.  They said they sent a replacement - it never got here?  Now I cannot get any response from iriver.  I like to go to stores to see products then go to AMZN for the prices - iriver's stuff is not anywhere to be found in any of the major chain stores...  these guys are going out of the game....

<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In October 2006 my Iriver H10 died a couple of days before my warranty expired.  I contacted Iriver about it and did not get ANY technical support whatsoever.  You don't get a person when you call and the ebox wasn't helpful either.  Finally, after 2 months of being given the runaround, they said that they'd replace my H10.  I mailed it back to them in December 2006.  I then received an email stating that I should allow UP TO 3 weeks for my replacement to be shipped.  It is going on NINE weeks and I still have no player. In my ebox I received a message saying that they were sorry for the delay in my response, but that my case had been assigned to someone who is no longer with the company and was overlooked.  I was then instructed to call or email them and they would "look into the matter".  This company's customer service department is TERRIBLE.  I had liked my player alright before it died, but trying to get the matter resolved has definitely been the biggest hassle I've ever had in dealing with a company like this.    DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY IRIVER PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>I bought an iriver H10 20GB in Nov 2005.  It froze up and required resetting within the first week.  I returned it only to receive another one just like it the next month.  Neither unit ever worked when I wanted it to.  It constantly froze up and/or turned itself on (even in lock mode) only to run down the battery.  Most upsetting is that I spent $270 on an MP3 player that NEVER worked and then had to spend another $250 on an iPod this February.  Good news- the iPod has never failed!

<Title>6 total iRivers
<Date>Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned a total of six iRiver's over the years.  My first is a 40GB unit that has been going strong for over four years.  The next two were smaller 1GB units and although they are still working, my kids wanted more capacity so we bought two H10 20GB units.  They are going on two years old and haven't had one issue.  Lastly, I bought my wife a 30GB unit about 1 1/2 years ago and she's never had an issue with it.  The thing we like best about the IH series is that they are recognized by your PC's USB port as just another drive.  It couldn't be easier to manage your video and music files them simply using Windows Explorer to copy and past files to your iRiver.  Maybe I've been lucky or others have been unlucky but either way, I'd take these iRiver units over the ipods any day.  Apple has tried to control how you use the unit in order to boost their profits.  I like them but wouldn't take one over the iRiver's.
