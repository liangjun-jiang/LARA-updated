<Title>Virtually Flawless
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, im gonna start off by sayin that this MP3 player is absolutely amazing. It has a color screen, touch sensative pad, and the instalation software is incredibly easy. It could display photos, and has a voice and FM radio recorder. and ofcoarse it has its own FM radio tuner, which has a pretty damn good reciever. The only flaws that i have seen with it is that it is very prone to finger prints makin it very had 2 keep all shiny but its easy to clean, and the seperate carryin case eliminates that problem. The only other problem is that seenin as though it is a relatively new product, there are not many accessories for it.

<Title>Finally, an mp3 player worth every penny
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been wanting an mp3 player for 3 years, but due to a lack of a job or cash, I was unable to get one worth its salt. I started working at Kroger a few weeks ago(from the time I wrote this), so I finally have an income. Thus, the search for an mp3 player began.   I looked at the iPod video, and was set on getting that one for awhile. I mean how cool would it be to carry around videos, music, photos, and anything else you could think of, in one pocket-sized gadget? Apple at that point had another willing customer. But then, after more research, I realized just how lame it would be to have to really take care of it, as it does indeed, scratch ultra-easy, and before long, your screen will look like a cat attacked it after a few trips in your pocket. It would get so burdensome, I think, to have to deal with that.  I went to Wal Mart a couple of weeks back, and my eyes caught a small black mp3 player in the display case...This was the Philips GoGear 6 GB. I was instantly attracted to its sleek design and just how wicked cool it looked. I also noticed that it was a little over $100 cheaper than the iPod. Sure, it didn't have near as much space, or video capability, but it still had a nice variety of features. I'll describe them now:  FM Radio: You can listen to the radio on the GoGear, and for such a small item, it picks up a NICE signal. I have 2 rock-station presets on mine(the only rock stations in my area) that both come in crystal-clear. When tuning for a station, you slide your thumb up or down on the touchpad, and a little indicator shows where you're at, much like an alarm clock or small radio's tuning device.   FM Radio Recording: I haven't fiddled with this feature yet, but you can record what you are listening to on the radio, and it's quite easy to do so.   Protective Rubber Case: Included in the package is a rubber case that does actually protect the player, and has a nice feel to it. You might want to cut a small hole in the center of the top of it, because it blocks the headphone jack. A minor, easily fixable flaw.   Earbuds: The included earbuds are a bit new to me, feel-wise, but they look awesome, and sound great! They could compare to the seemingly-perfect sounding white iPod earbuds. These things put out some killer sound.   Voice Recording: This to me, is a really fun and useful feature. You can record messages to yourself(when you have nothing better to do...lol), record your friends' saying things, or even take them to class and record a lecture. I have roughly 3.5 gigs of space taken up on my GoGear, and there is still 3 hours of voice recording available.   Pictures: It took me a while to figure out how to get pictures to show up on the GoGear. They would transfer with ease, (you must use Windows Media Player, you cannot use Windows Explorer)but would not be detected in the player itself. Also, the picture files must be in JPEG format. My pictures were in that format, but still would not show up in the player. I then came up with this seemingly bogus idea of just transferring my pictures to My Documents, to see what that would do. Low and behold, it worked! So remember, when you want to transfer pictures, transfer them from My Documents, not My Pictures. If I'm the only one that had this problem....Forgive me, lol.   Charging Time: Somehow, when I plugged it into the wall for the first time(to charge it, obviously), it was already charged! Every book and site I've seen about this player says to charge it first, before you do anything, and that when it is charging, there will be a battery charging animation on the screen, and it will stop when it is fully charged. I plugged it in, no animation started, and the battery indicated FULL! I still have no idea how that happened, but I've been listening to it for 3 hours now, and it has not failed on me. Perhaps it really is charged...lol. But initially, it takes 4 hours to charge it fully, or there is a 1 hour(70%) fast charge. For a first time use, a full 4 hour charge is highly recommended, unless you are like me, and get one that is fully charged in the package....I still have no idea how that happened.   I hope this narrative of a review has helped you make your decision, and I say this player is indeed, worth every penny. You won't think twice.

<Title>Loved it til it quit completely on day 3
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The color is great, blue light is definitely sexy.  Touch navigation was sensitive and easy to use.  Uploading music was a breeze.  Sound was great, even the color display was equal to my cell phone.  Options for saving battery life (backlight timing, skin options, etc) nice touch.  Slipped right into my pocket while shopping.  Well all that is past tense because today (the 3rd day) I attempt to turn it on to fully discharge the battery before recharging and it will not even power up.  I figure it was in need of charging, so I plug it in to the wall... no life.  Change outlets, no life.  I plug it into the USB and it shows nothing.  I'm so sad.  I love this little thing and now I may have to get an iPod which makes me feel like a sell out.  If anyone else had this problem and it is easily fixed, drop me a line.  I want to keep it, but only if it will work.

<Title>Skip it, buy anything but this one... except for looks
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, I give it to Philips for the killer good design: this thing looks awesome; i.e. if you like looking at mp3 players, buy it.  However, if you actually like listening to music, go buy a 20$ CD player from Wal-Mart, it will do a better job.  First, the sound is horrible: I bet that the earbuds are to blame (yeah, they look really cool too, but sound like crap), but never got to really buying an upgrade.  Second, the installation software won't even run, unless you have your XP upgraded with every patch imaginable: annoying.  Third, during the very first load, after getting about 130 songs on it, the device froze. I restarted it, added about 40 more and left on a vacation the next day. Guess what? When I turned it on, I had only the last 40 songs on it...   Finally, the device crashed for no reason whatsoever after being turned on and off three times and it took me about 20 minutes to reboot it.  I returned it after 5 days and do not plan on buying another Philips mp3 player any time soon: it's a pitty, it is the best looking player I have seen. It also has three times the capacity of similarly priced players, stores pictures, and has an FM tuner... If the designers would stay and the programmers at Philips would be fired, I would wait in line to get their next product.

<Title>Nice Player
<Date>Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nice little 6gb player. The touch pad is very touchy and takes a bit to get used to it. Sound is good and may be better than my old Ipod. The only real down side is that unless you have another program the people at philips leave you with media player 10 which is not the best for managing media files.  You need WinXP SP1 to run this thing and it is drag and drop ready from there which is very nice to have. Its the size of a cedit card and fits nicely into my pockets. The navigation menues are nice and the touch pad makes it a breeze to select all the options. It has several different power and lighting settings to save battery life. I havent let it run down but the most I have gotten is 14hrs on a full charge with the display settings all set in the mid range.  I would recommend this mp3 player for anyone looking at this size HD it is solid player with good looks and sound.   As for the reviewer that had the player die on them, you can do a soft reset by holding the power and + volume keys at the same time for a few seconds and then just power it up.

<Title>Great Little MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought this for myself. I have an archos 6 gig mp3 player that needs to be fixed it stopped charging after awhile, well  i decided on a whim i wanted another mp3 player. so i looked at a few online at walmart's site. I was all set to get the 4 gig archos one, but i decided that i wanted a radio in it also. I loved the look of the philips one.  well i ended up going the next day to get it. (that was this past thursday) It is now sunday and i love this thing. I have decided that in a few months when i can save up i am going to save up for the  30 gig version. I listen to alot of music, and have alot of it on my computer. If you do have this mp3 player don't use the earbuds that come with it they sound like crap. I bought a pair of sony ones awhile back that i just adore that i use with this player.  I haven't really had any problems with this player so far. i like the touch scrolling and the touch controls but as previously stated they do take some getting used to. I just use a light touch to get where i want to go.  i do really love having the option to listen to the radio, after years of using my other mp3 player i was just so out of touch with the radio since whenever i went anywhere i'd use my mp3 player. Now i can at least have the option to turn the radio on and have my presets at my finger tips. and i do love the little recording feature i havent really used that yet but i am sure if i have something important enough to remember i will. I also really love equalizer and the different presets i have kept it on the srs wow setting but i think i will have to customize it :), i like that you get a custom option. most of my music isn't in wma format so i have just over 1500 songs on it at the moment, and since i have over 3000 songs on my computer i have to rotate my music quite a bit but i have to say that syncing with the windows media player doesn't take all that long. I am so glad that this player is so much smaller and lighter than my archos that thing was just a pain to lug around but since it's been a few years it makes sense that they've gotten so much smaller lighter and more portable.  I would recommend this player to anyone with a moderate music collection, who doesn't have as many songs as i do (but then when i can i am upgrading to the 30 gig gogear lol).  great player for the price, if u are looking for multitasking in your devices this is a good one don't go for an overpriced over-rated ipod, the gogear can also store data files for transfering to other computers another thing i was looking for in my mp3 player.

<Title>Great new player
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this recently and so far I am loving it. It has lots of features and is easy to use.  I like that you can use Media Player to import songs or you can just copy and paste your mp3 songs directly to it by opening it from My computer(which is the way I'm used to), they don't tell you how in the instructions, but it's easy to figure out. The menu response is a little bit slow, but honestly I usually don't notice it.  The radio reception is great and radio encoding feature is nice.  You can also use it as a data storage device, which is also a feature I use, but you have to have the cable with you if you want to move the data to another computer.  Great player overall.

<Title>Best player for the money 
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After christmas I had some money from my Family. i went on line and searched for a mp3 player. i found one that i like and went out right away to by it, but the store did not have it. so i looked around and saw this little guy and bought it. no sooner than i had it at home i was able to start to put music on it and it was great. i had some problems with gitting the kinks worked out to get all of my songs on there but now i have all the songs i wanted. i was able to fit 1300 songs on my player. i'm glad the other player was not in the store, my advice is to get this player.

<Title>WORTHLESS
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>the one star is because i cant give a negative i bought this mp3 thinking it would be awesome. 6 gigs, color screen, touch sensitive...for 200 dollars too good to be true, and it is. ive had 2 of these players. the fisrt: i loaded my songs, around 600 or so, and let it charge for around half an hour, i admit-a bad idea, but it powered and the battery showed half full, so i took it with me to a friends house to listen to. after about 15 minutes, i turned it off. a little later when i wanted to turn it on it would not come on. i tried charging it over night, it still wouldnt power. so the next day i returned it and got a second player. i charged it for the recommmended five hours, plus one for good luck, and put all my songs on it again. this player worked fine for about a week. until the exact thing happened as did with the first. i went to turn it on, after listening to it less than an hour before, and it would power up. so i brought it home, charged it for about an hour and it still wouldnt work.  the moral of the story....philips isnt as good as i had expected, although the headphones are nice, and the touch sensitive is cool.....it doesnt work, atleast mine didnt. please try to find anothr alternative...

<Title>Performs great - battery doesn't last
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was torn between buying the Phillips GoGear and an IPOD.  I chose the Phillips because it was less expensive and I liked the looks.  I really like the way the Phillips performs, I've got it loaded with about 1000 songs.  The only complaint I have, and that's why I gave it only 3 stars, is that my battery only lasts about 3 hours.  It seems like even though the player is off, it's using up power.  I have even charged it overnight and the power still runs out.  Maybe the one I have is defective.  Other than that the buttons are easy to use, sometimes a little too touchy.

<Content>the thing began to malfunction 2 months after i bought it. when i called to complain, they would give me instructions that never worked... well i just switched to different problems every time.   it freezes all the time and i have to reset it, the screen goes black randomly, it's slow to respond, the battery doesn't last long anymore. oh, and the rubber things always come off the earphones so i had to buy new ones by sony.  i've had it for 1 year and a half and it won't sync with my computer on any program anymore. i tried repairing it with the device manager it comes with, but it never works. there's a wall between the player and my computer.  i'm buying an ipod as soon as i can afford it. you should too!

<Title>IPOD beats it even though this is cheaper
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had ipod video and I have been listening and reading about ipod hype. People say there are so many things offered by samsung and philips at lower cost. So I decided lets try one. The audio quality I heard was as good as ipod for mp3s and gogear offers FM, FM recording, voice recording etc. Its even smaller than ipod. It works as HDD which is cool because you can store/backup files; ipod doesn't. I compared to samsung and decided gogear is better for sound. It was a wrong decision but its the decision that gave me reasons why ipod sales beats these other mp3 players by huge margin. Top most reason is simplicity. I started setting up gogear Saturday morning and its sunday evening now its going thru last sync I thing everything will be as I need it. I spent 10 hrs and I know computers well.  First of all, the setup CDs provided are useless. When I put those CDs in, I got message 'recommend newer version for EasyCD connect to internet?'. If you say 'No', setup exits. If you say 'yes' it takes you to microsoft website for windows media player 11. But no download link. Since I have WMP 10, I thoght its asking for version 11. I upgraded to WMP11. It synced fine but started other troubles. Pic were not synced. Then I spent a lot of time on philips support website to fix it. Here is what I found -  1. You will need WMP 10 not 11. Philips provided a plugin for Gogear to version 10. 2. Firmware/Device manager upgrade is must if you are below what they have on there site. 3. I had to install philips device manager. Why??? This thing is suppose to work on standard windows and no need additional software(like itunes). I had to repair using Philips device manager. 4. Adding picture is thruogh WMP sync and its not smooth process. I found that documentation on support. May be its on CD but I was not able to install through CD. 5. On the good side, it has all the additional features I mentioned before. They work fine. FM play and recording is cool. I don't understand how come copyrights companies did not say anything about that. 5. The navigation is confusing. The ff button is same as choose button. Other buttons menu, view are not that user friendly.  Overall, spend more money on IPOD if you do not have intermediate level computer knowledge or time or help. I am sure you will spend few hours setting up. I am giving 3 stars because these additional features I mentioned before. This player has potential but...
