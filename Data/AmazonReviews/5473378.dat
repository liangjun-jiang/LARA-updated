<Title>a great product but...
<Date>Thu Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was looking for an inexpensive MP3 player for when I go to the gym or beach.  Something that if I dropped it in the parking lot I wouldn't be heartbroken or bankrupt over the loss.  This was the player for me.  What they didn't tell you is that the software and Windows XP don't play well together.  I tried downloading different drivers and such from their website.  I just made a bigger mess than I had before.  Long and short...I had to borrow a friends computer running Windows Me to get things to work.  Once it did, I loved my little gadget.  It was just a long process to get there.

<Title>OK for short use but not good for the long haul
<Date>Sun Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>We've had two Rio 600 MP3 players for over a year now, and while they are generally good units, there are several problems that are worth noting.<p>First, with 32MB, we can fit around 10 songs onto the MP3 player. While this is great for a daily selection on the bus or in the car, when we've taken trips those 10 songs get old REALLY quickly. So depending on how you're going to use it, that limit may be fine or may drive you crazy.<p>Next, as much as we've tried to be very careful with our units, they drop sometimes. They fall out of pockets, or down the stairs, or your hands slip while using them. Sure, I don't expect the units to last if you drop them onto concrete from 30 feet. But even the smallest drop seems to damage pins and switches. We have numerous problems with our Rios, from buttons not working to bizarre behavior, from even slight mishaps.<p>The headphones aren't really a big deal to us because we probably have 20 sets of headphones around the house. Most people who enjoy music have headphones already - getting a set with their MP3 is the least of their worries. Yes, the default headphones are barely adequate, but that is hardly a reason to choose or not choose a MP3 player.<p>We found the software to be quite good - and plus, just about every other MP3 software package we use also sees the Rio. So even if you don't like the software that comes with the Rio, you're hardly stuck for options.<p>The main issues we have really come down to its small memory size and its flimsy quality. Sure, you can buy more memory for it. But it's probably far wiser to buy a higher quality unit that already comes with more memory, and have it last you many years.

<Content>It was a dark and stormy night...lightning flashed in the diamond multimedia building. They had just created the ultimate mp3 player...the rio 600!! DUM DUM DUUUUUUUM. Ok i know i shouldn't be writing a review if i dont own this product but i can't help it. Courier messed up my shipping type, now the device will be here on monday. But from what i've heard the rio 600 is an awesome simple device yet has a few defects. <br>Pros:Large backlit lcd display<br>     USB support<br>     upgradable firmware and memory (future proof)<br>     Changeble sexy faceplates<br>     Ajustable equalizer<br>Cons: Only 32mb of memory<br>      Bad customer service<br>      Memory is only upgradeble by means of special (expensive) unreleased "backpacks"<p>All in all im looking forward to my rio arriving on monday

<Title>average mp3 player
<Date>Fri Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Rio 600 32 MB is an average MP3 player. <br>Its got more Cons than Pros!!!<br>Cons:<br>-Rio Audio Manager software is sooo useless, even amateurs can write better software than this. <br>-The buttons(play/pause,stop,next track etc) are soo difficult to use since they dont have the feel of a button at all. They are more like a dial which is really stupid.<br>-Earplugs given with this product is soo stupid and get entangled all the time.<p>Pros:<br>+Low battery consumption(about 9-10Hrs on a single battery)<p>+Windows Media player 9.0 detects this player immediately and is easy to transfer files(takes 10 secs to transfer a song)<br>+Supports WMA (Windows Media Audio) which has better compression at 64kbps.<p>Also I see most people pointing out that 32MB is too low to listen to a lot of songs but thats all you can do when you have a 32 MB player. Its not the fault of RIO mp3 player.

<Title>could be happier with it
<Date>Mon Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was so excited to buy my first mp3 player about a year ago, however I should have done a little more research first.  I was happy with all the features, the display, etc., but there are a few issues worth noting with this.  First of all, the battery doesn't last anywhere near the 11 hours it says.  If I leave it for any length of time without using it, the battery dies as well.  Then there is the memory issue.  I realize that is an issue with any 32 MB mp3 player, however, the memory backpack things are impossible to find; though the wonderful people at the store I purchased it at assured me I could order them online, that was not the case.  I suspect the reason they didn't have them at the store was that this model was on its way out. The website currently makes no acknowledgement of the memory &quot;backpacks&quot;, and while they do still have software updates for the 600 model, they don't sell it anymore.  I have not been able to find them ANYWHERE.  If you want more than 10 songs, do not buy this.

<Title>Most horrible thing I ever bought
<Date>Mon Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This was a horrible and udderly usless piece of junk.  When I first got mine (the first one i got) it worked for about 3 days. Then it just stopped working and i just heard static when i wanted the song to play.  Along with that, the software didn't work (i have a PC).  I tried countless times to upgrade on its site, called costumer support(which was very inconsiderate and didn't care if it got fixed or not), and did everything possible to fix it.  Then I got another one, thinking this one was just a bad one.  I was wrong.  Same problems with the software, and it worked for 5 days, then i just got static again.<br>       All in all, don't buy this one and get an archos or something (archos work very well.)even if it is a little more money.

<Title>Horrible battery life, cheap quality plastic design
<Date>Sun Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was not impressed with this MP3 player at all. First of all, im not sure if mine was defective but it would only go 2-3 hours of playing time before the battery would flat out die. I tried upgrading the firmware or calibrating the battery beforehand. This brings me to the quality of the design, when I try and get to the battery compartment. You have to remove the entire back cover and then open this other flimsy door to get to the one AA battery. Try and squeeze the battery in the small space while so worried that the small plastic holders are going to break off. One you got that in, you have to carefully position the back cover to fit back on with the metal contacts in place. Whew.<p>Goods:<br>-Nice blue backlight<br>-Small Light Design<br>-Somewhat easy menu system.<br>-Easy to copy songs using iTunes on mac [no experience with pc software]<br>-Fast/Easy USB.<p>Bads:<br>-Cheap flimsy plastic case<br>-Extremely short battery life<br>-Hard to replace batteries [Afraid of breaking something while squeezing that AA in an extremely small plastic holder thing.<br>-Horrible customer service when trying to get it fixed. They keep saying to flash the memory upgrade firmware I have done all that with no avail!<br>-Doesnt use any traditional upgrade memory method [compact flash or smart media] It needs some kind of special backpack to strap on the back for only another 32MB of memory.<p>In conclusion, I would not recommend the Rio 600, even though it was quite cheap. Spend about $20 more for a Creative Labs' Nomad IIc. It has double the memory and easy to expand.

<Title>excellent product- rio 600
<Date>Thu Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was very pleased with the Rio 600. Before recieving it, i was worried it wouldn't turn out so well because i had checked online reviews about it and said that it doesn't work, etc. However, for me it worked great! I took it on a field trip, it worked perfectly. very easy to change the battery. the battery can wear out fast, but don't keep the backlighting on so much, and remember to turn it off. by doing that, the battery lasted for three days for me. the rio-600 is a bit larger than other rio models, but yet, its still very compact. i did not use the headphones provided and the sound quality was pretty good. i didn't use the software either, but easily got mp3 files uploaded through real player. its very easy to download file from there, just add in rio- 600 as your audio device, and then copy files from there. rio-600 has little memory, but i still got it to download six files. i heard you can also add a memory card which lets it have up to 320 mb of memory! overall, i'm a satisfied owner of the rio-600.

<Title>If you like shoddy craftsmanship, then purchase this player
<Date>Sun Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this player off of Tigerdirect, and it was great for about 3 months.  (minus horrible battery life and small storage capacity, even w/ the extra 32mb backpack).  After the first three months, it simply stopped working.  Wouldn't turn on, no response at all.<p>Wrote SonicBlue, after a couple of weeks of going back and forth and finally convincing them that it wasn't a firmware update issue, they agreed to 'let' me mail it to them (at my cost) and they would repair or send me a replacement.  i guess they did replace it, but after about three months of use, i am getting the same problems again.  I wish I had believed other reviews about this product.  If you're into masochism, then by all means, get this thing.  if not, save up for an iPod or anything else but Rio.  You get what you pay for... (paid $70)

<Content>You wont find a better mp3 player then the Diamond Rio 600. With the big LCD screen it is very easy to read. And it being nice and small is great compared to the other mp3 players. It is also very strong, and the coler is  great. If you are looking for an mp3 player this is the one to buy.

<Title>Great new mp3 player, VERY upgradeable
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The diamond rio 600 is a great player.  It doesn't feel fragile like the previous rio models and has very good sound quality with the earphones that come with it.  Apparently, you can switch faceplates so your rio will have  different colors but there isn't really any point to doing that because the  original color is just fine.  The worst feature of the rio 600 is that it  only comes with 32mb of memory which translates to around 6 or 7 good  quality songs.  The software it comes with gives you the option of reducing  the bitrate of the songs, allowing you to fit more songs on.  However, I  would not recommend doing this because this causes the background music to  make a &quot;squeak&quot; type noise that is very irritating.  Of course,  you can also purchase additional memory in &quot;backpacks&quot; of 32, 64,  and a whopping 340mb in addition to the 32mb of internal memory.  Unlike  the rio 500, you can actually increase the volume to a level that blocks  out most of the background noise.  I would definitely recommend this  product to a friend as it has a very low price and with the large memory  upgrades, you aren't likely to want to buy another mp3 player for a very  long time.

<Title>Rio 600
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I like the device but have a couple complaints: not enough memory 32 is just too small and I can't find the upgrade modules yet. No belt clip, a case is extra $$ I'm hoping the fm tuner remote and extra memory modules  will be out soon and be affordable. (can`t be too soon for me). I use a Mac  and already use the included soundjam software, the usb download was fast  and software easy to use, I just need more memory!  The price was  reasonable as well, but we'll see when I add-in the extras I want.

<Title>Great player, for a great price.
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Ever since listining to my friends mp3 player ive wanted one, but the price of quality players quickly detoured me.  My eyes lit up when I can across this player on rio's site, and the price, $169 practicly made my  eyes bulge out of my head.  The usb cable is great for quick downloads.   Also the memory backpacks are cheaper then flash cards, and you can upgrade  it to 340 megs with them.  The sound is great, it has a great interface  which makes it easy to change the settings.  Also if you want to spend an  extra $20 you can get a remote control that unlocks the ability to use the  fm tuner (havn't got that yet). It's asteticly pleasing, but if you don't  like the blue you can buy many different faceplates to customize the look.   Its very light and it fits perfectly in your hand, the lcd display is easy  to read and if your in the dark its backlit.  This is a great player for  anyone.

<Title>Good....good for beginners
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Ok, I like this player. i like it alot. to tell you the truth this player is the first one ive ever owned, and because of the fact that you can upgrade, might be my last. The sound is quite clear, no problems there. To  me the actual best part of this player was the software, i love the  software almost more then the actual player. its very easy to use and cool.  The only bad parts in my opinion is th play/pause/forward/backward/stop  buttons are all on one little disk, they can be a little dificult at times.  also if you want to upgrade your memory to somthing higer, you have to by  new little &quot;backpackes&quot; that have to go on the back, in my  opinion it would have been easier if they used flash cards.  over all the  Rio 600 is a well rounded player with many cool hip accesories, like a diff  color plates. you can also get an FM tuner extra. Worth the money in my  opinion.

<Content>I just bought this thing earlier today, I wanted a not too expensive MP3 player. It sounds excellent but then again I have never heard any other MP3 players. Sounds as good as cd though.  the headphones are pretty sweet too.  one thing Im not sure Ill learn to like is that compact flash memory is not  available for this RIO product. It uses a wierd memory alternative. Im  having a hard time finding a place to buy expansions for it because It  doesnt hold very much music now. well anyways thats it for now..

<Content>The Rio 600 is great! The tranfer rate is even faster then the Rio 500, the headphones that come with are great (unlike Rio 500), and it is much more customizeable! There are some probs, first a good amount of mp3s I  tried to put on it would not play right! Either they would stop a few  seconds in to the song or they would just not play! Also 32 mb is not too  much memory, but upgrades comin soon. <p>3 1/2 stars<p>As soon as I can  upgrade and they fix the prob with the mp3s this is perfect till then it is  ok!<p>Alex Cutler

<Title>something that you should know
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>For me and others the rio 600 was a long awaited electronic device.  Sadly my first rio was a dud.  It cracked and poped and sped up and slowed down unexpectedly.  It also thought every song was under a minute and half even  though it was not.  After playing just a small part of the song it would go  onto the next song even though the first one wasn't done.  Example: the  player says the song lasts 3:44 it ends at only 1:30 into the song.  I then  spent an hour talking with diamond over the phone and they told me it was a  dud. So I took it back after working with it for 5 hours.  The new one acts  the same way so I tried it on another computer and it plays the whole song  now but it still sounds like Rice Crispies.  The USB port is squirly and  causes the songs to have big glitches but the computer version of the mp3  has no problems the computer version should be identical to the rios  version.  This prouduct is just begging for a recall.  Be smart don't  invest in a rio till this one gets a recall.
