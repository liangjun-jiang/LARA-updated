<Title>Present for my neice

<Content>I purchasesd this item for my 10 year old neice.  I did preset it for her, so I do have knowledgeable input, and she seems happy with it.  It was pretty simple.  I uploaded HS Musical 1 & 2 and Hairspray onto it for her before I gave it to her.  I had the CD's so I didn't bother getting mix clips of them.  It only took 1/4 or more of space for all that music.  It charges off your computer's USB port, , so I of course did that first.  It's supposed to take 2.5 hours, but after 4 hours, I just let it be as it was.  The red light was supposed to stop flashing when it was fully charged, but that never happened, but it worked fine, so I just figured it was a low power issue with my pc or something.  Not sure on that.  But it charge enough to upload the music and play for her on her birthday.  She seemed quite happy about it, so I am too! :)

<Title>Music to your ears

<Content>I purchased this for a four year old. Only drawback is the delay in response to commands entered. It's hard to get a child to wait the few seconds that it takes for the music to begin but once it does, there's a happy child on your hands!

<Title>Easy to use for young children

<Content>My 6 yr old daughter wanted this for Christmas.  I was pleased that it arrived before the expected delivery date.  My daughter absolutely loved it.  She used one of her gift cards to buy more Disney mix clips so she can have plenty of music to listen to in the car.  This product is easy to operate and the rechargeable battery is a plus.  I would recommend replacing the earbuds for a set of headphones to protect your child's hearing.
