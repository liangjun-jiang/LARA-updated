<Title>Very unhappy with the quality of this device
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player for 2 reasons. One, my son had a similar, smaller version that he was very happy with. Second, I wanted a small flash player device that would work with Rhapsody and their Rhapsody to go service. Initially the player performed well. I was syncing about 90 songs which consisted of subscription and MP3s from my own CD collection. After I added a second playlist which was mostly subscription music, the player froze up. At first, I thought I had tried to sync too much music, but I was well under the 1 gig limit at 650 meg. So, I started doing all the usual things to reset the device (pop the battery, hit different control key combinations, etc.). But everytime I turned it on, it froze on the Sandisk screen which is the initial screen. After 1.5 weeks of working with Sandisk support, they decided to have me ship it back and they would send a new unit. The new unit arrived and things worked well for one day then the unit started to stop playing after each song and freeze. Popping the battery would unfreeze this time and I was able to follow technical support instructions by reformatting the device using Windows Media player and resyncing with Rhapsody. After the resync, the device froze again and now I cannot reset. I suspect that the problem has something to do with the Rhapsody service and the "Play for Sure" code, but that is only speculation. If I can't get my money back, I will try to get another unit and only sync it with MP3s. If that fails, I will crush it underneath the tires of my car and call it a day.

<Title>Waste of Money
<Date>Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first bought this device it was for the FM recording capabilities. When trying to record stuff off of the radio, the instructions were pretty simple. Once finished my recording I listened to it back and the sound was VERY distorted and it skipped alot as if it was a CD player with no anti skip feature. If SanDisk is going to advertise this feature they should atleast make sure that it functions half-way decent. I was very dissapointed in this player

<Title>Good product for use and price
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player for my dad so he could retire the CD player when jogging and traveling.  While I prefer the iRiver series, I chose this line for a few reasons:  1.  Buttons were larger and easier to maneuver. 2.  Music and radio functionality were available. 3.  Storage size is a good size to have enough variety of music. 4.  Price was more than reasonable. 5.  The unit runs on a battery so a battery change would only be necessary versus charging it.  In addition, I learned that this unit could carry photos and videos.  While unlikely to ever be used, it's there as an option.   Like other SanDisk products, this item does deliver on what it advertises to be.  The instructions for how to upload music is a bit confusing, but solved with the following:  I opened the unit as though it were a regular flash drive.  Thereafter, I opened the "Media" folder and clicked and dragged the music I wanted into the folder.  Simple enough.    The sound quality is fine (i.e., equalizer options) and the bright color screen allows for easy reading.  In addition, there is the option to listen to the radio if so desired.  The unit is small, light, and an easy companion for where ever it may go.   In the end, I wanted my dad to have something that was easy to use and delivered on quality.  SanDisk does both with the Sansa c140.

<Title>Froze after a week
<Date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For a device with practically no moving parts, there is no excuse for it to freeze after a week of ownership, and barely an hour of use. If it would work, it could be just about my ideal mp3 setup. We'll see what happens if I am able to get it replaced...

<Title>Okay for the price......
<Date>Fri Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its an okay mp3 player. I like it. Its easy to use and easy to travel with. What I don't like about it is the triple A battery thing. I use my mp3 player A LOT, and I go through so many batteries it isn't funny. I'm thinking about selling it and getting a different model. Maybe one from the Sandisk Sansa e200 models. They are better and guess what?! They have a rechargeable battery. So if you don't plan to use this mp3 player often then by all means buy it. But if you're like me, find another brand!

<Title>After reading all the bad reviews I was leery about
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>buying this, but the used price of $55 was too good to pass up.  Figured to send it back if it didn't work well.  Don't buy this for the screen.  The color looks washed out and the edges are not very good for displaying.  The design is fairly easy to use and I have no problems hitting the right buttons through the pockets of my shorts.  This thing was SO easy to set up it was ridiculous.  You don't even need their software if you are using XP.  I had their songs off and mine on in 5 minutes using Windows Media Player.  The standard USB rule applies:  DON'T unplug it from the USB connection without first shutting down the port from Windows.  Like almost all USB devices it will hang if you do, and you will have a piece of scrap electronics if you do it enough times.  The sound quality is not particularly great.  My old Rio Sport, using technology from about 5 years ago, sounded better.  On the plus side, battery life seems very good so far.  I play it in a noisy health club so have the volume cranked up pretty good.  It has played MP3's for about 6 hours so far and the battery indicator is still almost full.  1GB is more than enough storage for me.  I have every song I would listen to more than once on it and have barely filled half the device.  Could have gotten by just fine with a 500MB unit but it's nice knowing I can dump a whole album (or 5) on it should something really good come out.  I wouldn't pay full retail for this, but if you can get it for under $75, go for it!

<Title>A great little player
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The SanDisk Sansa c140 is much smaller and easier to carry than a CD/MP3 player, and that is a plus for traveling. Several reviews below gave a low rating to the player's sound fidelity, but it sounds clear and rich to me on voice or music.  My main for purpose for using it  is voice Podcasts.  I have been using my player for about three weeks.  There are two volume levels in the Settings.  The highest volume in the default or low setting is not very high.  This means any background noise can easily overshadow what is playing.  Changing to the higher level is a distinct help when walking along the street or listening on an airliner.    Several previous reviewers also complained about short battery life.  The AAA alkaline battery that came with the unit gave out before its listed time, but it may have been weak from sitting on a shelf.  The battery meter in the display does not give any reliable clue as to when the battery will fail.  Always carry a spare battery with you, especially if you are using rechargeable batteries.  Otherwise, it seems to be a great little unit and I am looking forward to getting a lot of use from it.    The player is easy to use without installing the factory software.  As long as "MTP" shows on the screen when connected by cable to the computer, just drag and drop files.  It does not matter if files are in a folder or not.  The player finds and plays them in alphabetical order.  If properly shut down, it remembers where you stopped and begins there the next time the player is used.  It will even save your place during a reasonably quick battery change.  When a battery fails, the player starts again at the beginning of the file playing when the battery failed.  The PDF manual on the software disc is far more detailed than the printed quick start guide and is worth reading soon after your purchase.  It is not difficult to navigate the menu, but a little practice makes use of the controls much easier.  The FM radio feature is nice to have.    The voice recorder works well.  Files are stored in the Record folder in the unit's memory.  You are supposed to be able to play them on the player, but I had to move them to my computer first.  The files appear with a WAV extension on the player, but appear on the computer as MP3 files.    The microphone does not produce a loud recording and must be held close to the mouth, making it easy to get a lisp on the recording.    The player will not accept an external memory card, but with 1 GB of internal memory, it is large enough to hold an entire MP3 audio Bible.

<Title>Bad player. Zerro reliability.
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bougth this player almost one year ago. From the first minute I was dissapointed by the sound quality. Compares with old cassette player (not even with the worst cd player). Battery average life was under 10 hours.  Doesn't connect directly to USB (had to carry always with me the cable huge connector). Documentation is poor. It took me over 2 months of web research to find out how to create playlists (you sinply transfer the .m3u files to the root of the audible folder). Finally after 10 months the player is broken. After a media transfer with my pc it was never stopped updating the storage so the only sollution was to take out the battery. After restart the player was FROZEN with the last song played before the media transfer and the battery level on red (no control working, not even the power button). I wrote to the sandisk support twice (they never responded to the phone either). Buying again from SanDisk? NEVER!!!

<Title>Great inexpensive MP3 starter for pre-teens!
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased these for my 10 and 11 year olds for their birthdays coming up soon.  This was my first experience with MP3 players as well as theirs-and I didn't want to spend IPOD money on a player until I knew they would take care of them.  The sound quality is great, it's easy to load songs, and it's nice to have a screen.  For some reason, I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger of a unit, but that doesn't matter at all.  It's also nice that it offers an FM radio as well (and the reception was good too!). I figure we can always upgrade from here in the future, but it IS a great product-If they won't loan me theirs, I would definately buy the same one for myself!  I did read all reviews-pros and cons-and as with ALL electronics, anything can happen....But, so far, so good!!

<Content>I've had my C140 for a few months now with no problems - no distortion issues no trouble moving files to it.  HOWEVER, with doing absolutely nothing to it, my C140 is now frozen.  I can power it off but it's as if the hold button is on.  I can't forward to the next track, reverse to the last track - play and pause do nothing...  It's stuck at 1:06 of the last song I played.  It's toast...

<Title>Fine for my purposes
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I already had an iPod but needed an even smaller player for travel, and wanted a device that I could run on batteries even in countries where I can't rely on stable electricity. This machine fit the bill and has been fine thus far--as others have mentioned, it's easy to load and operate, and very lightweight. It also has better FM reception than the stereo with antenna does in the same room. I can't really say what the battery life is like because I've been swapping them out early, but I do notice that the device can be off for long periods (say, two weeks) and still power up when turned on. This is different from my iPod and PDAs I've had, which lose their charge over time even when not in use.

<Title>good introductory player
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned this Sansa player for about a month and overall I'm quite satisfied with it.  I agree with some other reviews which express dissatisfaction about some of the navigation features, but I feel this is a VERY minor problem.  The outstanding sound quality is really what makes the Sansa player THE leader among the wide selection of MP3 players in this broad consumer electronics area.  I believe that entry-level flash memory devices like this one provide a far better value for the consumer than any iPod.  Storage and retrieval of songs is just as easy and efficient.  Sansa's product is robust and versatile and reasonably priced.  If you buy one, you won't be disappointed.

It only has one battery (AAA) lasts about 20 hours. Ear buds are ok. Probably would want to get an extra pair anyway. This player is cheap for a 1 gig player. Easy to navigate and has lots of features. Very small, a little bigger than a Bic lighter. Good buy!

Nice sound quality Nice browser 971 MB are usable(95%) It's small and pretty Nice color screen Nice price  CONS 1. PRE-LOADED SONGS: I got rid of them because of formatting the device but I had to surf a lot of web pages to discover it 2. TAGS: Sometimes 2 or 3 tags does not function and It's because of the CON # 3 3. MSC/MTP: Why 2 ways to connect it to the PC? The things that are not right in one are right in the other.... Not a con but it's bothering  Finally... 4 stars because San Disk is doing the best and I hate Ipods because they're expensive and don't play WMA.

<Title>Nice, Quality Player
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this as a Christmas gift from my husband, and so far I have been very pleased with my Sansa MP3 player!  This is a very user-friendly MP3 player, probably a good start for first timer.  I plugged the MP3 player into my computer with the included USB cable, found the player on My Computer, and quickly deleted all of the preloaded songs, since none of them were of any interest to me.  I drag and dropped files from My Music folder, and within minutes was ready to listen!    The player runs off of one battery (included) and the battery lasted me about a day and a half, but that was because I left the player running all night (I forgot to turn it off!) the first night I bought it.  Since then, I've listened to the player every day at work, 8 hours a day, I haven't had to change the battery in 4 days.  Battery life seems to be pretty decent, especially since AAA batteries are not that expensive.   I have yet to fill the player, and so far I have 198 songs loaded (MP3 files, about 3-4 minutes in legnth).  I know if the files are WMA files, the player will hold double the songs.  There is also an FM radio on the player, which is a nice addition.    I have yet to experience any glitches with the player.  It plays my songs beautifully and the volume is MUCH more than I need, unless I want to rupture my ear drums.  There are two settings to the volume, one louder than the first, and I still have it on the first setting.  I also bought a $7 set of little speakers, and it sounds awesome!  The picture viewing capabilty is something I have no explored.  But it seems a tad pointless to me.  The screen is tiny!  I don't think you could even see what the picture was...  In conclusion, great player than I recommend!!!  Awesome alternative to the IPOD!

<Title>Dead after 12 days use
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Some initial trouble loading on songs, but after a little bit figured it out.  Was not as straitforward as the other MP3 player I own, the ZEN NANO from Creative.  Songs were alright, although I agree with other reviewers that the menu navigation is cumbersome more than helpful.  Major gripes started about 5 days in: (1) Audible books were able to be loaded on, but quit playing after about halfway into the first book.  Others could be seen and selected on the player, but even with volume set at high and all the way up, can barely hear the voice.  Multiple attempts to work around (using different media players or loading on directly) were unsuccessful.  Which brings me to problem #2:  (2) Sandisk telephone and email support people were totally unhelpful.  After several suggestions that I either already tried/considered or were off base to begin with, they blamed others-- "it must be an Audible problem or the file is messed up".  Neither are true, as both continue to work fine on computer and the other MP3 player.  (3) Now it is stuck on one of the Audible programs, but will not play, not shut off (unless I take the battery out), will not respond to anything.  So now it is worthless.    I will never buy a Sandisk MP3 player again.

<Title>Good MP3 player with slow transfer rate in Media Player 11
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>SanDisk makes solid mp3 players. This one is no exception. The only disappointment is the extremely slow transfer rate when syncing the c140 in Windows Media Player 11. If songs are simply copied to the device as a USB portable drive (look in Windows explorer), then the transfer is much faster and easier. Other than the slow transfer rate, the controls are easy to use and the device does what it is supposed to do.

<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The sandisk Sansa c140 1GB MP3 player has been pretty good to me in the couple of months that i've had it so far. the only real complaint i have about it is something most MP3 players have in common now days. The volumne control has been set so that they never really get very loud (headphones). It seems to be set extreamly low for some reason though. I can bearly hear it when i'm working out depending on the way the music files were saved.. i.e. low quality mp3s. but overall this MP3 is pretty good and very simple to figure out. Fairly inexpensive and large enough storage to be useful. Though memory expandability would be nice.  For the price this is a very good purchase.

<Title>For Low-Tech, Low music lovers
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My search for a really compact device that I could take anywhere and easily load the under 250 songsthat I enjoy listening to finally came to an end after purchasing this device.   Product design: Attractive casing, colorful screen, small and easily fits into pocket. The control buttons are clearly marked and easy to navigate.  Software: The driver was easy to install. I useed it with Windows Media Player 11 without any problem at all. Windows Media Player was easily able to detect and sync to it.   Sound: I am not looking for stellar sound performance especially in a small device such as this. As long as I can hear the words and melody I am really satisfied with the sound quality of this device. It has yet to produce any static sound. Radio sound quality is great provided the reception is good. I do suggest purchasing a good pair of earphones. The ones that come with the player are just the standard.   Device Menu and Controls: I basically play all songs in my list. I have found though that in doing so the player will repeat the same songs before cycling through the list.   Overall, for the price I paid ($60) this is a great device. I would recommend it to those looking for a lightweight, low capacity and easy to use MP3 player.

<Content>Big deal.  It's smaller, easy to use, and I like that it uses AAA batteries.  And did I mention cheaper.  Way cheaper.  It may not play movies on the little screen, but I bought it for music while I work out or ride my motorcycle.  I got a big screen HD for movies.  The music is clear;  The only thing I wish is that when it falls out of my pocket at 150 kph, it would bounce a little better.

<Content>I use mine to listen to music. Not the kind you kids listen to. I am 67 years old. ( Yes I can use a computer) My music is on one. My relaxation cds are on another and I am getting another for all the sound tracks of the works of James McEachin about Honoring the American veterans. Might need another one for a book I want on cd. I know I could get all on one, but this way, as a dottering old man I can keep track of what I have. It works perfect for me.

<Title>Not bad, but nothing to write home about either.
<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, the good: I got this player for $35 plus shipping, which is a decent deal. It doesn't require special software to work, although it can be set up to use a sync'ing media player like WMP or Rhapsody. It recognizes M3U playlists, and most importantly of all it has auto-resume play. This is critical for me, as I use it for listening to audiobooks in the car. The resume has worked every time, even with a battery change in between listenings. It has good battery life. The screen is nicely readable in all lighting conditions. The bad: Unlike my older DNT-made players, this one doesn't understand "folders". It could use a little more volume. It refuses to play some of my WMA recordings. And it shipped without the software CD. (Sansa is sending a new one, supposedly.) In summary: If you want an inexpensive player and you know how to use M3U playlists, which any computer-savvy Winamp user should, this player is a good buy.

It can be identified by Norton AV, but can not be cleaned. If you do get infected, virus removal is a manual and very painful process.  BEWARE!!!

IT is relatively easy to download music to the MP3 player from my home computer.  I would highl recommend this product to anyone with needs similar to mine.

<Title>Good machine... right up until the display went blank
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to take with me on business travel.  It's small enough to fit into a shirt pocket.  The battery lasts a long time with the volume cranked way up to cover jet engine noise.  I've been having a problem with it lately where the back light won't work properly.  (or much at all)  It still plays fine, but the back light will flicker for a while and then not come on at all during play.  It's a bit annoying, but the songs still keep playing.  I'm an electrical engineer, so I may attempt to pull it open and take a look, but it's already small enough to require the use of a microscope.  It was never designed to play video, but having thumbnails of your kids with you in a little MP3 toy is pretty cool.  (until the back light died)

<Title>Can't beat the Sansa c140 for the price
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought two of the Sansa c140 1GB mp3 players for my young children.  I was able to put all their children's music and more on the player.  At just a fraction of the cost of my 1st 1GB iPod Nano, my kids could have easy access to just as much music (and even little picture...which they love).  The c14o players are very easy to load and update (just drag and drop), small yet well built, battery changes are a snap, and well designed navigational features.   I did a lot of comparison shopping, and these Sansa c140's are a great deal as long as they last for a few years or more, when the kids are likely to upgrade to another model.  I have purchased, and will purchase more Sansa products...good value.

<Content>I love this mp3 player. I bought one each for myself and my 11 year old daughter for Chrismtas this year and got them both for $[...] on sale. I am amazed at how great the sound quality is, how reliable it is, and how much music can be fit on the product. It is not necessary to have an iPod nano or another player with more memory capacity since I can easily move songs from and to the player with Windows Media. I don't regret getting this at all and am so glad I did!

<Content>I bought this as a gift for my son, he loves it. All he was looking for was an MP3 player like his friends had to hear his music on. I went a step farther and found this gem in my research. It has some great features like the FM Radio and voice recording, SHOWS PHOTOS AND VIDEO TOO. The only downside is the antennae is in the headphones so you have to use the ones that come with the unit, and they work well, don't get me wrong. I do see tons of other varieties in the store though so I wanted to let you in on that fact. The batteries last pretty long and we invested in a battery recharger since he's in love with it and uses it often. WONDERFUL BEGINNERS MP3 PLAYER!

<Title>What's playing in YOUR ears?
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this originally because my library offers a free download service of books on tape via MP3.  I had more space than I needed for just the books, however, so I put my favorite songs on it and still had room to store some of my favorite Guided Meditations.  I can go out at break and unwind to music, listen to a book, or be guided into relaxation, all at my finger tips with a player that fits in my pocket.    The only thing I didn't like were the ear buds, but that's just me.  I don't like things sticking in my ears, but the player was adaptable to any earphones I could find, and also hooks up to a small set of speakers so that I can listen to my tunes while working on the computer as well.

<Content>I have another SanDisk 512mb mp3 player. After the headphones went out and the face plate got smashed on this mp3 player, I was eager for an upgrade.   I've had this one for about a month, this was a Christmas gift to myself. The headphones has already gone out on this (this is a pattern in there mp3 players). You can't turn it up very loud. It's easy to navigate and transfer music but there are other mp3 players that have the same features and do more better than SanDisk. Yes, you can put pictures on the mp3 player, I would avoid doing so seeming that the screen is extremely small.

<Title>Excellent audio-book reader
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Between driving my car, working out in the gym, walking my dog and doing chores around the house, I spend at least 10 hours a week listening to audio-books from [...] and lectures from The Teaching Company. Over the years I've tried tapes, CDs and a variety of book readers including the iPod and Zen. No book reader I've found works as well as this model c140 from Sandisk. It's small, light, inexpensive, easy to control, makes bookmarks reliably, makes it easy to load and unload Audible books, and makes it easy to manage MP3 files using Windows Explorer. This player takes ordinary AAA batteries that you can get anywhere.  My gym displays several TV screens in the "hamster room" and uses short-range FM transmissions so members can pick up the station they want to watch. So when I see a TV program I want I switch over to, it lets me quickly and easily switch to the Sansa's FM tuner and keep on running. When the Sansa's battery goes dead--about once every 12 hours--I it takes seconds to put in another AAA battery. They're cheap and when I've forgotten to put one in my pocket, I've gotten replacements from road-side convenience stores and from the little convenience rack at the gym, but I've always been able to keep on listening.  Audible recommends that you download audio-books for the Sansa in level 4 format. At that level, sound quality is excellent although, admittedly, the player cannot be turned up loud enough to pound your eardrums unless you plug it into an external amplifier and play it through a good set of speakers.  I got the model c140 to replace an older Sansa e140 that I used for two years. The older one never gave me any trouble but this one is said to have an improved operating system making it easier to control. I debated getting a c150 with twice the memory and only $[...] higher price, but the largest books I own (a biography of Harry Truman and the fantasy book A Storm of Swords) are each over 40 hours long, and either one will fit on the c140 with enough room left for two ordinary length audio-books.   The c140 delivered all I hoped for and then some.

<Title>great little mp3 player with fm radio
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>when i first got this mp3 and opened up the box i was surprised how small it is.  about the size of a piece of chewing gum.  i installed the program via the included cd and it worked right away with no problem what so ever.  this held all the music i had on my lap top with lots of room to spare.  the program is easy to use and downloading music to the player is fast and easy.  the sound is outstanding with the ear-bud headphones that are included.  the fm works well and the display is back-light and very easy to read. all of the players options are user friendly and do not require a lot of skill to use.  this is one piece of electronics that will not drive you mad with hard to use software or directions.  as an added bonus they included batteries.  this is one of my favorite gadgets and i would recommend the 1 gig for any user.  it is not expensive at all and really who needs more music than this holds?

<Title>great little player
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 2nd MP3 player, my first being an Ipod Nano.  I got this one because I decided to give Play for Sure a try--and have fallen in love with subscription music afterall!!  I chose this one because it was on sale, relatively cheap, 1gb, small, and seemed to be sturdy built. I have synced it almost daily for a month now and played it to death at work.  It has worked without a hitch.  The only drawback is that it uses an AAA battery that does not last very long, but that is par for the course with these cheap flash units.  The sound is decent, and  it has an FM radio and microphone.  There is a round button on the front that contains the menu, pause, forward and back controls. Often times I must press a button twice to get it to go forwards or backwards.  The unit automatically  shuts off if you pause for very long, which is actually good considering the battery life.  I use it with Napster and it takes a while to sync, but that is OK.  It has a dedicated volume control and a hold button that feel solid and well made.  The screen is smallish but well lit and colorful with a  simple menu.  I absolutely will buy more Sansa products after my experience with this one!  Now I kinda wish I had not bought the Nano and had instead gotten a bigger Sansa for my play to go subscriptions.

There is a tech support you can call, so I will probably do that.  Other than that a great product.  Battery also last a very long time, which it takes 1 AAA.
