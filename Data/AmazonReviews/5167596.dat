<Title>THE UNTENDED UNDERLING IN THE iPOD FAMILY
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to buy a no-nonsense mp3 player to keep me company while running. No video, no funky display menus, no labyrinthine software to work with. If I wanted to spend half a day getting my music in order I'd shell for the 80 gig iPod.   So I got myself a Shuffle, by far the sleekest small pod in the market.   But boy did I regret it.   After the one-time registration and initialization (which is not optional) the lemon wouldn't get the songs on it, thanks to the infamous "Disk not found error". Googled for it and discovered websites that are brimming with untended complaints; I'm on Windows XP, but the glitch seems to pervade operating systems.   Spent a day battling with the idiosyncrasies. Downloaded and installed an extra utility that Apple's Help site recommends. Enabled the Shuffle "for disk use". Reset it to factory settings and tried all over again, five times. And I'm a fairly persistent tech-savvy one. I did everything that's needed and more, but the stupid thing will still not remember the settings, will not let me change songs, and so on.    Tired with all of this rigmarole, I got a Creative Zen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S5TYQI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">Stone Plus</a>. It's a little larger than the Shuffle, but you can see why--Shuffle doesn't have a display and it uses the same jack for charging and earphones so you can only do one of those at a time. Stone Plus on the other hand connects through a small non-spaghetti USB cable, comes up instantly as a new drive on your PC, you copy the mp3 files from your music folder to this drive, and you're done.   I was up and running in 5 minutes flat. Can't help kicking myself for having fallen for the iPod luster.   Without becoming any clunkier in any meaningful way (both the doohickeys are pretty small), Stone Plus shows me the song that's playing, which I don't see on Shuffle. Stone Plus has an FM radio, a voice recorder, a timer, and a digital clock--none of which the Shuffle has. It charges in 5 minutes, which the Shuffle doesn't. I can use iTunes or any other tool or even nothing at all, but with Shuffle I am in an unhappy marriage with iTunes. The Stone Plus will hold about 1000 songs in comparison to Shuffle's 200 at the same bit-rate.   Because this is Creative, the company known among geeks for its speakers, the ear phones that come with the Stone Plus have a fabulous combination of bass and treble that will please the most fastidious connoisseur. After hearing them Shuffle's white thingies sound tinny and childish. I got my Stone Plus with a clip that makes it much more practical for running.   And all of it at 60% of the cost of a basic bare-bones Shuffle.   Sorry, Apple folks, in the small-mp3-player market Apple is simply the beautiful blond bimbo who trips on high heels at ten paces. If you're in the market for a nifty little mp3 player, skip the Shuffle. Even in the 3rd generation it's a 3rd rate contender.

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - A steep price for a starter MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> The iPod Shuffle second generation is a great MP3 player for working out or running, especially if you are a die-hard Apple fan.  However, the steep price means you had better review all your options before you choose this.  Pros - Small size - Nice case design - Many color options - Highly durable player - Apple reputation  Cons - High price point - Less durable shell - Proprietary dock for syncing - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability - iTunes software with limited formats (MP3, AAC) - No screen, FM tuner or line in recording - Competing products offer more capacity for less $$  The Form Factor  This little guy is small!  The body has a spring loaded clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt without any extra case.  Apple added a few extra color options with the 3rd generation, including the popular purple.  It comes in a composite case. The 2nd generation's case seems more durable than the 3rd.  The basic controls remain the same (fast forward, rewind, pause, and play) to access your music collection.  There is a headphone jack which you also use to mount this on the sync dock.  A standard USB B port would have been preferable to this as well.  Storage Capacity  Apple made it available only in 1GB sizes, same as the 2nd generation.  It would have made more sense to bump it up to at least 2GB.  The competing Zen Stone Plus by Creative offers 2GB (twice the songs), an FM tuner and the ability to see song titles for less money.  Sandisk also has some lower capacity Sansa models at similar price points. Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB MP3 Player Zen Stone Plus 2GB Black <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP50AY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk Sansa c150 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD40N8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">Sandisk Sansa Express 1 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IM9542/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Durability  Apple definitely deserves point for the more durable player in this group.  Even with the new player composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse.  There will be some failures, but for the most part these hold up well.  Software  When you only have 1GB to fill, having to use iTunes software to do it seems excessive.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  For those that care about file options, Apple's software allows only MP3 and AAC.  You can convert other formats to these, but be aware of the limits.  Sound  The sound this unit produces is pretty good for it's size.  However, it's just ok.  I still feel the first generation shuffle sounded much better, but the trade off was it was much longer.  Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $65.  Sandisk Sansa has similarly priced models.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.  Overall this is a good player at a price that could be less.  Weigh your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>  shuffle problems
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product from another store. Within 8 months it quit working. The salesperson said they had a lot of problems but I liked its convenience and size so I just got a new one. It too broke within another month. This time the sales person said: what do expect for that money." Huh? I refused another one and got my money back.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHGJ50/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">Apple 1 GB iPod shuffle Silver (3rd Generation)</a>

<Title>Ideal for a runner
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The shuffle lives up to the Apple ads. Extremely easy to use, while very light.   I replaced an MP3 player that I use for running that died, so I was extremely interested in the clip feature. At first I was skeptical that it would actually stay in place -- thought I would have to purchase the armband. I was pleasantly suprised. In fact, ran ~13 miles while it was hooked to my waistband and it didn't budge. There are a few arm straps that you can buy from aftermarket vendors (e.g. DLO), but it's not necessary.  If you are going to use primarily for running/exercising, I would opt for the shuffle over the nano. It's very rugged, inexpensive and simple to use.  Enjoy.

<Title>Piece of Crap
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am so disgusted with this product.  I expected to be able to use it right out of the box but instead I have to wait 4 hours for the stupid thing to charge.  It is basically useless until it's charged.  I just think Apple should make this thing usable out of the box instead of a dead lifeless piece of crap.  I am very disapointed.  I didn't buy this so I could sit and wait 4 hours to use it.  The battery should already be charged when you purchase it.

<Title>I'm Won Over from being Totally Uninterested in an iPod
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I listen to a lot of music, most of it classical. I review classical CDs here at Amazon. When my daughter-in-law gave me the iPod shuffle for Christmas I didn't even know what it was or what it was capable of. But since she showed me how to use it, how to download into it and the other little things one learns to do, I've become a convert. This little package of amazing engineering is a real jewel. My only concern is that I'll wear out my ears using it.   I think the best thing about it that I can use it while working away in the wee hours when to have loudspeakers going would wake the family. And, of course, on walks, which are a regular feature of my life in this small town where one walks everywhere rather than drive just a few blocks. Just load up a program -- it's easy as pie to load the shuffle with a program that you're interested in -- and start walking. I've been able to use my expensive over-the-ear headphones with the iPod, being amazed that this little thing can drive those big headphone speakers.   It loads quickly. Downloading an entire CD will take only five minutes if that long. Sound quality is just fine. I don't detect any significant degradation of the sound.   My daughter-in-law is getting tired of me thanking her for the gift.  Scott Morrison

<Title>Why so complicated and unfriendly?
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a long-time pc user with a lot of experience on the marketing side of the industry, serving as a consultant to several of the largest OEM's. I'm also a stickler for customer service.  As further background, I have owned several generations of MP3 players, and struggled with crummy documentation and interfaces. Well, Apple is the champ of user unfriendliness. Forgetting for a moment that once the Shuffle is up and running it sounds pretty good, lets just think about you, the customer.  - Horrific documentation in the box to let one know that one has to go out and find, independent of any pointers, the software to make the device operate (come on geniuses at Apple, why not a few web pages in the quick start guide)  - None, zip, startup software --- not even a readme file to help  - Absolutely no drag and drop capability (I bought a third party program to do this)  -iTunes takes forever (and on my computer is always trying to connect me to the web site; all I want to do is listen to selections from a thousand or so cd's I've made into MP3s)  - Cannot use iTunes on more than one computer without having to erase all songs from the device (what kind of stupid system is this? One travels and visits a friend and wants to borrow a couple of tunes; you're dead in the water buddy)  Then there's the battery matter. Wear one out and, for all intents and purposes, you're out the cost of a new Shuffle. Go figure, but isn't Apple the company that killed the concept of backward compatible software for its customers.....)  I'll load mine up with a few hundred tunes (it does play MP3 Pro, my preferred mode) and use it sometimes on walks and airplanes (which its excellent volume level will give my noise reduction headphones a boost), but for normal listing -- choosing a select few albums and playing whatever tracks I want to hear, I'll stick with my other players (a current favorite being a little Lexar device that plays directly off a Lexar Sport flash drive, has a display, runs on replacable AAA batteries and isn't all that much larger than the Shuffle and its associated dock and cable).   Bottom line: A highly specialized little device that seems an afterthought to plugging iTunes purchases and not caring much about creating a good impression of Apple. It took me the better part of an afternoon to get this thing working so I am modestly comfy. You pays your money and you takes your chances that you'll be back in the bad ole days when getting anything to work was a chore. Come on Apple, hop into the 21st century and  think simplification and 'customer first'.

<Title>Technically challenged?  The ipod shuffle is the gadget for you!
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I confess, I am technically challenged.  I've held off getting an ipod because I thought I would never be able to figure out how to use it.  Well the introduction of this new shuffle and the thought of having all that music in that tiny little clip-on was too much to resist.  Well I got one for Christmas and just looking at that tiny thing was fun.  Apple did a great job of packaging it in a nifty clear plastic box.  The instructions couldn't be easier and they include a little cheat sheet that you can carry with you until you get the hang of it.  The software was easily downloaded even for someone like me.  Charging the shuffle takes a few hours and it simply plugs into your USB port on your computer.  I tackled all that last night.  Today I decided to download some tunes off a CD into the ipod via the Itunes software.  It couldn't have been easier.  Plug in the ipod to the computer, slip a CD into the computer, load it, and then drag and drop the songs you want into your ipod.  I am rocking to the songs I downloaded as I type this review!  It was that simple, fast and easy.  A couple of things of note; the sound is very good, and if you are not an audiophile, you will more than likely be quite happy.  The ear buds (while not my favorite, I prefer headphones) fit fairly comfortably although please note they include a package of two sets of covers but are not marked as such.  That being said, the covers are pretty delicate and you'll have to be careful putting them on the buds.  I am sure there is still a lot to learn about my shuffle, but so far the learning curve has been very fast and easy.  I love being in the 21st century!

<Title>My first ipod
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have always wanted an ipod. I just either didn't have the money or know which model to get. I was thrilled when I finally got an ipod, specifically the ipod shuffle, as a gift for Christmas. I had the option to trade the ipod shuffle in for a nano but I decided on the shuffle. 240-250 songs was plenty for me. Secondly I liked the compact features especially when it comes to listening to music at work. For me personally having over 200 songs on my iPod is more than enough. Secondly when I am at work, I don't really have the time to mess with the thing depending on my musical mood.  The two somewhat minor gripes I had about the iPod shuffle was downloading iTunes on to the computer and the ear buds. If you have dial up and on AOL, you want to DL'd itunes via Internet Explorer or some sort of separate browser (especially if your OS is Windows). Don't do it through AOL. You will get a Win32 error message. There is a technical support message board on Apple's website that you can refer to if all else fails but downloading iTunes via IE or another browser (that isn't AOL) should do the trick.  The other gripe is the earbuds. They can become very uncomfortable after awhile. I don't know why Apple can't improve on the earbuds. If they can improve the ipod, then they can improve the earbuds. I have to switch to my earphones that I used on my computer at work when I listened to cds. Would it be asking too much for Apple to create a more comfortable pair of ear buds for  the iPod?   Overall I love my ipod shuffle. I was quite pleased that the ipod attaches to my clothing nice and snug. It does not fall off very easily. I don't have to worry about having to lock up my ipod when I walk away from my desk for awhile. I can simply throw it into my pocket. I am very happy with my ipod.

<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first iPod, and i love it, really. The old shuffle costed twice - these days other DAPs are cheaper anyway, including sony's, so that is maybe the reason - but this one is a really a beauty. The clip is really practical. This is a thing to wear, not only to listen to. I love how podcasts are automatically placed on the beginning of the playlist for easy finding. And how it turns off when i remove the headphones.  So if you really don't care for a screen - believe, i'm not missing it that much - and want the smallest and lightest, and also cheap, go for the shuffle.

<Title>Nearly Perfect
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice player, nice size. For $80, a good buy.   This player feels like quality with its satin aluminum finish and very solid clip. Tiny and light, the only danger is that you might lose it.  Sound quality is excellent but there is a small amount of hiss at high volumes during quite passages.   The only drawback is that there is no display. You can use this player two ways. The most likely way is in Shuffle mode -- load it with music you like and let it go. It's like listening to a radio station that only plays what you like.  The other way is to load it with an ordered play list and listen in order. Good for audiobooks, for instance.   Interface via iTunes is smoothly done, easy to manage.

<Title>Great Little MP3 Player!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After spending several hours doing a comparison of mp3 players in regards to brand, model, features, and price....as well as a thorough review of the feedback left by other customers in regards to this item and the others offered by Amazon, I decided to go with the !Pod Shuffle. I am certainly glad that I did. It's about the size of a money clip (although  a little thicker) and doesn't have a ton of "bells and whistles", which didn't interest me anyway. When I got it all set up and used it for the first time, I realized that I had made the right choice. The !Tunes software is incredibly easy to use, making it very easy to transfer songs from your favorite CDs and to buy mp3s from !Tunes store (they are 99 cents a song....which I think that is pretty reasonable). You can find just about any song you are looking for,from religious to hard rock to rap. Within a few minutes, the software uploads all of your selected music onto the !pod, and you are ready to go. I commute to college every day on the subway, and was used to bringing along my CD player and a few CDs which took up a lot of room in my bag. It was a waste of space, considering the fact that there are some CDS where I may only like half the songs on it, or even less. Now, I have only the songs that I REALLY like listening to on it. As of now, I have 170 songs stored on it, and still have enough room for a lot more. I would strongly suggest doing a lot of comparison shopping before you decide on one, but I would certainly recommend this little gem. Also, it would be worth spending the extra 10 bucks for the extended service plan. It gave me some extra peace of mind. So anyways....considering the price and the features, the user friendliness of the software and the device as well as the !pod reputation, this is one certainly worth considering for purchase. I certainly love mine.

<Title>Do not buy an Ipod, especially the Shuffle
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Did you know that when you use Itunes to download or import CDs, the shuffle can only be used with one computer?  That's right, if you do your work on one, you will have to erase and start over if you plan to use the shuffle with a different computer.  No one told me this...Do not be fooled by the cute size....it is a trap and a way for apple to bank from each .99 download you have to keep purchasing to replace all of your erased music.  Which by the way, everytime you attempt to troubleshoot, they tell you to "restore" the Ipod which means "erase"...cha-ching for them.  Do not buy an Ipod.

<Content>As far as I'm concerned, it's a perfect product... it's not expensive, it's beautiful, it's easy to use, it's incredibly (but not too) small, and it does everything you want it to do.  If you can use a cassette player, you can definitely use the shuffle.  And if you can keep track of a piece of jewelry, you can keep track of one without loosing it.  I just got one for Christmas, and I've had no problems with it.  It's a joy to use.  The attention to detail is incredible, and I haven't been able to scratch it or dirty it so far with normal, unprotected use.  And I definitely use it more than my full sized iPod.  Highly recommended... and to other reviewers, please try one out before bashing it.
