<Content>I'm having so much fun with mine, I'm back to get one for my husband. Everything is exactly as advertised. The buttons are easy to use and although I would prefer more contrast for the screen, it's still easy enough to read (So I'm over 40, lol). Sound: Better than I expected! I'm very happy with it, in fact I was listening to a long time favorite, and could pick out a few things I'd never heard before. I did hear a little distortion in one or two spots, however that might be my bad. I had downloaded these tunes from off line and CD, ran them through conversion software and then downloaded those onto my memory chip for my Palm. I simply plugged the memory chip into my new tower and did the "drag and drop" from the chip to the MP3 player. Considering how many generations that is, I'm pretty impressed. No VISTA issues!!! I dropped in the cd, plugged in the usb and was dropping files onto it in about two minutes. Download time was microwave fast, so no complaints there. I have noticed that when I use the select button, sometimes the track skips, say if I try to change settings in the middle of a track. Also, don't get impatient on the ship time. It really does ship straight from China and mine took 13 days to arrive, so if purchasing for a gift, plan ahead. Is it an IPod? No. But then again, I didn't want an IPod. $25 for a gig of memory, MP3, WMA AND WAV, tiny, light and an 18 hour battery life? You won't find anything else with all of these features and at twice the price. I know, I looked for three weeks before I bought one. If all you want is a great little MP3 player with good sound that's easy on your budget and has easy to use functionality...get this one.
