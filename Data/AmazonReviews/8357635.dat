<Title>Great MP3 Player and Flash Drive!
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this item about two months ago, and it is great.  Originally I bought it for an MP3 player, but I actually enjoy it for it's use as a flash drive more.  Fast transfer to and from the device via USB 2.0, and it also works with USB 1.0!  Can hold anywhere from 200-800 songs depending on the size.  It's actual size is 1.88GB, as it uses .12GB to store its run information.  One negative thing is that when you put music on it, depending on how much you have on it, it can take a while to start up, seeing as it is a flash drive, not an actual hard drive like other mp3 players have.  I have to wait about 5 minutes plus for it to start up and be ready to use.  Also, if you have the lock turned on, after you've waited 5 minutes for it to load it will turn off, being that you have it on lock.  This means another 5 minutes, and the lock doesn't take to much pressure to get pushed on in your pocket.  I would still reccommend this as a jump drive though, as it works great for that, and if you choose you can use it as an MP3 player, FM Radio, and Voice Recorder, where normal flash drives can't do that. The Voice Recorder is very good quality, and a neat feature to have. The FM radio isn't that good at all.  It picks up few stations, the antenna being built into the headphones they provide for you, but it might be better in a place highly populated with more radio stations to pick up. My final ruling is:  Flash Drive: 5 Stars Voice Recorder: 5 Stars FM Radio: 2 Stars MP3 Player: 3.5 Stars  Total = 15.5 Stars/4 = 3.875 Stars = 4 Stars

<Title>Very Decent

<Content>It delivers what it promises. It's simple and user friendly. The fact that you don't need to keep up with a cable is very convenient. It plugs right into your USB port. The sound quality is very decent. I've used it to play wma, mp3, and radio stations. I also acts as a voice recorder and creates wav files.  It takes about 40 seconds to start up, that's pretty slow. The 2 gigabyte version actually has 1.88 gigs of space.  If you can't see spending hundreds on an iPod, this might be for you.
