<Title>Awesome Player Except One Thing...
<Date>Fri Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is really cool!  It truly is an iPod Killer.  The best thing is that you can drag and drop your MP3 files and it looks and feels just like an iPod.  Only one small issue, no pun intended, but the slot for the carry band is very small and it takes patience and time to get the carry band attached to the player.  The sound coming of this unit is INCREDIBLE!!!  It realy sounds good in car stereo systems where you can plug the unit in via an audio-to-audio cable!

<Title>great features, just takes getting used to 
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Meizu's M6 miniplayer really is an ipod killer for people who don't mind learning the user interface. It takes some getting used to, but the features can't be beat: FM, mp3, mp4 (xvid), and outstanding battery life. It really does get 20 hrs of audio playback. I haven't tried draining it on video yet, but it just keeps going.  The M6 doesn't play any video just because it's XVID though; you have to make sure it meets the specs of what the player can handle, which is why it comes with video conversion software.  The bundled video conversion software isn't straightforward so you might want to check out this website to get easier and free software (iRiverter) and the associated Meizu profile: [...]

<Title>Great product, highly recommended.

<Content>I'm very happy with my purchase of the Meizu M6. The interface is pretty complex and takes some getting used to, but in my opinion it really only looks complicated just because of how many options and features it has. It didn't take me long to get used to it and customize the whole player to my liking. Adding my own wallpaper from my computer as a background in the Meizu was easy, as well as using the equalizer. The equalizer and sound settings in this player are the best I've seen in any player I've owned this far. Lots of customization to get the sound just the way I like it.   I also found the video converter surprisingly easy to use. All the settings in the converter are already preset to work perfectly with the player, so you just choose your videos, choose the folder to put the converted videos and hit start.   Another reason I'm so fond of this player is how easy is it to transfer songs and videos and photos to the player. When you plug the Meizu into your usb port, your computer reads it like it's a usb thumb drive and you just drag and drop your songs, videos, or photos into the correct folders. When you unplug it, it updates the song list. It can be used to store anything as well, basically a 4 gb usb thumb drive if you need it for just transferring files.  Updating the firmware is very easy too. When I did it, it only involved dragging and dropping two files into the root directory of the drive. After unplugging the Meizu and turning it off and back on it ran all its updates automatically.  I only have a couple minor complaints. One of which is the shiny chrome colored back of the player. It looks very nice when it's clean, but keeping it clean is impossible, so it basically never looks nice, there's always finger prints smeared all over it. Unless I've just cleaned it, the back of this player just doesn't look good. I would have prefered a plain colored back. Perhaps matching the white color of the front of the player. The other is the 4gb space. For me, 4gbs is plenty but for some it won't be enough.   Considering the price of this player in comparison to other players that are similar, my two complaints weren't enough for me to drop the rating down to 4 stars. The Zune has a 30gb hard drive, which I considered getting for around 200 dollars. But I just prefer flash storage over hard drive storage as flash players can be produced in a more compact size and are more durable if they're dropped since they have less moving parts.

<Title>FM radio is useless
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My major complain is that the FM radio function is pathetic. As for customer support, when I downloaded a video converter from their offical website(WisMencoder), my computer reported trojan found.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first "real" MP3 player. (I had a very rudimentary one about 6 or 7 years ago). I knew I didn't want an iPod because a) I didn't want to support the Apple empire, b) it's not the best value for your money, and c) from friend's horror stories, it just seems like an unbearably unreliable product. After a thorough Amazon search, I settled on the Meizu, and I am in love. The sound quality is amazing, and you can put it on different equalizer settings to enrich different genres of music. I haven't tried the video or radio features yet, so I can't comment on that. Battery life is outstanding too - you barely ever have to charge it. I got annoyed that it would sometimes skip songs or change volume while being jostled about in my bag, but that was easily remedied with the discovery of the "hold" button. You can make the background whatever you want, which is cool. I've showed it to all my friends, and even the most diehard iPod loyalists give a coo of envy. It's really easy to put files on there too - it works just like a flash drive. You can also make playlists easily on the Meizu, but you can't name them. There is a loophole, though - plug it in to your computer and you can manually title your playlists there. One of my only gripes is that when you're scrolling through lists, it sometimes takes a while (depending on how fast you can move your fingers!). It won't speed up like on an iPod does while scrolling. I really think that with a U.S. distributor and the release of models with more GB, this could be an extremely formidable iPod opponent. Even now though, at $130 compared to the Nano's $197 for the same amount of GB with less features, it's just the smarter choice.

<Title>Not perfect, but better choice than Ipod, in my opinion
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>With a price so much better than video IPods of similar memory capacity, the excellent sound quality, compatibility with so many formats, and nice picture quality, I would say that this is a good buy. The batteries charge quickly and I've had it last about 15 hours playing music. I've had mine for quite a while now, and have had no major problems with it. But I wouldn't call it an IPod killer. For one thing, I am fairly computer-savvy, but I couldn't get mine to sync with Windows Media player, and it wouldn't play DRM-protected files. It took a while to work through this, because the Meizu help site was obviously written by people whose first language is NOT English. In the end I had to download WinAmp to sync with my player. It also lacks some features that IPod has; for instance, the playlist features are very lacking, and creating a playlist is a laborious process. You can't even play music by genre. Finally, Meizu doesn't have nearly the amount of accessories available that IPod has. There isn't even a speaker-dock available. Yes, you can use generic speakers, but you have to use cables. Even so, if I had to choose again, I'd still get this just because the price and format compatibility is so much better.
