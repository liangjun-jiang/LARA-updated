<Title>A little gem!
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Creative Muvo is a great little mp3 player.  Easy to transfer files from the computer.  Although tiny in size it produces excellent sound quality.  The one AAA battery lasts ages.  The scroller, used for accessing menu options, takes a little bit of practise.  Excellent value for money for a quality mp3 player.

<Title>An average player at a good price
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had the Creative Zend Nano 1GB before and the first impression after opening the new player straight from the box is this think is bigger! Though the MuVo has a great advantage over Nano with the built-in USB for connecting to Win PCs with no hassle, no cables. The major issues with the USB is its speed - it took 20 minutes for 300mb to be copied. It will pose a problem if in a hurry and want to refresh your library in a timely manner.  This is the first impression after opening the box and plugging the Muvo to a PC.

<Title>Vastly Improved
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my 3rd Muvo player.  Things that made me a repeat purchaser: ------------------------------------------ + Extremely compact (Roughly the size of a cigarette lighter) + One handed navigation + Excellent battery life (About 16-20 hours on a single AAA) + Crisp, Clear Audio + Customizable EQ + No cables necessary to connect to a computer + No need to install proprietary software (Works like a flash drive)  Improvements with this model: ----------------------------- + 2 GB Capacity + Now features lyrics and 'libraries' for organization + More compact + More customization options + Lyrics display (if you're willing to supply the file)  Complaints with this model: --------------------------- - When you go to skip a folder, it doesn't bring you to the folder that's currently playing, as in previous models, but the very first one in the list.  Somewhat annoying. - No key ring attachment (But there are holes to attach a strap)

<Title>Great player for 90 days, then it died
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Neat little player that worked great for me for almost 3 months.  Then it dies for no apparent reason other than it is poorly made junk.  You hit the scroll wheel and it turns off.  I wish the power button worked half as well.  I'm shopping for a new player but it won't be one from Creative.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the best small mp3 player that I ever had, I bought it for recording my song from the guitar then it becomes my favorite mp3 player, I have a IPOD 20gb but it's bulky and don't have sound recording and it has no file browsing, you have to open terrible  Itunes to upload a single song and you have to add mp3 tags for each songs. it's a pain. But with creative you just plug the usb cable and upload your musics like an another harddrive, you don't need to add mp3 tags, it reads the file name. Record from the microphone or line in it's great. I am sure you are not expecting studio quality it's only good for quick guitar demo.  also it's works with AAA battery, I don't need to wait for charging like IPOD, I have AAA battery charger and 4 AAA batteries, I replace the batteries then the old one is died. I am carrying one extra AAA wiht me and I am always in tune.  it is very light and comes with arm band, perfect for trade mill.  Only thing is lcd screen is small and it's hard to use the navigation button if you have large fingers. I don't mind but my friends father didn't like it.  I think they shouldn't call it creative nano, because it's better then nano, it should have unique name like Creative IHateIPOD :)

<Title>A review with the blind or visually impaired in mind.
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>(I'd like to see more reviews which talk of access issues, similar to the following review.) First I'll give the pluses.  What I consider a plus for the MuVo V-100 is the direct plug and play access without any stinkin' proprietory software to muck around with.  That, to me, is more a must than a plus! Second plus, although, not necessarily anything real big or important, is the fact one can take this equipment apart and just use the guts of the unit, when separated from the battery pack, as a thumb drive. Third plus and must, is the multiple level directories one can work with, the way mp3 players should work in mine humpble opinion, not this single directory junk where the device does it's own numbering system according to when each file was loaded into the player.  That's a big fat minus where the Ipod shuffle, or any other device like that is concerned.  Fourth plus is, of course, the space at 2 gigabytes.  Now for the minuses, which are unfortunately way more than the plusses. Firstly, there are only four buttons or switches on this device, volume up and down, scroll switch, and play/power button. So, right there, you know that the scroll switch is going to be the main controlling factor on this unit as far as moving from track to track, or going through menues which I'll get to in a bit. Secondly, no audio feedback, of course, unless you stay in "Music" or maybe "recorded tracks," and you turn the device on by holding the play/power button for roughly five seconds, then wait for the unit to boot up, which can take upwards of 12 seconds, depending upon how much data is stored. As for the menues -- which are accessed by pressing the scroll switch -- they do not default.  So, even if you memorize the menues, you have to remember where the heck you left off at.  So, if you left off at Microphone, there's a possibility that once you manage to turn the device on, you might be continuing the recording.  Oh, to select what you want in a menu, you press the scroll switch again.   And, of course, there is no audible monitor through the headset when you record.  So, of course, you have to ask a sighted person if the recorder is going. Oh, speaking of having a sighted person help, what is with these stupid symbols rather than actual written text stating where one is in the menues? Furthermore, what is with this bad habit of these devices that stay in a menu for no more than maybe 5 seconds at the most?  For someone trying to help a blind person out, or for someone with difficulty with focus issues, that just does not work, people!  Hellllllllo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As for recording, the quality is poor.  Now, I'm taking into consideration the fact that the recordings are being done in low bit-rate wave files.  However, the recording volume -- or maybe it's the volume setting used for "recorded tracks" -- is very much lacking. We won't discuss how badly put together the mannual provided on the accompanying CD-rom was.  No step by step instructions on how to work the device, just some cursory explanation of some of the features. So, here's my final grading of the MuVo V-100 by Creative.   I give it an A for concept, an A for space,,  However, for ease of use and accessibility, I give it a D minus. Why a D minus rather than an F for accessibility?  Well, as long as you stay in "music" and as long as you don't accidentally press the scroll switch before moving it left or right to go from track to track, or for scanning tracks, then you're okay.  Secondly -- for folks who are left handed, one can go into the settings menu and rotate the display.  I guess that can actually be a help if a blind person is getting help from a sighted person and it makes it easier for the sighted person to se the screen. Creative seemed to have had a neat idea when they made the first MuVo with no display.  However, I got the impression that those particular models were lacking in space.

<Title>Just okay
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a few other flash players and, in comparison, this is the poorest purchase.  I bought it because it plays audible and fits a niche between my 1g players and my much larger ones.  The sound of the music is comparable to the other players.   The cons for me are as follows:  1. I always lock my player both while listening and while off.  The muvo's lock is  in the settings section rather than being a simple switch.  That makes it inconvenient to lock quickly. 2. Transferring files to the muvo takes much longer than with the other players.   3. The usb needs to connect directly to the computer- not to a hub.  It's thicker than a regular usb connection.  On my computer the way the usb ports are set up, it took up two slots. 4. The navigation system is similar to the one on my Iriver t10 but not as stable. 5. A minor complaint is that it came with no case or arm strap. The size is comparable to the Iriver t10  and to the Sansa both of which come with cases. For someone who is new to mp3 players, I would recommend the comparably prices Sansa m250.  It is far simpler to use and has similar features with fewer negatives.  An update: I've been using this player now for a few months.  Far from growing on me, I am even more unhappy with it.  I'd lower my rating if I could.  I alternate between this and my older 1GB Sansa.  It takes  20 minutes to transfer 1 book to the Muvo and 5 minutes for the same files with the Sansa.  Possibly the Muvo still uses the defunct 1.1USB format. The 2GB version of my Sansa is the same price as this player and is a far better player. It also has a radio and voice recorder. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-6925435-5758463">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>

<Content>I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  It works great in every way.  It's also a lot of memory for a great price!  We have already loaded over 300 songs and still have almost half the memory free.  The only negative I would have is that it is a little hard to power up.  You sometimes have to hold the power button down hard to get it to start.

<Content>Anyone have trouble with your computer recognizing the USB connection with your MP3 player?  I have tried numerous times to get my computer to recognize the Creative V100 (has the USB built in, no cord) and the computer simply does not see it.  After looking through Creative's web forum, it appears I am not the only one with this problem with this unit.  I've reinstalled the software and even tried plugging the player in without software to see if my PC recognizes it and it doesn't.  I don't have any problems using my USB port when downloading from my digital camera.  I am curious if anyone has had trouble with the SanDisk M250 2 GB.

<Title>Audio Book Heaven
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned 3 MP3 players prior to this one. 2 iPods and a Phillip's GoGear. All fancy $200+ units. I think the models of those I purchased were probably great for music... but they stunk for audio books. Problems I had were syncing devices, 3rd party programs, extra cradles, wires..etc.... I'm a computer savy person and it was just a hassle to get new content onto those players quickly...  I came upon the MuVo line via a friend with the 512mb one. I played with it for 30 minutes and was sold. In no time I was able to plug it right into my PC's USB port and XP automatically detected it as a flash drive.... I dumped a medium sized book onto it in about 4 minutes and I hit the on button..... and that was it, it started with the first file and kept on truckin. Now the BIG test.... i turned the unit off and prayed that it remembered where i was at in my book... flawlessly it did :-)  I quickly ordered the 2gig version that holds about 3 books worth of data. I could totally get by with just the 1gig, but... regardless, i've got the extra space if I ever need it.  What I love about the MuVo 100 is it's super simple... there are no wires, it plugs straight into a USB port and I've used it on many a laptop and desktop with no problems at all.  I listen to books about 12-15 hours a week.  I 'almost' gave it 4 stars for one little flaw.... you need to pay attn to the battery indicator on the LCD; it's the typical battery icon with 3 cells that start off black... then as you lose battery life a cell disappears... you get the picture. But when you're on your last cell, when you notice the last one go away, replace the battery. If you don't, it sometimes will fail to record where you were at when you turned the unit off and uses your previously timestamped shut off date. The only annoying thing at that point is once you have a new battery, fast forwarding to the where you were at.

<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I chose to go with this .mp3 player for a couple reasons, partly because I didn't feel I needed more than 2 gigs for what I was planning on using it for (turns out I was right, too; I have yet to fill it with music), and partly because I don't like the idea of a non-replaceable, rechargeable battery (for me, I think it's easier & safer to just use AAA's).  The only real drawback for me is that there's no AM/FM tuner. Normally I don't listen to the radio but having it would've been far preferable to the microphone this .mp3 player comes with. If you can overlook that then this is a great buy.

<Content>Just got for Christmas. My home computer does not recognize the player even though it recognizes all my other USB devices including an older MuVo N200. A search on internet reveals many are having this same problem. Their technical support stinks. It's only e-mail and you get a response about every 2 days. Good news is that it works on two other computers I've tried it on. I saw a posting saying that someone solved the problem by adding a second USB card. Have spent over 6 hours on this to no avail. I'll bet it works fine if your one of the lucky ones whose computer recognizes it.

<Title>If it only had a brain!
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Muvo V100 by Creative for its ease of use: AAA battery, & drag & drop from Windows Media Player 11.  The thought that I would have trouble finding the music on the player never entered my mind.  If this thing had a "brain" (you know, like a user-friendly folder system?) it would be a very nice product for the price.  As it is, I have only one music list that it will play most of its selections.  So I will use it occasionally, but after buying a Cadillac (My Sony NWZ-A818 Walkman, reviewed elsewhere), it's hard to go back to the little red wagon.

I tested this device on several PC's and got the same performance.  The older, 1GB Muvo worked fine and copied at acceptable speed (about 10 mins per GB).  This 2GB Muvo is not worth buying; it is a blemish on Creative Lab's name.  They should not be selling it, period.

<Title>Not an Upgrade over the Nano Plus
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own the Creative 1GB Nano Plus with FM tuner, and it is one of the best flash players out there.  It is small, beautifully designed, and full of features.  The only problem was that I outgrew the 1GB size, so I thought what could possibly be better than having a later version of it and a 2GB size?  Well, this MuVo works like an earlier generation of Creative's mp3 players, not like a newer generation.  - I was warned about the transfer speed, but I figured I only transfer music onto the player once every 3 or 4 months.  It takes about 90 minutes to transfer 1.85 GB (that's the maximum capacity).  My 1GB Nano Plus took about 15 minutes (so 30 minutes if a 2GB version of it existed).    - For some reason, my Nano Plus also sounds far better than this player.  The sound is flat on this player.  I tried adjusting the custom equalizer to match my Nano Plus's custom EQ settings, but the sound is inferior compared to the Nano Plus.       - I'm not a fan of the default folders labelled A, B, C, D on this MuVo.  On my Nano Plus, I created my own folders.  I can also do that with the MuVo, but anything outside of the lettered folders is considered part of the root folder, and I can only keep a combined 500 files outside of the lettered folders.  In other words, you'll have to keep at least some files in the lettered folders, and you'll have to remember whether your audio book is in generically labelled Folder B or C.  When you select one of the labelled folders, it automatically plays the first file of the first folder by default instead of letting you select the subfolder within the lettered folder before playing.  Not as easy or intuitive to manage your folders as the Nano Plus.  - The player is lighter than the Nano Plus, but it is also slightly wider and longer.  And the plastic feels very cheap.  The USB drive that detaches from the battery is not easy to remove, and you have to crush the LCD screen to even get a grip on it.    - The only positive of this player over the Nano Plus is that there is a "favorites" option where you can tag any track that is playing (by holding down the scroll wheel for a few secs) as a favorite.  This acts like a built-in favorites playlist which can span across folders.    - I suggest you buy the Nano Plus if it's still available and you don't need 2GB (2GB holds about 600 songs with an average VBR of 128kps in WMA format for me).  And the Nano Plus also has an FM tuner which this MuVo lacks.

<Content>On the pro side: great price for a 2G device.  Good sound and battery usage.  USB makes it easy to download music to.  It uses standard MP3 rather than a proprietary format.  On the con side: they say it uses USB2.0, but downloads are slow.  There are very few accessories that work with it.  I purchased a Belkin device for FM use in my car, and the signal is not stong enough for my car.  The file structure on the device is very clumsy.  In the end, I'd rather have a device that can be used in more situations because more accessories are available.  I may end up buying an iPod anyway, even though I think they gouge the price.

<Title>Great Value - Works OK with a Mac
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Roughly $70 for 2 gig and a voice recorder with great sound. I am happy with this purchase. As a long time Mac user you might expect that I would be like eveyone else and get an ipod. I bought this primarily for working out. It serves its purpose wonderfully and I don't see why I would want to spend more given what I am using it for.  I like the fact that it uses a AAA battery instead of a proprietary rechargable. $5 got me a package of 4 nimh rechargables and it runs something like 20 hours on 1. I have had it a month so far. Have recharged the batteries once and am on my second go around on 1 of the 4.   Creative goes out of their way to make things difficult for Mac users. That said, if you set itunes to import as .mp3 or .wav (I don't like .wav) you can drag your playlists right over to the muvo.   You have to set up your own folders and you may have to rename the song titles as the muvo plays in alpha order within a folder. However, if you can handle this kind of basic file organization, or don't care which order your songs play, this unit will work fine for you regardless of what operating system you use.  I currently have 4 different  1 hour workout folders, a book on mp3,  and another 8 hours or so in 4 or 5 different folders orgainized more by genre that I primarily play in the car through a fm transiver to the car stereo. All that in the size of a pack of gum!  Can't speak to the software as I wouldn't use windows software with it.  Perhaps if money were no object I would get an iPod nano. However, money is an object and while the ipod interface may be nicer, it is certainly not that difficult to manage the mp3 files with this unit. Plus, I still like the AAA vs proprietary battery and the built in voice recorder.   My bottom line is that the sound quality is good, it works, gets good battery life. The down side is that the documentation is in a proprietary Windoze format that I would have to go through more effort than it is worth to read, the interface is clunky, it doesn't display the artist or album tiltle only the song title. However, for my purposes and given the fact that I am comfortable with computer file management, the plusess far outweigh the negatives.  Wade

<Title>Oh how I LOVE this product line

<Content>Creative's Muvo series is really the most ingenious thing to happen to portable music since the invention of the mp3.  Being able to carry and listen to music on what is essentially a thumb drive means you never have to wonder where the USB cable went:  you can swap music to and from the player using any computer's USB port, no software necessary (DRM'd tracks being the exception, for obvious reasons).  This makes it a snap to create new folders and stuff them with whatever goodies you happen to have on your hard drive.  I also love the feature that lets you delete tracks without going anywhere near a computer, which is great if you just uploaded a brand new album and discovered some less-than-listenable tracks while you're on the go.  These players also get amazing battery life as well - I usually get between 12-15 hours from a single AAA.  The players come with a dizzying array of playback options: Normal, Shuffle, Shuffle Folder, Repeat Folder, Repeat Track, etc to keep things interesting.I've been using the 1 GB model for about a year and a half now and couldn't be more thrilled with it.  The 2 GB models were christmas gifts to several family members and have since gotten rave reviews as well. For some strange reason I was never able to find the Muvo series at any of my local electronics stores, but they were well worth the wait from the online retailers. I can't see how anyone would be disappointed.

<Title>Creative Muvo V100 2 GB MP3 Player White-Would Not Work !
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very dissatisfied with this product because I live in South Carolina and I bought one of these Creative Muvo V100 2 GB MP3 Player White units for my wifes son in Florida for a Christmas gift and it would not work. Amazon only had a 30 day warranty on it and I bought it in the end of  November and it was not opened and tried until after Christmas and it DID NOT work.In cases like that where the item is not going to even be tried out for a period of time,I should still be able to get it replaced
