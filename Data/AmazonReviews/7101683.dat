<Title>Spend some TIME with it, and fall in love
<Date>Fri Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you spend some time with this player it is equal to or better then the ipod. I've used an ipod before and its great. But when researching to choose which player I wanted to invest $300 on, I downloaded the manual from each of the players respected manufacturers (apple, sony, iriver, creative). When directly comparing the HD-3 to the ipod (the "most popular player") they both have the same annoying features. Ipod uses only itunes to transfer music and sony uses sonicstage. Sonicstage version 3 was pretty simple to figure out.   I loaded up my library from my pc and then transfered album by album to the hd3. It was the same procedure the ipod manual describes.      The HD3 does have a playlists option in which you bookmark songs. Ipod calls it "on the go something" but both have you hold  a button to add the track to a my favorite playlist which is a few menus away from the opening screen. Its no problem.   Shuffling is also easy to figure out. It's about the same explanation you would see with any sony audio device. I mean the manual came from Japan but its written in english. So stop whinning. The HD3 actually gives you more shuffling options than ipod. You can shuffle all the tracks, or all the albums, or all the artists, or choose to shuffle tracks within an artist or album group.   Overall the HD3 has way better sound and a much longer battery life than any other player including ipod. Plus if the battery dies YOU can replace instead of paying someone to do it. The HD3 is also smaller, sleeker, and looks cooler. Plus when do sony products break? I still use a six year old cd player.  So don't let U2 convince you to buy an ipod. Buy a freaking awesome player that is unique and much cooler.  No I don't work for sony, I work at Publix. Its a grocery store.

<Content>IF you are considering this you might want to wait until may when sony releases the NW-HD5, it has an even longer battery life (40 hours ATRAC, 30 hours Mp3) and a user-replaceable battery. Pictures are on engadget.com

<Title>The Sound is Incredible but I had to exchange the original
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Sony HD3 in lieu of the IPOD because of all the reviews I read stating that Sony had the best sound. I was not disapointed with the sound--it's amazing. HOWEVER, I had to exchange it after only four days because the flimsy power button bent when my fingernail accidentally slipped under it. The power button on this device is very thin and should anything get caught underneath it, it will easily bend. This is something Sony should consider modifying with the HD5 that is scheduled to be out this year.   Also: The software is not the best but not as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.   The best reason to buy this MP3 player: The sound--it's awesome. Also the battery life is a plus but don't count on getting 30 hours unless you convert to the Sony format.

<Title>Buy by name, reap the benefits...
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had purchased the Network Walkman after my iPod was stolen.  I had used the iPod and discovered all of its perks and downfalls.  The Walkman, to me, is 10x as sexy and as functional.  The only downfall is the digital equalizer, which doesn't help the sounds quality whatsoever.  What you need is a good pair of headphones.  The songs go on a lot easier than the iPod's music match and iTunes.  My problem at the moment is finding an FM transmitter as good as the iTrip.  Buy this product, it comes in your favorite color.

<Title>Just a few points
<Date>Thu Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A lot of other reviews have posted all important points, but I'll sum up with the best qualities in this player. All players have flaws in them, but it depends what you are looking for. 1) A 30 hour battery life is great if you play it a lot. Plus you only need to charge it for 2-3 hours to get it fully charged 2) The sound quality is superb for an mp3 player, with its own equalisers, custom and pre-set. You can set your own treble and bass quality. 3) Lots of shuffle options. You can shuffle by groups, singers, albums, and songs (basically track shuffle and unit shuffle). 4) You can't exactly have playlists but you can 'bookmark' up to 100 songs, which acts like a playlist. 5) You can search by artist, groups, genre and album 6) The player is very very small (smaller than an i-pod) and can hold up to 13,000 tracks. It is really thin and can easily slip into a shirt pocket. 7) Lots of useful little things that makes the player great, such as a measure bar to indicate how much time of one song has elapsed.

<Title>Geeky software, not so excellent hardware
<Date>Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Initial review (April 2005) I don't like Apple and neither understand nor want to participate in the iPod mania. My experience with Sony walkmans (I've got two MD walkmans before plus MD hardware) has always been positive, and the choice of NW-HD3 was obvious.  Here are my impressions:  + Sound quality in incredible (I don't have the background noise some people are complaining about); + Navigation is convenient; I'm able to control the device when it's in my pocket; + Native MP3 playback is nice: I've got my previous collection of 300 CDs encoded into MP3 because I couldn't take all of the CDs with me when I moved; NW-HD3 didn't require me to decrease the already decreased quality of the music by converting MP3s into ATRAC.  * The battery lasts for 14-16 hours, not 30 (I'm mostly listening to ATRAC3Plus-encoded music); * The charger is inconvenient but seems to be hard to break :) * The screen is large but long song names get scrolled just once. * Sony's HD-CASE1 hard carrying case became available just recently; it's still hard to find. It's a must if you don't carry your HD3 in your pocket (as I do). * SONY Connect music store is a joke. It doesn't have what I like (various kinds of metal and rock). I downloaded a few songs from it and they seemed to be in ATRAC3 132 kBps - could've been ATRAC3Plus 256 (I didn't find a way to switch the format).  - The software takes getting used to. I tried SonicStage 2.3, 3.0 and 3.1. Upgrade requires you to re-authorize your player (kind of inconvenient). The latest release of SonicStage (3.1) occasinally terminates with some error. - The player sorts music by album name, not by the release year. It's a bit confusing. - The most annoying feature is that the player forgets the song that was played before charging it, and you have to look for it again.  It should be noted that I don't need some features many people find extremely useful: playlists, genres, games, organizers, etc. I know all the albums I record on my player (so far I've put 12 Gigs into it), and thanks to the fast navigation I can access any of them in a matter of seconds.  Buying this walkman was my conscious decision which I didn't regret.  Update after 2006-01-31. The walkman freezes for 20-40 seconds every 3-4 hours, and SONY suggested me to pay them $83 for figuring out what the problem is. Next time I will think twice before buying their harddrive-based gadgets.

<Title>Avoid it and spend your money wisely on some other player.
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I baught it and feel like throwing it from the highest floor for the following reasons;  1... Like most MP3 players I have used you cannot drag and drop music files directly to the player.  2... SonicStage Software used to "manage" the file transfers SUCKS. Sony should consider firing its software writing staff, or outsource its software from good people.  3... No songs list. Can only list by Artist /Album/Genre/Group/Others. Dude where my file list?  4... Why on earth do we need another audio format (OMG) ?  5... Did I mention that the software sucks?  Avoid till sony releases a better audio manager.

<Date>Sun Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I will just mirror everyone else's comments, great player, horrible software.  I wish someone would write better software than Sonicstage, it isn't intuitive at all.  Even Windows Media Player has a better interface.  If you like your music organized in to neat genres, don't get this player, because Sonicstage will make you tear out your hair.  if you just download various music files from P2P sites, then this is for you.

<Title>Best mp3 player for the price
<Date>Mon Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this player for four months and I am an audiophile and i have had most of the different players for music except minidisk.  THis player is outstading.  Not only does it have unbelievable and unsurpassable sound quality, it also is very functional.  The 13000 song capacity is great however none of us will ever use all that space.  I find that the extra space is nice because you dont have to worry about if u have enough space.  Now to discuss the software.  I have used the orginal sonic stage and found it quite confusing, however the version which ships with the HD3 is superb, most things are tabbed or dropdowns, and very easy to navigate.  If someone thinks the software is hard to use, then they must be completely inexperianced with computers.  I find it uinbebleiavablhy easy to  navigate.  Now this is a real mp3 player, not a fake like the ipod.  The thirty hour battery claim is pretty accurate (honestly  who can use an 8 hour charge?).  This player has much better sound quality and is easier to use.  I did alot of research before buying this expensive peice of equipment (i got it when it just came out).  The specs are much better than anything out there.  You will not regret this purchase

<Title>Network Walkman NW-HD3 - A Mixed Bag
<Date>Wed Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The NW-HD3 looks and sounds excellent.  Navigation via the LCD display is ok but not quite as easy or as quick as on an iPod.    The big drawback is the Sony Sonic Stage software that comes with the unit and that must be used to transfer tracks (there is no alternative).  The software's faults include but are by no-means limited to; can't handle a large number of files (crashes), intermittantly hangs your PC, relies solely on ID3 information (i.e. often transfers files as 'Unknown Artist Unknown Track'), auto-transfer will re-transfer audio files that are already present on your NW-HD3 as additional files (resulting in many copies of the same tracks), has a confusing interface, requires frequent re-installation (which often requires completely re-formatting the NW-HD3), no longer supports importing Windows Media WMA audio files and is very 'processor intensive'.    Software aside, I would give this product 4/5 stars.  With the software I feel generous in awarding it 1/5.

<Content>Only someone who is from another planet would buy this player. It has problems playing MP3 and WMA files. It forces you to use the dumb Sony software. It costs more than an IPOD.. In short.. buy something else. Sony get your act together.. You invented this category and now you have lost it

<Title>Worst electronics purchase I've ever made
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Absolutely terrible. That's the best two-word description I can give this player.   As many other reviewers on this and other sites have indicated, the SonicStage software is a laughable abomination- as if they outsourced the coding to a group of novice programmers with bad senses of humor. Moreover, if you're lucky enough to get your songs onto the player, the player scrolls through tracks at a mind-numbingly slow pace- for my modest collection (roughy 1k tracks) scrolling took 2-3 seconds per movement. So scrolling through the entire collection in order would take roughly 2-3k seconds, 30-50 minutes. That's simply unacceptable for a device that costs as much as this.  Two notable positives were sound quality and form factor. The device looks and sounds good, and if all you wanted to do was turn it on, press play and let it run, it'd be a great product. But if you like to flip through tracks, my best advice is this- buy something else because it will drive you out of your mind.  Thank goodness for reasonable return policies.

<Title>Do NOT buy this player.
<Date>Fri Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made.   While the mp3 player itself is not bad, the software it forces you to use to transfer songs, is aboslutely awful. It will only organize songs by their ID3 tags and sortof artist, album, etc. but the software WILL NOT allow you to create any kind of subdirecty what-so-ever and this drove me insane. If only have 10 albums, fine, if you only have albums made by one artist, fine. But if you have a soundtrack or a compilation album with multiple artists, the whole thing gets split up in alphabetical order according to artist. And if you want to sort by album, every album you have is listed on the main screen. Personally, this way forced me to scroll down for literally minutes to get to an album a ways down the alphabet.  All I wanted to do was organize music so I didn't have to scroll through so much to get to something I actually wanted, but it was literally impossible. And there is no way around this software(SonicStage), I checked with Sony support (I called repeatedly) and everyone I talked to said it is impossible, and judging from how many updates have come along for sonicstage, without this support, I don't see it happening in the future either.  Stay away from this mp3 player, I highly suggest an iPod or an iRiver brand player.

<Title>WHAT?!
<Date>Fri Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>What is everyone talking about? If they just read the manual they could work it better. The software for this player is not brilliant but it DOESN'T crash your computer... it depends if you're computer sucks. It: 1. Holds up to 13,000 songs and this theory is TRUE 2. Has more shuffle options than the I-Pod shuffle 3. Is the smallest mp3 player out there for it's memory 4. Has better sound quality than other players 5. Can search for songs by name of song, album and artist. Also searches by Genres and you can form groups. 6. Can have one playlist that holds 100 songs. 7. Is extremely small and good looking 8. The 7 line display is very clear and informative.  9. Many different sound options with an equaliser. So there.

<Title>Okay if you want to carry around a LOT of songs
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I bought this in the store, I also looked at those little round 1GB players and found those a lot more attractive, but I let myself be talked into buying this one because of the space.  Frankly, 13K songs is WAY more than I'll ever have on this thing; it's kind of like renting an entire condo complex so I can use three or four rooms.  But for those who want a lot of space and want to back up their music collection on it, it's fine.  I have had the same problem people have mentioned about the way the player sorts songs (I have a lot of soundtrack albums by various artists, and when I copied them they were scattered all over heck and gone in the menu) but I found a way around it--SonicStage lets you create personalized playlists, so I simply divide up my music into personalized playlists in My Library and then copy those to the player.  Kind of a pain, but it works.  I also have another issue with the hardware--the power switch on the bottom is rather small and flimsy and difficult to manipulate, and I am afraid it might snap off (probably the day after the warranty runs out).    If I had it to do over again, I would buy a different player.

<Title>Fairly happy with my purchase
<Date>Mon Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned this device for about 4 months and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I found this new for $170 at another site - sorry Amazon :( - so I really couldn't pass it up.  Good points: Cheap, Sony name(some may find that bad), Sound quality is good, mp3 support, I got about 25hrs of battery life, small size, and nice styling.  Weak points:  Menus are a little cumbersome to navigate but nothing major.   I often have the player lock up or skip during high-impact running.  I suppose a flash type player would be better suited for running. The biggest disappointment was uncovered the first time I transferred my collection of music onto the unit.  SonicStage 2.3 would crash on my system during transfers with Win XP Pro SP2.  Also, many of my mp3's would not transfer.  I downloaded an XP hotfix and I somehow managed to fill up the drive so I didn't need to add anything else for a while.  Recently i wanted to add some new music so I downloaded version 3.2 before making the transfer and had no problems!  I recommend everyone upgrade to a newer version of Sonicstage if you are having reliability issues.   3.2 also organizes tracks a little better and it's a little easier to clean up the artist/title/album names to make everything nice and neat.  If you can manage to find this for &lt;$200 I would say go for it and make sure you download some better transfer software.

<Title>Great sound- build quality
<Date>Tue Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you can find this player for [...] or under and don't mind a player that uses id3 tagging, you will get a awesome sounding and great built piece of equipment.If you have used sonic stage before or had a minidisc, that would be a plus for this player. I have owned or own a ipod mini , ipod 4g 20 gig, iriver h10, creative zen micro,and a rio carbon pearl, and can say this player bests them all in sound quality, especially with atrac files.  If you want a radio , recording, or the ability to just dump files on the player look elswhere.Sonic stage 3.2 actaully works pretty good , though not as smooth as itunes and the sony connect store is lacking.You have to have your songs properly tagged or else you will have a mess with the "artists" catagory. Keep in mind you can still find albums with multiple artists under the "album" search, or make a playlist of random songs under Sonic stage (GROUP MODE). I am used to this because itunes does the same things to my multiple artist albums ie "the southpark album", it's the same thing I have to look under "album" on my ipod, because it lists every artist on the album on the artist search , which makes it a pain.  Anyway, the unit is built very nice, aluminum shell and stiff buttons and very good quality plastic is used. I think this is the last Sony HD nw built in Japan , the hd5 is built in Malasyia.  A score of 5 may seem high , but I really love the battery life, sound and beauty of this unit. If I had paid 299.00, I probably wouldn't be so happy. If your the type of person who likes superior sound and has a well tagged music library and can live with sonic stage and don't need voice recording, FM ect. and can find this for a steal you probably will be a very happy camper !!  Also, here is a link of a program that lets you transfer mp3's to the hd3 , hd5 , e501 ec. ect. without sonic stage. If you don't have SS installed already you will also need the driver. http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3
