<Title>Coby's PMP4330 is an impressive device  that shows what other PMP's are lacking.

<Content>Strengths: Wide Screen, Built-in Speakers, FM Radio, Records Content Directly (no docking station needed), Plays Most Content, Fits in Pocket  Weaknesses: Power Adapter Required to Re-charge Unit (No USB Charging)  I saw a prior CNET review and wanted to set the record straight because I thought it was unfair and we (as consumers) need to tell companies when they are doing something right. As an experienced PMP user, I can tell you that there are only two choices that make sense for users who want PMP's with the most comprehensive video functions, that can still be slipped in your pocket: Archos 604, or Coby PMP4330.  Archos was the leader in power PMP's until they split their product into two separate products.  Now you must purchase a separately-priced docking module to record video, and use proprietary cables to connect the unit to a computer. Archos did this to get the price closer to the low $300's because the days of selling $400+ PMP's are over.  Coby, however, has managed to deliver a product that allows you to have your cake and eat it to. You get a self-contained unit with all the features of the old Archos models in a very compact package for around $269 (in a recent sale) with a 30GB hard drive and an SD card slot. You don't have to purchase anything else to record content directly from the unit, and it uses normal cables that are included.  The 4.3" wide screen blows away the competition. If you haven't used a PMP with a wide screen, you don't know what you are missing. Many PMP manufacturers are moving this direction. Coby allows you to set the ratio and fill the entire screen regardless of the video. It would take about 3 iPod Video screens placed side-by-side to get the same effect. This is a good unit to watch video on. My advice, don't buy units with square screens.  The stereo speakers are surprising good and blow away the lousy speakers on my other PMP's and even my laptop! You rarely see this in a PMP. I think the reason for this is the curved design behind the unit that allows optimal space for speaker positioning. I'm not an expert, but you will be satisfied. I can't figure out how CNET's previous review got it so wrong.  The FM radio function is excellent because Coby designed a user-friendly radio interface that looks and feels the part. My wife couldn't get over the screen that looked like a car radio and was so easy to move through the automatic presets. She wanted one of her own just based on that feature. The reception quality was as good as any car radio. Optionally you can record any radio content to MP3.  I think this would be most useful if you want to record a radio talk show and listen to it later.  As an MP3 player it doesn't impress or unimpress me. Most MP3 players deliver content that is pretty standard.  This is no exception. One benefit of this model is the equalizer, but that is something I expect on any unit. If you don't care about video and just want an MP3 audio player, buy an iPod because you will be able to recharge it using a USB cable and it will have a smaller foot print. I similarly have little to say about the voice recorder or e-book functions because they are bonus features to me. I have tried them and they work. Good enough.  The File Explorer is about what you would expect. It is nothing fancy, but it is simple and uses a directory hierarchy like any computer hard drive.  One nice thing is the ability to rename files and directories using the unit, but you will probably end up using your computer to organize the files. When you connect the unit by USB, your computer recognizes the PMP as another drive and allows you to manage files just like most other PMP's (except iPod). It's a simple, universal USB cable. Archos, what are you thinking?  Recording video content directly from the unit is a HUGE plus and separates it from the newest Archos models which do not record video unless you buy the $100 docking model which is a deal-killer. This is great if you have a lot of programs TIVOed and want to move them to your PMP. You get typically large .asf files which you can keep and play as-is or if space is a concern (and it will be), you can use a utility like ConvertMovie 4.0 to reduce them by 80 percent with the same quality in MP4 format. Ten episodes of the Simpsons can be reduced to about a gigabyte. One thing I noticed is that it takes about 5-seconds to start after you press record, but no big deal.  It has a typical timer so you can set the time or you can stop recording manually. No fancy scheduling, but that's what my TIVO is for.  The form factor and size is unmatched by the competition. It is a little wider, a little thicker, and about an inch longer than a 60/80GB iPod Video, yet it does so much MORE. It still slips easily into your pocket, and the back of the unit tapers inward so it appears smaller and fits easier into your pocket. I own an iPod Video and I can tell you that the only things iPod has on this unit is the smaller size and the larger hard drive.  That is it. I even disagree with the previous review about the controls.  I have no problem with them and find them easy to use, actually easier to fast forward video than the iPod.  The previous review talked about the quality of the unit being low. I have to disagree. Yes, it is plastic, not metal like the back of an iPod Video, but it is decent quality and as good as the materials forming most new laptops. Just because iPod sets the bar high with a metal cover on the back does not mean that all other cases are cheap. It is a practical design that works. Everything is plastic anymore and it keeps the price affordable.  White plastic always looks cheaper. If Coby had used an all-black design, then the previous reviewer probably wouldn't have noted anything.  I actually bought this unit as a present to replace my daughter's current PMP, but decided to give her my hand-me-down iPod Video instead.  I think that's for the best.  I hope that Coby keeps doing what it is doing in providing another option for consumers.  If you are in the market for a video PMP right now, you won't beat this deal and you won't be disappointed.  Maybe Apple, Microsoft, Archos and the rest can learn something from what Coby is providing.

<Title>Great all around PMP.
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not sure what reviewers at CNET were thinking but this Coby portable media player is excellent.  It accepts a lot more media files and the cost is just right for a 30g player.  I don't think many other PMP's out there can compare when you factor in everything.  The screen is nice at 4.3 inches and one of the biggest out there.  I generally use it while doing cardio at the gym.  This way I can catch up to my TV programming and makes my workouts go by fast.  I haven't tested the battery to the fullest but it seems okay.  I recommend this over any iPod video, Zune, Gigabeat and Archos.

<Title>Video and mp3 player.  Not much of an text reader
<Date>Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A criticism.  The ebook feature for this device is a mean-spirited joke. The first frustration is the load time. A longish novel (over 100 pages) will take 2 to 3 minutes to load onto your screen. Why, is beyond me. By comparison, a 2 hour long movie (probably 100 times larger file size) will load, and start playing in about 10 seconds. The reader pretty much ignores any formatting, including indents and line spacing, and will not justify text on its own screen.  That is, it actually cut off lines of text midword. In addition, while you are able to alter the background wallpaper of the player to pretty much anything you want, you are stuck with a dull red background for the reader.  Also, when the features description said text, thats what they meant. You can forget about reading palm dba or any other popular ebook format on this. If there are others to whom this is a significant purchasing point, be warned. As for the other features, not really an audio or videophile, so I will defer to the other commenters.  No problems personally

<Title>Needs a firmware update
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this device for about 6 months now.  The best thing about it is the ability to record video.  I've been able to grap a number of things that I only had on VHS into digital files.  The quality is good enough for viewing on the device or on the computer, but nowhere near what you'd need for TV watching.  But then, by modern TV standards, that's pretty much true for VHS, too.  I have had problems playing MP4 and other video files on this thing, too.  They will work okay for a while, then start to get noisy with drop outs after about 15 minutes.  Others will play for 15 or 20 minutes (into a 1 hour file) and just stop.  All of the files play fine on my computers with a variety of players, so I figure there are problems with the device (or my device, anyway.)  Then there's the MP3 player.  I can't figure out how to get the songs to play in a selected order.  It's either the order they are on the disk, or "random" and there's not much difference between the two.  Files display in folders, not in alphabetic or date order, and there doesn't seem to be any way to sort them.  There's no mention in the documentation of playlist files, which would help greatly.  Then there's the multi-second delay between songs, which is helpful (sarcasm on) since it gives you time to select the next song you want to hear.  I'd love to be able to listen to songs on this thing in the same order that they are on the original CD.  Is that too much to ask?

<Title>COBY PMP4330 got a few flaws, still one of the best in the market...
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>POSITIVES: + The quality of the screen is pretty amazing.  + The size of the storage is just enough for me, and the transfer rate is satisfactory.  + The design of the PMP is fabolous. ;) + Video recording feature is pretty amazing.  + It is so convenient to connect it to your TV, Camcorder or any AV terminal. + The price is very affordable esp. for a quality product like this.  NEGATIVES: - Not all the codecs are supported and yet there is no firmware upgrade that COBY has published for this product. - For some movies the video codec works but the audio codec is not supported and it takes years to convert.  RESULT: definitely a "BUY" !! ;)
