<Title>Great when it works!!
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I loved this PSA player, and then it stopped working two weeks after I received it.  The computer software could not recognize the player and made changing the music impossible.  Also, the player stopped working.  I found out, dealing with Sonic Blue customer service is a NIGHTMARE.  It looks as if I MAY get a new player 1 to 1.5 months after I returned it due to lack of stock on their part.  The player itself was sleek, and easy to use, but<br>eats batteries fast.  Rechargeables are needed to make it cost effective.  All in all, the player is a good design, Sonis Blue and their warranty/customer service get a zero for their help and support.

<Title>The only MP3 player for athletes
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I've had the PSAplay120 for 3 months now and I absolutely love it.  It's light weight, it's durable, and the sound is incredible.<p>Nike/Rio have supplied many features which make this the ideal player.  The arm strap and belt clip offer two different methods for wearing this player, depending on your activity.  The player is designed so that you can easily control it without having to look at the buttons (great for when you are running).<p>Now I just need to get my 64MB MMC card and I'll be able to load over 150 minutes of workout music.

<Title>Love it
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I love this thing.  Its so lightweight and perfectly designed for running with, unlike most other mp3 players.  Some tips for others to note with this device, and some for all such devices: although mp3 is the most widely used format, wma offers the same qualty for less space thus giving you more music.  Also, and this is important to know for this device, the sandisk cards are the only ones guaranteed to work all the time with the nike players, the other brands have been found(by the sonicblue development team) to work only part of the time.  Make sure you get a sandisk card so you dont end up getting burned and then taking it out on the good folks who made this wonderful device.

Since head phones are about 5 bucks they don't detract a whole star from a 200 dollar product. Other than that none of the other problems are that annoying, the lack of features is made up for by the remote control which makes it so easy to change tracks that you can listen to whatever you want. Not being able to change the battery when the belt clip or arm band are attatched is ok because chances are when you are running you don't have a battery any way and isf you do you can always just unscrew the thumb screw and change it. The last slight con is the arm band being a bit snug, this was unavoidable because if the band wasn't a bit snug the player would not be secure to your arm and it is no where near tight enough that it will ever cause any damage to your arm. I find that be putting the band over my shirt sleeve feel barely anything. Overall this is a great product and should be considered if you are shopping for a player even if you aren't an athlete.

<Title>Great Sound, User Friendly and  Affordable
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>After several hours of reviewing many types of players I decided on this one and I have not been dissapointed.  I was looking for a player with at least 1 hour play time so I decided on a minimum 64MB.  After my first download (about 15 seconds per song) I had 30 songs with around 2.5 hrs of music without the additional memory card!  I bought it for snowboarding and mountian biking so fancy controls and LCD was not a priority.  The software is great wants you spend and hour or so getting use to how it operates. Headphones are nice but I'll buy new ones that will allow me to wear a helmet. The face plate design with its controls is easy to operate without looking at it. The arm band works great and I can't imagine not having this option!!  Overall a great player and great choice!!

<Title>Not bad...initially.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>My player worked well for the first 2 months.  Unfortunately, I also had a lot of difficulty with my computer recognizing my player due to driver problems.  Dealing with Rio/Sonic Blue customer service is a joke.  I had to pay...just to speak to a technician and, at the end of the session, NOTHING was resolved.  I would seriously consider another player.

<Content>the player itself has been great.  Had to download the new firmware to stop the battery from draining when it went to sleep but after that it was fine.<p>The headset was too small for my big head and the remote control was useless to me because the combined length of the headset cord and the remote (which always popped off anyway) was too long.<p>If you buy a headset make sure it doesn't have the &quot;L&quot; type plug as these don't fit in well to the device.

<Title>Slow downloading on external media card
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>It downloads songs to the player at a decent rate to the internal memory, but it takes twice as long to download songs to the external (extra card plug-in) memory.  Also, you really need to have a great battery charge to transfer songs or you'll get an error in the process.  I always put new batteries in right before downloading songs, then you can put the older batteries back in.  I can't wait until they put 4 times as much internal memory into this unit and give it a firewire interface.  ....what, I can dream, can't I?

<Title>It's ok IF it works
<Date>Sun Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for jogging after my Rio 300 (which I had for 3 years) quit working.  I was hoping that since this product was Nike it would be somewhat durable and would be suitable for activities such as jogging.  Unfortunately that was not the case as it isn't suitable for anything.  <p>The unit is poorly designed and the software is unreliable at best.  The belt clip is a joke.  It will not stay clipped for more than 5 minutes given that it doesn't really clip (the lower portion of the &quot;clip&quot; actually bends outward rather than inward to grasp your waistband, etc.).  The player also has a terrible time identifying expansion memory and the software is unstable.<p>Sonic Blue replaced my player once, but now it has stopped working again, so I have to decided to look for something else.

<Title>Disappointing - Broke Early
<Date>Sun Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I tested this player for about a week, and I ultimately returned the product.<p>I bought the product for its attractive style, obvious athletic uses, and rugged design.  Setting up the product with batteries and listening to the sample songs is very easy.  One of the strong points of this model is its excellent volume and good sound.<p>I returned this product for several reasons.  First, the remote control unit stopped working after approximately two days.  New batteries and hardware tweaking did not fix it.  Next, the batteries seem to be drained even in the off position.  I was surprised how often I had to change out the batteries.  Finally, the software is horrible.  I could never get it working in WinXP - only on an older computer running Win98.  The controls are clunky and difficult to use, while transferring files to the player is anything but intuitive.<p>Unfortunately, the strengths do not overcome the weaknesses in this case.  This might be worth a buy if you only want to transfer your files once and then use the player without the remote control.  Do your research as the remote control problem is a known problem.<p>You are better off finding a better product.

<Title>Get something else
<Date>Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This product isn't all that it advertises to be.  First, I agree with a couple other reviews regarding the software: it is awful.  To upload songs onto the player you first have to enter them in the software's database.  If you have a lot of songs you would like to choose from, this poses two problems; first you must load EVERY song into the database, and second the database is a flat file system, there is no heirarchy between folders so all your songs just get listed in the order they were entered.<p>Additionally, this unit is upgradable to 128 MB with an additional 64 MB chip, but what they don't tell you is that they are having problems with the SanDisk and Lixar brands.  So if you do purchase this item and wish to upgrade to 128 MB, avoid those brands or you will be stuck with an extra chip like me.  Their techinical support says that they are currently working on a fix but have no ETA (surprise).  <p>This unit also eats batteries like crazy.  For such a small unit with few moving parts you would expect batteries to last a while, but they do not.<p>My overall advice would be to avoid this item.

<Title>Fair
<Date>Thu Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Here is my review after one week.  Fortunately I think I found the work arounds.  First, find the firmware upgrade on the Sonic Blue site.  Version 1.1 shipped with it, and I upgraded to the 1.6 firmware patch.  That solves the battery drain and "most" of the remote going blank issues, and also gave me a battery meter on the remote.  Speaking of the remote, you can always unplug it, bypass it so that it doesn't drain the battery.  Next, the headphones are very portable, look cool, sound quality is fair to poor, and the pressure on my ears is somewhat uncomfortable.  The belt clip is a joke.  My 64M MMC card does not work with this unit - but my documentation said 32M max on the expansion card.  The included software is a joke - but fortunately that other joke, Windows Media Player 8, will work - but when copying to devices, press F5 to refresh the device list drop down.  Also, I configured mine to send 64K files to the device, so converting and copying 128K MP3 takes about 5 times longer to set up.  I'm using Windows XP, it works, I hear music when I run.

<Title>Didn't last long
<Date>Mon Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>When I first got this product, it was wonderful.  Clear sound quality, convenient arm band for running and lifting, and easy transfer from Windows Media Player.<p>HOWEVER, I didn't have it but a couple of months before it flatlined.  Just stopped playing one day while I was out running.  Tried to resuscitate it with a new battery (it eats plenty of those), but that didn't work either.  Even XP can no longer find it.  It's dead.<p>My advice--avoid this product and get something more reliable!  I would recommend another product, but I myself am shopping for something new.

<Title>A great player for running with.
<Date>Thu Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've had this player for a few months now and I have yet to experience most of the technical problems the other reviews speak of. Overall, I have been satisfied with the quality and sound, but there are a few drawbacks. I agree with everyone else that the software is terrible. They would be better off including the trial version of Musicmatch or something like it. I also have to replace the battery frequently. However, the player only takes one AA, so how long would you expect it to last? The only other complaint I have is the lack of a random function...whatever order the songs are loaded in is the order you have to listen to them in.<p>The simplicity and ease of use are a great benefit when working out. The armband alone makes this the ideal MP3 player for someone active. I spent two months looking for a MP3 player designed with running, biking, etc. in mind and this one is by far the best. Hopefully, they will work out the kinks and come out with an even better player in the future.<p>Update:  10/25/02 - The display on the remote has stopped functioning, even though I only use it about 25% of the time.  Luckily I purchased the extended warranty because of the problems I had read about.

<Title>Great idea, but not the one to choose.
<Date>Wed Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased this player with full intentions of getting a 'workout' player. Something that didn't have commercials, didn't skip and could withstand a few bumps. The player itself is nice but lacks an FM radio and is a battery killer if used with the remote. I've had the player for about 2 months and it is no longer functional. The software that comes with the player needs to be updated and the Nike site is HORRIBLE for obtaining this. After multiple attempts to register my player and get the software, I have given up. I've attempted to contact the support group but it is via auto response e-mail only. I'm still attempting to get the software, use Media player (recommended by the manufacturer but still doesn't work) or anything to get the songs to record. My hands are in the air in frustration. I'm giving this player a 3 based on the limited usage I had. The headphones are useless but the player was everything I had hoped for. If I could only get the software....

<Title>Best Xmas gift ever!!!
<Date>Sun Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my husband as a Xmas gift 2 years ago. He claims this was the best Xmas gift he had ever recieved. My husband is an avid jogger and loves being able to download songs of his choice and listening to them while exercising. I was surprised to read the negative reviews and learn that so many users found the product to break easily. I can assure you that this MP3 players takes a beating. We are currently stationed in the Middle East where the average temperature is 114 degrees and my crazy husband still joggs in that weather. The device never gave him any problem whatsoever and he takes it with him on his many travels around the world. I highly recommend it and was going to purchase one for my brother-in-law when I started reading the negative reviews and decided to write my own.

<Title>Good, but with several major flaws
<Date>Wed Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've owned this player for about 3 years and the hardest thing I've had to deal with is the changing times and technology.  When I switched to Windows XP, the software that came with the player was no longer compatible.  Luckily, there is a driver for Windows Media Player 9 that recognizes the player and makes the music transfer process even faster and simpler than with the included software.<p>Its 64mb internal memory isn't much by today's standards but it's plenty if you're close to your computer and can change the songs when you get sick of them.  There's a firmware update (a download from the internet that updates the device while it's connected to your computer) that supposedly lets you use larger multimedia cards to expand the memory (I haven't tried yet).  The latest firmware is supposed to support the use of 128mb cards (and the successful use of a 256mb card has also been reported).  The manual, strangely, mentions nothing about how to use multimedia cards with the player, although one diagram clearly points to the expansion slot.(??)  Beware, though of the new secure digital (SD) cards because I've read that they aren't compatible with this player.<p>The remote was cool but when it's attached to the player, it drains the battery *even when the player is turned off*, so I quit using it.  It doesn't scroll the song title anymore since I switched to WMP9.  However, unless you have the remote connecting the headphones to the player, you'll find that the headphone cord is very short.  I just use a different set of headphones.  The headphones included are hard plastic and hurt my ears after just an hour or so of wearing.  So really I don't use any of the contents in the original box except the player itself!<p>The equilizer presets are nice (though you have to have the remote plugged in to know which one you're using) and it has long battery life when only the headphones (not the remote) are attached.  The armband is cool too for sports and walking around--better than the included clip, which tends to slide off.<p>So I can't exactly recommend this player but I've been able to make it work for me and I'll probably get a few more good years out of it.

At first, only songs I had installed on the MMC card wouldn't play.  I put it on my computer and it could still see the songs were there but the player just skipped right over them.  Then the thing would work about once out of every 15 times you pushed &quot;play.&quot;  And when it would play, it might play 10 seconds of the first song and stop.  I finally pulled out the 128MMC card and trashed the unit.  <p>To be fair, this seems to be indicative of many MP3 players, not just the PSAPLAY 120.  <p>FYI - Though this unit has an expandable MMC port, the newer NIKE 128Mbs does not.<p>Here's the good and bad on the PSAPLAY 120<br>First the bad:<br> - The belt clip broke in the first week. <br> - I also dropped it in the first week - not hard and on the gym's carpet - and the case cracked.  <br> - The armband attaches to the player via a tiny little screw. They give you two.  Now I know why.  One of them broke in the first 4 months.<br> - There is no &quot;random play.&quot;<br> - The Nike audio software they give you isn't very useful.  It has about 1/2 the functionality of more popular titles like Media Player.  Unfortunately, using Media Player was alway a hit or miss thing.  Sometimes Media Player could find the PSAPLAY and sometimes it couldn't even though I kept up with all firmware and software upgrades.<br> - The armband is bigger than most, though still too small for serious muscle builders<br> - Songs that load onto the expandable MMC slot load about 1/2 as fast as the internal memory (this is not a problem with my new RCA MP3).<p>The good:<br> - Battery life is excellent if you don't use the remote. <br> - The buttons are raised and easy to find for hands-free operation during running.<br> - Several preset equalizer settings that work well.<br> - Looks good.<p>Wow! When you write down the good and bad, it's a wonder I ever kept the thing as long as I did. For the money, there are better units out there I believe.<p>So there it is.  It was pretty good while it lasted, but now it's gone...

<Content>If anyone has the piece between the main device and the headphone jack that they can send me that would be great.  I could revive the player otherwise it's dead...
