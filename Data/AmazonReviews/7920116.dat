<Title>Like throwing money down the drain...
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This isn't worth the money. Save your pennies for a few more weeks & buy a different MP3 player. This is little more than a toy included in a cereal box.

<Content>This is a very handy and easy to use tool. Just plug it directly to you USB port and download, erase, and reset, whatever you want.   The battery is a AAA that is easy to find and extremely easy to replace.   It has no belt clip but a small cell phone holder from the dollar store works fine.

<Title>MP3 Malfunction
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I order 2 of these Mp3 players for my girls for x-mas and one of them just quit working. Actually I should say it works when it wants to. So I have to rate it with a 3 because the other one works great and they are so easy to use.

<Title>Does what is intended for
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player can do all the functions as advertized. The recorder is not a very good quality. The mechanical design is not very good. Will buy it again only at a good sale price

<Title>Is this a joke
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is not at all a great deal. Yes, you may be inclined to buy this piece of junk because of its relatively low price, but as with many other things, with a decrease in cost comes a decrease in quality!   1. This is not as small as you may think- i am 6 feet tall and this mp3 player is as thick and as wide as my index and middle fingers held together  2. This player doesn't even have a radio tuner so count out listening to it in the car unless you have a tape deck  3. It comes with an annoying silver metal thing at the opposite end of the usb port, but without anything to attach the dangly thing on to... i bought this player for jogging and supposedly this souldve come with a string at least to hang out your neck  4. also the headphones are not great

<Content>I opened this, downloaded a few files, listened for 45 minutes and then nothing.  What a waste.  Not worth it at any price.

<Title>Excellent price!
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these, needing a cheap, easy to use mp3 player.  Mainly for falling asleep with, jogging with, and just enjoying music in general when not at the computer.  The price is unbeatable.  It does the same as an ipod will; more actually, since this has a screen.  I have had mine for about 2 years, and today, while it was in my pocket, the LCD screen shattered.  It sucks, because I can no longer see what is playing, but I can still use it.  Now I think of it as a downgrade from a nano to a shuffle.
