<Title>Terrific item!

<Content>This is a terrific piece of technology. It improves on its MuVo precedessor (I bought a 128 MB player 16 months ago) with a longer battery life, larger memory, and LCD window, while retaining the immense advantage of a digital music player *without* moving parts.  To my mind the iPod is overrated -- too expensive and too fragile. Plus the MuVo plugs directly into your USB port.

<Title>Great Device, Bad Ear Buds
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  I researched this model, and found that others thought it was good.  I agree.  The sound quality is excellent for such a small device -- better than CD and tape players I've had in the past.   The software makes it very easy to download songs to the device, as well as rip from CDs I own.  Takes some getting used to in regards to playing different folders (have separate soft and workout music folders), but quick to navigate once you get the hang of it.    Would definately recommend it for someone who doesn't need all of his music stored on one device and who wants to play for 1-4 hrs at a time (anything more than this, would recommend a hard drive device.)

<Content>I just bought this player about a week ago. My computer at home is only operating on Windows 98 but it still works. I wasn't able to use the software that was included but instead used windows media player to change my cds into .wma files. To organize the music I just created folders by double clicking on the removable drive (mp3 player). The music sounds wonderful and holds tons more than if I had converted into .mp3 files. I had to check out a lot of players due to my older computer set up. This was the only one that I saw that could work on my system. If you're a little slow in the updating department I would highly recommend this player.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently puchased the 512MB Muvo TX FM so I could listen to music while running. This model comes with an armband (some don't) and is great for the job. It took about 2 seconds to figure out. I simply plugged it into a USB port, copied some MP3s onto it and I was off.  Like anothe rreviewer mentioned, the earbuds aren't great, just OK.

<Title>More than the iPod Shuffle (but not so Mac-friendly)
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You can read about this great little device's many features in other reviews, so I'll mostly direct this to Mac users.    Apple claims that iTunes supports this mp3 player, but it really doesn't.  You can load mp3's onto it using iTunes on a Mac if you download MuVo Helper, a little freeware application you can find online (search on "muvo helper").  Even with MuVo Helper, however, iTunes can't transfer its playlists to the MuVo; nor can it transfer Audible spoken word files.  Of course, the MuVo won't play Apple iTunes AAC files either--just mp3's.  With a Windows computer (98SE and above), you can upload mp3's and wma's (drag and drop using Windows Explorer, and create playlists by grouping files into folders) and also Audible files (with Audible's Manager program and Creative's new MuVo firmware, which you'll need to download from creativelabs.com).  You might also check out Red Chair Software's Notmad application (redchairsoftware.com), which helps you order songs into playlists.  Otherwise the MuVo can play songs in a few different ways: the order in which you uploaded them, or alphabetical order, or shuffle play.  So... if you have a Mac and no access to a Windows machine, you won't be able to take full advantage of this device.  However, it still makes a worthy alternative to the iPod Shuffle if you don't buy from iTunes: similar price, similar size, removable battery, a pretty good radio with autoscan and presets, and pretty good radio/voice recording as well.  If Creative were to offer a real iTunes plug-in, this would be a little treasure.

<Content>This is a great product in terms of price and ease, and better than the IPOD Shuffle, I might add. The price is very affordable. It is very easy to use, just plug and play, the person doES not even need a software.... it acts as an external drive.  Moreover, it tops the IPOD shuffle because it has an FM, fm recorder and voice recorder. I read somewhere that this product does not have a shuffle feature. Well, I beg to differ, just go to the play mode and select shuffle once, then it would shuffle all the music folders saved.  With all the assertions above, it is viable to say that this is a great product.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>I love this thing....

<Content>I just got my MuVo TX FM in the mail this afternoon, and it is a delight to use. I was copying MP3's onto the device, and playing them, within 5 minutes of unpacking. I'll also point out that I only have USB 1.0 ports on the system I am using right now, and the transfer speed was still very managable. (About 8 minutes to copy the entire 512 megs, around 1 minute for a single album). As several people say, the earbuds are so so. The belt clip is really nice, and the armband is cool. (Although, as a bigger guy, it might be a little snug if you wanted to wear it on the upper arm.) The display is great with a nice blue backlight, and the interface is very intuitive. The FM reception is great. (It's much easier to let it autoscan and assign all the stations to presets. If you try scanning around on your own without doing this...good luck) The voice recorder works fine, and I have already tried running the output to my car stereo. All you need is a little two ended cable if you have a line-in on your car CD player, and it sounds great. I'm no audiophile, but at least at a casual listen, the sound quality was the same to me as a CD in the player.   The software is OK. You can import an external playlist, and it will transfer a playlist to the player, which is cool. It does seem to take a while to import tracks, and it would be nice if the autoplaylist had a little more control.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the device. I have a couple friends who already owned them, and they are also very happy. Bottom line, why pay the same money for an IPOD shuffle with no display!?!?

<Title>Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I considered many different mp3 players before purchasing this one.  Several things made the Myvo tx fm 512 standout from other similar products.  First was the durability, I am not the most careful person, I have accidently dropped it on a few occasions, including once from the car onto blacktop, but if you look at it you cannot tell that it has ever been dropped.  Next was the storage capacity.  512MB is plenty of storage space.  I have yet to run out of space, I am now up to 38 different bands with about 3 songs apiece.  The price was very good.  Even though the iPod shuffle may be a few dollars left it is a little less reliable and lacks a screen to tell you what song you are on.  Another good feature is the navigation, using windows I made a folder for every band,  it is very easy to move from folder to folder using the small joystick.  I had two slight complaints with this little gizmo.  The first is that the included headphones are very small and uncomfortable.  I replaced the included ones with a pair of my own and and now happy.  The other complaint I have is the included software.  It probably works fine, but I don't have much patience and after a few minutes when I couldn't figure it out I decided to drag and drop and it worked perfectly.
