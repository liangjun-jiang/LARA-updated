<Title>Jusr Right for the Gym
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This my fourth Ipod, and second shuffle.  I bought this specifically for when I am at the gym or working in the yard.  THe clip is substantial, and will endure mistreatment.   And the price was reasonable.  I find the sound quality just fine (though I use third party headphones), and it saves some wear and tear on my 20 gig and 30 gig Ipods.   No install disk either-- if you have Itunes already, just plug and play. [...]

<Title>Perfectly small and useful, Clip is fantastic
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got my shuffle this week and it is even smaller than I imagined it would be. Some of the reviews just go to show that some people will complain about anything, this item is awesome if you use this for what it's meant for, that is taking a random batch of 240 of songs from your music library and taking it for a run or bringing it anywhere for some music on the go, there is no problem with it whatsoever. Personally I think adding a screen would have ruined it, it's perfect the way it is. Sound quality is great, the battery life is good and the usb dock is pretty cool. For 79 bucks go get one, you won't regret it.

<Title>Comes w/janky old earbuds, otherwise LOVE
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Shuffle straight from the manufacturer today (took 3 days to arrive to DC from China, according to FedEx tracking).  I had to update my iTunes to 7.0.2, but other than that, the device was ready to sync right out of the box.  The packaging is exactly the same as the Nano, very efficiently packed, and no install CD.    I'd love to give it 5 stars like I gave the Nano, but my one complaint is big enough to deduct a star: The Shuffle does NOT come with the new, updated earbuds that come with the Nano, but instead ships with the old, round ones with the foam covers.  I mean, really Steve Jobs, how bougie is that?  Hopefully, this will change with later orders.  Personally, I much prefer the updated earbuds and never got a good fit with the old earbuds. I remain mystified by the functionality of those foam covers.  Also, I feel it's a bit dodgy for Apple to sell the new ones for $29 separately and include them as a pack-in for every other new iPod model except the Shuffle.  Granted, the Shuffle is the cheapest, but previously, all the iPod models came with the same janky earbuds standard, so to unload the leftovers on the Shuffles now hardly seems fair.  All that said, the Shuffle itself is fantastic.  Sound quality is great.  The USB-integrated docking system is genius, no more USB nubbin coming out of the player, though you CAN still drag and drop files onto the iPod on your desktop -- just like a thumb drive or regular iPod.    Finally, the design is super!  It looks a lot like the radio remote, a little wider and thicker, the major difference being that the Shuffle is cased in alumninum vs plastic.  Its clip is also made of aluminum and non-removable.  The Shuffle has a little light on the top that flashes either green, yellow or red and in various patterns, depending on whatever Morse code thing it's trying to tell you.  Like everything Mac, it's very intuitive, and you'll figure it out quick.  I was never into the old Shuffle, but I really like the look and feel of this one.  It's tiny enough to take anywhere, but solid enough to throw in your purse (or for guys, pocket/European carry-all) without being afraid it will break.  The clip is a big design improvement as well.  As much as I love Mac, iPod necklaces don't really go with everything.

<Title>Definitely Portable!
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved my 2nd generation iPod Shuffle from Apple's website about a couple days ago. I love the weight of the iPod because you don't even feel like you're wearing it. The size is also nice because it's not bulky at all. The clip is great because then you don't need to buy any special armbands or lanyards in order to keep it attached to you while you're out and about. Also, when adding songs to the iPod, you can have iTunes convert the songs to AAC format @ 128kbps automatically to make the file smaller and still have the great quality sound. This is an awesome product and is my favorite iPod aside from the video of course. The only draw back is the possiblity of losing or misplacing it. For under $80 this is a very nice MP3 player and would make a great x-mas present.

<Title>Form, meet function
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At a time when most portable electronic devices seem to be engaging in feature wars, it's truly refreshing to see Apple go back to the basics.  With this redesigned Shuffle, they've remembered what's important: it's portable, and it plays music.  The design of the new iPod Shuffle is elegant in its simplicity. The player itself is tiny and sleek, with a simple 5-button arrangement to start and stop playback, skip backwards and forwards, and adjust volume.  The buttons are so intuitive that they can be manipulated without even having to look at them, a feat most portable music players can't seem to manage. Toggle switches for power on and off, and selecting sequential playback or "shuffle" mode (random playback order) complete this tiny package.  A small docking station is included as well, which allows you to hook up the Shuffle to a computer via a USB connection, to transfer music files and to recharge the player itself.  As to function, the new iPod Shuffle plays music, and lots of it. With about 1 GB of storage capacity, you can usually get around 200 songs on it easily.  There is no visual display to show song information, no capacity for video playback, and no options to plug in the various toys and accessories that other iPods can do.  But here's the thing: none of that is needed.  The new iPod Shuffle is a portable music player, and it accomplishes that goal handily.  The earbud headphones that come with it aren't the greatest, but you can use whatever headphones you want instead. Playback of classical, rock, or electronic music all sound good, and that's all I really care about in a portable music player.  The new iPod Shuffle looks great and sounds great.  It merges simple, elegant design with a good dose of technical wizardry to create the perfect blend of form and function.  If you're looking for a portable music player that just plays music and gives you a compact package, this may well be your best bet.

<Title>I can't believe i bought an ipod...
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I picked mine up at the apple store yesterday, and i am amazed by its simplicity and portability.  This is the first time EVER i have bought an ipod, and i am quite pleased with it.  I still miss the flexibility of other non ipod players, but i was amazed at how simple itunes was to use, and it was not as restrictive as i thought.  the sound quality from this thing was great, but still ins't par with the bigger non-mp3 players, but it was better than my small creative flash player   The clip was a great feature to have, this thing can go anywhere with me, and is sure easier than carring my old 20 gig mp3 brick around.

<Title>Warning: Old style headphones
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got my shuffle from apple store. It's sleek design is really cool and the sound is great. I love the ability of the clip on for exercise. The only draw back is that apple stiffs you when it comes to the headphones. Steve Jobs in his last keynote address toots about the new sleeker headphones. Apparently you have to buy the nano or regular ipod to get them. Its my first time having apple being cheap with headphones that can't cost them more than a few bucks to make. I'm sure I won't be the only shuffle buyer to register this complaint. Other than that it's a cool product.

<Title>like it, not impressed with longevity
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had a 1st generation iPod shuffle and loved it, but it stopped working after 1 year -- wouldn't charge.  Sending it back to Apple to get fixed wasn't worth the inconvenience or the price tag -- especially not with the 2nd gen shuffle coming out.  Instead, got a new 2nd gen shuffle.  Have had it for a year, and same thing has now happened -- won't charge, and problem is not the cable/charger.  Once again, the inconvenience and price of getting it fixed makes it easier to just buy a new one.  I love the shuffle for what it is -- easy to take on runs, love the clip, ease of use, etc.  But am I really going to have to fork out $75 every year for a new one because of quality issues?  Maybe I've just been unlucky, but in my experience, this doesn't live up to Apple's advertised standards.

<Content>I love that the shuffle is SO small.  You can clip it on and not even feel that it is there, much different than my other MP3 player.  As a runner, it's great that it doesn't seem to bounce around-- you can't even feel it's there.  Also the lack of a screen is great for exercise, because I never get to look at the screen anyway, and it makes more room for larger controls.  It's very easy to feel for the control you want without having to look at it, which can be very important when running.

I love that it clips to my shirt, instead of some bulky armband, and I can just push the button to scroll through the songs without looking. Very simple, perfect for when I'm on the go or at the gym.

<Title>I just purchased a second one for music . . .
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my first shuffle for talk mp3s. It plays my very low(22kbps) bitrate MP3s without problem. At that bitrate the 1GB shuffle can hold over 50 hours of programming. Since I don't want to loose my place in a study I bought a second shuffle (an orange one) just for music.   The clip is absolutely perfect. You forget you have it on. I usually clip it to my collar and it always stays put. Since it's so small I always leave my headphones connected so I don't loose it. It's much smaller even than a book of matches. I use Sony Fontopia EX71s since they sound great and can be used either short or long.   I made the mistake of purchasing the new Sansa Express as a second player to save a little money, plus it has some additional features. After having the shuffle It spoiled me. Wearing the much larger Express around my neck was a great disadvantage. I can't imagine a better design than the shuffle for an active person.

<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved the Shuffle as a gift,my first MP3 player.  The first thing you notice is how small and light weight it is (2 quarters and a nickle).  Sound is great, very clear.  The clip is a nice feature.  It stays in place on a cotten shirt while shaken pretty hard. The headphones work better with out the little pads they come with. The docking station comes with the ipod and is also very small.  Packaged in a clear plastic box makes an excellent display for gift purposes.

<Title>Gift away your old shuffle and go for this cool little thing!
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My new shuffle gives me the ultimate coolness factor! The functionality is awesome too.  The shuffle arrived in it's beautiful transparent hard plastic box. It is really small, 1.5 inches long and 1 inch wide and the depth without the clip is hardly a few mm. The packaging is great too, even better than the last green cardboard box, and if you buy it from apple you can engrave it with your special message and also include a gift note which arrives in a tiny white envelope with a silver apple logo. My shuffle has my name and cell phone number engraved at the back from Apple in case it goes missing...though I don't think the finder would ever want to return it.   The "goodness" of a shuffle: I had always liked the Gen 1 shuffle too as it was small, and could slip into my tight jeans easily. Every time I wanted to change a song while at the airport in a queue, shopping for groceries or jogging I could just press the raised ring as I knew where each symbol was. I never needed to look at it or to take my attention away from what I was doing. It was light too, so much so that the weight of the headphones would sometimes nudge it out of my pocket and it would clatter to the floor. When I wanted to change the songs I just slipped it into my laptop. I had planned to buy a bigger iPod or even the Zune or Zenvision for my car so I could load my complete song collection (and get rid of XM) or for long plane trips where I might look at the screen. But for the everyday activities - jogs, work in the kitchen/garage/garden, or shopping trips I was happy with the low maintenance easy-breezy shuffle. So, the early pictures of the new shuffle blew me away ...I realized it was time to give away my old one...to my dad in this case, who loves listening to his books on shuffle, and doesn't want a screen.    The 2G shuffle: The new shuffle sounds just as good as the last one and the headphones tangle up less with a rubber slider. Did I tell you that the white and gray headphones co-ordinate perfectly with the gray and white look of the new shuffle? I love these little touches from Apple...(Can't believe Microsoft thinks the dull brown color of Zune is cool...) The port to connect the headphones is the same one you connect the docking station to load songs or charge it. The docking station is small too, white on top and barely 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide with gray rubber base with an apple logo that prevents it from sliding around. You'll need to download the 35MB iTunes software to your computer (in case you don't have it already) and then load up your songs on the shuffle and you're ready to go. When it updates software the light indicator is red, orange when it uploads songs and green when you eject it and it's ready to play. The genius is that there is no need for a separate battery indicator as the same light glows orange for low charge or red if your battery is very low. In fact the same light will tell you with a blink sequence if there are no songs loaded. Press the forward button once and it will go back to the beginning of the same song, press it twice it goes to the next song. Similar function for the reverse button. If you press the play/pause button 3 times it goes to the beginning of the playlist...If you have your songs organized you can load the list you want according to your mood and these controls are enough to take you where you may want to go.  I was able to load 180 songs on to my shuffle, which is more than enough for a whole week for me. You have to use iTunes but all my songs are from CDs or downloads from other sites and I did not have a problem getting them on to the shuffle with the iTunes software.   The only downside I see is that I'll have to carry the docking station to charge it or upload songs if I travel, and while the docking station is really small, it makes the shuffle less self-contained. However, given the look of the new shuffle I don't mind  too much. Especially now that I have a clip on the new shuffle, a feature I did not anticipate would make carrying the shuffle so much easier.  In fact, now I am in love with the convenience of the shuffle's clip that makes it easy to access and does not keep falling out with the weight of the headphones. The possibilities of where to clip it are endless. I've had it clipped to my T shirt neck, my office shirt front, on my leather coat lapel, or the jeans top pocket, or even my purse strap. Doesn't fall out and it's easier to reach the buttons.   By the way, all the people with negative reviews for 2G don't seem to be users. If I just want to make toast I don't want to buy an oven, even if it's available for the same price. If I wanted a screen on the shuffle I would get a Nano or something else. But the shuffle gives me what I want -not only does it play great music, it's cute enough to sit on my blouse. And does get some ooohs and aaaahs!   Now how about blue, red and pink metal shuffles...I need to color coordinate them with all my outfits! ;-) Update Feb 28, 2007: So Apple listened to me (!) and they do have these in nice colors now...love that orange..

<Title>Maaannnnnnnn...
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow, is Apple really that desperate? The original Shuffle was bad enough, but now they go and make another one! Now I don't have this, but it's pathetic just by looking at it. $79.99 for this thing. Who in their right mind (if you have one) would buy this remake of an already pathetic excuse for a portable music player for $80 when the Samsung YP-K3JQB is a measly $100 currently on Amazon?! The ONLY people who would get this shuffle instead of the amazing E250 are those can't stand the fact that Apple has finally made something completely unacceptable (well, the Nano was pretty darn close), those who keep saying that "they don't need a screen", and those who are so braindead that they get anything that has the "Apple" logo on it.  Yeah, I know, I'm stupid. I don't know what I'm talking about. In a way, I like this more than the other Shuffle. It's cool the way you can just clip it anywhere and go. But something as bad as the original shuffle should NOT be remade. It should be totally discarded, and make a completely new iPod. , and you obviously can't make a new shuffle WITH a screen. The price is ridiculous, it STILL doesn't have FM or recording or even a screen (the lack of a screen is the "key feature" of the Shuffle, but it's really the key blunder). It's obvious why they don't add the radio or voice recorder: they want to be totally separate from the other music players. It's obvious. Well, I hope you enjoy my review.  0 of 3,000,000 found the following review helpful  sigh...  As a closing note, I'd like to show you my beautiful poem. It's very appropriately called "iPods are Rip-offs"    IPods are Rip-offs by Michael Marcopolus    The iPod's not the only music player you can get,  It's just that there are MP3 players people have not met.  If they just knew what the other players had in store for them,  They'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig's pen.   The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites,  But why not get a better player with more gigabytes?  SanDisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices,  Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices.   The SanDisk Sansa E200 has many, many things,  An FM radio, recording, and movies make it the king of kings.  Does the iPod Nano have this stuff? No, it does not!  The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot.   The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal,  It has so much more for so much less that it's basically unreal.  Radio, recording, and replaceable battery make it a better player,  For less than the Nano...are you kidding? It's definitely a Nano slayer.   There's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space,  It's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place.  FM tuner, voice recorder, and screen make it a great buy,  The fact that the Shuffle doesn't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry.   The Creative Zen Vision: M is better than the Ipod Video,  Better screen, more features, and better value make it glow.  The fact that the Vision: M is thicker doesn't really matter,  The features are what make the Vision: M unimportantly fatter.   So you see, my friends, the iPod is a waste of precious time,  The fact that Apple cheats you out is basically a crime.  They make their iPods fragile just to make them really "cool",  Anyone who buys one is just a ridiculous crazy fool.    Facts  1. Ipods are MP3 players. It seems like people want to separate iPods from other MP3 players. Can iPods play MP3's? If so, it's an MP3 player.  2. The Creative Zen Vision: M is pretty much the same thing as the iPod with video, but the Zen has much, much more. It has an FM tuner (FM recording), voice recorder, better screen (262,144 colors as opposed to 65,000-very big difference),

<Title>Approaching Perfection
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I replaced an old iPod Shuffle with this little gem. Here's what I found:  Size: Phenomenal. It's about the size (width, length and depth) of a Halloween mini-Hershey bar (no kidding).   Performance: Longer battery life, better response time than old Shuffle.  Sound: Still great.   Easy of use: Unmatched. Attach it, iTunes loads it, off you go.   Disappointments: Earbuds that ship with it are poor; ships with virtually no info or instructions; requires latest iTunes update; uses docking station.    Notes: I normally hate Apple products, but liked my old iPod Shuffle. This unit is smaller, lighter, generally easier to use and a much better value than the old Shuffle, and dramatically better for me than other MP3 players on the market. I need good sound for my good music without a bunch of hassles. Nothing else gives me that package like this unit.  I was stunned when I opened my Amazon box and got this tiny little thing out. The pix don't do it justice; I think they have a twelve-year old holding the thing. It's almost comically little. It is significantly smaller than a "tiny" post-it note and slightly larger than a postage stamp. It is about the same thickness as a ball-point pen.   I get much better performance than my old shuffle. The battery lasts longer (which could just be battery fatigue on my old one) and the load-up time is much shorter. There is no screen, but to answer Mr. Rudeness the Poet, no, I don't care about a screen. I know my music. A screen is just more useless weight. I'm not going to be reading the screen when I'm working (or working out) anyway. The sound is good, the clip is secure and nothing could be easier to use. Update your iTunes (required), plug the thing into your computer and you're done!  I do NOT like the docking station concept. I liked the fact that I could plug my old Shuffle into any USB port and recharge it. However, that feature had to go to make the new one so small, light and high-capacity, so I'll live with it. I did not like the earbuds that ship with this unit. Also, if you like detailed instructions (or anything more than wordless cartoons), you're out of luck. Overall, though, I have not found a single product that comes close to matching this.

<Content>Get your 2nd gen iPod shuffle and a set of Shure E2c sound isolating earphones and say goodbye to noise, interruption and tension.  My Shuffle arrived last week and my Shure's were ready and waiting for the week's flight to Denver and back.  Sure I couldn't hear the stewardess but how much is there to saying 'water please?'         This teeny-tiny iPod is scary small!  Just how is it possible - battery, memory, computer, and plug all in a size smaller than a watch face.  It packs and travels easily.  [The dock is unfortunately the biggest piece in the package - look for somebody to make a USB to audio-jack cable soon (without the base).]  The sound is wonderful.    I"ve not tried wearing this combo through the TSA security check yet but I"m building up the guts to say "Are you just making small talk or is it something important?"

<Content>The design of the 2nd Gen shuffle is mindblowing.  First of all it is small, unbelievably small.  Once you get over that, you will notice how incredibly beautiful it is. The design and the production is top notch.  The attention to detail is something you would not expect in a $79 product, nothing cheap looking about this.  Oh yes, and it plays music, seamlessly.  The itunes integration is genius.  I own many ipods 3G, 5G, couple of nanos and as much as I love my new 8G nano, I love the shuffle even more.  It's almost weightless so its perfect for the gym.  I could go on and on but to hold one is to want one.  I guarantee you will not find a better way to spend $79.  I am buying one for everyone I love.

<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Nano 2 months ago after owning an IRiver for 4 years.  I loved the Nano until my wife "borrowed" it so I decided to order the shuffle.  I ordered it on September 30 and got it this past week.  A long time to wait but I thought it was only $80 so I could wait.  I charged it on Tuesday night and added a bunch of songs to it.  I have used it quite a bit since Tuesday and still haven't re-charged it.  I really do like it as it is small and clips to my clothes.  Wed, Thur and Fri I ran with the unit and it has been great.  Today I spent the day getting rid of leaves in the backyard for about 2 hours and it clipped to my jeans and never fell off.  I have to say though I really liked having a screen.  I will keep this one for use when working out or mowing or whenever I don't need to change songs.  I will be buying either another Nano or possibly a 30gig IPOD.

<Title>Unbelievable
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This shuffle replaced one I had for several years. Unbelievable sound, unbelievable size.  I don't like having to carry the dock with me when I travel. The old shuffle was nice because if you had it, you could plug it in. Now you have to remember to pack the dock, also. Still, bang for the buck, it can't be beat!

<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>its my first portable audio device since cassetes, so i had a lot to catch up on. some of the things i was looking for answers for might be automatic or second nature to those familiar with mp3 or ipod devices. seems to me it doesnt work independantly from i-tunes, & i was hesitant to download that, just to use the music i already had on my computer. once i got past that & figured out how the library is seperate from the music on the device, it itself works fine. now i'm happy & very satisfied with it. yet bottom line some more detailed instructions would have got me up & running about 3 days sooner, online help was hard to decipher also.

<Title>THE UNTENDED UNDERLING IN THE iPOD FAMILY
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to buy a no-nonsense mp3 player to keep me company while running. No video, no funky display menus, no labyrinthine software to work with. If I wanted to spend half a day getting my music in order I'd shell for the 80 gig iPod.   So I got myself a Shuffle, by far the sleekest small pod in the market.   But boy did I regret it.   After the one-time registration and initialization (which is not optional) the lemon wouldn't get the songs on it, thanks to the infamous "Disk not found error". Googled for it and discovered websites that are brimming with untended complaints; I'm on Windows XP, but the glitch seems to pervade operating systems.   Spent a day battling with the idiosyncrasies. Downloaded and installed an extra utility that Apple's Help site recommends. Enabled the Shuffle "for disk use". Reset it to factory settings and tried all over again, five times. And I'm a fairly persistent tech-savvy one. I did everything that's needed and more, but the stupid thing will still not remember the settings, will not let me change songs, and so on.    Tired with all of this rigmarole, I got a Creative Zen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S5TYQI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">Stone Plus</a>. It's a little larger than the Shuffle, but you can see why--Shuffle doesn't have a display and it uses the same jack for charging and earphones so you can only do one of those at a time. Stone Plus on the other hand connects through a small non-spaghetti USB cable, comes up instantly as a new drive on your PC, you copy the mp3 files from your music folder to this drive, and you're done.   I was up and running in 5 minutes flat. Can't help kicking myself for having fallen for the iPod luster.   Without becoming any clunkier in any meaningful way (both the doohickeys are pretty small), Stone Plus shows me the song that's playing, which I don't see on Shuffle. Stone Plus has an FM radio, a voice recorder, a timer, and a digital clock--none of which the Shuffle has. It charges in 5 minutes, which the Shuffle doesn't. I can use iTunes or any other tool or even nothing at all, but with Shuffle I am in an unhappy marriage with iTunes. The Stone Plus will hold about 1000 songs in comparison to Shuffle's 200 at the same bit-rate.   Because this is Creative, the company known among geeks for its speakers, the ear phones that come with the Stone Plus have a fabulous combination of bass and treble that will please the most fastidious connoisseur. After hearing them Shuffle's white thingies sound tinny and childish. I got my Stone Plus with a clip that makes it much more practical for running.   And all of it at 60% of the cost of a basic bare-bones Shuffle.   Sorry, Apple folks, in the small-mp3-player market Apple is simply the beautiful blond bimbo who trips on high heels at ten paces. If you're in the market for a nifty little mp3 player, skip the Shuffle. Even in the 3rd generation it's a 3rd rate contender.

<Title>WOW...nice and neat
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you just need an mp3 player (or more specifically an iPod) that just plays your songlist then this is it. there is no screen to select the song you want, so you either play the list of songs stored on it straight or shuffle them (hence the name). When you are finished with that list, create a new list on your computer and upload it. This is something you need as your secondary iPod or give as a gift to someone who does alot of work or jogs alot and needs the distraction but won't have the need to search for a specific song. The ear pieces are comfortable and audio quality is WOW.

<Title>Dead On Arrival (Buyer Beware)
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Shuffle on November 2. 2G is misleading so let's clarify that it is only 1 gigabyte. I gave it to Fedex for return on November 3 as it was classified as "dead on arrival". Yes I paid the +$55 for the year warranty which ensured me wonderful and prompt service just in case such an event took place but I have since realized that this was of no benefit.  To sum up everything in a nutshell...   a. I wanted my money back but they cannot do it because it was personalized. Even though I was told by level 2 support that they will throw away the one being returned.  b. The technical support has to be embarrassing for Apple as 1st level is worthless. They could not even figure out had to transfer me to sales and one even kept saying his computer was having problems. I bet he was not on a PC...haha. What a joke.  c. Here it is the 14th of November and I have no Apple. I am a fool for buying from the Apple Store but was assured I would have mine before anyone else had it. Guess what I saw at a local store yesterday and it was actually $78.88 which is cheaper than Apple ($79). I wonder if they  would just exchange the shuffle if it was dead on arrival?  d. Apple has had my money since early October but I still am without a Shuffle.   e. The employees of Apple are either totally untrained or trained to lie as much of what they have said has been truthful.  This is my last experience with Apple as the only thing of quality they offer is their marketing approach. I cannot understand why so many fools out there continue to buy into all of their talk about Mac's superiority to PC. Like their employees...this is a not the truth.....

<Title>Looks Great - Sounds Bad
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered my i-POD shuffle and got it in a few days without any hassle.  It's a nice little item - easy to use and it looks good.  However...  The sound quality is not what you'd expect - even in a lower-priced player like this.  There is very (very) little bass.  I went out and bought a reasonably nice ($60) set of headphones thinking that would help.  Sadly, that actually exacerbated the problem - it seems the "muddiness" of the i-POD's standard headphones helps to compensate for the lack of bass from the unit itself.  The device works (though it does take a loooooong time to recharge), it has a very cool form factor...but I wish I'd purchased something else. - I'll call this an $80 learning experience and use the thing until I lose/forget it somewhere. - If you haven't made the purchase, then I strongly recommend looking at other products.

<Title>It's too small to handle
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is TOO small for my big hands. The edges of the control wheel that controls all the activities are about an eighth of an inch away from the edge of the shuffle - making it as difficult to handle as a needle and thread. I do admire the compactness but this gets no stars for ergonomics. The fingers you use to hold it (thumb and forefinger) are also the only ones that can control it - which means you have to use two hands (two fingers to hold it and two fingers to press the wheel. I preferred the previous shuffle because it was longer in the body and you could hold and manipulate it at the same time with one hand.

<Title>I Love the Shuffle Feature!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The design is pure genius; it's much smaller than a book of matches; it's so light that I can clip it onto the neck of my t-shirt and not even feel it when I'm running (this baby's not coming loose!); it comes with a complete illustrated online manual as well as a movie tutorial and a troubleshooting guide; it only takes a few minutes to "import" a CD from my collection; I imported 5 jazz CDs, each one more than an hour long, and it only used up 28 percent of its capacity; I personally like earbuds because I need to be conscious of ambient sounds while running; these look to be the same earbuds that come with the more expensive iPod Nano; the sound is on a par with any portable device I've ever owned; there are ways to tweek the sound which I haven't explored yet; I love the shuffle feature, I can either listen to songs in order, play them randomly, or create my own playlists; I can easily add, delete, or select songs from a CD; I can charge it while I'm online or buy an AC adaptor which plugs directly into a wall socket. In short, this is one of the most AWESOME little music players I've ever bought. Do not hesitate.

It is so light weight that I can't even tell that I have it clipped to my pocket.  Sound is excellent, and it comes with cool accessories.  You have to try it to believe it.  This is my second iPod.  The first one has the bulk of my music collection on it; this one is only for running.  Love it!  It definitely lives up to AAPL's reputation.

<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I already owned an iPod video prior to this one, but it was kinda hard to take it to the gym with me because of its size.  I tried the armband, the clip, it's just too big for the gym.  so I picked one of these 2nd gen shuffles today and boy am I ever happy.  It takes up no room, clips easily, does not skip when I'm running, and sounds excellent.  Some have complained about it not having an equalizer, well you don't need it.  It sounds good just the way it is.  It has plenty of bass--when I play it in my car (aux) it bumps even just as good as my CDs.  I played it through my car stereo via the aux (using monster cable--basically the same set up I use for my video iPod) and it sounds freaking amazing.  I highly recommend this item.  I love it.

<Title>Good even as your only MP3 Player! 
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I absolutely love my little shuffle. It is the only MP3 player I've ever owned, and I found it easy to use and the buttons are very intuitive. It is perfect to tuck into a pocket or purse and the clip keeps it nice and secure; I've never had trouble with it slipping.  It does take a while to load up songs, so if you're sticking them in one at a time the lag can be annoying. It's better to select a bunch and move them to the ipod, and then do something else while it loads. It charges quickly, though. I'm not sure how this compares to other MP3 players, and how much of it depends on computer speed.   My only (small) regret is now they are coming out in more colors, and I want them all!

<Content>I love my ipod.  It clips easily on my clothes whether a sleeve, collar or a jacket.  It is lightweight and easily warms to my skin.  I can easily flip from one song or podcast to another without looking and if I drop it, it doesn't break.  How did people ever live without one?  I'm a bit old to just walk around listening to loud music all the time but I am young and old enough to listen to podcasts and iuniversity.  I have learned about so much using my ipod and have become involved in the world around me (and in my ears) more because I learn about environmental issues, history and human rights.  Things I haven't paid attention to much in years!  Yes, other people sometime shout at me and it takes me some time to orient myself to my literal surroungdings but the ipod has become my constant and most facinating friend.  The metallic pink is a matter of pride too.  It looks great!

<Content>What a wonderful treat the Shuffle is.  When I was given an Amazon.com gift card, I was not sure what to purchase.  However, I love music and I wanted something that I could have with me when I walk.  I went through lots of my favorite music that had a good beat and I put my "walking music" on the Shuffle.  I clip it to my shirt or jacket and off I go.  Many friends have commented on the size, color and the clip feature.  I love it!  I don't have to carry it in my hand and it is so light that you almost forget that you have it on.    Of there was one negative, it would be the earbuds which are hard and would not stay in my ears.  I purchased softer earbuds locally and that made a big difference.  Apple needs to address that as I have heard others say the same thing.  But all in all, this was an excellent purchase.

<Title>Wow, this thing is fantastic
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great:  - Sound quality with Audiobooks and middle of the range headphones.  - Size: It is smaller than my headphones and fits in the case with them.  - Weight: a nano around your neck, on your arm is a noticeable distraction at the gym, this thing is not.  - Weight: Did I say weight. You can't even tell you are wearing it.  - Weight: At most, you feel the headphone cord, but not the shuffle.  - Max volume control in iTunes, no inadvertent blowing your ear drums.  - Battery: 12 hours at moderate volume!  - Clip: Built in clip, clips to almost anything, no accesories needed!    Good  - iTunes interface, I prefer drag and drop  - Battery charging time. Took 5 hours first time, not 4.  - Size, it may be just a tad too small, and the clip may be too big.  - Bass, with songs, not great, but passable.   - Not a high performance device for audiofiles, however no MP3 player is.  Frustrating  - Autofill in iTunes, is slow and has too few options.  - Shuffle, I always use playlists in a fixed order, especialy for gym.  - Click buttons: anyway to put the regular click wheel on it?  - No screen: I wish they could put a one line LCD to show song progress.

<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was the proud owner of an old 4th generation monochrome iPod.  That suit me well, but I absolutely hated walking around campus with it, and I worried too much to exersize with it.    This little guy, however, solves all those problems and more.  I am able to load my newest CDs onto it and the songs that I like, and carry this around everywhere.  The design is small and light, so I can clip it on one of my pockets and go.  Being small, made of metal, and lacking a sensitive harddrive, I worry little about dropping it.  (Except if I were to lose it.)  The only thing that I don't like is that you are coerced into using the iTunes interface and have few options other than iTunes and CDs to get music legally.  Now the most annoying part of the iPod is the headphone cord.  Look at me, I am trendy!

<Title>Great for audiobooks
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a 20g "brick" ipod that I use 99% for audiobooks. I rip the books from CDs that I borrow from the library.  For some reason I decided it was no longer convenient to haul the brick with me on my daily walks so this new shuffle caught my eye.   With no screen, I was worried I'd forever lose my place and have to click blindly forward and backward to find my spot. I knew my 14-year old would be happy to take it off my hands so I took a chance and bought the tiny new shuffle.   I am happy to report: NO WORRIES. This shuffle is fantastic for audiobooks, even those in mp3 format. I set it on "repeat" instead of shuffle, and each time I turn it on, it picks up exactly where it left off. It goes walking with me, to the gym, and probably even on vacation. It holds plenty--I currently have it loaded with just over half of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It will take me weeks to get through that.  My son's friends think it is the coolest thing and so do I!   I probably wouldn't clip it to the bottom of a shirt hem -- I usually clip it to my collar or a pants pocket where gravity won't tug it loose.  Even if it does dangle loose, it is so light that the earbuds hold it in your ear. I have  seen reviews where some people have dropped their shuffle from a balcony, dunked it in beer, etc to see how much abuse it would take. It finally died when they ran over it with a car. So if you do happen to drop it, it will likely be fine. Just don't lose it!   My beloved 20g has taken a backseat to this petite beauty. As one reviewer mentioned, it is a nice feature of the flash drive that the shuffle simply begins when you push the play button. There is no waiting for the hard drive to rev up as you sometimes do with the bigger ipods. I don't claim to be an audiophile and I rip my mp3s at the lowest quality setting. But I have never heard the hiss that others complain of and my audiobooks sound just right to me.   I will never give up an ipod with a screen because I use the sleep timer to drift off at night. I often wake up at 2:00 am with my earbuds still in my ears! But now my 20gig never leaves my night table while my shuffle goes with me everywhere.   I highly recommend it.

<Title>Very cool, but sound quality could be better.
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Picked up a 2G shuffle along with an 80gb Ipod yesterday.  I had heard that the new shuffle had problems with sound quality, but figured people were blowing things out of proportion.  Well, they weren't.  The sound from the shuffle is very flat and dull sounding.  I listened to the same song on the shuffle vs the 80gb ipod and it's night and day.  I planned to use the shuffle for the gym and other times when I didn't want to carry the larger ipod, but I think this one's going back.  One the positive side it is very tiny and the little dock is pretty cool.  For a little more money, though you can get the very highly rated 2gb Samsung T9 with twice the memory and better sound quality.  It's also a very small player.  So if you're not picky about sound quality the new shuffle will fit the bill.  If you are, look elsewhere.

<Title>A true masterpiece
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like the concept and firmness of the designers, they knew what they wanted in the market. Some reviewers are wrong about the absence of the screen, the concept of the design makes the longed and heartfelt desired screen useless, uncomfortable, inadequate and irrelevant.  The only thing I find dangerous from a commercial point of view is the mistake made offering those poor Apple earphones. The inclusion of modest Sennheiser CX300 or AKG K27i would not have been so expensive and the improvement is notable and worth mentioning. Unsurpassable design and excellent sound using the modest earphone and heaphone mentioned or if you prefer to pay an unjustified price ---too expensive--- buy Etymotic Research ER4P. In short: this Second Generation iPod Shuffle is a true masterpiece, ideal not only for jogging or the gym.

<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, just to confirm other reports... YES, there is a "hiss" in the new 2G Shuffle.  I still love mine though.  The 1st Shuffle does sound better.  I still love mine.  The "hiss" is noticeable when using high-sensitivity IEMs... Etymotics, Shure, and the like.  It does NOT show up on my AKG K81, or AKG 240DFs unless I crank the headphone amp up.  The "hiss" is steady, and doesn't increase when you crank up the Shuffle's volume.  If you're using the Apple earphones, you probably won't even hear the hiss.  So there. :P

<Title>Better install the newest iTunes software before you buy an iPod
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my iPod Nano and Shuffle for 2 weeks and have yet to use them becuase the issues with getting iTunes installed due to older versions of Quicktime. I have used RegEdit, CCleaner, reintsalled almost every version of quicktimes and then uninstalled it and when all is said and done, I still get "Unable to install iTunes/Quicktime because an older version of quicktime could not be removed".   I thought Apple was supposed to be the company who thinks things out and makes software that works. If you search the web you will find long lists of people having the same issue. Some overcome this issue and other cannot, such as me. I should not have to F/Disk my drive just to make my iPod work. Right now my iPods are just paper weights because I cannot get their software installed. Someone at Apple needs to make a software package that knows how to remove older versions of quicktime off PCs.   Before you buy an iPod, install the latest iTunes. Without it, you cannot do a thing with your new iPod.

<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are looking for a small MP3 player to use while at the gym or running then this is a pretty close to a perfect choice.  It is barely larger than a quarter and has a clip built in.  The controls are simple and can be operated easily while you are in the middle of a workout.  The battery life is so long that I don't even think about whether i have a charge...it has never been an issue.  I can fit many hours of songs on the player but I generally use playlists of 30-40 songs that I create in iTunes.  The sound is good, the controls are easy and the size is right.  I'm not sure how Apple could even improve on this product.  The only thing you might want to do is look at different headphones.  I find that the earbuds pop out too easily during strenuous activity and I opt for the wraparound headphones (I use the Philips SHS3200/37).

<Title>I love the ipod shuffle
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the iPod shuffle last year for Christmas. The shuffle is my first mp3 player. Up until last year, I would rely on either my portable cd walkman or my work computer to listen to my music. I consider my shuffle a blessing. It is far more convenient than a cd walkman. After having it for almost a year, my shuffle still works like a charm. There have been a few times in the past few months when I had to re-set my iPod shuffle but that quickly resolved all of the issues I had with it (like the way my music would load into it). I hate the earplugs that comes with the shuffle, they are quite uncomfortable including with those little pads it comes with (and they fall off quite easily). Warning: if you try to use another iTunes library, the music in your shuffle will be deleted. Another minor flaw with the shuffle is that it is very easy to hit the wrong buttons but overall I still love the shuffle.

<Title>Smaller Isn't Always Better
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In March of 2006, I purchased an ipod shuffle. True, it's about twice the size of the ipod shuffle now, but it came with a lanyard, a headphone plug and a USB plug for charging.  After receiving the latest ipod shuffle, the fist problem I encountered was the clip. It hanged or flopped over instead of being securely clipped on and staying upright, and I was not aware the latest ipod shuffle required the wearing of specific types of clothing to be secure. Ugh.   And, since it is a clip, of course, there's no attachment for a lanyard, so I used a thick shoe lace and threaded it through the clip instead, so I can wear it around my neck.  The worse thing I discovered, however, is that Apple did not include a separate plug for charging which creates a serious problem--a lot of wear and tear.  Every single headphone plug I've used over the years would start to lose contact with the contact points over time, and unfortunately, it doesn't take long for it to occur if you keep plugging in and unplugging the head phones. The contact points wear down, and it reaches the point where the slightest movement of the headphone plug can cause music to cut out and you have to fiddle with it constantly in order to keep both "stereo" channels or any music going at all.  For me, too, I found the clip itself made matters worse because the headphone plug would get yanked or bent downward when I was moving around. After just one attempt at wearing the ipod shuffle with the clip and my music cutting out several times, I knew it was time to come up with some kind of lanyard.  Unfortunately, the lanyard doesn't solve the problem about the headphone and charging plug being the same and all the wear and tear it's required to take.  As a result, I have been using my older shuffles far more, for I suspect my new ipod shuffle is not going to last nearly as long due to this particular poor design by Apple.

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - A steep price for a starter MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> The iPod Shuffle second generation is a great MP3 player for working out or running, especially if you are a die-hard Apple fan.  However, the steep price means you had better review all your options before you choose this.  Pros - Small size - Nice case design - Many color options - Highly durable player - Apple reputation  Cons - High price point - Less durable shell - Proprietary dock for syncing - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability - iTunes software with limited formats (MP3, AAC) - No screen, FM tuner or line in recording - Competing products offer more capacity for less $$  The Form Factor  This little guy is small!  The body has a spring loaded clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt without any extra case.  Apple added a few extra color options with the 3rd generation, including the popular purple.  It comes in a composite case. The 2nd generation's case seems more durable than the 3rd.  The basic controls remain the same (fast forward, rewind, pause, and play) to access your music collection.  There is a headphone jack which you also use to mount this on the sync dock.  A standard USB B port would have been preferable to this as well.  Storage Capacity  Apple made it available only in 1GB sizes, same as the 2nd generation.  It would have made more sense to bump it up to at least 2GB.  The competing Zen Stone Plus by Creative offers 2GB (twice the songs), an FM tuner and the ability to see song titles for less money.  Sandisk also has some lower capacity Sansa models at similar price points. Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB MP3 Player Zen Stone Plus 2GB Black <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP50AY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">SanDisk Sansa c150 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD40N8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">Sandisk Sansa Express 1 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IM9542/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Durability  Apple definitely deserves point for the more durable player in this group.  Even with the new player composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse.  There will be some failures, but for the most part these hold up well.  Software  When you only have 1GB to fill, having to use iTunes software to do it seems excessive.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  For those that care about file options, Apple's software allows only MP3 and AAC.  You can convert other formats to these, but be aware of the limits.  Sound  The sound this unit produces is pretty good for it's size.  However, it's just ok.  I still feel the first generation shuffle sounded much better, but the trade off was it was much longer.  Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $65.  Sandisk Sansa has similarly priced models.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.  Overall this is a good player at a price that could be less.  Weigh your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Enjoy!!!

<Content>I had the previous shuffle and I loved it, it's so easy to use..itunes rules.  I hear people say, yeah but you cant scroll down and find a particular song, or it does not have enough gig strength, I say whatever, for me it's perfect..look i load all of the songs so they are all songs i want to listen to, as for the memory, well i dont want more that 150 songs on my ipod at once anyway, i replace my song list all of the time.  As for the new shuffle, it's fantastic, it's tiny and light and hooks on anywhere you need it, and i really like the chrome color, they only neg's are that you have to charge the shuffle on your computer, you cant set it in a charger and charge it from your home outlet..bummer..and the ear buds that come de riguer with the ipods are serviceable at best, but other that that, I highly recommend it, it's relatively inexpensive, easy to use and surprisingly durable.

Very light, sound quality is very good and the clip is very cool. I like the color, it charges easily.  Definitely the best thing for the gym, less cables, no need to have an armband for another 20 dollars.  All you need is the shuffle and a place to clip it. 1 GB is sufficient enough for a two month workout before getting bored of the music stored. I also bought the nano but I might not need it now although it is very nice and light. Recommend it. Technology is amazing now, so much capacity in a such a small thing.

<Title>Big Entertainment; Little Package; Medium Price
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been eyeballing MP3 players, specifically iPods for some time now.  I wan't interested in the original Shuffle and was undecided on purchasing the Nano or opting up for one with video capabilities.  I found the size novelty of the 2nd Generation Shuffle a selling point and opted for one as my first MP3 player.  I already use iTunes and wanted an MP3 player that was compatible.  I also wanted one that I wouldn't notice when I workout or run.  There is no need to purchase any additional accessories to be able to workout with this MP3 player.  I found what I was looking for in the Shuffle.    You can download or import your own CDs and sync up to approximately 240 songs.  Other possibilities are listening to audio books or any one of a wide array of free podcasts.  I went running today and listed to a running podcast set to music.  It was like having a running coach along for the workout. Here are some pros and cons I have noticed:  Pros: *  Price *  Sleek design *  Size *  Weight *  Material (aluminum) *  User friendly *  Additional accessories not necessary  Cons: *  Charges on USB dock only, not wall outlet (without another purchase) *  Limited functionality *  Cannot search for specific tracks, only play, shuffle or skip track forward or backward  The cons I have noted probably cannot be addressed without increasing the size and price.  Unless video capability is a must for you, the new 2nd Generation iPod Shuffle is a somewhat affordable way to take along music or spoken word MP3 files wherever your go.  This is definitely advancement from the Walkman (1980's) I used to own

<Title>Great for the gym and a no-brainer to use
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to replace my current Sandisk MP3 player tbat I use at the gym. To this day I can't reliably use the menu on that thing. The On/Off button is also tricky and sometimes it takes me multiple times to turn it on or off. And I never could get the right combination of buttons and menu choices to use the FM mode.   Yes, this is all embarrasing to admit, but my past experiences provide a perfect explanation for why I chose the new Shuffle. It's so simple to use. The On/Off switch (not button) is a no-brainer--and it's easy to see whether it's on or off, despite not having a menu. There is also a switch (again, not a button) that turns the song shuffle on or off. Press the Play button to play, and use the volume buttons to raise or lower the volume. Same goes for the Next/Previous song buttons. All of this is easy to accomplish if you're running on a treadmill at the gym. I can't say the same for my old player.   My only complaint is that the symbols are very small and difficult to read for anyone without great eyesight. At first glance I confuse the On/Off and Shuffle switches, but I have no problem seeing the bit of green behind the On/Off switch that indicates the player is turned on.   I also have a hard time figuring out the volume and forward/back buttons. I have to stare at them for a second to tell them apart and then press the one I want. On an Ipod this isn't an issue because the Ipods have a screen above the buttons, so the orientation and therefore the buttons are intuitive by design. On the other hand, the Shuffle is so small and easy to clip anywhere that you don't have a sense for what's the top or bottom of the player. When it's in your pocket or hooked to gym equipment, there is no obvious clue to its orientation, making it hard to tell whether the button on the left is Back or Forward.   But, these are minor quibbles! What's nice about the Shuffle is that even if you hit the wrong button, there's no menu to get lost in and your exercise won't be interrupted.

I've found the shuffle easy to control and navigate even without a display.  The small size makes it practical to use anywhere, and the sound quality is fabulous.  One feature I find especially nice when listening to podcast, is that the shuffle will pick up where it left off, should you jump to another one and come back at a later time.  You can also jump to the begin or skip both forward or backward in a podcast easily.  I like mine so much that I bought three more of these to give as gifts.

Sad to admit that happened, SO happy to re-discover how good my favorite music can make me feel. The sound is great, the unit is easy to use...i've become addicted to this thing so bad that i even told Hubby i wish they'd come out with a water-proof one so i didn't have to remove it to take a shower!  Even if you're 'on the fence' about getting an MP3 player, you cannot go wrong with this little gem! i'm definitely keeping these in mind for holiday gift-giving. Also, it's the perfect way to test out if you really want one or not because it's so affordable, you wouldn't even mind giving it to someone if you decide it's not for you. Which i would bet won't happen! So go on, go for it! (You won't be sorry!)

<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the iPod shuffle!!! For me, it couldn't be more perfect - small, holds 250 songs and mixes them up. It's truly all I need. I'm not into watching TV or Movie on a tiny screen, and I honestly don't need multiple play lists. I wear my Shuffle when I work out and when I go walking with the dog, or do yard work. The ease of use, and the combination of iTunes with it, makes it perfect for those, like me, who want great music, in a small package.

<Content>What can I say?  I thought it was ingenious of Apple to turn the player into a clip, the player works wonderfully and the clip is strong enough to keep hold of your clothes while you are running, biking, or exercising at the gym.  Perfect exercise partner.  5 Stars!

<Title>  shuffle problems
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product from another store. Within 8 months it quit working. The salesperson said they had a lot of problems but I liked its convenience and size so I just got a new one. It too broke within another month. This time the sales person said: what do expect for that money." Huh? I refused another one and got my money back.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHGJ50/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">Apple 1 GB iPod shuffle Silver (3rd Generation)</a>

The little shuffle came out of his pocket in the washing machine...it wouldn't play immediatly, but it has now been about 15 hours later and the thing is playing the songs, we will need new headphones, but it plays on his ipod speaker system. Good little machine...amazing!

<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Ipod shuffle is much smaller than the nano and in fact a lot of functionality is lost in this mini ipod. However, it is perfect for the younger members of the family or for older people who are not interested or cannot manage technology well. It is very simple to use and the bright colors make it fun to carry around.

<Title>Moody, does not 'shuffle', and incompatible with ITUNES
<Date>Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using one of these for my workouts and when I am out on mission (think Iraq) for a couple months now; the sound quality is good, and the battery life is truely great. However, one day it is willing to play a file, the next day I load the same file onto it and it refuses to play it. The pattern seems to be based on file types, so if you want anything to play reliably, you will need the files to be copied into probably about three different formats.  There is no shuffle feature. I have tried everything, heck there is not even a fast forward feature that would be a lifesaver.   And Itunes cannot load music onto it... I have tried everything right up to redownloading itunes and restalling it three different times. I still like itunes for shorting my music files, but that is all it can do.   The one redeeming factor is it does not waste battery power with visual features such as a screen.

<Title>Great for Newbies (& more SOPHISTICATED folks... eh hem)
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this iPod shuffle.  It's perfect for "new to iPod users".  And, older people who are less inclined to adapt to more complicated equipment.  Now, I am not in the latter category, not by age, but because I love to fiddle with new things, but before I advanced to the Nano or anything else, I wanted to familiarize myself with the way you use iTunes.  The sound is superior & I don't mind the lack of control on what I hear, because I only download what I LIKE.  So, for mindless listening while driving or walking, etc., it is perfect.  An iPod is DEFINITELY easier to download music than any other mp3 player.  That is probably the best thing about it.  The only downside is the music "shuffle", but once you adjust to that or if that is okay with you, this is an excellent product.  Mine is refubished & I love it.

<Content>So I got this little pink clipping mp3 player and I'm TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH IT! I have a 3rd generation nano also but I just was afraid of taking it for my walks and I got shuffle for that. Really small, great sound, intuitive and the clip is just perfect. I reach for it all the time, at home, while cleaning, walking, jogging... Clip and go. Another GENIUS idea from Apple.

<Content>A good no-frills mp3 player.  Ideal for jogging.  The metal clip makes cases and arm bands unnecessary.  Not really cheap but tolerably priced for the convenience.  The Apple ear buds fit well in my big elf-like ears but not my wife's.  Any feedback on the Sony headphones with interchangeable earpieces?  Say from someone who's about 5'3" and 110 lbs with normal sized ears?

<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a runner who loves listening to music during workouts, but hates having to carry around a bulky iPod on outdoor runs. The iPod shuffle clips right on to your clothes and weighs almost nothing. You can have it go through your playlist in order, or have it shuffle and surprise you with whatever pops up next. It was just what I needed to get me through the 4 hot hours of the Chicago Marathon last Sunday.

<Title>Only works if YOU are good enough for Apple
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am deployed to Afghanistan so as it is you have to have anything electronic you want mailed to family in the US and mailed to you, no one seems to be willing to send any electronics to an APO, so I guess the thought of major companies is that if we did not bring it we should not have it.  So I went through the hoops and waited 2 weeks instead of the one it would have taken had they direct mailed.  Then once I get it, they do not come with the software to load any music on it, you have to download it.  Well, I can't do this at work since it is a Government internet system, so I try it on my own, but the connection is not stable enough and I cannot download the entire 50 Mb file to use the IPOD.  So I call tech support, the tier one guy was nice enough, but he could not help because Apple does not feel it is necessary to make disks anymore, if you want to use their product you had best have an internet connection that is good enough to download their software.  So I talk to the tier two guy who told me that it was my problem and I should have downloaded ITunes before I ordered the IPOD to make sure that I had it, he made it clear that he had no intention of helping me and that he would under no circumstances be willing to transfer me to his supervisor.  When I asked his name so that I could complain, he hung up on me, really nice of him to do when I spent half an hour of my evening calling from Afghanistan.  So finally I called the Public Relations people and explained the problem, they got in touch with someone who would make me a disk and mail it to me so that I could finally use the IPOD, but here I am a month or more since I ordered the IPOD and it is still a useless piece of metal and plastic because the disk is still not here after 2 weeks if they ever actually sent it.  Other than supposedly sending me the software, that is required to make the product work except it is not included, Apple has done nothing except send an email to say thank you for working with them.  Customer service and support obviously do not exist with Apple and if you are not up to their standards do not buy their products.

<Title>Hissing sound
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod shuffle second generation is small and stylish however at the expense of sound quality. There is a hissing sound, some sort of noise, that is constant as long as it is turned on. It can be heard with the earphones that comes with it, and is more annoying with better earbuds.   I was quite disappointed when I got it. The iPo shuffle first generation (gum-pack version) had great sound quality, but I lost mine so I had to replace it.   I would not recommend this to anyone who does not listen to music so loud that they impair their hearing.   Also the docking station is a bit annoying, since it makes it harder to recharge the battery and use it as a data-saving source. It is possible to buy a little thing that is more portable than the docking station though, that makes it a bit more convenient.

<Title>Excellent product, mediocre sound
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This ipod is very nice with a solid, high quality construction. It is unbelievably small and the controls are intuitive. I love going to the gym with it.  The sound is not as good as one would expect. The bass is not much and the sound not is not crisp. It sounds better with my Sennheiser headphones but my PDA (which of course is not primarily designed for music) still outperforms it. It comes with low quality earphones which keep coming out of my ears when I work out. This is a big problem because the ipod shuffle must have been designed for the gym crowd. These are the only things making it less than perfect. Otherwise a fine product and I dont regret buying it.

<Title>Unbeatable portability and compactness but mediocre sound.
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This tiny device is amazing insofar as it is able to store so many songs in such a portable, concealable package.  BUT, the sound quality is average, at best, compared to other portable music devices.  For example, portable CD players with larger lightweight headphones give you noticeably more robust bass, a more detailed and revealing accurate midrange, and crisper highs, probably due to their better dynamic range, S/N ratio, etc.  Then again, perhaps I am 'spoiled' because when I listen to my high-end home stereo system (with Magneplanar speakers, Velodyne Sub, McIntosh amp/preamp, Denon HDCD/SACD player, etc.), ANY portable music device pales in comparison!  If you're into quantity and portability (being able to carry so many songs in such a small unit), get the 'Shuffle'.  If you're into quality higher-end sound, look elsewhere.

<Title>Wow- this thing is so amazing and tiny!
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just purchased  this for my 7 year old son.  This is what he has been wanting for Christmas.  When it arrived, in the cool clear apple box, I really was stunned at how small it was in person!  I took it out of the box, plugged it in to charge with the included docking station right into my usb port.  In the am, I opened  itunes on my mac, and it recognized this device, I was a little worried as I already have 2 other ipods on this same computer using itunes.  I named the device, and opened my library, dragged and dropped songs into his shuffle. So easy and so awesome! I had it ready to go in 5 minutes.  I have a mini and a nano. This thing is so portable, just enough when you don't want to drag along your other mp3 player. It clips to anything, weighs nothing, easy to use, super user friendly. I had debated buying a 7 year old an ipod shuffle, but after looking at Disney's mp3, and other players geared towards kids, I just thought this was the best overall deal , knowing  apple's reliability and excellent products!  Plus, maybe he'll even let me borrow it!  The only negative- which is no biggie for this mp3 is no screen readout. BUT, I liked it because it's not too overwhelming, holds plenty of songs without being too many to shuffle through.  You clip it on, press play in order, or shuffle through your song list. You can rearrange, update, change your playlist in no time at all on the computer and reload - perfect gift for younger and older.  Great value! Plus it is just too darn cute! Go for it- you'll love it!

<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This sound machine is great!  I use it at work in a warehouse. It is inconspicuous.  The buttons are easy to push and also easy to figure out what does what.  The sound is great for what it is . . . a small sound machine --- period.  The case is aluminum and strong to take the punishment of being scraped into other metal objects.  The clip works well and fits into the small watch pocket of blue jeans.  I purchased silicone skins for the shuffle, just for added dust and grease protection. Between pausing the music and turning it off when on break/lunch etc., I get about 3 work days use out of it before needing a recharge(non-continuous battery use).    The only improvement could be in the earphones.  I think they should come with a small clip near the ear speakers so that you can clip the wire to your shirt.  By having this, there would be a strain-relief so that the weight of the wire would not keep tugging on your ear pieces(a little annoying having that constant tugging on your ears).    All-in-all, a perfect device. It turns on, stores music,and plays music.  And its so tiny !!

<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me preface this by saying I am already an owner of a 5g iPod, so I bought this as a 2nd iPod for working out. This little thing is really well-designed.  I was going to just use it for working out, but I like it so much that I often take it instead of my larger iPod when I'm just going out for a little while.  PROS: - Eyecatching.  This is one sexy-looking device. - ridiculously small, easy to carry anywhere - controls are easy to use by feel without looking at the iPod - built-in belt clip is really useful - sound quality is excellent to my ears - great value  CONS: - the wired dock adds clutter to an already cluttered desk - you must make sure to clip the iPod firmly or it could fall off (it's pretty lightweight)  Overall, no major complaints with this.  It feels solid so I hope it will last the beating I am sure to give it when I exercise.

<Title>Nothing Better For Running
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought an iPod Nano about a year ago along with the optional FM radio.  I added the new Shuffle to my iPod collection and have been using it now for about a month.  One of the ways I stay in shape is mountain trail running and sometimes it's nice to take some good music along for the journey.  I still use my Nano on the trails but tend to reserve its use for when I'm in the mood for radio (having a large collection of my own recorded music along is great just in case radio reception is poor).  I bought the shuffle because I quickly discovered when running trails I seldom wanted to look at the Nano's video screen and something simpler, smaller, and more compact would be preferable.  When I heard about the new Shuffle I ordered it from the online Apple Store a month before they were available for shipping without the benefit of any user reviews.  This is an excellent gift idea for anyone on your list who likes to exercise and wants to enjoy music at the same time.  Just because someone you know already has one of the other iPods with a video screen does not mean the Shuffle won't quickly become their favorite iPod to use when exercising and being physically active.   You simply put your play list together on your computer and upload it into the Shuffle.  You can play your songs in order or tell the Shuffle to shuffle the original order.  I play my songs in order and put together a play lists long enough to cover the time I will be running, 3mi, 5mi, 10mi or more (highest energy songs at times when I know I will need the most inspiration).  It clips anywhere  on your shirt or shorts and you're good to go.  The new Shuffle is as outstanding a product as my Nano, I love them both.  Another advantage  of having two iPods I've discovered is being able to lend an iPod to a friend who's along for the run (that is if they don't already have one).

They are great compact, it is very simple to use and unlike other ipods it has an on and off button! It is great for people who just want a way to lisent to your music, it holds about 250 songs, so only put your favorites on the ipod. The only down side is it dosent have a screen do you have no way of knowing what song it is. It is great for long car rides too. I f you want a way to play all your music but your not ready to commit $200.00 this is the way to go.

<Title>Great little mp3 player with a couple problems.
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will not say much about the good since there are so many positive reviews here already that would supply more information that I care to do.  I will say the reason I bought this to replace my nano was the form factor and the lack of a scroll wheel.  I liked the nano and really liked the lanyard headphones that allowed me to wear it around my neck.  The problem was I found the scroll wheel too sensitive.  Too often trying to skip to the next song found me accidentally increasing the volume and blowing my eardrums out.  Now for the shuffle's bad points... 1)It is gone!  I lost it already after just a few months.  The clip, which I thought would great, is not strong enough.  The headphone cord is not long enough to keep it in my pocket, so it was usually clipped to my shirt somewhere or I would wrap the headphones around my neck and clip it to the wire.  I was unloading some wood from my car and it fell off.  This was right in front of my house but by the time I realized it was gone, someone had picked it up and made off with it already.  2)No folder support.  Sure there is no screen but there could still be a button to skip to the next folder.  The Creative Zen Stone I picked up after losing the shuffle has this ability(I DO NOT recommend it, however, see my review of that player).  One gig holds 150 songs or so and I would like the ability to break that down a bit by mood, etc.  3)A bit expensive for a screenless 1 gig mp3 player.  So, I guess the improvements I would wish for would be folder support, a lower price and a stronger clip.  Or, a clip free version that could be worn around your neck.  I had a 256 mb pendant mp3 player from Virgin that was pretty good.  Give it the shuffle's better controls and capacity and it would be great.

<Title>Poor Sound Quality. Treble set too high and damaging to eardrums
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very disappointed with the sound quality; in fact, it seems to be hyper-tweaked for treble and base, and the two overpowering settings and opposing qualities pierce your ears. The treble is so high it actually is a bit dangerous and could increase longterm hearing damage. It is really important to consider equalizing music for clarity (keeps volume levels down) and for hearing safety. I love dance and hip hop so this shuffle is so not for me. It's price tag is also too high for being a step back from the original shuffle. I am confused? I love the size, but it doesn't hold the quality that 79$ can get you these days and I am not willing to risk my hearing on bad sound quality. Good Luck!

<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for a video ipod and couldnt decide which. Ive been using my sister's video 30GB. I came upon this shuffle for $60 and couldnt pass up the chance of buying it. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!! I rip all my songs onto my pc from CDs at 256k so that 1GB was gonna hold less songs than 250. Well, turns out I was able to fit a whole 155 songs onto it at 250k and havent had one problem. The size is excellent!! The shuffle or limiting size is no downer. Ive taken it walking with me and clipped it to my small pocket by my pant pocket, and it weighs nothing!! Now the video ipod stays at home unless i travel out and this shuffle is my new best friend. LOVE IT!!!  UPDATE: I just noticed that when you plug in your shuffle, itunes gives you the option to convert all copies of songs to 128k, on the fly. No, it will not convert the songs in your library, just the copies it sends to the itunes. Wow... simply amazing.

<Title>Perfect
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This small relatively inexpensive ipod is perfect for anyone.  I have to admit I didn't want to spend a fortune for another traveling audio device.  However, when I first saw the advertisement on tv, it was love at first sight.  I can''t believe how much it holds.  Presently, I have an audio book which has 11 cds and 1 music cd loaded with plenty of room left to download another cd or 2.  Some people are concerned that it doesn't have a display.  Personally, who cares.  For those who do not want to watch CSI on a 1 inch screen or have no need to download 80 gb of music or tv shows, it is fine.  For the price who can beat it.  The only thing I would change is the horribe ear plugs.  I realize they could not include the best high quality ear plugs for this price.  But they could have included ear plugs that actually fit in normal ears.  I purchased another set of ear plugs and it was fine.  I feel fortunate that I even own one.  You will not be disappointed.

<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been eyeballing MP3 players, specifically iPods for some time now. I wan't interested in the original Shuffle and was undecided on purchasing the Nano or opting up for one with video capabilities. I found the size novelty of the 2nd Generation Shuffle a selling point and opted for one as my first MP3 player. I already use iTunes and wanted an MP3 player that was compatible. I also wanted one that I wouldn't notice when I workout or run. There is no need to purchase any additional accessories to be able to workout with this MP3 player. I found what I was looking for in the Shuffle.   You can download or import your own CDs and sync up to approximately 240 songs. Other possibilities are listening to audio books or any one of a wide array of free podcasts. I went running today and listed to a running podcast set to music. It was like having a running coach along for the workout. Here are some pros and cons I have noticed:   Pros:  * Price  * Sleek design  * Size  * Weight  * Material (aluminum)  * User friendly  * Additional accessories not necessary   Cons:  * Charges on USB dock only, not wall outlet (without another purchase)  * Limited functionality  * Cannot search for specific tracks, only play, shuffle or skip track forward or backward   The cons I have noted probably cannot be addressed without increasing the size and price. Unless video capability is a must for you, the new 2nd Generation iPod Shuffle is a somewhat affordable way to take along music or spoken word MP3 files wherever your go. This is definitely advancement from the Walkman (1980's) I used to own

I can clip this on my clothes at work, and I don't have to listen to the annoying sounds of crappy music coming from my co-workers' cubicles. The earbuds could be better...they aren't as comfortable as I would have liked. The sound quality is nice, though. For $79, I'm pleased.

<Title>My first IPOD...
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I didn't think I would join the IPOD movement and then came along the IPOD shuffle, the 2nd generation.  Actually, I purchased two directly through the Apple store because the shipping and engraving was free.  The highlights for me are, the shuffle is: compact, lite-weight, and easy to use.  Do you really need more than 240 MP3 files?  If so, this is not the IPOD to get.

<Title>IPOD SHUFFLE THE BOMB!
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was a gift, and the green casing is beautiful. It has heft - the feel of a well made,quality product.  It is powerful for its extraordinarily small size - 1" square! Pictures do it no justice. The product comes with a tiny belt clip, earphones and necessary equipment to download ITunes - well over 200 songs. The sound is amazing! This is truly a perfect utility for someone who doesn't require thousands of songs on hand - a jogger, an office worker. It is so unobtrusive, yet delivers beautiful music.  As for Amazon's service - it arived MUCH faster than estimated delivery time. Thank you! Initially, the recipient could not get the shuffle to work. She took it to an Apple products dealer nearby - and,afte examination, they said it was defective. Thru Amazon, I initiated the return process, and my recipient quickly received a new shuffle within just a couple of days - before I could return the defective one! The replacement seems to be fine, and is a wonderful gift.

<Title>Awesome
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for my grandfather.  To my ears, and just testing it very briefly, the sound quality was better than my 2g iPod Nano.  It has a really awesome sound, is completely lightweight (probably really easy to lose), and looks very classy.  The bummers on it are obvious, no switching between albums, and all that, which honestly would be hard to have fit onto the unit.  I would not use this as my main listening device, I have my computers hooked up to speakers in the house for that, and can easily go between albums, songs, etc.  But this is great for when you are on the go, or basically in any situation.  I found the sound quality to be very good.

<Title>Orange shuffle rocks my walks!
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I absolutely adore my orange shuffle for a number of reasons: its tiny, lightweight size, sturdy metallic encasing, vibrant color, Zen-like simplicity, clear sound quality, generous battery life, and ability to clip anywhere (I clip mine into my jeans pocket). In fact, I love mine so much that I got one for my partner, a painting contractor. In fact, she loves it so much for work that she wants a second one! I just ordered the new Product Red shuffle for her through the Apple Store. One shuffle has her rock, and the other will have all one artist. The 1GB of space is more than enough for a gadget with no screen. Honestly, I don't want a screen when I use my shuffle. That's what my 8GB nano is for. Between my walks with the dogs, watering the yard, and my partner's painting business, we both could not be more elated with our shuffles. Except for the cord on the cradle, this is the PERFECT music machine.

<Title>Ipod Shuffle 2nd Genatation
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased for my wife but I am the one that maintains it since my wife is a technophobe. My wife likes the small size and easy controls because it's great for her to take to the gym and on her walks. It is relatively easy to install but requires you at least have ITunes 7.0. In my opinion loading songs is not very intuitive and I know my wife would not be able to do it. I don't like that you can't tell what song is playing because there is no readout. I don't like that you have to actually copy songs from a cd to your computer to download to the device instead of just being able to load a cd and drag songs from the cd. The songs you add have to remain on your computer or the next time you connect the device to sync the songs you previously loaded will be erased. And the songs have to remain checked in ITunes or they will be erased. You have to buy a separate charger if you don't want to have to use the docking station which has to be connected to your pc therefore using a usb connection. Also, it has no radio tuner. It is for all these reasons I only give it a 2 rating. As I said my wife likes it but I would not recommend it.

<Title>The first must have gift of this Christmas season...
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Shuffle returns with a brand new invention....  I had the first generation 512MB Shuffle, which was small enough for me to carry and use everywhere. The second generation IPod shuffle is 1/3 the size with twice the memory of the 512MB, and at a lower initial price point. This is the first IPod product that has come out which was an immediate buy for me. My need for musical portability is limited. I use it in the gym or the library. I don't need a 2GB or larger Nano, and only have a 80GB IPod for video use and music storage. The Shuffle fits the perfect niche for me. I preload multiple playlists, thrown in some utterly random goodness, and I'm walking out the door. Some don't like not having a screen or having to move forward through the track order or the randomness of the music when it plays on shuffle, but for me that's the appeal. This 2nd generation Shuffle is as simple and inexpensive as it gets, and does its job incredible well (which is to play music). The only major drawback are the hideously bad earbuds, which you may want to consider upgrading.  One note, check the pricing before you buy on here. Some days Amazon is fulfilling the order at list price, and other days third party vendors are ripping people off charging between $99 and $115. If you don't see it at the list price of $79,  Apple has it on their own website for $79, so pick it up there or in big box chain stores. This 2nd Gen Shuffle will dominate the low cost, low memory end of the portable music spectrum, and continue Apple's dominance in the market. At this price point, there are few who can't afford it, and plenty who are going to add it to their existing IPod collection. Highly recommended, and the perfect holiday gift.  A.G.

<Title>Not worth its price
<Date>Tue Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This damn thing didnt come with a manual. It wouldnt charge no matter what. Now copying files from your computer to the i-pod is a mystery. Good luck figuring it out. There is no simple quick manual that comes with it. Didnt like anything about it, I would return it for my money and buy other better cheaper MP3s. The clip is not strong. Summary: (1) Charging is a pain, it wouldnt charge for ever. (2) Even though I have a new desktop, it complained faster usb in a slower usb port. (3) You will have to spend some time figuring out how to copy files to the player. (4) There is no quick simple manual that comes that will show basic stuff. (5) How do you copy files to the mp3 player is a mystery. Shame on APPLE.

<Title>Having lived with it for a month ...
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>here's the good, bad, and ugly.  But mostly very good.  First, don't leave it on. The battery drains even if you're not playing music, and at the same rate. It's very easy to forget that you need to slide over the tiny on-off toggle on the bottom between uses. Three or four times after you've had the new shuffle die at the gym, you might remember.  Second, it won't load lossless files. Can't play them, can't down sample them to AACs. If you've got a bunch of them, it may not be worth the hassle of converting to AAC or MP3 format.  Third, this thing is so tiny it's easy to misplace. Do the right thing and get it engraved so you can tell it apart from the bunch of shuffles you'll no doubt buy for everyone in your house.  Okay, those points aside, the new shuffle is amazing. Having owned just about every flavor of iPod, including the original shuffle, I think this, bar none, is the ultimate evolution of the MP3 player. It's perfect for working out -- just clip it to the part of your shirt that's most convenient. It's so light you won't even know it's there. It also has the best sound quality I've yet to hear from an iPod, and plenty loud.  The price, of course, is astounding for what you get, and having a cute little dock thrown in is great. Remember, though, that you can't charge it without a dock (not yet, anyway -- third party USB adapters are almost here).  Apple does it right yet again.

<Title>not so practical MP3 at all.
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i-shuffle was supposed to be made for easy of use, however it's the opposite. I got the i-shuffle for my wife expecting for her to quick use it at the gym rather than carrying her bigger iPod around.  That sound is nice and the size is really small, but that's about all the good things. Here comes to the pains.   1. you need to charge it by put on the dock and plug it into the Mac USB laptop and also need to have iTune opening and running. (it won't charge w/o having the iTune open. also the computer need to be turn on). Which mean, you need to leave the laptop on all (4 hours) in order to charge the Shuffle, unless you would want to spend another $30-40 for the AC adapter.  2. If you don't use it for a few days w/o charging, the battery will die out. Means you need to turn on you laptop, open you iTune and leave them on for 4  hours just to recharge the battery.  3. Copying songs onto Shuffle is the pain as well. It needs iTune to transfer the songs (unlike other USB MP3 which once you plug to you USB port, it show as another removable harddrive which  you can you drag and drop the songs)  I personally wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you only want the look but not so practical at all.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First let me say that this iPod Shuffle is my first experience with an MP3 player. I don't listen to music much when I'm out and about but I've been flying for business more lately so I wanted something less bulky than my portable CD player. I didn't need one of the large capacity models, 240 songs is more than enough to get me through any round trip flight. Apple being the leader amongst MP3 players I figured I couldn't go wrong with an iPod.  I have to say that I am disappointed with the iPod Shuffle.  The frequency response is not as advertised (20hz - 20000hz) and the overall sound quality is quite flat and poor. Particularly absent is the bass. This frequency range is commonly featured on most portably audio devices including my old portable CD player and it provides plenty of bass. I tried swapping headphones for the ones I use with my CD player; it sounded better but only barely. I tried the same song on my CD player, iTunes on my PC, and then on the iPod and the iPod was the worse by far.   I'll also never use the provided ear buds. They do not fit well in my ears, nor do they stay in (in addition to not sounding very good).   Another draw back is that the Shuffle can only be charged from its docking station, which can only be plugged into a USB port on a computer that is on. This kinda makes it difficult when you're on the road and need to charge the thing. You could try to beg some juice off a fellow traveler I suppose [Approaching someone at the airport you see using a laptop] "Excuse me sir, would you mind if I could suck some power from your computer's USB port for my iPod?"   I also didn't think I'd mind not having some indication of what I'm listening to (even a track number display would be nice) but it is an inconvenience not knowing where you are in your play list.   The provided instructions are very thin, especially on how to use iTunes with your iPod. I've been using iTunes for a while and it took me some time to figure out how transfer music to the iPod (after I figured out I needed to upgrade iTunes to version 7+).   Speaking of the software, my computer has crashed more in the last week than it has in the last 2 years after installing iTunes 7. I cannot boot the computer with the iPod in the docking station and the docking station plugged into the PC. I also cannot put the iPod on the docking station without first having iTunes running. Doing either of these causes the computer to lock up.  There are a couple things I do like. I like that it's small. And I like that the volume can be turned up pretty darn loud to drown out the screaming children on the plane.  I cannot recommend the Shuffle if it is going to be your primary means of playing your music. It works well from a functionality standpoint but falls very short on quality. An $80 learning experience to be sure...   Pros: Small Volume goes up high More than enough storage space for casual use   Cons: Poor audio quality Poor ear buds Can only charge with USB docking station Poor instructions Software crashes my computer

<Content>If you use any higher quality headphones than the ones that came with the shuffle, be prepared to be disappointed.  When you turn the shuffle on, without any music playing, you will hear a background noise which gets even louder during music playback.  In Apple's user forum on the Apple website a lot of users are noticing this problem as well.  I took my shuffle into an Apple store and the only response I get is "I can't hear the noise" so the people in the store refused to do anything about it.  I've owned many iPods.  I've never had a problem before, but the first time I have a problem Apple refuses to do anything about it.  I think they've lost a customer completely.

<Title>Shuffle = 4 Stars; iTunes = 1 Star
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The shuffle is one of the smallest MP3 players you can get (although not the smallest, as Apple claims).  It's enclosed in a durable, aesthetically-pleasing casing and has an incredibly functional clip.  This is pretty much the only incentive to get this MP3 player.  If you do not care about that, you will likely be disappointed.  First of all, the Shuffle requires the use of iTunes, an incredibly ungainly program that will destroy the ordering system of your entire digital collection if you're not careful.   This required software doesn't actually come with the player either; you have to download it from the Apple website (those with dial-up beware the 35MB file size).  There are other work-around programs that you can use, but you'll find them just as user un-friendly as iTunes -- at least those currently available for the Shuffle.   Many other MP3 players will let you drag and drop music from your computer straight to the device without having to use any additional software, which is by far a much easier solution.  Once you actually get your music transferred over (a fairly long process using iTunes versus being able to drag albums over), then there's not much more to the player.  It plays smoothly and intuitively, despite not having a display (the MP3 player I owned a year ago that was smaller than the Shuffle actually had a brilliant OLED display that was easy to read despite its size).  The sound quality is quite poor compared to other flash MP3 players, such as those made by Creative Zen or Rio, but still sounds decent enough for what it is.  I use the same pair of headphones on all my MP3 players, and the sound comes out far more tinny on the Shuffle than any of the others, which are less expensive too, I might add.  In summary: Great looks Decent sound quality (note that I didn't say great) Poor computer-to-player interface

<Title>Shuffle Complaints
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I do not know where all these reviewers are getting their criticisms from. As a musician myself, I bought a 2nd generation IPOD three weeks ago. I also own a first generation Shuffle and a Nano. I use all of these units with both the Bose triports and the Sennheiser 100's. Both the sound and the portability are excellent. They certainly do not lack bass. I have a feeling that problems with bass are due to the included ear buds and not due to the player itself. In short, I feel that when I can clip this much music practically anywhere on my clothing and get this quality of sound, these units are a bargain...I do, however, wonder why Amazon is getting so much more for their units as all other vendors out there.$79 seems to be the going price at almost all vendors.

<Title>shuffle a nice little mp3 player
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I absolutely LOVE my shuffle. There have been so many times where I've wanted to listen to music but didn't want to carry my slightly bulky video with me. The shuffle is a perfect solution to this problem.  Pros: -it's VERY small -it has a convenient clip -the sound quality is decent -the design is nice  Cons: -the only way to charge it is using your computer unless you buy some other charger  So far, the battery life has been decent. Charging it at my computer isn't very convenient, but it doesn't kill me. The shuffle is an amazing little thing, and I love its size. It's great for someone who wants music on the go in a tiny package.

<Title>Apple 1gb ipod shuffle 2nd gen
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is 2nd flash mem mp3 player and my first ever ipod. In general I like the design of this fine piece of machinery. It's very small, sleek, sound quality is decent, and it seems to be somewhat robust. I would give this product five stars hardware wise, but what I don't like about it compared to other flash mem players such as creative or sandisk is the fact that the user interface (I-Tunes) is really not that user friendly. Being mainly a PC based user using win-xp I really liked the idea of the drag and drop of files without a program such as creative or sandisk players allow, but this player does not allow you to do it with-out Itunes. Itunes seems to run really slow compared to creatives' media source player and I've found it difficult to set up a single ipod to add songs from several computers.

<Title>It's Righteous
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been playing with my iPod Shuffle 2G for a week and I absolutely love it!   It's well made.  The clip is strong and you really can clip it to just about anything and not worry about it.  You won't even feel it on you, but it looks slick.  I like to clip it to my collar.    I'm a big fan of simplicity, so this is the perfect device for me.    The sound is good (though you'll need better headphones).  It doesn't sound quite as good as my discman, but it's very close and sounds better than I thought it would.   On the downside, you could run into a problem due to only being able to recharge the battery via a computer.  So, keep that in mind if you're looking for a device for traveling and you travel without a laptop.  [***EDIT:  Actually, I see that Apple sells an optional USB adapter to plug it into the wall, for 29 bucks.***]  The only hassles are related to iTunes:    If you're still a loser on dial-up like me, iTunes is a loooooong download.  I wish they'd have just included the software.  It actually took me about 5 tries to successfully download iTunes, and I was starting to really worry that I'd never get it.    Once I got iTunes going, it was also a long task to get that organized with songs to sync onto the Shuffle.    But these two hassles are worth going through.  Once you get iTunes figured out and organized, it's very easy to use this iPod Shuffle.  So, I'm still giving it 5 stars, despite the short-term hassle of getting iTunes going.    5 Stars because I'm wearing this baby literally everywhere I go.  It rocks.  It makes me happy.  So...get one or something.  Mmmk?

<Title>perfect for many reasons
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>PROS: It's size and weight make it almost nonexistant. For running, working out, etc., I haven't found a better choice, and just taking it along with you is effortless. The clip is also very strong. I don't see it ever slipping off a piece of clothing. The new aluminum design makes this a seemingly durable product and very pleasing to look at. It really does go with anything. The storage and battery life are also just right. I listened to my shuffle for a week straight before it needed a charge (obviously it wasn't non-stop). 12 hours is plenty. Plus, you can shuffle the songs or play them in order. As long as you make playlists you like and/or only keep good music in your library the absense of a screen is no big deal. I gladly give it up for the better weight and size. Docking and charging are easy, and iTunes is elementary to use. I recommend this to anyone. A good first player, an absolute perfect second player.  CONS: There are a couple minor ones. The only way to charge the player right out of the box is through your USB port. There isn't an AC adapter included. Apple sells them for $30-$40 bucks, yeah right, but I bought an off brand from Amazon for $0.75 plus shipping. I know it's hard to trust an expensive iPod to an off brand, but the reviews of the charger sound good so far. The included headphones aren't stellar. You have to get used to them or they make your ears a little soar once in a while, and the sound quality is alright. The cord length is perfect tho and they do look sweet, so maybe just get a different pair sometime in the future. For those of you who don't like iTunes I don't think you can use anything else. Sorry. Can't say I've really tried, but Apple is usually pretty tight about it. I got used to it. Overall, these minor flaws shouldn't discourage you from the player. It really is as cool as it looks, and it works perfectly.  SIDE THOUGHTS: Make sure you have USB 2.0. It's not a big deal, but I went from 20 minute transfers to 3 minute transfers. You can get adapters for your laptop, and PCs are even easier. You don't have to worry about charging it at off times. The make of the battery makes it possible to charge whenever, whether fully dead or not, without losing capacity. Just plug it in every day or so and you'll never run out of juice. The Apple site has more info on the batteries if you're curious. The batteries can even be replaced and are covered for the first year. Because it's a flash memory player, you needn't worry about skipping or breaking hard drive disks. Although real music junkies say flash memory doesn't have the same sound quality (you won't tell a difference).   Basically, I LOVE IT. Just think of it as your own personal radio station. You never know what's coming up next (unless it's out of shuffle mode), but you know it'll be a song you like. If not, just skip it. Buy it. It's a good buy.

<Title>It's the user not the player.
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've read some reviews for this product; and in general reviewers who give this product a low rating must struggle with setting the time on their VCR's (yes the phrase is somewhat antiquated now)  Simple iTunes interface - want a song on your iPod? drag, drop, done.   I like the durability of this product, it's sleek, it's small - a bit easy to lose, but it's a double edged sword when it comes to all of this modern micro-technologies.   I get 15 hours out of this player on a single charge - more than enough time for me; charging is a snap, it just sits right on it's little dock. Plug it in, go to bed - wake up, grab, and go - you have 15 hours of decent quality music (I'd say an 8 out of 10 quality-wise)   If you have trouble understanding the basics of iTunes and creating playlists - then go back to CD's - when it comes to MP3 players iPod + iTunes is the easiest way to go.

<Content>My mistake was not reading all of the directions so I thought it didn't work; thus, the only drawback I see to this is the 47MB iTunes download (even if you're not downloading any music from iTunes). But once it works, it's amazing how much music comes out of that tiny little thing. Note to Apple: 47MB is a lot to put on your computer just to download music. Provide options- with or without the iTunes store.

<Title>Shuffle vs Zen
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After my stereo had been stolen out of my work van for the 2nd time I decided to try an MP3 player instead. I figured 1gb would be more than enough for the short time I'm on the road each day. I chose the Creative Zen Stone mainly because it was $40 cheaper than the Shuffle. I had it for a couple of months before I either lost it or someone picked it up. I had wanted the Shuffle more orginally because I have all my CD's ripped to AAC files to play from my USB flash drive through my Kenwood head unit in my car, so this time I decided to give the Shuffle a try. For $40 more you do get better quality with the Shuffle, the Zen is all plastic. I like the clip on the Shuffle, none on the Zen. I feel the sound quality of the shuffle is a little better, 128k mp3 vs 128k aac. Of course you have to like Itunes for the Shuffle to work for you. The main area I like the Zen over the Shuffle is that you can drag your music in folders to the Zen and then there is a button to scroll through the folders, whereas with the shuffle all your music is not separated and with no screen it takes longer to find what you want to hear. I think the Zen Stone works better for me but there's a lot to like about the Shuffle and I can see why it's so popular.

<Title>5 stars for simplicity
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My IRIVER was stolen so i bought this.  The most attractive feature about this is the clip and its simplicity.  You really need to accept the fact you will need to change the way you store music on MP3's to own this.  1 GB is more than enough space if you need to fish through the files to find the song you want without a LCD screen.  Music quality is the same as any other player on the market.  The cradle/charger/file transfer station is a nice component that uses the earphone hole.  Again, its a bit of an adjustment since it doesn't have LCD screen, but once you are adjusted, you'll find its small size and large clip nice to have if you need your hands while exercising.

<Content>I have the nano as well as this shuffle and the nano just didnt work for me during my runs. So I decided to get something smaller and lighter and this was perfect. I barely feel it on me when I am at the gym using the machines. I don't use my mp3 as storage, more so to listen to my top 50 songs at any given time, so the memory size is fine and I don't need th LCD. I may give up my nano, however, I have a car integration kit that my nano will only work with. So until I can figure something out for the shuffle I will keep both. FYI I got the green, I like my colors bright!

<Content>I own a 30GB iPod Video that I got around this time last year. Which I love. I have been wanting a pink iPod shuffle. I finally managed to talk my husband into to buying me one since we joined a gym this week. I was so eager to get the shuffle ASAP I had it sent over night (which only costed $1.99 since we have PRIME). I was amazed at the fantastic sound quality of the shuffle and how it is light as a feather. This will be great for my workouts at the gym. I tried clipping the shuffle onto the collar of my shirt and I can't even tell it is there.   I did not want to take my iPod Video to the gym because the hard disk might get damaged. To sum up my summary the iPod shuffle is a great investment. Great sound and a great MP3 player for a great low price.

<Content>I own a 30gb iPod with video, which holds all my music, but when I started working out at the gym, I really wanted something smaller that I could have more of an upbeat playlist for.  I went for the iPod shuffle instead of the Nano, because of the very small size of the shuffle and because of the shuffling of songs.  I decided the Nano held too much for what I wanted to use it for, especially when I already have the iPod with video.  I like the fact that the Shuffle has no screen, and it is great to just be able to clip it on to your shirt or pocket, while everyone else has their clunky iPod Nano or iPod with video strapped to their arm.  I love this thing!

<Title>For the price and size you can't beat this...
<Date>Tue Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For years I suffered the slings and arrows of iPod snobbery as I carried around my white Shuffle everywhere.  Shamed and disgraced, I ended up buying an iPod video model recently and discovered something surprising.  The Shuffle is a great deal and easy to use.  I play it more than my top of the line iPod.  I'm a Shuffle fan, and the new one is great!  They are selling out everywhere the minute they come out so grab one now.    The big change here is size and color.  Old Shuffles were the size of a lighter or stick of gum and white plastic : this new aluminum one is tiny and grey metallic.  Will be much more discreet in a pocket or stashed away somewhere on the go.  12 hour battery life isn't so bad, and musical clarity is right up there with the higher end iPods.  A Flash memory drive also means no moving parts and less chance to break down.    The biggest misconception - you CAN PLAY SONGS in order to follow a playlist you designed.  Or you put it in shuffle mode and let it deejay for you.  Controls are easier than the click wheel - just press and play with no turning.  There is no screen, but why would you need it?  This is an iPod for a gym routine, a car commute, or music and podcasts on the fly while you are doing something else.  It is meant to be forgotten about and not futzed with constantly.    I am a proud Shuffle owner, and this great deal just got greater.  More compact, still the same great sound and clarity, and absolutely jog proof.  Awesome way to deejay your entire day.

<Title>For Most People in Most Situations, This is the ONE
<Date>Tue Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When making buying decisions, many people (including myself) focus too much on features and capacity and fail to anticipate what they are actually going to use the product FOR:  During the times when you're away from your computer and want to listen to music, are there really over 10 albums or over 200 singles which you need to be able to listen to on demand?  Because this is the only advantage of the "higher" IPods.  The disadvantages though are numerous.  The Video IPods scratch and skip, because they're not made of metal and they don't make use of flash memory.  They're also too bulky to put into a pants pocket.  The Nano is small enough to go into your pocket but you can't operate it blindly because you need to look at the screen menu and operate the scroll wheel.  Both the Nano and the Video IPod are several times more expensive than the Shuffle.  Yes, with the Video IPod you can watch movies on a tiny screen but how often are you going to do that?  I've come to the conclusion that the IPod Shuffle is all I really need--that and my IMac at home.

<Content>This should fly off the shelves like hot cakes! My first concern was, would the sound quality be compromised when fitting all into a diminutive case?...but rest assured sound quality lives up to ipod expectations. The joy of this ipod is that its presence isn't felt...perfectly snug clipped to the button placket of a shirt, its controls are easy to get used to, even beneath clothing.  The clip is strong and functional enough to rid fears that it might fall off. The headphones have a very tidy small jack and are comfortable to my ears at least, perhaps not delivering the best sound quality in the world, but far from the worst. The play-in-sequence or shuffle features make it great for following a series of podcasts or livening up a familiar album with randomly juxtaposed songs.  Improved itunes software makes the lack of a screen issue less of a problem...so all in all it is a marvel of engineering that brings new levels of comfort for listening to info or music on the go...it might be called revolutionary, not so much because of what it is, but because of what it isn't!

<Content>This device is just cool.  In my opinion it might be the coolest iPod of all.  I love my video iPod, but this will be the one that I use more frequently.  The form factor is genius and this will be the iPod that I constantly have with me for work and exercise.

<Title>It came in today!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We ordered a Shuffle on 9/13, it shipped 10/30 and got here today. The pictures don't do it justice- it's so small and light, and the personalization letters (ordered it from Apple) are &lt;1mm. The redesigned headphones have a bolo-like clip, so you can slide it up all the way to the earbuds and they won't tangle.  The ipod clip back is not too hard to open, but still seems pretty sturdy. I think this is going to be the ideal ipod for many people- at this price point, less than a lot of other 1G players, you get the design and quality of Apple, and itunes. I can see my husband subscribing to a few podcasts, synching them in the morning before he leaves for work  and listening on the drive. The kids will probably get them for Xmas...if they're available again by then!

<Title>Best iPod Ever ......
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After A very hard wait i finally got my ipod shuffle (2nd G) today (nov.2) and i have to say im impressed. on amazon and apple the pictures make it look  tiny but not even close to as small as it actually is. it so lightweight and the clip is a god it goes on the bottom of my shirt or sweatshirt pocket perfectly. plus the new rubber slider on the headphones is a great addition. this is by far the best and most portable mp3 ive ever seen. ive been listening all day and the sound is great.(it actually goes louder than my big iPod). i ordered mine from apple on october the 26th and it came already today. so what if you have to pay an extra $3.47 tax you get a free engraving and don't have to wait till december.

<Title>A miracle in design and functionality. Apple's masterpiece!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As an avid Ipod user, and Apple brand loyalist, I can honestly say that very little surprises me when it comes to the brilliance of Apple products. They are in every sense of the word perfect, and when it comes to design and functionality, they are unrivaled. However, when my Ipod shuffle arrived in the mail this morning, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer beauty and brilliance of this small device. Forget any conceptions you may have regarding the previous generation shuffles, because this is quite possibly the masterpiece Apple has been working towards. Simple, elegant, cool, shiny, beautiful, affordable - there aren't enough words to describe it. Once this little thing is in your palm, you will be in love!   The sound quality this small device can produce is unbelievable, and with the right headphones, you will be in 'sweet-spot' heaven.  Don't think, just buy. It would be almost criminal not to purchase this device!

<Title>The sound quality is not so hot
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got mine yesterday, returning it today. I changed the headphones of course, but the sound quality does not come anywhere close at all to the new Sony S2 Sports Walkman. I like to hear the clarity in the background on vocals and guitars, but with the new shuffle, these sounds blended together and sounded rather dull. I know I will be in the minority here, but if you are open minded and want awesome sound quality, there are far better choices out there.   If one brand is all you have ever tried, one brand is all you will ever know.I admit that it looks great though!  Sony Model in comparison was: Sony NW-S203F 1 GB

<Content>I really like the clip on ipod. I don't even notice it when I'm running. And it actually holds a ton of songs. Battery seems to last pretty long before needing a charge. The pink is so pretty. The only complaint I have is that the white circle thingy (that you use to forward or backup) can get dirty or scratched kind of easy. Also I'm not a big fan of the ipod ear buds. I think the zune ones stay in your ear better. But I would definitely recommend the clip-on shuffle to anyone

I have a 20Gbyte 4G iPod, but it always got bounced around and sometimes skipped.  No problem with a Flash based player.  Like all Apple products, top of the line.

<Title>Flippin' Awesome.
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Originally, after several recommendations, I bought an 8gb non-Apple unit that cost nearly 4 times what the shuffle costs and packed a lot of gimmicky features like movies and text.  It was bulky, bloated, and didn't work as expected.  After a month of use, it wasn't what I wanted so I sold it and bought an iPod shuffle.  First of all, the shuffle is tiny and just looks cool.  Apple knows sexy.  It was hard deciding on a color but I finally settled with green.  The unit is very durable and has a metal exterior.  I haven't had it long but it feels like it could take a real beating.  The clip on the back rocks.  I love being able to clip it anywhere (shirt pocket, jean pocket, sleeve, shorts, wherever).  The clip is metal and well built.  Also, the way the clip is designed, it latches on securely so you don't have to worry about it falling to the ground.  The iPod Shuffle comes with a dock that connects your unit to a computer and charges it at the same time.  It is great not having to worry about long wires.  When I come home at night, I can just set the shuffle in its dock and it will be ready to go again in the morning.  I use Ubuntu Linux and the iPod works well with this operating system.  [If you don't use linux, you can skip this paragraph].  I use gtkPod to transfer files to the shuffle.  Rhythmbox has support for 5th gen shuffles but not 6th gen, at least not yet.  Hopefully this will be fixed in October.  Until then, gtkPod works great and I can easily drag and drop songs from rhythmbox to gtkPod.  Now, for the bad parts.  The audio quality is not nearly as good as the last mp3 player I owned.  It still plays music fine and the ear buds that come with it sound okay.  Don't expect audiophile quality here.  There is a bit of a background hiss at higher volumes when music reaches a quiet or silent part.  I usually listen at low volumes where it is not prevalent anyway.  Even sitting in this perfectly quiet room right now, the hiss is not distinguishable unless I crank up the volume.  I have a feeling most of the people who complain about the hissing are being picky or listen to their music too loud.  Then again, more expensive headphones are also more sensitive and may make the hiss more noticeable.  As I said before, don't expect audiophile quality here.  If you are the type of person who buys $60 ear buds because you need perfect audio, this range of player is not for you anyway.  This has been brought up before: How do I charge the unit if I am traveling?  For the price of the shuffle, I wouldn't expect too many accessories.  I have found AC adapters online so that is an option if you need to charge the unit away from home.  My biggest complaint: This player doesn't support ogg or flac.  However, my library is all mp3s because the stereo in my car doesn't support ogg or flac either.  I would love to make the switch to an open format such as ogg and hate that companies like Apple tie me in to proprietary codecs like mp3 and aac.  Oh well, I guess I'm a sucker.  Overall, this player rocks.  I absolutely recommend it.  And if you don't like iTunes or use linux like me, there are third party applications that will get the job done.  If you want something that just plays music and does a good job of it without all the junk, this player is for you.  I am the biggest minimalist you will ever meet; I love it when things just work how they are supposed to without excess.  I don't want a camera on my cell phone and don't want movies on my mp3 player.  So, the iPod Shuffle and I are a perfect match.

<Title>Just the right amount of music
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After much contemplation and trying to decide exactly which MP3 player I wanted, I chose the iPod Shuffle, and am very happy with my selection. I use it during work (8 hrs) and my commute to and from (45-50 min each way) and find it holds charge for 2 and a-half days worth of listening. I wasn't sure that it would hold enough music, but in 2 days, I only get a few repeats, and I only have it loaded to about half-capacity. Hot pink was my color choice, but I would be just as happy with it in any other color.

<Content>It's tiny, it's pretty, it's cool. The only downside as I see it: it cannot sync with itunes to update podcasts. You have to do this manually. Given that it's supposed to be portable, this is just a huge design flaw. I use it for workout, but having to spend 15 minutes to drag podpasts to it manually every time I use it is such a huge pain. I think I'll have to get another ipod that can sync.

<Content>this little mp3 player is great. i dropped it a few months ago into a glass of gatorade i took it out immediately and let it dry out for a day or two. and it still works like it did out of the box.  when the switch is on shuffle, the songs will literally play randomly. what i mean by this is that it will play the same song two or three times before it gets halfway through your playlist. thats why i gave it 4 stars. this problem is easily fixed by putting it on loop.  the clip on it is very strong  i would suggest getting the travel dock for it.

In general a good product. The only reason that the product is not given five stars is that it could use a better/more durable clip on the back. The one that it has is nice but could be a little tougher.

<Content>Ever have your stride thrown off balance because of a clunky mp3 player hanging on to your arm?  Ever have problems with the sport band of your mp3 player not actually fitting your upper arm?  Well the shuffle is absolutely amazing for longer distance running.  It doesn't throw off your stride and can fit nicely on your shirt.  Some people have problems that it doesn't show the songs, but it you are running you don't want to be always scrolling for songs anyway.

<Title>Great Sound From a Rugged, Light, and Simple MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I actually purchased this device to give away in a contest but I couldn't resist seeing how it sounded. My first purchase of an Apple product ended up surprising me in almost every way.   The well packaged device comes with picture-based instructions which I didn't use. I looked through the plastic case and found the tiny dock, headphones, and the thin mp3 player which is the size of a large postage stamp. Plugging it into my laptop, the device was instantly recognized. Preferring not to install Apple's ITunes, I used the open source solution for Ubuntu Linux to load a few ripped CD's onto the device and then I let it charge for about three hours.   After I put the comfortable ear buds in and hitting play, I was amazed. The sound quality and output from this tiny device hit all but the most complicated highs and lows, the stereo perception was balanced, and the level of bass was the closest to optimum I've ever come across without having to tweak (fortunate since there isn't an apparent way to make adjustments).   It's been a few months since I purchased the Shuffle and it has gone through quite a bit as it comes with me on hikes, morning workouts, and every other place I tend to go. There are some scratches on the surface but other than that, this thing has taken quite a few beatings with no ill effects noticed. It has dropped into the Puget Sound and it still worked after I let it dry over night. The biggest thing though is that on occasions where it fell out of my pocket and dangled from just the mini connector - the player didn't fall.

<Title>A great little MP3 player
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device is almost perfect for my needs.  I use it when I am running, so the lack of a screen is a non issue.  The size is perfect.  The clip was an excellent idea.  The storage capacity is more than adequate.  Since it synchs with your Itunes playlists when you are charging it, you don't realy need anything more than 1GB because it is unlikely you will have listened to all the songs on it before your next synch.  I only have two minor issues with it.  The first is song volumes.  Since it shuffles between songs from different artists, the volume on different songs can sometimes be quite different.  It would be great if there were a feature that would level out all those volumes since when I'm running it's kind of a pain to change the volume.  Second, the headphones don't handle songs with loud bass very well.  Then again, not many earbuds do.  Again, these two things are minor complaints, and I have been very satisfied with the Shuffle.

<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little player is so portable and rugged, it's amazing!  Sound quality is as good as any iPod I've tried and it's nearly indestructable, as long as you don't get it wet or walk on it. This player clips securely to your shirt pocket, belt, sleeve, knapsack, bookbag, etc. It's easy to use, and while lacking some functionality, it's great for listening to music, e-books or lectures while you run, walk, commute or exercise. No hard drive means an accidental drop won't kill the player, no skips during playback and working with iTunes or Windows Media Player is a snap. You can even transfer data files to the iPod since it appears as a removable drive in Windows when you connect it using the USB dock.  While you can't manage the order of songs on this little wonder, you can choose to play songs in their alphabetical order or randomly. The controls are well made and appear to be able to stand up to a lot of use (unlike the knock-off shuffle I first purchased off eBay) and the battery life is very long (10-12 hours).

You need a computer to charge it, but as the battery lasts enough that's not a problem. I have experimented some issues with the syncing, just disconnect and reconnect again. You have to carry the special dock to charge/sync.

Buying it from Apple you can get free engraving on it which is a nice touch.  Around 250 songs can be added so for adults that is often enough. Teens like more songs but my daughter still prefers this smaller one for exercising and all the songs are picked for exercising.

Needles to say, it is insanely durable.   It was my first iPod, and I recently bought a 30G video iPod. I'll still use this for working out, running/jogging, camping trips, etc. It's very useful.  I really do recommend that if you're looking for a small, cheap, tough, and well-designed mp3 player, you should get this one. Thanks for reading.

My new Shuffle is so versatile- it's basially a clip, so it can clip on your sleeve, the bottom of your shirt- wherever!  No more constricting arm bands or lanyards that bounce around all over the place!  Also, Apple has kept it simple- still user-friendly with no big changes to any of the software or the controls.  It has a bigger storage capacity, and if you're an addict like me, you know that you can fill it up faster than you ever thought!  A durable lil guy, mine has been dropped more than a couple times now and you'd never even know it.  The price is right, and it can really go anywhere. The only complaint I could ever have about my shuffle is that it is so small, I worry I might lose it!  It hasn't happened yet, though. I would recommend this as a starter iPod or as an accessory for the gym for anyone!

<Content>I bought an Ipod Video to have all my music and videos with me, but I have realize it's not recommendable to take you Ipod Video to Jog/Gym/Walk, because you can damage the Hard Disc.....So this is the best Option if you already have the Ipod Video or some other portable HD, is tiny, is fashion, its a memory, and wont fall out that easy (it has a SUPER CLIP)

<Title>It's nice and compact.
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It works great.  I bought this specifically for running and working out.  I use a 30g Ipod for everything else.  The shuffle is perfectly compact and I downloaded only the songs I wanted for running/working out which is all I need and there's still plenty of space for more songs.  If you're looking for more, you'll need to buy a Nano or video Ipod.  Otherwise, this is a bare bones, simplistically styled, compact mp3 player and perfect for the person on the go who needs no fancy options--just play, pause, FF/RWD, shuffle, volume control and an on/off switch.  There are a couple other multi-function button options like pressing play/pause 3 times in non-shuffle mode and the playlist will restart from the first song.  Again, this is bare bones so you can't make a playlist.  If you can't live without playlists, then upgrade to an Ipod with more functions.  If you have big, manly hands, I'd recommend trying one of these out at your local electronics retailer first.  It is compact, so a test run might save you some frustration.  One drawback of this thing is that they only include a USB charger.  Typical Ipod makes you buy accessories it should include.  Anyways, this is only an issue if you won't have access to a PC when you travel. There's no wall outlet charger included so if you must have one, I'd recommend a DLO 008-7546 PowerBug for the Shuffle 2G or any other if some other company manufactures them. [...].  --Update:  The wall-charger that I use for my Ipod video also works with the Ipod Shuffle.  So, no need to buy a PowerBug if you already have the Ipod wall-charger.  You can plug the USB-plug included with the Shuffle into the Ipod wall-charger and it charges fine.   If you're a runner or fitness guru, I'd also recommend the DLO 008-1619 Action Jacket for the Shuffle 2G.  It was the hands free solution I needed.

<Title>Sweat ruins iPod Shuffles
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> I would love everything about the new iPod EXCEPT that I use it to go running (about 1 hour at a time) and the normal sweat from my body gets into the jack and ruins it.    I had to replace my 1st generation iPOD 3 times due to sweating on it. The store clerk kept saying it wasn't made to be sweated on. But I would say the #1 use of any iPOD is for exercise.    i thought the new design would fix the problem but it hasn't.  I need to get a new on after 2 weeks of running with it.  The next one I will have to wrap in plastic and kept in in a pouch away from my body to kept it from getting sweat on it.

<Content>PROS: The G2 IPod Shuffle is so small and light weight, it is astounding.  Just clip it on and go - you almost forget about it. Even better is the rechargeable battery.    CONS: No battery meter.  Even in iTunes, where it will tell you how much space you've used, there's no battery usage - so you're alwasy charging and guessing.  However, the battery does last for several hours.

<Content>At age 46 I'm thoroughly enjoying my first excursion into 21st century audio technology.  I'm amazed how easy it was to load music onto the Shuffle from CDs and iTunes.  Have used it on walks, at the gym, in the car, doing errands...even lying in bed fighting a bout of insomnia.    PLUSES  + Sound quality + Convenience + User friendly (even for those like me with little tech savvy) + Value ($75-80 for 1 GB capacity) + The intangible 'fun factor'  MINUSES  - Quality of the volume control mechanism needs to be improved. The not insignificant annoyance factor here costs the Shuffle a 5th star.

<Title>So far, a great little gadget
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this because I travel a lot, and I walk a lot. I like having music with me. I got the blue colored one, and it is attractive looking, very tiny and clips easily onto the pocket of my jeans or anywhere else I want it. The sound is good. It is easy to load. I have had no problems choosing what music I put on it, though I know some reviewers have had problems. It does have an "Autoload" feature which it defaults to the first time you turn it on. That could be the source of confusion. I have 187 songs on it currently, but I have pretty bloated files. Someone mentioned that iTunes has a conversion thing for Shuffle which I plan to try. The price is not too expensive and I think it is priced well for what it is. The small size of the Shuffle has made my multi-mile walks and frequent travel more convenient for music.   I am thinking of getting shuffles for my bridesmaids as a gift at my wedding this winter.   The only negative is of course that there is no screen, which is annoying but I knew it would be annoying before I bought it.

<Content>Wow!  The size of this thing makes all the difference.  It's extremely light with a very strong clip built in, so you can clip it to your hat when you work out, put the wires in the hat, and then you have no wires hanging down to get tangled up in.  Or clip it to your shirt and you won't even know it is there.  Even though the Shuffle is very small, the navigation buttons are plenty big for finding with your fingers without looking during a run.  And the area on the front that isn't covered by the navigation button - just happens to be where you grab it to squeeze the built in clip.  Perfect.  Someone really thought this device through.  For working out, nothing else comes close.

You don't have to hold it in your hand or worry that it'll drop out of your pocket, just clip it on and you're set to go. I have it on right now as I type. The only thing I may invest in is another set of earphones, though these are really fine for my purpose.

This is practically weightless and clips on to clothing and doesn't let go. I just love it.

<Content>Well this is the perfect mp3 player if you want a slick, cool one that will give you lots of music to play with but won't get in your way. So unless you are one of those guys who spends half of his life architecting their music compilations, this is a good buy. Only down side (besides the exaggerated price) is the subpar earphones that ship with it, and the fact that you are stuck with using the horrible ITunes program. This ITunes - Ipod forceful binding reminds me of the Windows- Explorer one.. another classical example of uncle Bill's way of "doing business".

It is so small it also is out of the way when lifting weights. The only problem I have with it is remembering to turn it off! Then it has to be recharged but that is the other cool things. NO BATTERIES to buy! I use to carry spare batteries in my gym bag b/c I always forget to turn my mp3 players off! This is my first apple product and I love it. I want and iPhone now!

<Content>I have the video iPod, nano and the shuffle.  The shuffle is my favorite. It's cute, compact and portable. The sound is great. I don't have a problem with the headphones. 240 songs is about 150 more than I need.  About the only issue I've found is that cases for the shuffle are hard to find. I like the Agent 18 cover with earbuds holder.  The rhino skins (4 colors) are okay but they don't cover the back. I also have the green shuffle so the rhino skins aren't that great (they'd be good if you have the silver shuffle).  The Agent 18 is a clear cover so it doesn't hide the green and it's still protected.

<Content>The Shuffle comes in a variety of shades - blue, pink, green, orange, and a silver color. My green Shuffle matches the various shades of green I have in the d�cor of my studio. Because it added such ambience to the room, I left it in the cute plastic display case for two days. On day three, I removed the Shuffle and displayed it proudly on my shirt, a green shirt. I wore it for a few hours around the neighborhood. See, I wasn't scared, just a tad bit nervous of delving into a new world. I'm a PC kind of girl and this is my first ever "Apple" product. I had questions. Did I have to have a Mac? Did my best friend, who gave it to me as a present, misunderstand and think I already had a Mac?  It didn't matter. I found out you can use the Shuffle on a PC or a Mac. The hardest thing about the Shuffle was getting it out of the package. It was encased in this thick plastic package that was no match for a butter knife, in the end, it was a pair of wire cutters from my husband's tool collection that set my new musical device free.  The Shuffle came with a bright white docking station and ear buds. Now, I've yet to master the art of keeping ear buds in my ears, so I opted to use my SONY MDR-A35 headphones. A perfect fit. While I was charging the Shuffle, I downloaded the latest version of the iTunes library for free! Thank you!  After that, I started downloading my CDs onto my laptop. Now, in the past I've downloaded a CD or two to burn or to transfer to my MP3 player (Napster), but I never downloaded my entire collection. I didn't see the point; I mean I already have them in nice square plastic cases alphabetically organized by genre. Wow, I didn't know what I had been missing.  The iTunes library did everything for me and when the Shuffle was charged, it was just a matter of copying some of my favorite tunes to my own playlist.  I will tell you that I found I had more CDs than space on my new Shuffle, but that's fine with me. I can't even begin to listen to 240 songs at one time. That is about what my Shuffle seems to hold. I love it! It is so small and the clip fits anywhere.   Shuffle is the perfect name. It will take your songs and play them randomly, or you can have the Shuffle play your songs in order. The only down side I have found is that you have no way to read titles and you only have one play list. But . . . I love that the middle button is very easy to use to navigate through your songs and control the volume. The clip is sturdy and the outside casing seems very resilient.  Also, as an extra bonus, I can listen to my Shuffle with my Harman Kardon Soundsticks II 3-Piece Plug and Play Multimedia Speaker System by JBL. The jack that fits into my laptop also fits into my Shuffle. Awesome!  So, I've transferred my entire CD collection to my laptop and I will rotate the songs on my Shuffle every few weeks. My husband gave me an iTunes Music Store card so I can by any new CDs I might want. I have no excuse to keep those cute plastic squares filled with silver discs, but more than likely I will. I'm sentimental that way.

<Title>Magnific little thing
<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the gray iPod Shuffle a few months ago, and enjoyed every part of it until someone stole it last week.  Excellent sound, very easy operation, and durability. Nice price for the capacity and design.   For doing things like working out, going to work, or travelling to a near city, you can't go wrong. For many many people who buy bigger ipods, this is actually what they need, not a bigger device. I've had nanos and videos, but it wasn't until I got the new shuffle that I really listened to my favorite music constantly. Think about it, deep inside what your iEars may be really expecting is to hear your REAL favorite tunes all the time... and that's the equivalent of like.. 150, 200, 250 songs?? For most of normal consumers, this is enough. Now if you really really want to have with you all the time your ENTIRE collection, and you really NEED it, then you should look for the more gigas.   The only con? mmmm.. maybe for it being so small, it got stolen! No, seriously, it's a great little thing. For PC people, iTunes-only compatibility may be a stress factor, for me it was ok.   I don't regret having buying it, and definitely would get it again.

<Title>The overlooked gem in Apple's line-up!
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned many player's over the years. Sony, Creative, and Apple.  The Shuffle is my favorite of them all!  Yes I do need to carry my entire library with me but it is not practical.(I own a 80GB iPod).  The shuffle is one I carry everywhere I go.  The sound is very good and I think it sounds better than the bigger iPods but, not as good as a Mini Disc or Sony DAP. The clip makes it so you can attach it to anything; hats, pants, shirts, bra's, or the collar of an undershirt for discrete listening.  It is tough, hell I washed it one time, and it doesn't get in the way when I do things. I a pinch I have used it to copy files.  I plays all day long a I never have to listen to the same song.  When I travel I use it to go to sleep and doesn't get in the way of sleeping.  If you don't have a large collection you might consider this over any other player.  If you need to see what you are listen to get another player or put song's on the shuffle that you know.  The Shuffle is easy to manage and work with, physically and with iTunes.

<Title>Favorite iPod
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We have numerous iPod's in our family, the video iPod, mini, old shuffle among them.  While the big iPod is good as the main household music library and is used w/stereo and in the car on long trips, I got this to work out with since I didn't want to use a big armband w/the big iPod. And I have fallen in love with this little jewel.  It clips so easily to everything, weighs next to nothing so you don't even notice it's on.  Running with it is perfect. Doesn't get in the way if you happen to fall asleep with it on. It has great battery life and is almost indestructible. The clip has perfect grip, nice and firm but doesn't ruin clothing/fabric. Love using it for music and works great with audiobooks as well, since it book marks where you left off last. In fact, we got a second one so the kids could take it to camp, etc. cause it travels so well. Well made, functional & cool...it deserves some kind of design award. This is a great little addition to the family for those with bigger iPods.

<Title>100% Satisfaction
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased the Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle AAC/MP3 Player Metal (2nd Generation) and have to say I am 100% satisfied. This little thing (and I do mean little) is fantastic. It will hold 240 mp3's and is so lightweight you can clip it anywhere or even just let it hang around your neck from the earbuds wire. It sounds great too. It took me about 20 min to add 150 songs through the I-tunes software. I would recommend this to anyone.

<Title>Letting a five-year-old use it
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sound crazy?  Maybe, but here is the logic - a rugged, "kidproof" version available in several places has many drawbacks.  The most glaring drawback was the battery usage - the kidproof versions I found took AAA batteries.  The shuffle charges through the USB connection.  The shuffle also doesn't have a fancy screen that can get cracked or broken.  Even better is the built in clip.  The sound doesn't suffer either - my oldest daughter has a 30gb Ipod and the sound quality is comparable.  There is enough space with 1gb of space that my wife can put a playlist on there to use when she works out as well.  The kidproof versions offered only 256 or 512mb of space, and that's for the same price I paid for the shuffle.  All around, it's been a no brainer decision all around for us.

<Title>Good system ruined by iTunes
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is great, don't get me wrong.  I owned the original version (the gum pack size unit) along with this one, but the overall idea is ruined by a couple of factors:  * It's iTunes or nothing.  Fat chance you can load anything on this puppy without iTunes doing the work.  Got music at work on your Microsoft Media Player?  Too stinkin' bad. * If you get rid of the iPod (like I did, only because of iTunes) and opt to uninstall iTunes, you'll soon find out the iTunes is holding your music hostage.  I found this out after uninstalling iTunes.  My Media Player couldn't retrieve the music even though I had purchased the tunes legitimately outside of the iTunes system.  Until Apple gets rid of the iTune requirement, I plan to look elsewhere.

<Content>I didn't need an mp3 player that holds 10,000 songs like my teenagers do, just something that I can put a variety of music on for when I go to the gym, etc. It's also very easy to change out the music you have on it if you need to - especially since I'm sitting in front of my computer all day anyway. I also purchased a Belkin item that plugs into the Shuffle and into the cassette deck in my car which plays the songs - excellent quality.

<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ipod shuffle is pretty cool. I like it because unlike most ipod, this one clips onto your clothes. For the other ipods you usually have to buy a case. It's also small so I can fit it in my purse and it's not heavy so I don't ever feel it when I'm wearing it. I got the color pink, and at first I was afraid of what it was going to look like, but I like how vibrant the color is. The space on this ipod is limited compare to the others, but I was able to put a little bit over 250 songs on it. If you think you need more space, I would say to buy one of the bigger ipods. All in all, I would recommend it to a friend because it does what I need it to do and that's listening to music.

<Title>IPOD Shuffle reviewed
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Very nice small MP3 player. It has a very nice quality look to it (I purchased the silver one). The earbuds do not fit my ears real well. They take a little "configuring" each time I use them to get them "situated" just right in my ears. They also sound a lot better (more bass) if you keep your fingers pushing them in as you listen. Other than the slightly less than perfect earbuds, the only other things you might beware of is that is has no display and, as far as I know, the shuffle does not "plug into" any MP3 players, etc., like the IPOD Nano and other IPOD's do. Definitely if you are looking for a "no frills" MP3 player that is somewhat inexpensive and is definitely small (slightly larger than a postage stamp), this is the one for you! Craig

<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are new to the MP3 player technology, this is NOT, I repeat, NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR YOU.  This player is only for those who already own and use an MP3 player.  This is important because the Shuffle has no labels and its small size (book of matches) necessetates your finger instinctively jumping to the "Forward" or "Back" button as it is too small to see.  Also, there are no song labels so you pretty much have to either know what you have downloaded, be willing to scroll through or frequently change the songs.  Regardless, this was my first MP3 player and I still have yet to figure out how to use it.

<Content>Oh Pink iPod Shuffle, let me count the ways I love thee:  1) You don't break down as often as your predecessor, the gumstick Shuffle. 2) You weigh very little. 3) Your clip is very strong and works for securing onto a cap. 4) The buds are an improvement versus the previous iPods. 5) The little USB thingy to recharge and sync is extremely cool.  OK, now seriously, this Shuffle is recommendable for those that really want to take their iPod outside and forget that they are wearing an MP3 player. Its form factor is convenient and the buttons take little time to master. Its premium over other players with similar capacity is well worth it.

<Content>  What more could you ask for?    Every feature on this little ipod is not only usable and convenient, it's aesthetically pleasing as well. There's no fumbling for the play/pause button, and the surrounding volume controls and track selectors are just as accessible. There's also an on/off, which relieves any concern of accidentally hitting play and running down your battery.     And, Oh, that battery! I've had this since day one of its release in October, and the battery has consistently lasted through several days at high volume (I average about 2hrs of use per day).     I do everything imaginable with my shuffle: Run, lift weights, fly, and run some more! I haven't had a single problem, and the clip has held tight through every activity, rigorous or otherwise.    The bottom line: It's the perfect MP3 player: Simple, durable, and Super! Get yours today!

<Title>Amazing Little Machine
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved the First Generation iPod Shuffle, which I bought in March 2006, but this one is even better.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with my old Shuffle, but when I saw this 2nd Gen version, I said, "I'm in!"  The only thing I didn't like about the 1st Gen was its lack of a good way to attach it to clothing, belt, etc.  I use my iPod mostly at the gym, and since I walk briskly on the treadmill, the Shuffle was always bouncing around at the end of the lanyard.  I finally found an arm band made for it...that's the other problem with the Shuffle:  lack of accessories...but after 45 minutes or so of a brisk workout, it made my arm sweat and irritated my skin.  So the addition of the clip to the 2nd Gen model made it a no-brainer for me.  And it's been worth every penny!  If you don't care about all the bells and whistles on the larger-capacity, higher-priced models, this is a great choice.  And Apple has doubled its capacity but only increased the price $10...not bad for a great little machine.

<Content>I own a Nano and a Shuffle.  Both work great.  But, only my Nano allows me to load multiple playlists.  On the other hand, the Shuffle is super light weight, and easier to use at the gym.  I have to use a "holder" in order to use my Nano at the gym, but thats ok because I like have more options...like deciding where in my playlist I'm going to start my workout.  Bottom line, both are great -- just understand that each has its limiting characteristics.  Word.

<Content>I've had the 2nd Gen Shuffle for a month. Use it primarly for running. Clip it to the back of my hat, with my Sennheiser neck band ear buds, and I'm good to go. The recharge light does eventually turn green, but it may take a reset for it to work properly. Apple iTunes is awesome. I'm an Apple convert. My only other MP3 player is my Palm. I only wish they made a 2-4 GB version.  I'm consistently wiping down the iPod after my workouts to prevent salt accumulation. So hopefully, it will hold up. Definitely recommend this.

<Content>This is so far the best mp3 player I have used - and my first ipod. I am very satisfied with the sound quality-I recommend using it with a good pair of headphones. It is so small and light that you forget you are carrying it. The clip fits perfectly,the controls are very easy and file transfer is fast. It works so nice with itunes, just plug it in and it takes care of the rest. The only disadvantage I can think of is the absence of an fm tuner but I never listen to radios on mp3 players so that wasnt a problem for me. I certainly recommend ipod shuffle.

<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had an early iPod and liked it but the hard disk died out of warranty.  I learned that all the iPods (other than this own) use a hard disk.  This uses flash memory which makes it much more durable.  If you are running, biking or hiking with your player or if you're prone to drop it, consider the shuffle.  If it had a menu and allowed you to select songs individually, it would be perfect.

<Title>Great little MP3 player
<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Am really pleased with my Shuffle. First of all it seems almost indestructible, the aluminum casing looks great and gives the Shuffle a sturdy feel. It's compact and the clip is really useful. And there are other software options than iTunes, I actually use Winamp to autofill the Shuffle. Holds about 160 songs, but I encode my MP3s at a pretty high bitrate so that is to be expected.  My only gripe would be that it seems kind of expensive for what you get (a screen-less 1GB player). The Creative Zen Stone, for example, has basically the same features and is half the price. Also a small gripe, as it doesn't really bug me but may bother others. With certain headphones the Shuffle's low SNR becomes apparent. I recently picked up a pair of IEMs for use with the Shuffle and because of the isolation background static noise can be heard that couldn't with the stock earbuds. You can only really hear it with the player on but paused, though; once music is playing at any appreciable volume noise is for the most part drowned out. As mentioned though it's not a big issue for me. Probably unavoidable when dealing with a player this compact, so can't really fault Apple's engineers for this.

This is a very good, and rather affordable product for what usage it gets. although it has a click wheel for changing songs, and you can not select one single song to play because of the lack of screen, it is still a great item. If you are not a die-hard music lover, but still you like to listen to it, I reccomend this device. Very convenient for road trips and the such, and filling boring hours has never been so much fun!

<Title>Works great, but it's a little too small
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I know most people using this iPod want it to be really small, but it has been a problem for me a few times.  We bought it for my 6 year old son because it's very easy for him to control.  He can use it like it's second nature, so that's great.  But it's so small he tends to misplace it.  We've thought it was lost several times, only to have it show up in an odd drawer or between the couch cushions.  If you're using it while you exercise, the form factor is probably perfect, but in our case it's been a little less than perfect.  The older shuffle that was a little bigger would have been better for us, but who wants to buy yesterday's gear?  As with any iPod, the headphones that come with it are garbage.  Throw them away as soon as you open it and get some new ones.  Even $20 will get you a much better experience.  And, of course, try to use AAC instead of MP3 to rip your music.

<Title>Great design, terrible hissing problem
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really wanted to like this thing.  I love its size, its design, and its functionality.  However, I can't get over the constant background hissing noise.  You can't hear the hiss with the earbuds that come bundled with the shuffle, but it's quite audible with any high-end (high fidelity, low impedance, noise isolating) earbuds, like my Ultimate Ears super.fi 5Pro.  If you're planning on using this ONLY when you work out, it'll be fine because you won't notice the hiss when you're in the gym pumping iron or running in Central Park.  However, if you plan to listen to it in the office or in any sort of quiet environment, the background hissing noise will drive you nuts (again, only if you use high quality earphones).  And at this price, I'd expect something more than a workout-only audio player.  When I tried to bring this issue to the rep at a nearby Apple store, they refused to admit that anything was wrong with the player.  Below are excerpts from my posts in the Apple forums about this experience:  [Posted: Jun 5, 2007 10:31 AM] Glad to see I'm not the only one hearing the hiss on the shuffle, but also quite disappointed that this seems to be a problem with all shuffles and not just a bad batch. I was thinking of going to the apple store and asking for a replacement, but if this is a problem with all shuffles out there, then I don't know if it's worth the trouble.  [Posted: Jun 5, 2007 12:59 PM] I just got back from the Apple store. I explained the problem to the guy there and asked if I could get a replacement, bet he told me instead to schedule a meeting with one of their techs. I'm not sure how much good will come out of it, but I went ahead and scheduled a meeting for tomorrow. I'll post the results of the meeting tomorrow.  [Posted: Jun 6, 2007 1:34 PM] Well, I'm back from the "meeting" with the "apple tech." It was totally useless. I don't know why they didn't take a look at it immediately yesterday, since today all the tech did was listen to my shuffle with the default Apple earbuds in the middle of the noisy Apple store, tell me that he didn't hear any hiss and so they wouldn't do anything about it. Well of course you won't hear the hiss with the cheap Apple earphones, and especially not in the middle of a noisy store. I asked him if I could try my UEs with one of their demo shuffles, and he said no because they weren't plugged in, and I guess it was too much work for him to plug them in for me. So in the end, I just wasted an hour (driving to/from the store and waiting in line) for nothing. :(  [continued...] I'm pretty ticked off right now. How could this issue go unnoticed by QC, or maybe they did notice it but decided not to do anything about it? At $80 for a 1 GB mp3 player with no screen, you'd expect at least decent audio quality. Even my 7 year old Rio has better sound quality than this thing. Sigh, I don't want to get into a rant here... I guess I'll just return the thing and suck up the shipping charges.

<Title>I use it all the time!
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>About a year ago, I bought the iPod 80GB and love it.  However, it's not very convenient when going running, walking, through the airport security, or any other place besides in the palm of your hand.    That is why I love the ipod shuffle.  It clips onto anything, giving you a free hand.  No more silly armbands.  Yes it's only 512MB, but that's perfect for an hour's walk, jog, plane trip or anything.  Best of all, it's the size of a quarter.  I hate to admit it, but I rarely use my iPod 80gb anymore.  It now just acts as storage for my itunes library.  The iPod shuffle is like the 'greatest hits' (which is used 99% of the time).

<Title>Great player for running and walking to work
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>SUMMARY:  *PROS* - integrates perfectly with iTunes - simple - light - plenty of space for regular listening  *CONS* - could be a touch less expensive, though better than the first generation - doesn't have a screen, but I'm surprisingly okay with that  *NOTE*   When I got the shuffle, I only had USB1.1 ports on my computer.  This takes considerable time to reload music, which is something that I want to do fairly regularly with this type of player (for example, I have a different running mix than standard listening mix).  Now I have a USB 2.0 connection (through a powered PCI card) and changing my music content only take a few minutes max (for reloading the entire 1gb).   UNNECESSARILY VERBOSE VERSION:  Now for the longwinded, imprecise review because I spend too much time thinking about even mundane electronics purchases.  When the first iPod shuffle came out, I was somewhat skeptical about what the merits were of buying a screenless "ipod," particularly at it's near ipod mini price at the time.  Since that time, I have gotten a 20gb ipod photo, which I use regularly at the gym, and occasionaly in other cases (music is indispensible at the gym).  However, I have started running outside, and no matter what way you cut it, the standard ipods are a bit on the bulky side.  Now, my given the realization that while at the gym I rarely look at the screen (mostly just leave it on shuffle and occasionally fumble around to change tracks or the volume), my aversion to the shuffle lessoned considerably.  I then tried my girlfriend's newly purchased 1st generation shuffle one day at the gym, and loved it. Since I had some gift certificates to amazon, I took the plunge and got the shuffle.  It was an excellent decision.  It can hold far more music than I could possibly need at any one time, and it's battery life has never been an issue.  Its sound is quite good (not amazing, but quite good).  It is extremely convenient and lightweight to carry around or clip on when going running.  And its last major selling point over other flash players that I was considering is that it integrates seemlessly with itunes (where I have all of my music, including some purchased from their store, which I can't play on pretty much any other player).  I find that to be a general nusence.  But given that that's where I am, and that I really like iTunes, an Apple product has a significant edge over others to me.  In my mind, if the player was about half it's current price, it would be a no-brainer 5 stars.  But given that I got it with gift certificates, and that it is still quite good, I'll let that slide for now.

<Content>Hello, I've just received my new ipod shuffle mp3 player and I just love it, I strongly recommend it for those looking for simplicity and quality sound when it comes to enjoy your musical experience. The pros I see in this ipod it's overall that it has the perfect size, a great sound quality and volume capacity, outstanding portability - once you wear it you can't put it away :)-, finally the size it's also cool of 1 GB, because if you really think about it, for what do you really need huge space if you're probably be listening only to your top favorite songs anyway. I'm not an expert in mp3s but I'm a very satisfied client, so if you ask me it's the best one to buy now.  Arturo

The Shuffle is a TREMENDOUS value for the price, and is very convenient to wear, particularly for fitness.  ITunes software was easy to download and install and has many "smart" features.

<Date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my husband after his 1G shuffle quit keeping a charge (after zillions of hours of use). He loves it! I think the little built-in clip is a great idea, although he says he usually just keeps it in his pocket. Great colors, he loves the electric blue, but the orange looks fabulous too. It's also a great bargain! Even includes the cradle, which retails for over 30 bucks alone.

<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this iPOD for a very reasonable price, the PROS: Small, light, cheap, long last battery and fast music search. the NEG: You must use itunes, not too much memory (1GB, its OK for the size but still low), there is no way to know the number of the track that you are listening. Is a very good choice if you want to do exercises without that extra bag for the big iPOD.

<Title>Ipod Shuffle a godsend....
<Date>Tue May 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have wanted one of these for quite some time, but the high cost of any Ipod has kept me from buying one--so when I found the shuffle for only $79 I decided to try it and am very pleased with this Ipod.  I researced many other brands and types , but felt I wanted to go with a company that I could trust.  The only thing I don't like about the shuffle is that sometimes in my job(where i use it most) I am putting things away and lean the wrong way and accidentally push the button on the shuffle and change channels...this would not be a problem if i were only listening to music, but it messes me up when I am listening to podcasts.  It would be nice if there was a FF button, but I just am more careful not to lean too far forward...I would recommend this to anyone who loves music and also loves listening to Coast to Coast am, but who can't stay up late to hear it...this helps me stay informned.  Great little machine--still can't believe something so small can hold so much!

<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this iPod to load a spoken copy of a book to take on a trip.  The book was approximately 8-1/2 hours long.  I screwed up a couple of times, and had to start over; so I was worried about having enough battery, since I had no way to recharge.  No problem!  It ran whenever I wanted it, fast forwarded when I screwed up, and was as loud at the end as when I started. What more could I ask?

<Title>So glad I got it!
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted to treat myself to a new toy and at first I couldn't decide between the shuffle and the nano.  I had just about decided on the nano when I thought that if I'm going to spend that kind of money, I should just go ahead and get the video ipod.  So I finally settled on getting my feet wet with the shuffle.  I'm so glad I got it.  I'm getting to listen to all these CDs that were just sitting in a box in my basement.  Since I teach kindergarten I don't have the opportunity to listen to music while I'm working, and my commute is only about 5 minutes.  But now I'm listening again!  The shuffle is so small I can wear it while I'm outside with my own kids, and don't tell anyone, but I even had it on in one ear during recess duty today.  And I LOVE the opportunity to buy the one song you want on iTunes instead of buying the whole album that I'll never listen to.  It's been easy to load the songs I want from my own CDs into the shuffle.  I think I've only got it about half full, but there is more music in the basement, and I'm keeping a running list of songs I want to buy.

<Content>This has to be the coolest gizmo I've seen. Purchased 2 of these little babies - one for myself and one for hubby. Now we can listen to our own kinds of music wherever we go.  Only two minor complaints to speak of. First, there are really no directions for downloading music and if you are Apple-illiterate (as I am) then this becomes difficult. Would help if there was a short guide included for us PC users. Easiest way I found to obtain directions was to go to the Apple website. Also, the earbuds seem tiny to me although they are quite powerful. I have a problem getting them to stay put in my ears. This, however, is something that I can rectify by buying another type of earphone.   Overall, the ipod Shuffle (2nd generation) is worth every penny and then some. The music comes through crystal clear! The tiny docking station (included) hooks up easily and is easy to use once you get the directions.  I would recommend this item to anyone who is a first-time ipod/mp3 user.

<Content>I recently got this item for my sister back in India. The product is really cool, especially the size - very compact. But you don't have any control other than turning the shuffle on or off. If you really want to select songs u wanna ply, you have to go for players with a display and to fit into a &lt;100$ budget - u definitely cannot choose apple. Also the left ear phone produces some crackling sound often which is annoying at times. But I don't know if the warranty would hold good in India. So if u r buying this for someone overseas, think twice ... check the product if its absolutely fine before sending it over.

The only thing I hate is the ear buds, they fall out of my ears all the time and its not the most convenient to be running or walking with it and holding the ear buds in, looks a bit strange. If the earphones were made to fit inside the ear like a hearing aid, it may work better. I replaced the earphones the 1st day of trying it out. Other than that, I love my pink shuffle!

<Title>GREAT
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second Ipod, and I love it.  It is unsafe to run/exercise with the larger Ipods with the big hard drives.  I have gone through a couple of those because the moving jostles the hard drive.  The shuff (and the nano) have flash drives, so you can bump them around more and they'll still work.  Plus the little clip feature on the new shuffle makes it ver convenient in the gym.

<Content>This is a terrific little ipod for those who don't need all the extras of the bigger ones (viewing screen, etc).  it's easy to use and so unintrusive as it clips right onto your collar, sleeve, or wherever.  The last MP3 player I had needed to be attached to an arm band, which made for interesting stripes on the upper arm in the summer!

<Content>I bought this thing as a total impulse buy, and it's totally worth it. It has made me want to work out more often and longer when I do work out, because it just clips on to your clothes, shuffles your music, and lets you go.   Excellent size, shape, battery length, and if you are used to iTunes by now, then it's another no-brainer.

<Title>Another great iPod from Apple
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a new orange Shuffle yesterday so that I'd have an iPod that synced with my iTunes library at work.  I loaded it up, and immediately everone that saw me with it clipped to my shirt stopped me and just had to look at it.  It's: Super small Has great sound Is amazingly simple and quick to set up- about five minutes from opening the box to listening to a random mix of music.  I just love it.  It does what it's meant to do perfectly- play a random mix of your music and not get in the way.  It will be great for exercising.  I'll also download various podcasts for the commute to work.  With 1GB of memory, it can fit your latest favorite podcasts in addition to music.  Another great Apple product.  Their products rock, and are well worth the money.  Highly recommended.

<Title>Yes, But How About The Sound
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I agree that this is a delightful little postage stamp size thingy. It's a low cost gem that holds lots of music, and plays it very nicely. Actually the only thing I have to add beyond other reviews that I have read (who actually is going to read all of them) is a comment on the sound quality.  I bought mine, and walked around with it for awhile, and thought, gosh this is great. After a bit I got a little out of sorts about the fact that you don't have a menu to go exactly where you want to go. So I bought the big 30g ipod. My big surprise was the infinitely better sound quality of the big iPod. I used a good pair of Sennheiser earphones on both of them, and there is utterly no comparison. I listen to classical music and I do like to be able to tell the difference between a flute and a flugelhorn in the orchestra. This little iPod has its place, but if you really want top notch sound it just won't do. One big problem is the striking lack of bass. I had assumed that although this unit lacks the bells and whistles of its big brothers it would still push out the same sound as the more expensive ones. Wrong.   Some reviewers deplore the lack of a video screen and menu on the Shuffle iPod. That's like buying a Corolla and complaining that it doesn't have the features of a Lexus. You get what you pay for.

<Title>Better then the nano
<Date>Tue May 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the nano a couple a months ago and i did not like it so i was hesitant about getting another ipod. But after i bought a mac mini computer i had to get one my old mp3 player would not work anymore. When i had my crappy old PC it took forever for itunes to import my music. When i got the mac i was going to keep my old PC just for the media player and my music. But seeing how fast it took for itunes to import my music i deicied to get a shuffle and to toss away my old PC. I like the clip on it, is pratical and never comes off. It has alot more storage space then my old mp3 player. It is so small i was affraid i would loose it but now i just put it in a ipod case. I dont know why there are so many complaints about the earbuds they work fine and fit in my ear well. The only complaint i have about it is that itunes can be kinda of confusing but i think i can get use to it. It it has pretty good battery life and the case it comes in is actractive and usable. I dont get why people have complain that itunes is hard to use all you have to do is ask help if you have any problems. It is easy to put songs onto it all you have to do is click on the song and hold the shift key to put more then one song on it. Another negative i found out is the battery, it takes like two hours for the ipod to fully charged and i have a new mac computer. But i like the light indicator it tells you easily how the battery life is doing. I found out another think it does, when my earbuds were pulled out while i was listening to it it automatically pauses.

<Title>The Shuffle is a must have
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a large iPod that often got left behind on hikes or cross-country ski trips. The little shuffle always goes along with me now. I clip it to my ballcap or shirt collar and the short cord doesn't dangle or tangle. And the shuffle's newer earbuds fit better and sound better than my 3rdGen iPod's. iTunes makes it very easy to setup the shuffle. Since I already had a docking station for my older iPod I bought a $20 Griffin iPod shuffle dock adapter and now can charge my shuffle from 110 v. or use it in my speaker system<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P6H7Y6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">Griffin Dock Adapter for Docking Devices for iPod shuffle</a> as well as other devices that were previously accessible only to full-size docking iPods.

I downloaded tunes from my best friends computer and then lost them when I tried to add to it from my computer.  There's only certain songs I want to work out to and I was trying to only have those - I talked to the folks at the Apple store and they told me it was made that way on purpose to keep their iTunes stuff proprietary or somesuch....oh well, I can't have everything.

<Title>My techno-evolution
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Apple iPod Shuffle is great, so small yet so much music. I had not bought a MP3 player thinking they may be a contemporary "Betamax". So I waited, and waited, so long in fact that technology had left me behind. My mother was now far more techno-competent than I, and had my grandmother not passed away, she would have had a MP3 player before I.  With a figurative giant leap, my iPod has brought me into the present. A new iPod meant a new PC, faster, more memory, compatable operating system, et cetera, et cetera. I have now bought 3 iPods, one for each member of the family. I plan to upgrade in the future to a Nano but for now I an enjoying my "matchbook" that rocks.

<Title>Apple iPod Shuffle Rocks
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The technology is amazing.  The tiny Apple iPod shuffle holds 240 songs - more or less, depending on the length of the tune.  Music can be downloaded quickly and easily from the iTunes store or directly from your own CD collection to your computer and then to the unit.  It's light, durable and never skips like the old portable CD players, even if you're running.  The sound quality is excellant - no need to purchase pricey additional earphones.  With the iPod Shuffle, you can listen to all your favorite songs - and ONLY your favorite songs - while working out, doing errands or travelling.  The unit clips securely to any article of clothing which is a great plus over the iPod Nano.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone of any age.  Both of my children (ages 7 & 12) have one and now my husband wants one, too!  If you just want the music (without video options) this is the way to go.  For people like me who came of age during the years of the Walkman, this unit is nothing short of amazing.

<Content>I love that it has two different modes- you can shuffle your playlist or just listen to it in the order you put the play list in on your computer. I also like the fact that you don't have to fuss with batteries, and the charge lasts a really long time. It's very compact, and the clip holds well. It doesn't take as long to synch with my computer as I thought it would, and it doesn't take very long to charge (a couple hours) especially compared to how long the charge lasts (my sister-in-law has been using hers at least an hour every day for over a month and still hasn't had to recharge it). This product gets two thumbs up from me. The ONLY downside is you may want to consider the iPod Nano instead if you want more than 250 songs on there.

<Content>I bought the first shuffle when they first came out and was reluctant to buy a new one - even though it was cute and in great colors. But, my armband broke and I paid the money instead of buying a new armband. I love this thing. It's great for my workouts. The best thing is, I don't need to buy an armband accessory anymore. Funny thing, though, my headphones are now too long! No problem, though, since I can contain it within the clip. Also, because of the shorter length between the shuffle and headphones, the buds don't come as loose. I love my orange shuffle.

They are expensive but worth every dime ($159).  You can hear every instrument and the vocals are incredible.  It is pretty amazing sound. If you use your shuffle a lot I really recommend this combination.  If you are into bass you might not like them.  The clip on the shuffle works well and I could not be happier!

<Date>Tue Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would give this 5 stars but for a few things:  - the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears during   exercise - syncing is sometimes buggy - you have to load all podcasts manually - podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player, no matter how you   arrange them in iTunes  Recent releases of iTunes have solved some, but not all, of the sync issues. Also, I have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this.  Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets.

<Content>OMG...How much do I love this little thing! Even after I dropped it on the tread mill, stepped on it and flung it back like 6', it works perfect. Very well built for something so small. Anyway, I see a lot of reviewers complaining about the battery life, and the lack of special features(like screens, radio, ect) but do you guys not realize the purpose of a shuffle. It spouse to be small, compact and not complicated. If your looking for features like those spend the extra money and get your self a 30gb ipod. But if your looking for something to take with you on runs, or when you just need a little music entertainment, this is what you need. I my self have a Nano and the shuffle, and seem to use the shuffle a lot more then the nano, I say the simpler, the better, and simple does go hand in hand with the shuffle!

<Content>This shuffle is simply a marvel. Absolutely tiny, adorably cute, and yet holds a TON of music. My only wish is that Apple would make it so that the user could choose to have the songs stop automatically once they've played through. (Unless I'm missing something, the tracks will continue to play through eternity, repeating over and over until manually stopped). For the price and the size, it's not a huge complaint, I'm super happy with my shuffle--and maybe they'll work something like that into their next models. It's easy to use, easy to transport, and is so incredibly cute it makes my regular ipod look bulky and huge! (I never though that could be possible, but it's true!). I love my new shuffle. Absolutely love it!

<Content>This is my 3rd iPod and the very best yet!  If you want to take your movies with you, if you want to organize your musik library and save 1000s of songs, this is NOT for you.  If you want to have plenty of musik in the smallest, lightest and coolest mp3 player ever, and take it running with you, look no further, THIS IS IT!  Ok, it has no screen.  So what?  I cannot be fussing around with my iPod mini while running anyhow! With the shuffle I choose some songs that I like, make a list that I change every so often, and always have a cool running partner with plenty of battery life to last for several weeks sometimes without recharging. One down side?  It is so small, that you really have to be careful not to loose it!

<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I think it's great.  I bought it to have music to listen to while I work out.  It's the perfect size, holds more than enough songs and I love how there are different colors to choose from.  The only problem I have with it is that the clip doesn't work that great when running on a treadmill.  It stays in place while walking, but slides off when running--not a biggie though, I just stuff it in my pocket and press on!  Great deal for the money.

<Title>Great Tough Product
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We have gone through too many iPods, but this one is tough and so small.  At $75, it also is less of a loss than the iPod 60GB!  Perfect for the gym, the beach, where ever.  Easy to manage and maintain.  Still use the other iPods that have not broken yet, this is the unit of choice in my book.  Also, Amazon turned around the order in three days under its 'standard' free shipping.  Why pay more?

<Content>I love being able to clip this on and go running.  In reference to the person who said there's no way to fast forward/reverse - if you hold down the forward or backward arrow, it doesn't move to the next song, but allows you to move back and forth through the current one.

<Title>THE SHUFFLE IS THE BEST!
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recived my APPLE IPOD SHUFFLE for Christmas.  It took a while to figure out where to put the usb.  It has a very sleek design.  It has very good sound quality.  Stickers, earbuds, and usb docks are included (two packs of fuzz for the earbuds).  The shuffle has a very low price and the 1gb holds 248 songs!  It also has a built in clip, so no need for a case!  THE BEST IPOD! (my opinion)

<Title>Music On the Go
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>These electronic beauties are not just a new wave, but a total dream for a music lover. iPods are used everywhere and can store an awful lot of music. People of all ages use them everyday! They're easy to use and fill your ears with music for a long time. Now they come in colors and are so very small.   Sales skyrocket and I don't question why. Now, as ipods become more popular and more trendy, I defiantly support anyones decision to buy it. I recommend them for all ages, and hope you are as satisfied as I am.

<Title>Worth the Money....
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The sound quality is great and I definitely feel this little iPod is worth the money!! My only complaint is that it is easy to lose your grip on it....I wish they had designed it with a textured area. The way it is now it sometimes slips out of my hand when I am trying to clip it on. My husband wishes it was like our larger iPod and displayed what song you are listening to...I don't really care about that. I know what songs I downloaded, so that isn't a big deal to me. Overall I am very pleased with the product:)

<Title>Love my lilOrange.
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My iPod shuffle, unlike my 4th gen 20gb, has not given me problems (yet).  I think the lack of screen and touchwheel or clickwheel or whatever the heck it is is actually an improvement.  (Buttons are much less likely to crap out on you than a touch-sensitive wheel.)  I load up my songs, put it on shuffle, and go.  And my battery doesn't drain nearly as quickly as my old iPod.  It's also very handy for the car.  I plug it into my casette adapter, clip it to something, and go!  The metal clip is also a great bonus, since plastic clips tend to break or fall off of whatever you've clipped it to.

<Title>Good for active people
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This second generation shuffle is really cool.  It is perfect for persons on the move; in the gym; out jogging; etc.  So small yet it does a great job. I have classical music on it and the playback is of good quality.  Uploading music to it is a breeze.  Using the check boxes below in the itunes window you can replace the entire list of songs or by removing the tick just add new songs only to the list.  It is so simple to use my nine year old son from the minute he took it was able to manipulate this player.

<Content>After 2 very long and delayed flights my ipod saved me from screaming and crying children and others. Several people could not believe how small it was.  The sound was great and the battery lasted a long time. It was easy to dowload my CD's and simple to use. I can clip it on and take it everywhere.I love it.

<Title>The Almost-Perfect MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Wow. You probably know all about the Ipod Shuffle already. This review is based on my experience with it - this may not be typical to all users, however I believe that many of these points are valid for all Ipod Shuffle of the 2nd Generation.  The one I am reviewing is the 1GB Ipod Shuffle.  1) Volume : I find the volume to be very uneven. I went to Itunes and increased the volume on all tracks and then transferred the music back to the Ipod, but the volume levels were the same. That said, it sounds just fine even in crowded rooms or airplanes, so this is not really a complaint.  2) Capacity : The ad says it can 240 songs, yet mine could only hold around 180 tracks (note that most of my tracks were pretty low kbps - around 128, most of the time). I am not sure if many others have noticed this stark difference, but it certainly bothered me.  3) Display : Granted, at this price, a display is impossible to be afforded to us, but it REALLY makes a big impact. You know, I think the WORST thing about the Shuffle is the lack of display. I just cannot see whats coming up next, and while this is great for some people, it just did not work for me.  4) Fast-forwarding/re-winding Tracks : This is impossible on Shuffle. Once you start a track you cannot go to your favorite part in it or anything. This makes it tedious, especially if like me, you have a 30 minute interview with Tori Amos on it, and you want to skip to minute 15. Shuffle makes sure that you sit through the WHOLE THING before you reach that point. This does not work for me. At all.  On the plus side, the price is low, the sound quality is good (though NOT as good as the Nano), and the small, compact feel of the Shuffle is great enough to make this a must-have.  Just keep in mind the four points above though. If even one of these points makes a difference to you, I would advise investing in either a Nano or a Video Ipod. They ARE better models, and with good reason.  Hope this helps! Vote Yes, if it did!

<Title>Cute Li'l Thing
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this shuffle because my iPod Mini was kind of a pain to lug around at the gym.  I got this and it holds enough songs that I can work out 2-3 times without hearing a song again.  It's awesome because you can clip it darn near anywhere and it holds on tight!  I was worried at first that if I was running that it would fly off, but so far it's really surprised me! I had to get different ear phones because my ears are small and the ear buds won't sit in my ears right but that's only a small inconvenience and is more of a personal issue than a complaint, really.  Great product!

<Content>I had no idea this was so small( evidently I didn't read the description too well)...but my 9 year old grandson loves it, and so far hasn't lost it!  240 songs is enough for him until he's a bit older.
