<Title>One of the better digital storage devices out there
<Date>Thu Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>-Easy User Interface. Plug and save for your compact flash card without having to turn the unit on if you are in a hurry. <br>-Nicely designed exterior and 3.5 inch display. <br>-The screen resolution in review mode wont allow you to determine sharpness absolutely but definitely will allow you to review pictures and show them to friends. <br>-There are smaller units out there but this is a nice compromise for size and functionality. <br>-This unit is a hard drive,so don't expect to take this running when you listen to you MP3 player.<br>-It has good sound quality when using headphones.<br>-My only complaint is the &quot;case&quot; is just a felt bag, I was expecting something more durable.

<Title>Flashtrax vs EpsonP1000-A Comparison
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Owning both the Flashtrax 20g and the Epson P1000, I shall attempt to compare these two units, as they sell for about the same price. Both units act has "hard drives" and are designed primarily for downloading photos from digital camera cards when the cards are full, thereby making room for additional photos to be added to the card. Both units do this job very well. So what are the major differences between the units? 1. The LCD on on the Epson measures 3.8 inches, whereas the LCD on the Flashtrax measure 3.5 inches. The difference in size is minute, but the quality of the images is very different. The Epson's image is outstanding, whereas the Flashtrax's image is mediocre, at best. The backlighting on the Flashtrax is weak, even at the highest setting (which is not recommended as this runs down the battery faster). The resolution and the detail on the Epson leaves the Flashtrax in the dust. 2. Both units are quite user friendly. The Flashtrax has the edge here. In order to download photos onto the Flashtrax, one simply plugs in the card and presses a button next to the card slot. Everthing else takes place automatically. In the case of the Epson, one simply inserts the card, then navigates to the proper section of the built-in software, and downloading begins....not too difficult, but not as instantaneous as the Flashtrax. 3. Both units are able to present slideshows, either on the unit's LCD or on a connected TV. Each unit has its "special" feature here. The Flashtrax has a wireless remote, thereby making it possible to sit in your easy chair and run the show. On the others hand, the Epson has a rather cool feature of its own. You can run a manual or an automatic ordinary slide show, OR you can run a slide show whereby the photos fade in and out. The fader operates in such a way that the each photo begins as a somewhat magnified image which scrolls across the screen, This image then fades into a "still" image of the complete photo. This same "routine" is then carried on by the next image, and so on....This makes for a less boring slide show......but as I previously stated, no remote controller. 4. The Flashtrax includes an MP3 player, and a very good one at that...Obviously, a speaker as small as the built in one will not produce much decent sound.....but add a pair of good compact headphones (I use the Sennheiser 200's) and you are ready for great sound....Yes, the unit is too bulky for jogging, but for sitting on a plane or in a motel room, it's great! The sound is as good as my IPOD! 5. The Flashtrax closes to protect the screen...a great feature; then it stores in an included bag...(I hate this bag and store mine in a felt bag that came with a bottle of Seagram's Crown Royal)...The Epson comes in a velcro closing soft case which seems to protect the unit quite well, although, like most PDA's, the screen is not protected by a hard cover. Both units appear to have very good build quality. This, in a nutshell is my assessment of the two units..If you can afford them, buy them both...I use my Flashtrax to download my photos to then transfer them to my computer...oh yes, by the way, the transfer speed on the Flashtrax is USB 2.0, whereas, the Epson uses USB 1.1....quite a bit slower. Once I have tweaked my images to my computer, I then reduce them to 800 (using a JPG reduction program...I use JPGSizer, a piece of shareware that I thoroughly recommend...it's cheap and very functional....just do a Google search and find it). Now I can permanently store and show others the photos on my excellent screened Epson P1000. One more thought....Epson now has an upgraded viewer, the P2000. Unfortunately, it sells for $500, or almost twice the price of the Flashtrax...BTW, the storage capacity of my Epson P1000 is 10g and I own the 20g Flashtrax...But, unless you are a pro (or have no life and can shoot photos all day), 10g translates into 20000 photos at the size at which I store them....This space will outlive me!

<Title>Middle of the road - Look at the Epson P-2000 before you decide
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned a Flashtrax (40GB), Epson P-2000 & eFilm Picture pad and would rate the Flashtrax in the middle of the pack, with the P-2000 in the lead at this point when it comes to digital photo storage.   Advantages to Flashtrax  - One button download don't need to open cover to start download process  - Better raw file support, can rotate & zoom raw files & view histogram  - Offers a 80GB option   Disadvantages of Flashtrax  - Doesn't come with protective case  - Hinged screen seems vulnerable to breakage if you bend it back too far  - Menus & filelists are hard to navigate - buttons awkward  - Need to move rubber piece to insert memory card each time  - Compared to p-2000 the screen display is poor and protective plastic is flimsy  - Battery snaps on end near hinge and can pop out if you press buttons on side accidentally.  - Slow download speeds  - Awkward to hold & balance because you have to unfold the screen. Folding screen also makes hard to adjust screens angle of view if there is a glare.   Advantages to P-2000  - Menus & Buttons are visual, intuitive and easy to use. Browsing thumbnails display quickly.  - The display is large, sharp, bright and perfect for viewing photos  - Quick downloads  - Memory cards slot design makes it easy to load & remove cards with press of button. Accepts both SD & Compact Flash cards without an adapter.  - Comes with protective case, hand strap & display stand  - Battery is well protected - stored inside device with a door covering it  - Easy handling, no clumsy screen to unfold   Disadvantages to P-2000  - Can't Zoom or do slide shows with raw files If you shoot .nef +jpg, you can still zoom, create slide shows and it will auto rotate the jpg for you. Although you can't rotate raw files I didn't find it an issue since it's easy to turn the device sideways and that way it uses the whole large screen for a larger display anyway.  - No Histogram display on raw files (again if you shoot with a raw+jpg you can view the histogram on the jpg)  - Hard to find one in stock to buy!   Prior to buying the P-2000 I owned a Flashtrax & an eFilm PicturePad which I use to download raw digital photos. One day the eFilm stopped reading memory cards, but the other functions worked. Although it was under warranty the eFilm stopped making them and couldn't fix it so bought a Flashtrax to replace it.   I liked the Flashtrax a lot better than the picturePad since it's display, battery life and menus were much better than the efilm. When my husband dropped the FlashTrax on a grassy area, the screen cracked even though it was folded at the time. It still worked fine, the display was just cracked. So don't assume that the folding screen will protect the screen from breaking. SmartDisk replaced the screen but a few weeks ago my photo equipment was stolen so I was back on the market for a portable storage device. I must give kudos to SmartDisk for great warranty support! After reading a review of the p-2000 I decided to give it a try. (On the p-2000 the glass/plastic on the p-2000 screen & body seems much more solid than the FlashTrax so I think it would withstand rough play a little better even though it doesn't fold.)   Now that I've worked with the P-2000, I wouldn't buy another Flashtrax. The P-2000 downloads from memory cards much faster, and the screen display is bright, sharp and large enough (3.8") to get a detailed view of photos. The menu's are more intuitive due to the more visual nature of the menus and the buttons easier to use. The slide show feature also automatically will create transitions to make the show look polished without any effort. There's no folding and unfolding screens to view making it's easier to hold and adjust the screen to get a direct view without glare.   Bottom Line:  If you are a professional or enthusiast who shoots in raw format, you'll probably agree that Flashtraxs raw support is better than Epsons. Epson needs to add the capability to view histograms and zoom on raw files which I'm hoping they will do in a future software update that owners can download. Shooting in Raw+jpg does work around this but wastes memory space. Most the time I only check my histograms while I'm shooting to see if I need to adjust settings so this isn't a deal breaker for me. You'll still love the P-2000 for it's great display and ease of use. Getting the Flashtrax or P-2000 is much cheaper than buying 40GB of compact flash cards and smaller and easier/faster to use in the field than a laptop. If you decide to go with the Flashtrax you'll be happy not to lug a laptop but learn to balance awkward devices in the field. If you need the capacity for 80GB the Flashtrax is your only option at this point. Nikon owners may look at the Coolwalker. Although I haven't owned one the P-2000s screen and flexibility to use with non-Nikon cameras (such as my Olympus point & shoot) gives it a big advantage over the Coolwalker in my mind. Plus on the p-2000 & Flashtrax you can view videos & listen to music too!   If you are an amateur you'll love the p-2000 since its a slick device to store/view thousands of photos, listen to music and watch quicktime movies on. I wouldn't get the Flashtrax since you don't need the 80GB file capacity to store thousands of jpgs or raw file features. The P-2000 is easier to use too.   The only problem is it's hard to find a p-2000 in stock due to demand or Epsons lack of production so if you are in a hurry, you may need to get a FlashTrax instead.  **
