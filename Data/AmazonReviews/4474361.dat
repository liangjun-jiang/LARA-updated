<Title>Nope
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 60GB version of this MP3 player multiple years ago. and i never use it. why? the interfacing is ridiculous. you cannot easily make playlists on the fly. it is frustrating to get to the music you want to, and half the time i end up settling for some band in the A's or B's, because getting to the L's or T's is such a pain. Another huge annoyance is that artists names such as "the Pietasters" all show up under the T's. I would just turn it into a large equivalent of the Ipod Shuffle (and just have 4 or 5 star songs on it), if getting the Gigabeat to work properly with the computer weren't such a pain.  Previous to this MP3 player i had a 40GB Creative that i used obsessively. I miss it terribly.

<Title>good player for the money
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted a nicely priced mp3 player to hook up to the stereo for my business. I have been very happy with the Toshiba Gigabeat. The buttons are easy to maneuver, which is important because different staff use it. When I want to update the playlist I play during business hours, I just bring it home, connect it to my rather slow and dated computer, select the files I want to transfer to the Gigabeat, and then wait awhile. Once I figured out the best way to transfer files via Windows Media Player, transferring files became a snap. I bought a cable to hook up to my stereo receiver, so simple for a non-techie like myself.  If you just need this for music, this is a good capacity mp3 player for the price. I've never had problems with it freezing or malfunctioning. The buttons sometimes seem to either not respond or are very "touchy", but usually they are easy to maneuver. The 40GB capacity is more than ample for my needs, but there are larger capacity models as well. I bought a silicone case for it which is nice because it gets bumped around a lot at work. I also have an FM transmitter in the car which works great with it when we take a rare vacation.

<Title>Colossal Waste Of Time
<Date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Did someone say file management?  Race through and install ALL of your image files and convert them into a form that you can do nothing with.  Take your totally useable .mp3 files and turn them into unusable and unmangageable .sat files.  Next, make trying to move these files off and on to the gigabeat to avoid duplicates impossible.  Trying to prepare this unit for sale on Amazon, I found no reference to returning to original factory settings at hand.  Using Windows XP sp2 to format the drive was a mistake.  I hadn't found this out until I sold the unit and was looking for any missing documentation.  It was no use anyway, The unit would bring back things that you've deleted.  The Gigabeat room software would tell you that something is there when unplugged it isn't.  There isn't any Toshiba factory support.  The 1.1 USB is hell-of-slow especially with 2 Gigabytes worth of 700K files.  This unit is generally hostile towards non-commercial music such as my 78s collection on .mp3, my recorded gigs of David Kafinetti (from spinal tap) with bird sounds, train sounds and people I find the need to record.  This thing does not do well with those.  Why do you people always want to see a "Genre".  Sansa was like that also.  What on earth is up with you people?  I will not have my musical tastes pigeonholed.  Thank you not.  Towards the end, it stopped working altogether with the 2.0 USB, Always switched my 1024x768 SVGA to low-res VGA, and slowed all other processes to a crawl while losing track of itself.  A complete and utter failure at filling MY need to put my favorite old 78 records into a form that I can listen to often.  Don't waste your time on this one as it most assuredly will.

I didn't want to spend twice the money for an I-pod and bought this figuring that if she got some enjoyment out of it, it would be worth the $180 bucks.  She loves it so much her mother-in-law is buying one for our 9 year old grandson.

<Title>Great for photos
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just got my Gigabeat F40.  I love the quality of the photos, the screen size is nice (better than my husbands IPOD 60gb color).  The funny thing, when I upload my CD's, so far I only get the CD art when I do it through windows media player cd rip.  I love the sample music and hope that I can figure this thing out to do the same with photos and pic at the same time (instead of starting a song a then menuing out to the photo section).  Need to also figure out how to upload directly from my camera to gigabeat.  So far so good. No tips yet though.

<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Love the screen. Album art is great and photos are spectacular. Gigabeat software is buggy and needs alot of improvement. But it works, downloaded 250 CD's without any problems. Software always seems to freeze, but no problems to end result. The different equalizer settings are not very different. But it plays well.

<Title>Nice alternative to iPod
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It seems everybody has an Ipod these days.  The Gigabeat looks more stylish and has a better display.  When I ride the train to work in the morning, others look at my Gigabeat with envy (Especially the iPod owners) and ask "what is that thing". The color screen draws attention.  I've found it easy to use with Windows media player 10.  I don't particularly care for the headphones that were packaged with it, but everything else is top quality.

<Title>A bit cheaper but some major flaws
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Only tried this player since the iPod isn't compatible with a subscription music service like Napster but you have to live a few major flaws.  1)  Only syncs at USB 1.0 speed with Windows Media Player 10 or Napster's software.  You have to use either of these if you want to listen to copywritten material like Napster's music.  You also have to use the cradle.  Toshiba's software is 2.0 speed and you don't need the cradle to sync but you can't download copywritten music!  2)  Navigation needs some serious improvements.  You can't sort by song title!  And... when playing a song, you can't view other songs on the album without first navigating to ALL artists, then drilling back down to the particular album your currently playing.  Very annoying.   3)  After only one month of use, the player frame is already starting to creek when I push the buttons.  My iPod didn't do that after years of use.    Other than these things, the unit is fine.  The color screen and picture sync is cool and simple to use.  The sound quality is also solid but the earbuds wouldn't even stay in my ear.  But perhaps ears are the problem since iPod buds did almost the same.  I'd look into another brand (e.g. Dell) if you want to use Napster (or comparible) subscription service, though they may have flaws too.

<Title>Playlist Drawbacks
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Don't let the size of the HD, the display resolution or, the navigation pad fool you. This product could have been great...but it's just OK. The biggest drawback for me was not haveing a "now playing" playlist. You can't just grab a track here and a track there and add them to a playlist. You can play selected tracks only from a prexisting playlist created from the gigabie software on your PC. The navigation buttons themselves are very cool, I'll admit, but the operation of these buttons in not obvious.  Only after reading through every page of the manual did I understand how to some of the most basic operations [such as returning to the main menu while a track is playing]. I purchased a Dell DJ [20g] a few years back and never had to read a page. The operation was obvious and easy to use. Personally I think it is a decent product, howver if your looking for an alternative to the ipod craze, as I was, you may want to look elsewhere for something with a more simple and obvious operation.

<Title>You get what you pay for
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this Toshiba Gigabeat because it was only about 2/3 of the cost of an iPod.  I saved over $100.  I had a friend who told me about the Dell Jukebox, so I figured this one matched up pretty well.  Well, I didn't research enough.  While the color display on the Gigabeat looks pretty sleek and sexy, the sound quality really isn't all that great.  It's not bad, but not what I was expecting.  I had to go out and get state of the art headphones to make the music sound good.  Forget about the headphones that come with the Gigabeat.  They don't stay in your ears for more than 10 seconds if you're moving around.  Even while laying down, they'll still come loose.  The play list on the Gigabeat REALLY frustrates me.  You can't add and subtract songs from the playlist on the Gigabeat itself, which is insane.  Horrible job on Toshiba's part with that one.  The software is very easy to use and I haven't had a problem with it, as some people have.  My problem was having to load Windows XP onto my computer to use it!  I was using Windows ME, and the program would not load onto it.  That was a hastle in itself, but it was about time I upgraded.  Now, let's talk about this whacky + in the front that you use to control the song selections.  Looks neat, but doesn't work all too well.  I'm also not a fan of the buttons being on the side panel, and only having 2 buttons control about 30 features.  It gets complicated, and annoying.  Many, many flaws with this Gigabeat, but it's cheap, sounds decent, and holds a TON of music.

<Title>The Beat Goes On!
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Alright, I'm somewhat crammed with homework, but I just had to give a short mini-review of the lovely Gigabeat. I'm a college student, and at 19 years old, life is pretty hectic, and so tedious walking in-between classes made me want something more. I know a lot about MP3 players, desiring on since uh...probably since I was a junior. An iPod would be nice, but I'm not even close to the definition of rich, so I decided to stick with my CD player. Eventually, I saved up enough to get myself a Christmas present, and so I traded in a 512MB iPod shuffle I got for my birthday for a Gigabeat at Costco. It was the best decision I've ever made. At 249 at Costco, which is the same price for: iPod Nano 4GB or Creative Zen Microphoto 8GB, the Gigabeat trumps those competitors with its massive size of 40GB, although its way larger than a Nano and slightly bigger than a Microphoto. The screen however, is to die for, as its 2.2" and has the same QVGA resolution as the new iPod 5th gen, but with 200,000 more colors. This thing is beggin' for video. I saw the Gigabeat X30, which sadly isn't released in the US, but rather Japan, which costs $311 on some website, is shorter than the 40 and doesn't feature the protrusion on the back of the F40, which is quite weird. I quickly installed the Gigabeat Room, and found that it was very buggy. It froze on multiple times, and it has a few other bugs (I will explain later).  THE PROS AND CONS (Rolled into One) +The screen is amazing. What can I say? However, the sunshine's glare makes it nearly impossible to read anything, and the fonts usually "white" and if you download other QVGA wallpapers, it'll sometimes be unreadable in some spots. The Screen Themes are all cool, making it truly stand out against the iPod. -NO VIDEO! ;( Gah! This thing is crying for video, due to its QVGA display (the same as iPod 5th gen), and its fairly large size of 2.2 (the X30's 2.4 would be even better though). It could be possible through a firmware upgrade, but Toshiba's forgotten about the US (as its already released 3.0 firmware for Japan, and THREE OTHER GIGABEATS, TWO WHO SUCUEED THE F40! The P5 and P10 are their new Japan-only Flash-players, and the F41 (which doesn't feature the protrusion), but looks exactly the same otherwise, and the X30, which I've already talked about.  +Size? This is both a pro and a con, because the new X30 is .57 thick, and the F40 is like .65, I believe. The iPod is only .43 thick, and it weighs only 4.8, while the F40 weighs 5.75 oz. I know that the X30 weighs less than the F40, but I'm not sure by how much, but it probably weighs more than the iPod. The size fits into a pocket perfectly, but it doesn't fit in any iPod case, so you'll have to either: a) find a sock and cut and sew it into the perfect shape (i did that) or b) spend $19, which includes shipping, and by from OneCall (the supplier), a zCover silicone case, which works fine.  +The Player's Shell: The casing is amazingly durable, as I've dropped the player once, from...probably 4'? and it landed smack onto thin carpet and paused for 1 sec before playing again. The shell resists against most scratches. It also feels really good in my hand, and I love the metal as it rubs against my hand.  -The Player's Shell: The metal wrapping that's a darker grey than the rest starts to squeak and very slightly, starts to move back and forth just a little, and I've only had this player for like 2 weeks. Hopefully, this doesn't mean that the player will have future problems.  +Dedicated Volume Button. That's great! +PlusTouch: This is a minor "plus", as you actually have to not just "touch", but you have to apply force. Touching will make it sometimes move and sometimes not. Just push harder.  -PlusTouch: You begin on the first entry in Artist/Album, etc, so you'll have to scroll all over again if you go back. Also, from the top, you can't just hold the up button to go to the bottom of the list, you have to do a quick-tap to move it, then hold it down to move farther up once you reach the bottom. This is extremely aggrivating, since it requires two movements, a tap and a hold to move to the bottom of the list. Also, from the MAIN MENU (if you're playing a song), YOU CAN'T RETURN TO THE NOW PLAYING SCREEN WITHOUT SWIPING YOUR FINGER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT ACROSS THE PLUSTOUCH. PLUS!!THE MANUAL DOESN'T STATE THIS! YOU HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN!! -The Side Controls: Okay, whenever my friends try to use the player, its pretty hard for them to figure it out. I mean, WHAT KIND OF DESIGNER MAKES THE ON/OFF BUTTON RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU FROM THE "Now Playing" section? You can't figure that out without having someone to tell you, or without reading the manual, or without having to try and mess with it to figure it out.  -NO USB 2.0 FOR ANYTHING BUT GIGABEAT ROOM! Toshiba is making you use GR is you want to transfer anything in USB 2.  +Subscription Services. Yay! It works with Yahoo Unlimited To Go, but unfortunately they just raised the prices from 4.99 to 9.99, so dang. +Battery Life: Hmm. This is a tricky category. Well, I've gotten 17 hours, 24 minutes on the first overnight drain, but then, I got 15 hours 45 minutes when I actually used it at school. Toshiba says 16 hours, so I guess this is pretty close. Charging is pretty fast, and you can charge from USB, although you can't play music while charging from USB.  -CHARGING: When you are charging, the volume sudden drops dramatically like 3 steps, although it won't change on the volume screen. Once you unplug, it'll return to normal. The first time this happen to me I was like "Holy crap. These $40 Sony Fontopia in-ear 51's just died on me!", guess I was wrong.  +/-Earbuds: They don't fit my ears, and I couldn't get them to go in, but they fit my brother, so I dunno. It's just about your ear size. I just tossed them aside for my Fontopias, which have amazing quality, although they aren't worth $40, unless you're an audiophile. Normal people, just save your money and go with the stocks, if you wish, as they have okay quality (my brother says this), and they have no hissing, which is great. My brother thought they were great stocks, better than his 4th gen iPod photo, so I gave em over to him.  +Low Priced! You get 40GB for the price of either 4GB flash (iPod nano), or 8GB Microdrive (Creative Z MP), and iPod 5th gen costs 50 bucks more for a .3 bigger screen, less colors, easier navigation, but most of all, 10GB less! 7 (+), 7 (-) THE SOFTWARE Gawd, this software sucks. Both iTunes and WMP10 have their share of faults, but at least they ain't buggy.  +RipREC: This is a great feature, but you can only rip in WMA and in 192kbps, which is why I rarely use it. I use WMP10 to rip in MP3s in 320kbps (double the quality), and then use Gigabeat Room to transfer. The thing transfers directly to the Gigabeat, so if you have a dinky 40GB internal HD like me, you'll love this feature, although I use a flash memory key to store my music temporarily for Gigabeat Room.  -Bug #1: I planned to download "Stripped" to my Gigabeat, and so I did, after ripping it from WMP10 first. I've done it plenty of times, but this time, it made me 20 albums in Album mode, all of them being named "Christina Aguilera". However, if you go to Artists, "Christina Aguilera", it'll only list her "Stripped" album, which isn't anywhere in the Album folders. WTF??? I deleted the 20 songs, but now, you can't delete the 20 "CA" folders. I've tried and tried, even on Windows Explorer, but those folders refuse to be deleted.  -Freeze! Gigabeat Room froze constantly for me, even though I have a 2.2Ghz Toshiba laptop with 512MB memory. It sometimes recovers, but sometimes it will freeze and you'll have to "End Task". This can erase the songs you were trying to download the Gigabeat, although sometimes it won't. I was downloading The All American Rejects, when it froze midway and deleted all the songs that I had already dl'd from the album.  -The software comes up with a message everytimes you turn it on. Annoying.  -You have to go to the Gigabeat's Setup to change whether from WMP10 or GR or Choose When Start Up. The gigabeat was set on WMP10 and the manual doesn't state this clearly, at least, how to change the setting. -TWO MANUALS! WTF? This is a major sign that you'll need a 4th grade reading level. Anyways, the major reading that you'll have to do gives a sign that this player is complex. And it is. If you don't read the manuals, using GR will be difficult, unless you're accustomed to throwing manuals away and learning on your own.  -No firmware upgrade! Japan's already got 3.0 and all we have is 2.02! Why, Toshiba, why?! -The design and layout of the Gigabeat just sucks. It looks ugly, with some of the stuff copied from iTunes (such as the metal brushing look on the top.  +Set to All: Hey it works, and this is VERY GOOD, since in both iTunes and WMP10, you don't have this feature so you must tediously go through individual songs, instead of highlighting like the GR and just using STA.  -SAT. No, not the tests, ladies and gentlemen, although they share a common factor: they both suck. Yes, SAT is added to the end of MP3, making the songs you store on the Gigabeat locked (although you can still delete them Windows Explorer style), you can't play them anywhere else.  -SAT: PART 2: Okay, this part deserve another negative. You can't just store songs on here by draggin and droppin. So therefore, if you were planning to use this player not only to listen to your library, but to store your library (if you have a dinky HD like me 40GBs no less), you're outta luck. SAT prevents this, so if you're against this too, let's protest. However, a firmware would fix this, although, Toshiba has seem to have left us.  2 (+), 7 (-) Conclusion: With bad software, no firmware upgrades (other than 2.0 to 2.02), the Gigabeat is bogged down with those faults. However, the player is pretty good, and is "CHEAP" (listen up if you're on a budget!). This decision is basically up to you, now, although I won't return my Gigabeat, but I'm going to call Tech once I get the time and see if they have a solution to the bugs.

<Content>My Dad got me this for X-mas.  Many other people probably found it under the X-mas tree too in 2005.  Only works with XP??? WTF!!!  That pisses me off!!!  Come on, that's just poor for design.  I have ME now and now I have to throw down the dough for the XP.  Whatever. Like I said in the title; it was a gift.  I didn't pay for it.  The software was not designed perfectly, and once I get the XP up and running, I'll probably delete all the files I hastily loaded off my Dad's computer X-mas day because my music files are all over the player and in different folders.  The player is excellent.  The design is excellent.  The sound is excellent.  The picture quality is excellent.  There is no video, no radio, but who cares?  Think about it:  do you really want to watch a show on a tiny screen?  I don't.  That's what I have my tv and portable DVD for....and as for radio, who the hell still listens to AM/FM terrestrial radio?    Lots of people out there don't know anything about these players, so at the gym, people always come up to me and ask me questions.  Girls especially!!:)  The ipod is an ipod and so many people have them now it's almost like their cliche.  Not as cool anymore.  So, when you sport something different, people want to know what it is.  Even though it was a gift I still know the pricepoints and when you get down to brass-tax; dollar for dollar, this player (despite it's flaws here and there) is still enojyable and can't be beat.  Let's face it: no techno-toy we own is perfect.  ....I need Windows XP anyway.  I hate windows ME.

<Title>Pretty good, but could be much better
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: Excellent display; large HD; charging while connected to the USB port of a PC; good sound for casual listening; sofware allows bypassing a PC Hard Drive, while transfering from CD.   Cons: No way to load and listen to raw CDA and WAV files or lossless, such as FLAC or APE formats (such a huge HD and you are forced to squeeze your audio files into a highly compressed, very lossy format!) As I mentioned before, sound is good for casual listening, but lacking for a true audiophile. I would gladly pay double the price, if I could just load my music files and enjoy them without converting into all that lossy, double-extension nonsense (.wma.SAT).  The software, Gigabeat Room, is very buggy. It crashes once every hour or so and then resists termination of its process, thus requiring a system reboot. The program permits listening to your files, but you can't preview any image files you may want to load to your Gigabeat.   A couple more drawbacks: no drivers for 64-bit`operating systems. No support, no updates for the Gigabeat Room software, which needs some improvements badly and urgently). The battery is non-replaceable, so when it gets bad, you can kiss your Gigabeat  good-bye.   Conclusion. This is a pretty good product, which can bring a lot of enjoyment, provided you're not looking for a pristine audiphile-quality sound and are willing to suffer some pain of frustrations while loading it up.

<Title>Got it, love it, can't live without it
<Date>Fri Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, just got my player.  I've been trying to find a really good MP3 player for a while.  I'm cheap and lazy, so I want one that works with subscription services. Also, I need a lot of music as I fly internationally and if I hear "fasten your seatbelts" in English, followed by Korean, followed by Japanese, then I'll probably loose it.    Pros: *	Display is awesome!  Loaded it full of my pictures from my camera and it looks great.  You can even direct transfer from your camera into the player without a computer.  Nice if you are traveling and want to offload some images. *	Charges via the USB! *	Can be seen as a drive in windows.  Big caveat here, when you connect, you have to decide if you want to use it as a portable device or a drive.  If you use it as a drive, Windows media won't see the unit (as well as Yahoo Music, Napster, etc) and you can't copy protected files.  However, you can just reconnect later as a portable device. *	40 gigs in my pocket.  Oh yea.... *	16 hours of battery life, which is about as long as it takes me to fly to the other side of the planet.  Coincidently, it's also the length of all of the Jim Bulushi videos you can watch on my flights.  Cons: *	No radio.  Not big deal for me *	You have to use the cradle to use a subscription service.  For whatever reason, if you connect directly with the USB cable, it always comes up as a drive. *	No video (yet?) *	Little thick.  Newer version in Japan is slightly thinner.

<Title>Almost perfect!
<Date>Sat Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I first saw the Gigabeat at CES this year and I've been waiting for it since then. I finally got my hands on the F40 a couple a weeks ago and I wasn't disappointed. By the time it shipped here in the US Toshiba applied firmware 2.02 which lets you view slide shows of your favorite photos while playing music.  The good: - The screen is no doubt the best in its class. - The touch sensitive cross is very intuitive, much more so than the wheel on the iPod. The Gigabeat can be operated in horizontal mode, my favorite, and the cross is designed perfectly for this. Due to its design switching from vertical to horizontal mode requires no change in how you navigate. - Setting the EQ to flat will give you crystal clear and a very detailed sound experience, and the volume has more power than I can handle. - You can preset volume and EQ settings per song in the Gigabeat Room program - You can browse music by Artist/Album/Genre, but also by folders like Explorer. - No need for the cradle if you transfer music via Gigabeat Room, or without Room if you use the Gigabeat as external HD using drag and drop. - Rip Tech button on the cradle will rip an entire CD and transfer it to your Gigabeat in 5 minutes. - Works with all Play For Sure online music services.  The bad: - SAT encryption on anything you transfer via Gigabeat Room or Windows Media Player. You can get around it by using drag and drop while connected in Windows Media Mode and using the cradle. Instead of using WMP you just drag and drop your music onto the Gigabeat. Gigabeat will recognize ID3 information and catalog your music when you drag and drop this way. - USB 1.1 speed when using any other way then Gigabeat Room to transfer music to the Gigabeat. - EQ quality is not as good as it could be. However with the EQ set to flat everything I have tried sounds great! - No video... yet.  I REALY like the Gigabeat. I have recommended it to all my friends and I got a second one for my wife. "The bad" can all be fixed with a firmware upgrade, and I'm hoping that Toshiba is listening to all Gigabeat enthusiasts. I belive that hardware wise the Gigabeat is perfect. All that now is needed is some fine tuning on the EQ and to get rid of the SAT encryption.  Lots of information about the Gigabeat can be found over at www.mygigabeat.com. The forum is an excellent way to get most of your questions answered.

<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchaed the Toshiba Gigabyte a couple weeks ago.  At first, I thought it was terrible because of the software.  The manual is not real clear about how it works.  I've finally figured it out now and I think the player is great.  The software has a 'update library' feature that you have to use to get songs on the player.  Anyway, the size of the unit is great and so is the sound.  The Equalizer is also great, with a large variety of choices.  The screen is very clear and photograhs look fine. What I like best is the size and the controls.  I think the controls are easier to use the then Ipod which has the circular wheel.  ONce you get over the software, you will be happy with the Toshiba Gigabyte Mp3 player.  I have the 40gb player. I wish I had purchased the 60 gb because of the number of albums I will be transfering to it.

<Title>Thrilled w/ the Gigabeat
<Date>Tue Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had the player about a month after spending 6 months and countless hours trying to find the player I wanted.  I am thrilled w/ the Gigabeat Positieves: 1) plays for sure compatible 2) works perfect w/ windows media player 10.  I had a Dell DJ and even after plays for sure upgrade, I had nothing but trouble w/ it w/ media player so I sent it back.  The Gigabeat works seamlessly with it, and I find media player very easy to use contrary to popular belief 3) color screen 4) easy to navigate w/ the cross and menus and see what you are doing Negatives 1) encryptes all files so is hard to use it for a transfer device.  If want to share music w/ friends, you will not like this player 2) highest bit rate supported 192 kbps.  I could not find this anywhere in manual or even toshiba website, but most of my files are on my computer at 400kbps + and they are all down regulated to 192kbps.  This sounds fine in car and headphones, but if demand higher bit rates you need to look elsewhere

<Title>The best player available
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the truly the best player I have ever run into. I had previously tried out ipods and rios that my friends have purchased and have been very disappointed with them. Then finally I saw the toshiba gigabeat F40. It looked very sleek and I had heard wonderful things about it from others who have purchased it, so I decided to buy one, and have been absolutely thrilled with the player since. It works beatifully and produces top-notch sound. However, there are a couple of small downsides.   First, the earbuds that come with the player are very hard to keep in your ears. The other downside is that the software can be difficult to figure out at first, but once I understood it, I actually found the toshiba software to be much much better than the ipod software. Just keep your mannual handy until you figure it out.   Another positive side is toshiba's tech support. I had to call them when I first got the player because I was having trouble registering it online. When I got ahold of a service rep I was quite surprised. He was located in the US, spoke perfect english, and was very kind and helpful.   Overall, the player is extremely good and I am very glad that I purchased it instead of an ipod or a rio. I have recommended this product to my friends and family and would reccommend it to anyone looking for a high quality player.

<Content>I'm new to the mp3 game, but the gigabeat seems to work for me.  I had over 300 cd's I needed to upload, and the rip-rec function worked great! Awesome screen, software good enough,  battery life great, controls can be awkward, but you get good with practice. I use Napster which is pretty good for mainstream tunes.  The only other player with 40 gigs and color is the expensive iPod photo,...and that's for chicks.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my gigabeat for a couple of weeks now and absolutely love it!  I have been wanting to purchase a player for ages but didn't really like the ipod (and a lot of users who think that once they buy and ipod they can plunder CD collections from anyone, eventhough that person has spent thousands of dollars building up their collection - my problem, I'll get over it.)   I have 500+ CDs and have quite easily uploaded all of them with the RipRec function.  I have also been able to tag them all with their album covers that can be found on most music sites.  There are a couple of bugs with the gigabeat room software but I have found these to be quite minor.  Pros. Great colour screen.  Very vivid and I like being able to change the screen so it functions both horizontally and vertically.  Navigation is also fairly easy after a short time familiarising myself with it.  RipRec works effortlessly and it take about 5mins per 12 track CD on my medium fast laptop.  I was also sceptical of the gigabeat room software but I have had very little trouble with it.  Sound quality is v goos.  Have listened to my flatmate's Ipod and I found the sound to be noticeably better.  Cons:  Earplugs.  I had a bit of trouble with songs appearing in the Artist folder but not the Album folder and vice versa.  Not sure how to fix this.   Gigabeat room downloads Various Artists albums from Gracenotes as Various Artists and not as individual artists.  A little annoying as you have to rename everything.  Also when tagging an album cover there is a 'Set to All' button that is totally useless and only works if you press the button as many times as there are tracks.  Had a lot of trouble deleting photos from the gigabeat.  I went into the photo browser and deleted all photos from the folders and when I turned on the gigabeat they were still there.  Finally worked it out but it should be a little easier.  Also think you should be able to delete photos from the photo folder on the gigabeat to the recycle bin as with music tracks but this doesn't appear to be possible.  Other than these minor things I am a massive fan and enjoy being outside of the ipod crowd and enjoy even more the look of jealousy on their faces when they see the gigabeat.

<Title>For people tired of ipod
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a pretty good product. I am happy with it overall. A few downsides: It says that it is compatible with Windows Media Player 10 but if you use it to upload your songs, the album art will not come up with it. the only way to get the artwork is to use the library software that comes with it. Another thing is that when wma files get transferred, they don't always work. An easy fix for that is getting an mp3 converter. The last withdrawal is at this point there is no accessories what so ever!! I had to but a case made for ipod to put the Gigabeat in and it was a little snug. Hopefully they'll start putting more accessories out there. There are many positives to this product. The plus sign navigation is very easy. There are several ways to display information, even sideways which is good for pictures. There are different settings for bass and treble which is good so depending on what you're listening to, you get that perfect sound. This product is pretty neat and a nice break from the ipod that's everywhere!!

<Title>Impulse purchase--I wish I had bought a Creative mp3 player instead
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Most of the reviews say the Gigabeat is better than the i-pod.  I haven't tried the i-pod, but I had a 4 gig Creative Nomad that I just loved.  Then I saw the Gigabeat on sale and bought it so I'd have 10 times the space.  Big mistake!    The player itself is OK, but the software drives me nuts!   *It won't load WMA files at all.  That's a big drawback, since I have a lot of files that I have to change to MP3.   *When you put music on, it copy protects the music so you can't make another copy from the Gigabeat.  So it's no good as a backup.  You have to have another backup on CDs or whatever. *The menu is very difficult to figure out, and the manual doesn't help. *The installation CD doesn't lead you through the right steps. I had to pull up the manual from the CD and follow the instructions on that. *It doesn't work properly as a hard drive when you attach it using the cradle.  My Nomad worked great as a file transfer tool

<Title>Much better than the overpriced Ipod
<Date>Sat May 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:long battery life, can play wma as well as mp3, durable, gives choice of using windows media player or gigabeat software to sync  Cons:bookmark sucks, plastic top and bottom pieces pop-off, does not track most played, most recently added, etc lists  I purchased an Ipod for my husband for Christmas, and he got me this gigabeat and of the two of us I am the happier. I can play just about any type of audio file, including the free audio books from the library that ONLY come in WMA format and are protected so you can't convert them. The Gigabeats batteries seem to last longer and it has held up to a lot more damage than his Ipod which he has had to reformat several times and the drive keeps freezing. The top and bottom pieces kept popping off, but a bit of super-glue fixed that. I don't like the "bookmark" as it only bookmarks the track, not where I am in the track which is annoying when listening to long audio book tracks. I have had problems making the cradle rip cds directly, but I didn't really need it to anyway so I am not too upset about that not working. I have dropped it numerous times and it keeps on ticking. Now my husband wants me to get him one as a backup to the Ipod.

<Date>Sat May 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Tallk about a dud product. This Gigabeat is a flop.  Transfering music is an incredible frustration.  Contacting toshiba support is an incredible frustration.  Using the Toshiba Gigabeat is punishment for a crime you didn't commit. I have a Toshiba computer, it is easy to use. How could Toshiba flub this product so badly. I think they looked at an Ipod, and tried, conceptually, to copy it. What a mistake. The Ipod is made by Apple. The whole Apple company reminds me of Canada. Look at Canadian zip codes, they make sense to someone, but not normal people. If you like the Canadian zip code system, then you will like the Toshiba Gigabeat. I am going to sell my Gigabeat on Ebay.

Well for one, it's not compatible with Windows Media Player 11 which would not recognize it.  As a result, it's own software,Gigabite Room, was the only option and Gigabite Room was terrible and full of glitches even after having Toshiba mail me an update disc.  Now, after a few months, my Gigabeat 40 doesn't even function and I've thrown it away.  No, I'm not electronic devise or computer challenged. No I didn't drop it. Buy at your own risk.

<Content>STORAGE: This is one of two primary reasons to purchase this product; you simply cannot get the same storage for the same price anywhere.    COLOUR SCREEN: This would be the other reason to buy this product.  The screen size is amazing for a unit of this overall size.  FIRMARE: To get the most out of the excellent hardware, you will have to ditch the Tobishia firmware, which is the source of everything wrong with this product.  If you don't mind using the cumbersome Gigabeat Room software, having your mp3s encrypted, having no organisation of photos, and having no ability to view video on this fantastic screen, then you shouldn't have a problem.  If this would frustrate you--and you are even a little computer savy--then replace the Tobishia firmware with a certain FREE open source firmware (simply google search) and this product will leap into full utilisation of the fantastic hardware.

<Content>I chose the Toshiba Ggabeat because it could both show pictures and  play music. It does a wonderful job of both. I am a little frustrated with how hard it is to navigate, especially from the desktop program. I've had the player for three weeks and still am not sure if I am adding or replacing songs and/or pictures. The battery was supposed to last for up to 20 hours, but I usually get only a little more than half of that. All-in-all I am very pleased with the quality of the output and the large capacity, but I wish it had a more intuitive interface, or at least a better manual or "help feature".

<Title>Some say it's "Quirky", I say it's Aggravating!
<Date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player a few days ago from Best Buy.  It was on clearance for $199.  I had done a bunch of research on different WMA players from Creative, IRiver, etc... but had read very little about the Toshiba.  It was a good price, it had a beautiful screen, cradle and an inline remote included in the package and that appealed to me.  So I thought I would try it out.    While still at Best Buy, I actually logged onto a PC and read some of the reviews here at Amazon and on CNET.  Some people raved and others called it "Quirky".  I took a chance.  The box had the "Plays for Sure" logo on it, which was important to me because all my music is ripped in WMA and I use Windows Media Player exclusively.  I got it home and browsed the manual and quickly found out that if you want to used the Windows Media player to Sync, it is LIMITED TO USB 1.1 speeds.  What a deal breaker.  Really Toshiba what are you thinking?  Ok.. ok.. I calmed down and resolved myself to a long download process, justifying to myself that when I needed to add CDs later it wouldn't be too painful.  ...4-5 Hours later it finally finished loading my 9 Gigs of music.  I moved the cradle and connected it to my Home Audio System, which is where I would like it to stay until my family goes on one of our frequent road trips.  Well I found some more CDs around the house to RIP and plugged the Gigabeat directly into the PC with the USB cable.  Now only it only comes up as a Mass Storage device compatible with the Gigabeat Room software.  I went back to the manual and found out you HAVE to use the cradle if you are using Window Media Player.  So if I want to update sync the player, I have to move my cradle back to the PC instead of using the USB connector on the player directly.  Oh and if you think you can just copy your music directly to the Gigabeat while it is connected as a Mass Storage Device, think again, the music files have to be in the Gigabeat Encrypted format in order to be recognized.  OK, well I thought that I would give the Gigabeat Room software a try, since I didn't want to be moving my cradle back and forth.  I just had a few albums to sync, so maybe it wouldn't be too painful.  Wrong, the Gigabeat Room software seemed to find all the music on both my player and PC and then proceeded to start synchronizing ALL the music again.  No way... I don't want to have to use two different media players.  OK... so I finally got my music on and decided to play with it a little.  Here is the next Aggravating saga.  The controls and user interface are atrocious.  The plus pad on the front actually works allright, sort of, but here are some of the problems.  You want to play an album?  Press the Power button, huh??  You want to select the album press the middle of the touch cross, nope, touch the right, yep.  You want to select and new equalizer?  Press Menu, OK that seems to make sense.  Select the new equalizer setting.  Now you want to get rid of the menu?  Uh, push the left cross-nope... press the menu button-nope, the power button-nope?  Ok at this point you could wait exactly 1 minute to let the menu timeout or you could swipe your finger from left to right on the cross... very intuitive? NOT, its one of the secret features.  These are just a few examples.    BTW, as I'm writing this, my new IRiver H10 20 Gig just finished synchronizing my entire music 9 Gig library in 45 minutes.  I got so frustrated with the Toshiba that I went and picked up the IRiver to see if it was better.  In short it is, I am now listening to a playlist in the H10 that I made in WMP...  OK I'm tired of ranting.  The Gigabeat beat me and I'm taking it back...  PROS -Beautiful Screen -Docking station included -Remote included -Sturdy construction -It sounds good when you play music  CONS -Aggravating- It could be so much better -Have to use cradle to sync with Windows Media Player -USB 1.1 speed when using Windows Media Player to Sync -Horrible User interface -EQ setting are of little use

<Title>Sparing features for capactiy
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player at BestBuy for $220 (10%, display model that still worked fine).  I decided to buy this one after looking at the Creative Zen Touch, iRiver, and Creative Zen Micro.  I picked this one, because it was a bare-bones MP3 player, with good construction, reasonable price, and large capacity.    The display is very crisp and clean, and pictures look great on it-as long as you can call a 2"x1" viewing screen great.    Sound quality is decent, although the preset EQ settings are quite horrible, and there's really only a few settings of the user EQ that will give you good sound without feedback.    The user interface is a little bit hard to navigate, and the touch-pad takes some time to get used to.  The design in itself is not ergonomic at all, unless you put the screen sideways (allowing yourself to get to the buttons up top with your index fingers).  There's really a surpsing lack of playback features with this player.  However, I think that Toshiba spared extra features like this, for size and durabillity.  It really is a tough little bugger...  I had it in my front-shirt  pocket of my sweater at work, and slammed the hard-metal vise-handle into it, at quite a good bit of speed.  It left a little dent on the side of the player, but it remained completely functional... Just a small little blemish.  In all reality, the player itself is very durable, and has high-storage capactiy. It lacks a lot of playback features, and the navigation isn't the best.    I would like to reccomend an iRiver over this player, but I have not used one myself.  All in all, I would only buy this player if you're concerned with wanting 40 GB of storage, for a cheaper price.  It does serve its purpose as an MP3 player, however.

<Title>Great Player for the Windows Media crowd
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I long ago converted all of my music to digital format. However, since I was using Windows Media Player, and with 35+ GBs of music, I didn't want to go the iPod/iTunes route and have to redo everything. I'd been looking at various players (iRiver, Creative, Toshiba), and finally settled on the Gigabeat F40 due to its screen, capacity, WMA support, and price.   Having had the player for about 3 weeks now, I can safely give it a  5-star rating. Initially, I was probably in the 2-3 range. A lot of my music had been ripped in Windows Media Lossless format, which the player (and the Gigabeat Room software) does not support, meaning that syncing through Gigabeat Room (GR) would not work. Hence, I had to use Windows Media Player 10 to transfer music, as it would automatically convert to the right format. The problem there is a) the time for the conversion process, and b) the fact that the USB2.0 connection only works through GR - WMP10 connects only at USB1.1. A poor design decision on Toshiba's part.  A second issue with this method is that album art does not transfer with the songs - meaning that I had to go through 600+ albums and manually attach album art through GR. All told, it took about 7 days (including a few nights up until 5 am) to get everything the way I wanted it.  Since that point...it's been smooth sailing. Sound quality is good (just watch out for some of the EQ settings, they sometimes get distorted). Listening through a tape adapter in my car has worked well. Have also hooked it up with an RCA adapter to my home stereo, which also sounds very good.  One big issue (and this seems to go for any non-iPod player) is the dirth of accessories. I was finally able to find a case specifically designed for the Gigabeat after much searching on the web. Just know that you are very limited in what you can find, at least compared to the iPod.  All told, I'm quite happy with my first foray into portable media players since my last discman about 10 years ago. In hindsight, I probably would've opted for the 60GB version, in order to bump up the bit rate (a lot of my music is 64 kbps, would've preferred all 96+). But I would definitely recommend the Gigabeat line to anyone who favors WM over iTunes.

<Content>I have purchased this gigabeat and it's pretty decent. I didn't like the earphones it was average. The software is mad confusing , You can use windows media player , or giga beat. Sometimes when i select Window's media player 10 from the set up in the mp3 player it uses Gigabeat room. The sound quality is good. You have a lot of equilizer to choose from. You can store pics too and it comes out good. The bright Lcd lite is pretty cool . You can upload picture and set them as your wall paper.  Over all this product was "more bang for the buck" to me.

<Content>I bought this machine had it 3 days and returned it!  It was the biggest waste of money! Could not delete from it, could not create a playlist from scratch on it,  even if u could delete a song the info stayed on the machine.  Not user friendly and a huge disappointment...  Stick to Creative I have had my Nomad II for 3 years and still runs great! Be weary of this product!

<Content>I was just about to click the proceed button on my $208 40 gigger Toshiba, when I saw the Beach Audio button and clicked it. After going straight to their web site, I found the player for $27 dollars less there, and only $5.00 shipping!!!!!!  That's a great deal!!! Don't know why it's so much more from Beach Audio's Amazon site, but go straight to em for the better deal!
