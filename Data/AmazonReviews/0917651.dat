<Content>My older version (1GB) of this Coby player went out on me suddenly while trying to download a lot of music.  I was disgusted. It was only 10 months old - and I hadn't been downloading alot previously - though I had handled the little tyke roughly and used it on a regular basis (radio).  I searched online reviews of other players and came back to Coby for this newer model.  Maybe holds 1-2 less songs -  but still the best deal for it's price/sound/utility.  If you get one, DO HANDLE WITH CARE.  Also, I discovered that Energizer's long-lasting LITHIUM AAA batteries are oversized for the Coby battery holder.  You have to squeeze them in.  Probably not a good idea - but for the long life, what are you gonna do?? Multiple memory cards are great - just load and switch them out.  Have more music for your buck.  And this is so much CUTER than IPOD! ;>  
<Overall>4
