<Content>But now its gone bad!! Iriver support is not responding. I can't down load the updater to my H10,it won't reformat, and emails are getting me nowhere. Worst yet I miss my music. Like a relationship gone bad, it was great while it lasted, but the end was really sour.

<Title>I have never HATED a device as much as this one!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am actually on my 3rd H10 having had to receive 2 RMA numbers from iRiver.     The number of issues I have w/ this thing is difficult to even tally up.  Generally I wouldn't bother writing a reveiw; however, this morning I find myself having to wipe the piece of cr*p clean for the 30th time and re-syncing several thousand songs once again.  I'm not even going to bother.  I'm just going to go buy a new mp3 player and be done w/ it.  If you buy one of these things after reading this then I can only assume you are a masochist.

<Title>Great first player. Experienced no problems.
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While I wasn't ecstatic about receiving an iRiver (I wanted an Ipod), once I started using it I really loved it. It works well with Windows media player, I didn't have to download any software and moving around the menu is extremely easy. I didn't have the charging and battery problems everyone else had, but maybe that's because I read the manual. You don't have to connect to the computer to charge it; you need only connect the mp3 side of the usb cable to your player and THEN connect the ac adapter to player/wall. The only thing I needed to do to my player was update the firmware, which was easy if you can follow directions. Songs aren't always played in order (kind of annoying), but not so much that it ruined my experience with the player. SMART and AFFORDABLE BUY!

<Title>Hands down the best player available
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Without a doubt the best player out there. I was blown away by the build quality and attention to detail, iriver really put a lot of work into this. You will wish your cell phone/PDA could even come close to this quality. Took it out of the box, pluged it into usb port and opened explorer (just like a drive letter!), draged mp3s to it, done within 5 min of opening the box. No need to use Windows Medeia Player. A really cool feature lets you record from the FM radio to. By the way the display resolution is 128 x 128 so you can optimize photos (not in the manual or web site). If you are deciding between Ipod and the H10, there is no comparison other than GB, this unit makes the Ipod look like a cheap kids toy.

<Title>REVISED
<Date>Sat Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing it's way better than any other mp3 player I've used. Here are the specs: FEATURES  * Plays up to 150 hours of digital music* * 5GB of internal storage** * Vivid color display * Ultra-intuitive interface with convenient touch strip * Displays your digital photos * Slim, lightweight design * PlaysForSure enabled to play more of your music * Rechargeable, removable battery lasts up to 12hrs. * Built-in FM tuner and FM recorder * Integrated voice recorder * Ultra-fast USB 2.0 transfers * Supports MP3, WMA, JPEG and TXT files * Enhanced 3D audio (supports SRS WOW  PACKED WITH  * iriver earphones * Carrying case with belt clip * USB 2.0 interface cable * Installation CD * AC adapter  PC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  * Windows XP (Service Pack 1 or higher) * CD-ROM Drive * USB Port  It has a great navigation system almost as good as the iPods click wheel.(but that thing is really hard to match) It's features rival that of it's opponents and tops them all. The 3 players I checked out were the iPod mini, the creative zen micro, and of course the H10. I didn't think the Mini was worth $250 when it can't use Napster has no microphone or radio. The Zen micro was my 2nd choice because it has a radio and mic plus it looks way cool with the blue LED in the back and the colors but that is more of a gimmic than a plus and the touch pad doesn't work that well. Then I saw this by accident actually. I downloaded Napster onto my comp and was looking at it's special offers to see what would work with it. I was going to get the zen micro then I finally checked this thing out and I was captured. Since the iRiver H230 looked ugly I never cared abought them but this thing is beautiful and it looks professional. The color screen is a little to small but it looksamazing compared to most LCD screens like the iPod so when you turn it the image isn't negative. It's simplistic button layout is a definate plus which makes it so you don't have to take much time to get used to it. Also it has volume control on the side unlike the zen and iPod. The sorage is fine with me because I don't need my entire music collection with me at all times. However you can't directly link your H10 to a digital camera. Plus it has a few minor bugs. Hopefully iriver will make a firmware update.(mud slinging lol must be a fanboy of iriver) I wish the price was $250 so it could compete with the iPod mini and zen micro easily. But when you make an investment like this you know it's going to work and it does. It also comes with a great iskin which protects it from any fall. This thing is small though I was suprised when I opened it up. Supposedly it weighs less than the iPod mini and it's a photo player!!!  what I said up there ^ is an out of the box reviewwhich you shouldn't trust after only a week of having this machine it is a pain in the @ss. iRiver should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a premature item with all its bugs. this thing doesn't like a lot of computers and has problems with freezing but worst of all it can't play albums in track order. this is terrible for people like me who listen to bands like green day and linkin park who use transitions in their songs but even then there are pauses inbetween songs. If I bought a camera I'd expect it to work without having to wait a long time for it to be fixed. iRiver has terrible american support which is unacceptable even if they are based in korea. I can't give this thing anything higher than a 3 because it's faults are too big. this had a lot going for it but iRiver being as smart as they are released it way too early

<Title>Disappointment
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered the H10 and have now sent it back.  I have had problems similar to those many others listed.  The radio worked great and picked up even distant stations well.  The user interface and size are fantastic.  However, when I loaded music with WMP10, it would not work.  This includes MP3s and WMAs ripped from my own CDs as well as Napster to Go.  I uninstalled and reinstalled WMP10 and got the latest download from Microsoft.  Using this and USB 2.0 on both a Falcon Northwest Pentium 4 3.06 MHz (XP Home) and a Sony Vaio laptop (XP Professional), I had the same problems with both computers and had to conclude that the device was not functional.  The names of the songs jumbled such that artist names were linked to songs of different artists.  The menu and directories were all goofed up.  Many songs loaded but wouldn't play.  Some would play a few times and then everything would jumble up.  Tech support from iRiver was virtually nonexistent.  I sent it back and ordered a Zen Micro today.  I'm hoping I'll have more success.  Overall, the H10 is a very nice device conceptually but it might be better to wait for a later model with more stable technology if you want to order this player.

<Title>The product does not work - Zero support from IRiver
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this product about 2 weeks ago.  In spite of hours spent on researching tips from the Misticriver forum and trying all sorts of different ways, the product has not worked correctly.  The playlists do not work, the lists by artists and album is corrupted.  The tech support, which is open only during business hours, has at least 45 minute wait.  They clearly do not have answers to the problems with playlists, etc.  My inquiries via email have been unanswered.  It is clear that the product was prematurely launched to coincide with the Napster to Go campaign.  It is a nice paperweight, if you can afford to spend over $250 for a paperweight!

<Title>No problems here... and Napster to go
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have other iRiver products so when I decided I wanted to go with Napster To Go (monthly subscription service that lets you "rent" tracks for compatible players), I knew I would go with iRiver.  The H10 is an elegant little machine -- very nice to look at and solidly built. The interface on the player isn't all that great, occasionally confusing, but it works.  I have had no problems getting music onto the player. It works well with the Napster software. I play albums -- in track order -- by creating playlists in Napster and transfering those playlists onto the player. It's a snap.  And the sound is wonderful. I've been using some pretty good Sony headphones so far and have been satisfied with the sound quality. I have some Shure phones coming soon and expect it to sound even better.  Bottom line. For me the player has been almost flawless.

<Content>I was given the iriver H10 as a gift.  Upon opening the box, two inserts read,"STOP, before returning this product........."  That should have been my first clue that something was wrong.  The second insert recommended that I contact iriver via e-mail if I had a problem.  I did contact them, over a week ago, still no response!  The product is terrible!  It copied my whole MY documents file.  I tried to delete it, it wouldn't allow me to do so.  Now, when I return the product for a FULL refund, I have to make sure the salesperson can delete my files in the H10.  Also, EVERY time I tried to download files, it froze my computer!  Absolutely the worst!  Don't buy it.

<Title>Great product, although not perfect
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When this mp3 player was first announced and I started to see it all over the net, I was excited. I am a long time iRiver enthusiast (also an anti iPod) and their first micro hard drive mp3 player looked great, with a color screen, and of course tons of other features that iRiver always includes. (By the way, this is where Apple falls short - they dish out the same thing over and over, saying it's a "new generation" iPod with nothing different except the front design. The iPod never has extra features except games, it has terrible battery life, and plus it looks rather uninteresting to me, though not overly ugly.)  Unfortunately for me, when I ordered this iRiver H10 from Amazon (just two weeks ago it cost $271 now it costs 280, I have no clue as to why) they sent the wrong product! I had to return it and order from Newegg. In any case, the red version of this player looks simply amazing. Great sleek design, beautiful color screen, and the red metallic color tops it off. It's a lot lighter than I expected, you have to feel it in your hand for this fact to hit you. The button layout is bot intuitive and comfoprtable.  When I turned this player on my amazement didn't cease. The color screen had better resolution than my color cell phone! The touch pad worked a lot better and easier than Zen Micro's touch pad. I proceeded to plug it into my computer to start downloading music into it. I had no problems with syncing with Windows Media Player, only a slight learning curve. I certainly didn't experience any freezing or crashing problems that many other people mentioned. It might be that they had defective products or their computers are somehow incompatible, though I can't imagine why. After I got some songs into it I listened to the sound quality. Amazing sound. There are thirty or so different preset EQ modes, including an SRS WOW that you can customize, and another Custom EQ. The default EQ is nothing compared to SRS.  So far no problems. The only thing that annoyed me about this player is that it arranges songs in alphabetical order, even if there are numbers in front of them. Let's say you copy a cd into your computer and sync it into the H10. When you rip from cds using WMP, then it automatically puts track numbers into the music files. For example: 01 Foreward 02 Don't Stay 03 Somewhere I Belong etc  When you download it into the player, the numbers are gone and you see the songs arranged in alphabetical order, even when you browse song titles in albums. This can be remedied by changing the titles of the songs like this: 01 songtitle to 01 - songtitle  put a space, a dash, and then another space in between the number and title. Then, go to properties for that song and do the same thing in "Summary" where you input the title, artist, album, etc. Doing this with all the songs should put them in the original album's order. I just found this extremely annoying to do with hundreds of songs, and iRiver should fix this bug.  In any case, I found this player to be out of the ordinary, with great quality sound, beautiful design, and a handful of extra features like text and photo viewing.  And by the way, I know how annoying iRiver support is, with unresponsive service and the like. iRiver orginates from Korea, and the service is a lot better there, along with product quality, and I heard they have no bugs over there. So maybe it's just over here in the US that the problems are occuring.

<Title>iRiver H10 tries, but flunks. Wait for updated drivers
<Date>Wed Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love iriver products, and was blown away with the sound on this player, but I had UNRESOLVABLE problems with the player and Windows Media 10. I downloaded the "fix" from the iRiver site, but I just couldn't get it to work without re-running the "fix" over and over again. Finally, I returned the player to Best Buy, severely disappointed.  They need to create a new version of iRiver Music Manager as an ALTERNATIVE so one can just drag and drop the songs from your hard drive to the player. The Windows Media 10 is incomprehensible to use; and the connectivity "For Sure" is not sure at all! Furthermore, the documentation doesn't explain HOW to get photos on the player. WM 10 placed them on the file system, but the only way to see them was to use the file "browser" on the H10. Another problem was that the playlists were all "out" of sequenced from the alphabetical order I created on WM10. (This was when I COULD get the WM10 to recognize it). After awhile, I couldn't get WM10 to connect to the H10 at all.  Calls to the tech support line yielded busy signals for 2 days. My email to customer service has yet to be answered.  This has soured me from purchasing iRiver products for some time. Too bad for them.....

<Title>Worst MP3 Player I Have Ever Owned!
<Date>Thu Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Over the last couple years, I have owned a variety of music players. Here is a brief timeline: Rio (64MB) -> Mini Disc (Sony 74 mins) -> iPod (1st Generation 5GB) -> iFP-390T (iRiver 256MB) -> H10 (iRiver 5GB - Present) -> iFP-899 (iRiver 1GB - Present). The H10 is by far the worst player I have ever owned. Here is a list of frustrations that I have experienced during the short time I have owned it:  -Short battery life. I have only made it to about 6-7 hours. Much shorter than the 12 hours listed by the manufacturer.  -Frequent crashes. Much like the only operating system it works with, my H10 has crashed on multiple occasions. So far I have found that the only way to reset the player is to remove the battery. This is made more frustrating when you have the protective skin on, as you have to completely remove it first.  -Slow song changes. It's not very scientific, but it feels like it takes about a second or so to skip to the next song. It makes me think that the buffer is very small. I could be wrong, but believe that the iPod buffers about 20 minutes.  -Poor functionality I. In the morning I like to listen to the radio and switch to music during commercials. With the H10, you have to back out through quite a few screens to get to the radio from the music function.  -Poor functionality II. There does not seem to be any way to create multiple, on-the-fly playlists. You can create one quick playlist and that is it. Has iRiver never seen an iPod?  -Inaccurate battery indicator. This is related to the battery life issue, but is a different problem. On multiple occasions, the indicator has read 100% full for 4 hours, then when I shut it down and turn it back on, it reads 50% full. It will work for about another 2 hours, then completely shutdown due to insufficient battery power.   The H10 has a few other things working against it, but I have listed the ones that bug me on a daily basis. Hopefully, a firmware update will come out soon that will fix some things, but the short battery life is really annoying. Maybe it's so you have to buy additional batteries from them, I don't know.  There is a happy ending to all of this, although it does not involve the H10, but does include iRiver. I missed my iFP-390T and hated the H10 so much that I went out and bought the iRiver iFP-899. The 899 is, without a doubt, the best player I have ever owned (sorry 390T). I'll probably write a review for it, or maybe the 799, which is pretty similar. I love iRiver, but I wish they would put as much care into their hard drive players as they do with their flash players. If you need tons of space and no FM radio, go get an iPod. If you need tons of space and as well as FM radio, go get an iPod mini and use the extra money to buy a good mini radio. The H10 is too little, too late to compete with what is out there. Nothing is innovative about it, and it is more expensive that similar items. Even the Napster To Go service, which only looks good on paper, can't make the H10 worth the price of admission.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been looking for a new replacement MP3 player for my Ipod 3G 30 Gig.  I was thinking about Ipos Shuffle, Ipod Mini, or Zen Micro (or Zen Micro Color).  Then by accident, I stumpled upon Irivier H10.  It is very small, stylish, and easy to operate.  It's got FM radio, voice/FM recording, color screen (to view pics), and other standard MP3 functions.  It's only $30 more than Mini, but has so much more to offer.  The sound quality is great (but not w/ the included earpiece) and there are 40 sound presets (including your own setting).  In the package, you will also receive a transparent plastic skin.  It fits the player perfectly and easy to remove if you choose to.  This usually goes for $8+ for ipod, and you get it free.  Sure, you can't view those pics on TV like Ipod Photo, but who cares?  What's the chance of you carrying a cable w/ you at all times?  The battery life is around 12 hours per charge and it is replaceble as well.  That means you can buy an extra battery for your long trip to extend the battery life or change it when the battery dies in a year or so.  It is a true Ipod Mini killer and I've used 2 Ipods, Sony MP3 player, and a Samsung MP3 players.  Strongly recommended!  Edit 1:  *After I went to Apple Store yesterday and played around with Ipod Photo, I'm even more impressed with H10 color screen. On Ipod Photo, you have to view the screen directly (right in front of the screen) in order to see the photo clearly.  Otherwise, the photo/lcd will look dim. But, Ipod Photo has faster photo browsing speed.  As I said before, viewing photo on mp3 isn't a priority for me and I'm very happy as is right now.  *I haven't have much problem/bug with this machine yet as others have described here.  The only thing that I've experienced is that once I connect the player to my PC, I can't see the "remove this external drive icon" in the taskbar after a while.  So, I simply unplug the connection cable/usb.  Luckily nothing has happened yet.  *Many people asked me about the skin, well, it is just the Ipod skin you buy in Apple store but fits much nicer on the player.  I can't stress how nice it fits on H10.  For my Ipod, I litterally have to force it onto my ipod (because it sticks to the player so much that the friction is making it hard to do). And yes, it will attracks dirt just like other skins. If you worry about the look of it, don't use it.  If you want a good protection for the player on the go, this is a good choice.

<Content>Do not buy this player as its sound quality is nowhere near to the Creative Zen Micro , Only good thing about this player is Good FM reception , It gives distored sound with EQ settings .I have tried with studio series sony headphones also , whereas with full volume and EQ settings Zen micro gives very ultimate sound. But if someone wants fancy look and facility to store the JPG files can go for this player.

<Title>the perfect mp3 player
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is more of a zen micro killer than an iPod killer...or perhaps its both. It seems to be based on the latest chipset from portalplayer and uses almost all of the features ( unlike apple). I have a iPod 40g for my collection but wanted something to try napster to go. Well, I found it. I am kind of in awe of this mp3 player. It seems to be a lot like the iPod in intelligent filing system and ease of use AND it looks pretty good too. Of course I love the color screen and fm. This puts the creative product to shame. The iPod is in a class by itself-- its the "in" player and might always be. However, if there ever was a true challenger its the h10. I am really happy to own an iPod AND an h10.  BOTTOM LINE: This is as close to an iPod to date as far as looks and feel, and has a ton more features. I doubt it will really hurt the iPod mystique, but it is far superior to any creative zen or dell dj products which look cheap and seem to be inferior in quality ( build). It blows most players out of the water. This is the perfect player for people who like iPods like myself, but want to try napster as well too. It's just a great mp3 player and I can't really express just how nice this thing feels in the hand and operates so nicely. It's more like a pda than a player in some regards. ( very advanced filing system, menus) I really think this is going to sell like hotcakes once they start circulating...and the most bashing will come from creative ( they also make dj) because they can see how much better the iriver product is.  The firmware fix is on iriver.com website now. iriver fixed the bugs that all the bashers said would never be fixed lol. What a bunch of losers on these review boards!

<Title>research this player before committing
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: great build, feels nice and solid;  - the touch pad is excellent very precise movement: tapping the top and bottom of the strip or simply holding it down allows excellent precision and accuracy.  - great feedback with the buttons (you don't have to wonder if you pressed a button when it's in your pocket). - sound quality is excellent volume from 0 - 40. around 20 is already loud enough for me. - color screen; big pictures will appear blurry, but it's expected with a small screen - very intuitive controls. the back button always brings you back to the last screen no matter what the last screen is. example: while in the picture browser i wanted to change the song click FF then click back and i'm back in the picture browser. - excellent shuffle mode algorithm: you will not hear the same song twice as it the player takes the played songs out of the algorithm - MTP = drag and drop if you prefer it more than windows media player. there is no propietary software (but drag and drop is slower than syncing with WMP. it's still not UMS) - excellent FM tuner - battery life is excellent, it actually gets about 12 hours as advertised - removable battery - comes with a iskin like case (but the case attracts a lot of dust)  CONS - IRIVER hurried to release this product; thus, the software isn't complete. there are A LOT OF BUGS. Hopefully, these bugs will be fixed soon with a firmware upgrade. here's some of the bugs 1. some might encounter problems with syncing with wmp i/o error 2. albums on player plays in alphabetical instead of by track number 3. the clock on the player might not work 4. the back light turns on and off randomly in some units. there are some more bugs... visit www.misticriver.net   - you can rate songs on the player but it doesn't integrate with windows media. so a rating of 5 on a song does not update your library on windows media. the player just put the 5 stars first and 1 star last in a list. - for some, this might be a con but not for me - once the backlight is off the screen is pitch black, you can't see anything. press any button turns the backlight on then proceed with function. so if you want the player to FF you got to press it twice. - file browing is slow in browser mode (not the music browser but the file browser the music browser by artist, title.... is nice and fast) - horrible tech support. expect long wait time. (called around 4:30 ish, never answered...finally at about 5:05 got a voice mail saying their hours are from XXXX to 5:00pm)  conclusion. i'm giving a 3 star because at $280 there are simply too many bugs with the player right now; with time IRIVER will release upgrades to fix these issues because it's their new flagship model. the functions and features of the player beats any player out there within the same price range. be patient with this player, it will be an excellent product if IRiver fix all the bugs.  for more research info goto www.misticriver.net click on forums then the H series   it's an excellent forum for support and faqs.   EDIT: regarding "tommygman" i'm glad your player works perfectly. and no i did not simply read something negative. I have a H10 myself and i'm waiting patiently for an upgrade. furthermore, i can tell you that the Korean version of H10 (UMS) which came out a month before the us version (MTP) already had 2 firmware upgrades while they're on FW1.10 the us is still on FW1.00 IRiver has a list of bug fixes which you can find at misticriver.net

<Title>Me likee iRiver....
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll just start by saying, I've had an iRiver mp3 player since April, and except for some stupid things done on my part, it's worked perfectly, and the little 190T of mine has even survived a five-foot drop on a hard stone floor, and has an excellent equalizer, and just adjusting the bass and treble gives it spectacular sound. Judging by others' reviews, I assume the H10 is no exception. As soon as I amass the necessary funds, I intend to buy this, and rock out! The removable battery was iRiver's smartest move in my opinion, and that will give it the serious edge over the iPod. Creative's mp3 players are fairly good, but a friend of mine has one, and the bass is nowhere near as powerful as from my little 190T. The sound overall from the Creative Nomad was diminuitive compared to the 190T.    People who like excellent sound, compact packages, convenient controls, and the complement of a removable rechargeable battery will not regret this mp3 player at all (and yes, firmware upgrades are a must for ANY mp3 player, and iRiver is sure as heck no exception.), and will find a good deal of use from it. Peace out. Chaos in.  I have a few other questions: can this player be used as a backup hard drive? I know that the 20 and 40 GB models can be used that way, but can the 5 gig H10 be as well?  Does the .TXT support mean one can read MS Word documents? That alone would have me drooling a veritable Columbia River. I like to edit my stories on the road, and being able to read over my stories to catch my mistakes would be a definite bonus. That's my bit. But do try and think outside the iPod. This one's a definite up-and-comer.

<Title>Small, Feature Filled, Awesome new player
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all I have to say that my new iRiver h10 has NONE of the so called "bugs" mentioned in an earlier review. I'd love to know how many people actually had these and if that reviewer just read something negative on a bulliten board and felt compelled to bash as if every player had a defect lol. I've been through this player and the manual and everything worked-- and I did check out the site mentioned about the h10 bugs too to make sure mine didnt have any!. Well, my H10 works like a charm and iRiver site mentions that any firmware updates will be posted as needed. 'Nuf said. Back to reality-If you have windows xp and want to use napster to go, it was tailor made for that but of course its great for any mp3's or wavs too. Instead of wondering what it has, let's just say it has just about everything and at a great price. The bonus is that this is a super high quality player that looks simply amazing. I consider this an iPod plus, the plus being fm, recording, removeable battery etc. Its a pleasure to hold and look , and with windows media player 10 its a joy with this music system they worked out ( with microsoft)that Im using. This thing is simply the best mp3 player available. The only con is that it doesnt use iTunes. Its going to be a huge success for iRiver- there is no doubt about it. Ive been using mp3 players since before there were any hard drive models. Its unreal to have one this small with all the features and such an intense menu system with color .jpg viewing  of photos thrown in too. I have it right here and love it already. Mine is grey and very sleek. The design looks 10 times better in real life. Im prone to be pro iPod but have to admit this is really really close in the iPod style department and way ahead in features. Conclusion: The H10 just came out. It's going to be a huge hit and because of this there will be a lot of negatives tossed about by competitors. The fact is that mine works perfectly, sounds better than the creative and rio players Ive had in the past, and importantly looks amazing compared to the competition. Highly recommend.

<Title>Coolest Player for the Money
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I absolutely love this thing. Design is hot and it has the perfect small form factor and frankly I dont know how they got it all in such a small package. I got through the options/features as there are a lot of them and its this is killer plus. I've never had so much fun figuring out a player. I haven't noticed any bugs in my lounge dark grey H10 . IMPORTANT NOTE: The picture here doesn't do it justice. The amazon.com picture is distorted. It has the player tilted which as any photograhper knows causes bad distortion. In real life this will take your breath away. Basics: Super lightweight color screen for photos. A  slim  0.6 inches thick weighing only 3.4 ounces!!!! Amazing touch strip control and removeable rechargeable battery with 12-hour + ( my home test) battery life. Great  voice recorder and a digital FM tuner with FM recorder. The best thing about it is how small it is. Its going to surprise you. But, its not too small. Cool small is more like it. If you don't fall in love with this I will be surprised. Features are important and it sounds great. Looks are important and it looks great. Price is important and its priced low for the features it has. There are a few mini players around now but none with the features this has that look this good. I guess that's what got me interested in the first place. Good luck with whatever you choose. Im a happy camper with my h10!   More info-" PlaysForSure-verified with Windows Media Player 10 with  for Auto Sync for music, photos and playlists. You can choose from a growing number of PlaysForSure download and subscription stores, -- comes with earphones, carrying case with belt clip, USB 2.0 cable, AC adapter, and installation CD-ROM. "

<Title>Awesome Player!  Be sure to upgrade the firmware.
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is hands down best in class...  Comes with great sounding Sennheiser earbuds (must have upgrade if you buy other players). Move over Ipod Mini, Creative Micro and Rio Carbon!  Uh, I forgot they don't have color screen to view photos.  :)  It's obvous that some earlier reviewers are slinging mud...  Hey Bill Gates showed Iriver player at CES 2005, OK!  Got it?  Iriver ROCKs!    Ipod was too well "fem" look for my taste.  Had Rio Carbon but it had terrible sound quality (PCMag was right and good riddance).  Have Creative Muvo and thought it sounded great (of course had to spend another $25 for Sennheiser earbuds as Creative's stock earbuds was TERRIBLE) until of course I got this awesome player!  Best part is that I was among the first 1000 people who got it on Superbowl Sunday for only $180 shipped from Napster including 12 months subcription!  So go get this player as great deal even at $280!    Update -  Hard drive failed on the unit I had.  Called tech support and had to wait 30 min plus but the tech support guy was wonderful and issued RMA on the spot.  Now that's service!

<Title>Great Mp3 Player worth the money!
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing it's way better than any other mp3 player I've used. Here are the specs: FEATURES  * Plays up to 150 hours of digital music* * 5GB of internal storage** * Vivid color display * Ultra-intuitive interface with convenient touch strip * Displays your digital photos * Slim, lightweight design * PlaysForSure enabled to play more of your music * Rechargeable, removable battery lasts up to 12hrs. * Built-in FM tuner and FM recorder * Integrated voice recorder * Ultra-fast USB 2.0 transfers * Supports MP3, WMA, JPEG and TXT files * Enhanced 3D audio (supports SRS WOW  PACKED WITH  * iriver earphones * Carrying case with belt clip * USB 2.0 interface cable * Installation CD * AC adapter  PC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  * Windows XP (Service Pack 1 or higher) * CD-ROM Drive * USB Port  It has a great navigation system almost as good as the iPods click wheel.(but that thing is really hard to match) It's features rival that of it's opponents and tops them all. The 3 players I checked out were the iPod mini, the creative zen micro, and of course the H10. I didn't think the Mini was worth $250 when it can't use Napster has no microphone or radio. The Zen micro was my 2nd choice because it has a radio and mic plus it looks way cool with the blue LED in the back and the colors but that is more of a gimmic than a plus and the touch pad doesn't work that well. Then I saw this by accident actually. I downloaded Napster onto my comp and was looking at it's special offers to see what would work with it. I was going to get the zen micro then I finally checked this thing out and I was captured. Since the iRiver H230 looked ugly I never cared abought them but this thing is beautiful and it looks professional. The color screen is a little to small but it looksamazing compared to most LCD screens like the iPod so when you turn it the image isn't negative. It's simplistic button layout is a definate plus which makes it so you don't have to take much time to get used to it. Also it has volume control on the side unlike the zen and iPod. The sorage is fine with me because I don't need my entire music collection with me at all times.  However you can't directly link your H10 to a digital camera. Plus it has a few minor bugs. Hopefully iriver will make a firmware update.(mud slinging lol must be a fanboy of iriver)  I wish the price was $250 so it could compete with the iPod mini and zen micro easily. But when you make an investment like this you know it's going to work and it does. It also comes with a great iskin which protects it from any fall. This thing is small though I was suprised when I opened it up. Supposedly it weighs less than the iPod mini and it's a photo player!!!   iRiver has set a new standard for photo viewing mp3 players and micro harddrive players at the same time.

<Title>very nice but not perfect
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>pros: nice look, good feeling in hand due to metalic body       slim and light weight        color screen is bright and clear       easy to navigate ( after you get music or photos in to it)       Fm radio is terrific       sound is good, i am still testing the 30 EQ setting       btw MX 400 is a nice earbud  cons: i am using windows xp sp2, wmp 10 , but it still takes        me several hours to figure out how to sync playlist and        photo, since normally i just drag and drop music to mp3       players. I dont know windows media player can creat a    playlist of photos beofore. Also the gel case from the box seems useless, it doesn't provide anything to protect the beautiful screen, Maybe I need to get a cell phone screen sticker.   All in all, h10 is the best 5 g player of its kind( if you say ipod is the best it is also ok, ipod is ipod, who cares)

<Content>Actually, 4.5 star. Very well built machine. Evrything is perfect.  Due to the misleading of the user manual on connecting and disconnecting from a computer, I substract 0.5 star. It is noted here that you can not handle it as a regular USB hard drive, as most of the mp3 player in the market.  Strongly recommend it to anyone who is seeking a mp3 player.

<Title>A few major flaws.... 
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For most of us looking for a fast and reliable music player, this one appeared to be the one. At least, at first sight, it had potential. After working with an iPod for a while and its horrible iTunes music manager or Sony's music software, I felt relieved that a digital player would now be easily recognized as a mass storage device, thus facilitating the file transferring process from my PC. However, this single feature is worthless when it comes to managing your playlists. Lets face it, your not managing 50 o 100 files, you have 5 gigs of audio tracks in storage and it would be nice to find them easily, not to mention, program the way the files are played. You cannot create your own playlists unless you use WMP, and that is a problem. You should be able to transfer your playlist files either from Winamp or any other player to the device or simply create your own in the H10 based on the folders the music is located in. Tech support is inexistent, and no software is provided with the device.   Most of us use a single media player of our choice, not necessarily Windows Media Player. In my case, I've been using Winamp for several years (mostly for its simplicity), and I would certainly like the option to transfer playlist as an .m3u.   Pros - Low price - Superb sound - Multiple audio playback support - Built in Radio and recorder - Drag-n-drop capabilities  Cons - Lack of playlist and music management - Scroll pad is not to useful - The photo viewer is as bad as it gets  Overall, I believe this product is not recommended for beginners, unless you like to spend time surfing the web trying to find answers for all your needs. Still, its ahead of its competitors. Sad.

<Title>Nice when it worked, but poorly made and unreliable
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice gadget for the 1 year and 11 days that I had it, until it suddenly broke completely, for no apparent reason, and I had to buy a new player.  The warranty is 1 year!  $229 for a disposable MP3 player is a lot of dough.  Initial use was painful due to flaky firmware that iRiver eventually improved, they just released it too soon.  That got better but the user experience with iRiver plus Yahoo Music Engine was awful, largely due to Yahoo Music Engine being brand new.  Better now but this is still a collaboration between three vendors (iRiver, Yahoo, and Microsoft) that is not always smooth.  Bottom line is that I'm deeply unhappy with having this device fail on me 11 days out of warranty.  I have replaced it with a Creative Zen player and will never buy anything from iRiver again.

<Title>Not worth the headache
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise.  The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player).  Finally, iRiver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products!  As a owner of two iRivers (H10 and the 120), I have seen for a while how they function: they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month, and then they leave that product to produce a new one.  It seems like they have a new Mp3 player being introduced every few months.  Their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of, and if you do, they will simply say you need to send it to the factory (occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free, though).  Be smart, stick to a Creative, the new Toshiba Gigabeat S, or (clench your fists) an iPod.

I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....

<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The H10 is a nice looking device that doesn't work.  I have a constant reoccurring problem where the device will hang when you select a song or playlist.  The hourglass (initializing) will remain until the unit runs down the battery.  The only solution is to reinstall the firmware which also deletes all your files.  You have to use Windows Media Player to transfer and sync files.  WMP is clumsy to use.  It is not user friendly at all.  Anyway, after the firmware reinstall it will work for a while and then just start hanging again.  I used to be a faithful iRiver customer, but not any more.

<Title>H10 has been an excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have read some of the negative reviews and agree with some of them, on a very limited basis. Most I disagree with. Maybe some of these folks have bought lemons. I bought my first H10, the red 5GB, over a year ago. Since then, for family members, I have bought:  2 5GB H10s 2 6GB H10s 1 20GB H10 (listening to my 20GB as I write this. Someone else in the family has the red 5GB).  Needless to say, I think it is a great product. Sounds great, great display, great features. I have always made sure I had the most recent firmware on all of them. Maybe that is part of the problem the others are experiencing...they are not taking the time to do "routine maintenance". Response for service issues from iriver is not great. They take too long to respond to my emails, but usually do in the long run. I think you have to be a bit computer literate to use WMP (Windows Media Player) to do the song syncs/playlists. I really like the WMP now. It took some time to get used to it. Playlists are a bit difficult to do, but doable. So, I give this product 4 stars based on my extensive experience with the H10. It sounds better than the Dell and Creative MP3 players I have and far more flexible. Thinking of buying the Iriver Clix now.

<Title>Falls below expectations
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The specifications for the H10 looked good when I was reading it, but unforunately this mp3 fell short of my expectations.  Positives: Color screen Radio Tuner  Negatives: The USA version, which is what I bought through Amazon.com, isn't recognized as a "mass usb storage device" in Windows. This means you are forced to used Windows Media Player 10 in order to sync files with the player. When you do try to sync albums to the H10, they do not automatically play in order.  The time and date on the player was always a day or two off. This is a silly bug that should've been caught before they released this product.  The sad part is the iRiver has released firmware fixes for their International and Asian version of H10, but they completely ignored the USA version. How can iRiver release a product like this and expect it to compete with such products as the Creative Zen Micro or Apple iPod?

<Title>Amazing potential, poor execution
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Disclaimer:  I got this as a gift.  Had I been able to choose my own player, I likely would not have chosen (and still would not choose) this item.  Let me start with the good stuff:  1) Excellent sound quality!  Nice comprehensive (and customizable) EQ, too :).  2) Very small, comfortable to hold in my hand, fits easily in the pockets of even my tight jeans.   3) Plays protected WMAs.  HUGE plus!  Wouldn't accept any player that didn't support this (:ahem: iPod).  For just $15 a month, I have hundreds of thousands of songs at my fingertips... it's a fabulously liberating opportunity that you can't comprehend until you actually experience it.  4) It's neat to be able to listen to NPR (radio), and the extensive preset slots are handy.  Now for the icky stuff:  1) I find that the side controls are impossible to operate by touch.  So when the H10 is in my pocket, I can't feel where forward and back are.  That's bad design, IMHO.  2) I had to format it before I could use it with Napster.  3) The aforementioned inability to natively play songs in album order.  This is a horrendous bug, particularly when playing albums whose songs blend into each other (musicals, thematic albums, etc.)  4) I don't like the earbuds; while they offer great sound, they keep falling out of my ears (though this could be simply a personal-preference/personal-problem kind of thing).  5) What use is the photo feature?!  It doesn't automatically show album art.  It does a dastardly bad job of compressing full-size jpegs (jaggy-city!).  And the screen is smaller than the display on my actual camera.  When would anyone actually use this darn feature?  6) Sync'ing playlists is problematic with WMP10.  When I delete a song from a playlist, for instance, WMP10 says "Deleting [songname] from iRiver H10" but it doesn't actually delete it.  So, synchronizing should be renamed "copying"... which stinks.  I need the ability to actually keep my playlists in SYNC.  Only workaround I've discovered:  Delete the playlists off of the H10 and simply recopy over the newer version.  7) There's no two-way metadata sharing.  For instance, I can rate a song 3 stars on the iRiver, but that rating isn't carried back to WMP when I sync.  For that matter, is there even ONE-WAY metadata sharing?  I haven't noticed the H10 doing anything with the ratings I have made on WMP.  Blah :(  8) It sometimes takes too long to shut down (more than 5 seconds).  9) This is more of a Napster negative than H10 negative, but still... so many songs are purchaseable but not transferable.  That's really rude and unfortunate, IMHO.    Add to this the legendarily awful support of iRiver, and I must say, I'd not encourage anyone to actually pay money for this item.  Maybe with a firmware update things'll be better, but I've been burned so often in the past waiting for promised firmware updates, only to have the company simply release a new product version a year later and offer a wonderful "$20 coupon" and insist that we shell out $229 for a new player.  Great.

<Title>Mine doesn't work with Napster
<Date>Thu Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was one of the first to get the free H10 with the one year subscription. Since then I have run into the 2 mayor problems. 1.- Tracks disappear from the directory in my computer without logical explanation, they simply go missing. It happens EVERYDAY with LOTS of tracks. 2.- When I try to synchronize the H10 with napster, it ALWAYS stops in the middle of the process without reason. I already have reinstalled napster, reinstalled media player, reformat the h10 and none of this solve the problem  When i finally get a few songs on the player, and I try to skip to the next or previous one it take about 5 seconds to start the next song. Believe me, is annoying.  I won't recommend neither the device not napster to go to anybody.

<Title>spectacular
<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well first of all, I read many reviews on products that were in my price range before I decided to get the H10. I looked at the Apple iPod mini (of course), the creative Zen Micro and then the H10. Before I even herd of the H10, I bought the Zen Micro and was very impressec after the first couple of days of use. Although, after a week, it started to freeze and start up by it self even though I turned if of and locked it. After trying to upgrade the firmware via creative.com I sent it back. A couple weeks after taking a second look at the mini my uncle suggested me to take a look at the H10. Sure some reviews mention how it may not be working well or freezing and what not but reviews about the mini and the zen micro said that and still, many people seem to be buying them. So I told myself that I might as well try the H10. I've been using it for 2 weeks now and have had no trouble at all... but it only get's 4 stars because you never know what can happen right? So hopefully it will just keep on impressing me and I'll be able to use it for a while. Still haven't tested out the text characteristic but I hope it works just as well as the rest. So... all I can do is suggest you to try it out because it's always worth trying something new... and maybe you won't get a bad version which apparently are not to rare...

<Title>Could Be Great - But Deeply Flawed
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Beware!  This is a great-looking player - sleek, color screen, and so forth.  But, as of this writing, it has serious flaws in functionality and sound.  - Any significant bass distorts when using my Koss Portapro headphones (I've used them for many other players with no problems).  I'm not talking thunderous bass - just typical stuff, with equalizer set flat.  - Player only lists (and plays) songs alphabetically, rather than by track numnber, which has proved to be even more annoying than I thought it would.  - Player can take a long time to skip from one song to the next.  It is possible that these problems will be fixed by a firmware upgrade (that does not yet exist).  It is possible that they cannot be fixed by firmware, or that iRiver will simply choose not fix them.  I'd strongly recommend that propesctive buyers wait until all is repaired rather than taking a risk.

<Title>Nice looking but fails in several regards
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Battery life averages about 6-7 hours. The problem with the color screen is that you can't see what is playing unless you are actively using the menus. It isn't like a regular black and white lcd where you can still see even without the backlight on.  Does not work properly with Napster-to-Go. I downloaded all these tracks and lost of them due to license sync errors three times in a week.   I returned it after a week and a half and got a Creative Zen Micro, which has worked beautifully with no trouble and actually lasts 11-12 hours.

<Content>I was really excited to about the iRiver H10...until I tried to set it up and discovered that it only works with Windows XP and nothing else. It had all the features I wanted and it would have been great, but I am not changing my operating system just to use an mp3 player.

<Title>Looks so good, but beware: Napster-to-Go compatible player
<Date>Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start by saying that this is probably the slickest-looking player on the market, in its price range, that runs with Napster-to-go.  Full color screen, intuitive interface, and easy integration with Windows XP.  Here are the things I really didn't like about this:  1.)  Plays songs in alphabetical order, not in the order they appeared on the album (regardless of whether you did Napster, or ripped your own MP3s from CD).  For someone like me, this was the biggest frustration.  2.)  Broke within 2 weeks, TECH SUPPORT IS VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT.  One day, the thing decided to lock on boot, and their online recovery tool didn't do a thing.  I usually don't buy that extended warranty everyone always pushes, but in this case it could really save your bacon (I was within 30 days of purchase, so I simply returned it).  Called their tech support 6 times, and the first 5 times I simply got busy tones.  6th time I got through--and waited 2 hours for support (lucky thing I had two cordless phones, as the battery nearly died on the call).  Talked to someone, and within 5 minutes they said I'd better return my defective unit.  I did this, and replaced it with a Creative Zen Micro.  Much happier now.  3.)  Seemed to "lose" songs.  Some songs I could find on the file browser, but not in the library.  Very weird.  4.)  Recovery tools on the device were pretty much nil.  If it stops working, hope you're within 30 days, or that you did spring that extra cash for the extended warranty package.  You pretty much have no other options to you.  One day, I hope I have the opportunity to clean up their customer support operation.  My experience with them was the main reason I decided to return the player for a different one, rather than hope I just had a defective one.  &lt;u>A customer support group this bad is indicative that the IRiver folks don't stand behind their product&lt;/u>.  So, be warned and beware.

<Title>Two bad units
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Unfortunately, I can't comment on the quality of music playback as I never got that far. The first player would only display a white screen. iRiver technical support informed me that I had a "bum unit". Thankfully, Amazon has a very efficient return policy, but the second unit didn't do any better. It froze on the boot up screen, after waiting only ten minutes for technical support we went through various fixes before I was again informed that I had a bad unit.   I'm now returning the units for a refund. I don't have any confidence in the quality of the H10 and it doesn't help that included in the paperwork is an orange flier with "STOP" typed on it, instructing you to contact iRiver support before returning the product. It only leads me to believe that they have had numerous problems.   iRiver does earn one star with very adequate technical support, but it's unfortunate that the quality of product requires that support.

<Content>Software was out of date when purchased as new.  Was unable to use until I updated it...which based on the instructions from Iriver were a bit difficult.  Love the unit though..very functional.

<Title>I just returned my iRiver--what a great feeling!
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Do you remember how great it felt to break up with that lover where nothing in the relationship worked?  It was like a load was lifted from your shoulders and you could smile again.  That's how I feel about my ex-MP3 player, the iRiver H10.  I was very excited when I first took it home.  But after charging it I found that I couldn't navigate the screens for ten seconds without it crashing.  Oh, not to worry, there was a firmware update available.  Still, it bothered me that iRiver would sell something that useless.  What about the people who bought it before the update was available? Anyway, I updated to the latest firmware release, but it was still WAY TOO BUGGY to be usable.    I would select a song, and it would decide to play another one instead.  On other occassions it wouldn't play at all until I rebooted.  Sometimes the scroll bar worked, but more often than not I would have to work it for a few seconds (or longer) to get it to respond.    I finally got tired of constantly fighting it and returned it.  Ahhh...freedom.

<Title>Buy if you want problems
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like iRiver products generally and I have the 1 gig player and it works great... but the H10 Iriver player is a piece of garbage.     Number one:   The darn thing cannot be completely turned off.   That's right!   You turn it off and the screen goes blank but it stays in standby mode.   This is because the unit is so slow to open its library in the first place.   Meanwhile, your battery goes dead because your unit has been on for three days and you didn't know it.   Yes, it stays on after you turn it off and lock it in the off position.   I contacted Iriver about this.   Their advice.   "Sir, just pull the battery out."   Yep, that's what they told me.     2.  If you have Toshiba computer equipment or a laptop, forget Iriver working with your computer.   It won't.  It won't ever work.   Iriver doesn't know why their unit doesn't work with one of the most popular laptops in the world and they don't give a damn.    3.   Horrible tech support.     What happened is they made this player and they knew it had flaws and dumped it on the market hoping people wouldn't care too much.   It's a travesty.   Perhaps some of their other units work good but avoid this model at all costs.

<Title>Great Product - Few Flaws
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the iRiver H10 5GB for Christmas, I knew I was getting it because I picked it out myself. I couldn't wait to open it and get songs on it because it had really cool features.   So far I am really enjoying it. Right now I have over a thousand songs on it which is something I wanted in my MP3 player. It does everything (that I know of) an iPod can do and more because it lets you listen to the radio which the iPod doesn't let you do unless you buy something for it. It is really easy to sort through it because you can search by artists, albums, genres, titles, and playlists. I uses pretty much only the artists and titles way of searching because that is the way I know my music. It also has a lot of EQ settings so you can change the sound to make it how you want it to sound. It is also really easy to navigate.   The only negative I have is that some of the songs that I deleted from the player still show up on the screen when I search through the songs. So if I click on one of the songs, that show up as still on the player, then it goes to a different song. I downloaded the firmware update that it told me to download before I put songs on it so I don't know why it does that. I don't know it it is something I did or not.   It is also really easy to transfer songs onto the player. You can also put pictures on it, which I did, but I never really looked at them so I took them off. The quality wasn't the greatest but I didn't expect it to be exceptionally well since it is just an MP3 player.   To get an iPod with all of this you would spend well over $300 but I got mine on sale for $200 inluding tax. I just recently bought some Sony MDR-XD400 headphones off of Amazon for about $75 with shipping, which are over $100 at Best Buy. I am hoping that they sound better than the earphones that come with the player. The earphones aren't terrible but they definitely could be better. I will probably be getting some better earphones also because I don't want to be wearing huge headphones in public and school.   So overall I would rate this MP3 player really well with just a few flaws. It is cheaper than an iPod of this size and everyone has an iPod so that is why I got this and you should get it also. I would recommend this product to everyone.

<Title>iRiver H10 vs. iPod nano
<Date>Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While the iPod nano looks a little better than this, WHO CARES, the nano scratches easily, fingerprints are easily visible, and it doesnt have an FM tuner or voice recording capabilities.   H10:  Holds 1200 songs on the 5g model Holds too many pictures to count Has FM radio Voice record and radio record, ooooh Click wheel, sort of, except its not a wheel GREAT DESIGN  Shuffles songs Holds text, I think Comes with Sennheiser earphones, not much on the market better than that Comes with a rubber case 18 hours of battery life  iPod nano:  1g = 240 songs 2g = 500 songs 4g = 1000 songs Also holds many pictures Design could be better, easily scratches and shows fingerprints No FM radio or voice features Ability to shuffle songs Click wheel BAD headphones. bleh.  The only thing I really like about the nano that the H10 doesnt have is games, they're pretty fun. Weird marketing fact: The 4g iPod nano (1000 songs) is 250 dollars, hmm, the H10 holds 1200 songs and is 20 dollars less, (keep in mind it also comes with 40 dollar sennheiser earphones) now wouldn't you want to pay less and get more, I would.        -chris

<Title>Very Disappointed
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been a Rapsody customer since the first few months it was in place and I have always loved their model (subscription for unlimited songs).  When they came out with the ability to transfer these songs to a mobile device, I was all over it.  I upgraded the membership, went and purchased the product they advertised (iRiver H10 - 5GB) and thought I would be in high cotton.....  Not???  The device locks up always.  Controls are hard to find and use.  Rapsody software does not work with the device most of the time (lock ups, bad syncs, extremely slow).  User interface is extremely difficult to use (slow, not intuitive in places).

<Title>VERY POOR customer service
<Date>Tue Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, it takes a lot for me to write a bad review as I like to give the company time to stand behind it's product.  I recieved this player as a gift for Christmas.  One month later, the player would not turn on.  Amazon will no let you return this item so I had to go directly to iRiver.  So I returned the player in the beginning of February (at my own expense) to get a replacement.  iRiver sent the raplacement 1 1/2 weeks later by UPS.  UPS then "lost" the package so it was my job to contact iRiver and have them tell UPS they lost it (policy).  It has now been 5 weeks since I informed iriver that UPS lost my package.  I have called and e-mailed them several times.  Each time I call, they inform me that I must wait, that is my only option.  I may not speak to a manager, you must have an iriver employee "escalate" your case and then a manager can call you.  I have escalated the case 3 times and no manager has called me back yet.  At this point, I have learned that iriver is not a company that stands beind their products.  To make a customer wait 5 weeks (when they were initially told 8 business days), not let a customer talk to a manager directly, and not answer emails is unacceptable in my eyes.  Iriver has had my mp3 player longer than I have had it in my hands.  Very frustrating.  If you do decide to buy one (they are nice players when they don't break) just hope yours doesn't break.

<Title>Buyer's remorse:  Doesn't work properly 70% of the time.
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my iRiver for six months for use with the Yahoo Music Unlimited service.  I've had ample time to evaluate the ease of use of this device with the service and regretfully have to report that I'm so very, very disappointed with it. The player freezes constantly and must be reset by removing the battery (even with recommended firmware upgrades).  Six months later, I can't scroll through my playlist without it freezing up before getting through half of the song titles (I currently have less than 1GB on it). Also, the battery life is abysmal and if 2/3 of the battery is discharged, the device will freeze up, forcing you to disconnect the battery to restart the thing. I did extensive research before my purchase and am very saddened that I have this little red hunk of junk.  To think that I spent even more money on it to buy some decent ear buds since the ones that it came with are cheap and uncomfortable.  30% of the player for 100% of the price.
