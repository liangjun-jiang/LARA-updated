<Title>Excellent Little Player
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a good little player.  The menu is not as appealing to the eye as an iPod but just as easy to use.  In addition to playing music it also plays FM radio and takes voice memos.    The battery life is good and on top of that the battery is replaceable.  The FM radio reception is also excellent; my house gets poor reception for many FM stations but they all come in cleanly on this player.    The main downsides here are the fact that to transfer music you have to use Windows Media Player (Napster, Musicmatch, etc. can also bu used).  By default WMP transcodes MP3s to WMA and changing this setting is buried in a location wihtin the player that isn't the first that most people would look.  The player itself, without a case, feels a little fragile.    One big beef I have regards the playlists for the player.  The documentation that is available for the player (either the paper one that accompanies the player, the one available online or any help files on the SanDisk site) is very incomplete.  It only outlines the basics, and not very completely at that.  There are two access modes for the player and those modes control how music and playlists are stored on the player.  If you want to have playlists created along with music added to the player then you have to have the player in Auto Deetct mode.  The player will stay in this mode but can be switched out automatically by the likes of the Audible player when it transfers tracks and will stay in MSC mode until switched back manually.  How to work with this has been posted on my blog (which is a reposting of the response I received from the SanDisk tech support).    http://crichton007.blogspot.com/2006/01/sandisk-sansa-m200-series-mp3-player.html  I recommend this player, especially if you're looking for an alternative the more expensive iPod but be prepared to sacrifice some intuitive enhancements that you would get with an iPod for the money you will save.

<Title>Best Value in a flash-based player so far
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the m260 (4Gb version) from Circut City for $169 As others have said, it's easy to use, very attractively priced, sounds good, and doesn't require any additional software beyond WMP10. Initially, I could not get mine to sync with Napster-to-go on a notebook through a USB1.1 port. Moving to another notebook with USB2.0, Napster syncs fine (Janus not compatable with USB1.1?) I haven't tried Audible yet, but I see there is a firmware update for the m250 to fix the reported Audible bug.   Note - there are two sync settings: MSC and MTP. Use MTP to transfer protected content, then switch to MSC and transfer unprotected content several times faster using Windows Explorer (treats Sansa as a USB drive). Another observation: this player looks strange, until you find yourself holding and operating it single handed. Screen size is small but perfectly adequate. Though it's thicker than other players, it's less noticable in my pocket than a set of keys. The only regret I have is that I've just seen Sansa's forthcoming e200 series (March 06). For the price of an IPod nano, it looks just as attractive but far more capable.

<Title>Good for the price - bad firmware
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought the 4MB version and have been pretty satisfied with it so far.  A little thicker than other players due to the battery, but I don't have to worry about recharging another portable device before I head out.  Incredibly light, so it's great for the gym.  My big complaint is how the unit handles playlists.  It's tru that you can drag and drop mp3 files very easily in Windows explorer using the MSC transfer mode, and you can then sort through those files on the player by artist, album genre, etc.  If you want playlists, you have to transfer them in MTC mode from Media Player or Musicmatch, etc, and the songs transferred for that playlist cannot be individually viewed or played, because the playlist transfer does not carry the mp3 tags with it.  I wish SanDisk would fix the firmware to address this issue.  Overall, happy with my purchase but hoping for a firmware upgrade.

<Title>Could be better
<Date>Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm happy enough with it's playing but I'm giving this 3 stars based on it's lack of documentation.  No where do I see that you have to change the 'advance' setting to "on" in order for the playlist to function.  No where does it say the playlist you create will disapear everytime you connect the device to the computer, whether you sync or not. I shouldn't have to search this information out on the internet and even requested a replacement from Amazon when I thought my device was not functioning correctly.

<Title>Could be better...
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros:  -- Inexpensive. High GB/$. -- Lightweight -- Runs on AAA (I personally prefer alkalines because I can replace them unlike the built-in rechargables. Also, rechargable alkalines are cheap) -- Comes with nice arm band and a cover. (Cover is thin though) -- Bright display  Cons: -- User interface sucks. It takes some time to figure out what is where. -- Good luck if you want to create playlists. See other reviews for the same problem.  -- Very small display.  The things that I can live with but I wish it... -- had a better sound quality. It is not bad but there is room for improvement -- were smaller. Kinda bulky. Buttons are unnecessarily big and display is small. -- had a color display.

<Title>Handy player with a few kinks
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This time I made sure to buy a device with PlaysForSure compatibility and this SanDisk has it. Great. All the features of this player are great -- with much of the exact same functionality of the iPod (with a slightly less intuitive interface). I'm fully satisfied with it.  The only issue I have is that the player seems to spontaneously decide that it doesn't want to play (Rhapsody) subscription music. I haven't tried it with any other subscription service (yet) but after a couple hours on the phone with SanDisk (the first time) and Rhapsody (the second time) the solution both times was to delete the "DRM" folder in WindowsXP. (This has all sorts of negative consequences.) I can't be sure the problem is the player, but it would seem to be the case. For this amount of money and with the PFS certification, I would expect to have avoided these sort of major issues. Disappointing.

<Title>Perfect for what I need
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've seen several reviews for this player (a couple comments here, but mostly on other review sites) that have basically stated that it's "just not an iPod".  Well, yeah..it's NOT an iPod.  I don't think SanDisk is trying to be an iPod with this player, and I'm thankful they're not. I wanted an MP3 player so I could listen to music while running.  I needed something small, lightweight, easy to operate without having to break pace - especially when on the treadmill - and something that could take the bounces and jostles associated with running.  I didn't care about the iPod brand, being able to watch TV/video, color screens, or having double-digits worth of GB memory. This little SanDisk player is great for me.  Within hours of it being delivered to my front porch, I had several CD's worth of music loaded on and I was listening with no problems.  It was super easy to load music on it using Windows Media Player.  It did take some reading to figure out how to work all aspects of it, but that rings true for almost any electronic device.  I did the various functions while reading the instruction manual - the one on the included disk, not the super brief quick start guide - and was able to figure things out the next time with no problems.  And with 2 GB of memory, I have plenty of room for my music.  I've loaded probably 10 CD's on it already, and I have plenty of room to spare. As for using it for my intended purpose - while running - it's wonderful!  I used the included plastic cover and armband and off I went.  I'm able to skip songs and change music while maintaining pace.  The sound is great - even with the little foam earbud covers, even despite the noise of the treadmill.  It's definitely much easier than trying to deal with a discman and one single CD.  I've used it for probably 3-4 hours already, and the battery indicator has dropped just one section. A tip for the instruction manual - pop in the little disk and use Windows Explorer to find the pdf file, then copy it to your computer.  This makes it much easier to come back and look something up, rather than having to wade through the disk's contents. If you want a very nice and perfectly functional MP3 player - and don't need/want the iPod brand and price - then this player will easily meet your needs.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Great but...
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great little MP3 player especially if you want to be moving while using it. Unfortunaley, there is a known problem with the player that Sandisk has not been able to fix with new firmware. At random times the sound will emit a crackle and skip (remember what a scratch did to your LP playback?). Sandisk customer support tried to help, but finally advised me to return the player if I was not satisfied. I used it for Audible books. I've tried two of these and both had the problem. Luckily Amazon is most gracious with returns.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned three SanDisk Sansa M240 models that store 1GB. The first one I purchased with a in store warranty, but the player did not work right out of the box. So I took It back and got a second Sansa which developed an intermittent short within two months causing sound quality to diminish significantly. I took the second Sansa back and cashed in my warranty on a third SanDisk Sansa m240 1GB along with buying a second in store warranty. In two months my third SanDisk Sansa m240 developed the same intermittent short. I'll cash in my warranty on a different player this time.

<Title>For the price, this is a great mp3 player!
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second sandisk M-series. I previously had a 512 MB that I used for two without a single problem. I replaced it simply because I wanted a larger memory capacity. There are a lot of more expensive mp3s that might be a little better in terms of featues, but the small gain comes at a much higher price. For someone who's not a techie (like me), this is extremely easy to use. All I have ever had to do was connect it to my PC and drag-and-drop music files. Flawless!

<Title>M250 alot for the money
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My previous MP3 players have all been iRivers, so I'm spoiled. The iRiver iMP-350's (I have two), are CD and CD-RW driven, and have a very extensive feature set that is obviously iterative and well thought out and is the result of several product cycles. I also have iRiver H120 and H140 harddrive player/recorders, and they are supported by Rockbox. Again, powerful very extensive feature sets for these products.    In comparison, the m250 is very simple, but it doesn't sound noticeably worse playing my MP3 files. 2 GB is about 3x more capacity than the iMP-350's have (my H120 and H140 have 30 GB and 40 GB HDs respectively) and the FM radio sensitivity appears to be significantly better than that in any of my other carry-along electronic devices, including those expensive iRivers.     Pros:    Graphic equalizer is a great feature, however it only works for files, not FM radio. It's 5 band and you can increment or decrement each band individually and save your settings when using the Custom option. I've not looked at the preset EQs. Knowing that I'm deficient above 3000 hz, I just boost the two highest ranges.     The AAA battery concept is terrific. I have AAA rechargables and will always have the power I need. I don't believe battery life is going to be any kind of issue with decent rechargable NiMH AAA's.  The FM radio reception is exceptional. The weight room in my gym is a basement and I've never been able to listen to any but the most powerful stations in there with any of my on-person portables. That rules out my favorite station, a 500 watter. I've brought my Sony WMF-FX465 cassette AM-FM walkman in there and all my iRiver devices and none of them got more than spotty reception of that station. Even my radio-dedicated Aiwa CR-LD101 is unable to get a clear signal in most places in that room. However, this m250 gets near perfect reception in nearly every location! I probably won't push my luck down there and will keep it in mono mode in the FM settings, but I'm floored that I can actually get decent FM in that room.    Volume is more than adequate even with my low efficiency Etymotics ER4S earbuds. I think the included earphones sound fine, and they actually fit quite well and I would use them in most places, however they don't have the sound-blocking ability provided by the Etymotics, and that's why I won't be using them in the weight room, on airplanes, etc.    The AB repeat is a very nice feature.   The m250's hold switch is another crucial feature, much appreciated. My iRiver devices all have this but the expensive Aiwa AM/FM receiver does not, and it's sorely missed.  I really like the ergonomics. People complain about the toylike aspects, but that doesn't bother me. It seems sturdy enough, so far. The flare at one end is perfect for knowing where you are in the dark. With very little experience I already am able to use all the functions in complete darkness as long as the backlight is set to at least the minimum non-zero setting, 3 seconds.     Cons:    The iRiver players support subdirectories as a way of organizing your music. You can elect to play the selections in a particular subdirectory, for example, or repeat a directory, a song, randomly play the contents of a directory, or the whole device. The m250 is far more primitive. I'm not yet in the habit of using MP3 tags for my files, but the m250 is going to force me to start using them. For me it would be easier to just keep things organized using directories.    The armband is something I probably won't use, or sparingly. It's necessary to remove the plastic cover in order to change the battery, and it's not easy to do so. I'll just keep the m250 in a pocket, when possible.     The player does remember where you were in a file if you turn it off and then turn it back on. However, if you change to FM radio and back again  to file play mode (or to a different file) it forgets what file you were listening to and where. I play a lot of really long files (3 hours or more), so this is a minus.     I had a defective m250 before I got my present one. The first one had a version 4.x firmware, and the latest 4.x after installing the Sansa firmware updater. Since I often play MP3 files that are in excess of 3 hours, it's nice if I can fast forward at more than a snail's pace. The first m250 I had featured an accelerated fast forward when you kept it on for a while and I could navigate to the middle or end of the file rather quickly. The new player came with October 2007 2.2.5A firmware, and the updater will not upgrade it. Evidently players using version 2x firmware will not accept version 4x firmware, and probably vice versa. The player I have now will only fast forward at a very slow pace with no acceleration, and in this I am disappointed.  Evidently a firmware defect, the m250 I have (and the previous one) lacked the stopwatch feature (until I stumbled on a way to bring it out of hiding, see below).    Finally:   Here's a VERY helpful portion of a review I just spied at cnet (after enabling "Smart Menues" I DO have the stopwatch feature!):  "The user manual STINKS, I feel very bad for non-techie types. I'm guessing most people won't be able to use the unit to it's full capabilities. Check out "Advanced/Smart Menus", you use the left/right navigation to move around menu options (instead of having to keep hit menu & start all over from main menu, Smart Menus brings you back to your last place in options)."  Having turned on Smart Menus, the Stopwatch feature appeared in the top level menu. It remains there now whether Smart Menus is enabled or disabled. Obviously, the feature not appearing initially is a bug in the firmware. Smart Menus is totally undocumented in the manual. I wonder how many other features are undocumented or improperly documented.  If you happen to find a Sandisk device that's promoted as "refurbished," I suggest you give it a wide berth. Sandisk does not have a reburbished products program and if you find one, it's something set up outside of Sandisk's system and Sandisk will not honor the warranty. In the event that you have a defective device, you will have to deal with whoever you bought it from.

<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>While I enjoy the increased memory for more music and the recognition of more file types, I miss the old buttons I had on my 512. Buttons simply offer more tactile feedback than the membrane areas (I guess that's what they're called) on my newer m250. Sometimes these membrane areas don't respond and the A-B function I bought this unit for?; fugget about it! It's very difficult to isolate small segments of music with the new membranes. This is very important for me to learn a piece of music by ear. If I had known about these drawbacks prior to buying this 'new and improved' model I never would have bought it.

<Title>Off to a Rocky Start
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player works pretty much as advertised, but the lack of documentation in the package was staggering.  Such instructions as there are assume that you are ripping CDs into a Windows Media library - and then synchronizing the Sansa device from that program (2 weeks ago I would not even have understood the previous sentence).  My musical relationship is with RHAPSODY - and so getting the M250 to work with that web site was pretty much a matter of trial and error.  But - 4 days from the time that the M250 arrived on my doorstep - I had my music loaded.  You pay more for the NANO - but loading music from iTunes has to be easier than my experience.  My last concern focuses on the number of songs which the product packaging says this device will hold. Using WMA compression, Sansa claims up to 960 songs.  I guess that's 960 songs, with each song lasting about a minute. Loading normal, progressive-rock-type material I am carrying a little over 300 tunes.

<Title>Excellent Value for the Price With Bookmarking
<Date>Sun Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I use this device mainly for listening to audio books. When it is powered down (ie., turned off) it will, when powered up, begin to play at the power down location. It is my understanding that many players on the market do not have this feature ( "bookmarking"). However, be forewarned, if music files are also downloaded, the bookmark feature will not save a position in the book if you move out of the book and listen to a music file. The bookmark feature only returns to the position in the particlar file that was last listened to. There is no multiple bookmarking feature. Thus, the device is not really suitable for contemporeneous book listening and music listening.  I am not aware of any other device that allows multiple book marking but this would be a very useful feature. In effect, without this feature,  you will need to buy two of these devices. One for music and one for books. (In fact I have purchased a second for this reason. This, in effect, added significantly to the overall cost)  Device seems to be durable. I have dropped it several times and it still works like a champ.  It took me several hours to learn how to download files using the  windows media player but I attribute that to my lack of techno savy more than anything else. (The provided instructions were somewhat inadequate on this point).  Battery life is about 15 -20 hours. Although you will need to pay for batteries, keep in mind that once an ipod's internal battery is shot a new IPOD must be purcased. The replaceable  battery on the Sansa is also a nice feature if it will be used for extended periods away from electricity for recharging, eg., an extended camping trip.  This device fits nicely in the palm of the hand but is certainly not as elegant or light as an ipod. It does get the job done, however, and for a lot less $.  Post script 3-26-06 The earbuds after three months of daily use have shorted out where the cord attaches to the plug-in jack. This problem was not caused by any obvious misuse (e.g. accidentally pinching the cord or otherwise cutting it). (I notice a review below refers to a "shorting out" defect but it is not clear whether the problem was with the hardware or the earbuds.)

<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the M250 with 2 GB memory recently. It is a nicely built unit but the interface is the worst I have ever come across. The software/firmware has a mind of its own and move your files to what ever folders it thinks the music or podcast belongs. It will break up the tracks from one CD and put them all over the place. Who in Sandisk thinks that they should decide where I should put my musics and how to organize my files. What a piece of junk as far as the software is concerned. Please read other reviews and comments. I should have read all reviews and negative comments before I made my purchase. Sandisk must change the software/firmware. From all the reviews I have read, I don't think they care.

<Content>Yes, this is my baby. So lightweight and easy to use, great for working out (keeps "strange" strangers from talking to you and makes the time go by quickly). Had bought the SanDisk 1gb. Gave to a friend when I had 450 songs in my library and 1gb would not hold them. Both models have great sound, but the controls on this model are easier to use and more substantial; worth the small price difference. Created folders by music genre and can shuffle within those folders, had bought a Coby and it would not perform this seemingly simple feat. Any novice can use. Would highly recommend it!

<Title>Excellent mp3 player for low price 
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I purchased this mp3 player(2ea) after reading news paper review. I was expecting more durable construction that actual.  One thing I notice is when I connect to my computer it show as sansa m250 and it will contain 2 folder(data and audio) which upload mp3 music to audio folder. But if I connect to my son's computer it will have 3 folder(config, data, audio) and all the songs I upload in the audio folder will not show. First I though just outdated firmware problem so I went to sandisk website and download current f/w and installed. Now my comp. show 3 folders and my son's computer show 2 Folders.... Hummmm....   I e-mail the tech support and suggested me to reload f/w again.. while I was flashing f/w it crashed(freeze). now it will not power on or reconize as sansa 250 on my computer, so sandisk is going to replace this(Sansa M250/ 2G).   But other one I have have no problem with. I actually got this under $100 so can't complain about the price. it has multi-function (radio and voice recording) and good sound quality. Control is very easy and don't let plastic casing fool you, it's abs plastic and not easily break. They could make the battery cover batter design. Overal it's excellent item for the price.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I hate to bash anything and I have to consider how little I paid for this but I have not had very good experiences with it. Regardless of how much you pay for something, you expect it to work and at least do what is advertised, this is not the case with the one I have. The first problem I had was with Napster To Go, when I plug the device in, Napster does not recognize that it is plugged in at all even though it is listed as a compatible device so I couldn't upload the 500 songs I just downloaded. The funny thing is, I also have a Sandisk Cruzer that Napster recognizes when that is plugged in but it is not a compatible device. The second problem that I had with it: it would just turn off for no apparent reason. I started noting the times when it would shut off: while out jogging in the cold, when the battery was low, when it was in the complimentary armband carrying case, and when I would listen to a particular album or artist. This happened a lot less with a fresh battery and when I carried it in my hand but still happens nonethess. Also, I have not had much of a problem since the weather has warmed up. The third problem is that the directions state you can create playlists by holding the white button in the middle, not so on mine. I hold it for the recommended two seconds and nothing happens. Finally, my brother bought one without talking to me first and his wouldn't even power on initially. I don't want to mention all of my problems without listing some pros. I found it easy to upload all of my tracks onto the device using WMP 10, even if it does jumble the tracks and artists. This can be remedied by using the listen to a particular artist/album. I think the sound is pretty tight for such a small device and the low cost. One more thing I ought to mention is that I haven't taken it back, I guess I am content with complaining about the disappointing one that I have. Maybe I will check out best buy's return policy on no receipt or packaging. At any rate I would recommend NOT buying this, unless you like being disappointed.

<Title>Excellent Product for Low Price
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After hours of deliberation, I purchased the SanDisk Sansa M250 2GB.  It is excellent.  I use it at the gym while running and love the quality of the sound of my downloads and the radio.  The earphones fit fine and I have small ears.  The only reason I did not rate it a 5 was that in order to remove a song, one must remove the song from the playlist on the computer while the MP3 player is connected.  Other than that, I would recommend this to anyone!!!  I would purchase this again.

<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really liked the player until today when it "locked up" on me.  The display is frozen and the back light is on.  It doesn't respond to any buttons and removing the battery doesn't fix the problem.  Basically, its just junk now. You might think something like this would work for more then the 20 hours I used it.  I've seen other reviews where people have reported exaclty the same problem.  Don't buy it.

<Title>The Worst...
<Date>Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After some research, I ordered this item with high expectations and was extremely disappointed. The playlist feature did not work out of the box so I contacted Sandisk. After four useless back and forth emails they "allowed" me to return it to the place of purchase OR send it, all costs to me for postage (including return and insurance) for a replacement. I opted to return it to the place of purchase and I will purchase another brand after some more research. In sum, the accessories are super cheap, the player didn't perform even the simplest funtion well and the customer service was horrible. I would not recommend this item to anyone.

<Title>Great product for what I need
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this for when i run. it's pretty basic but for the price, exactly what i need. the headphones are actually pretty good in terms of sound. although, they tend to come lose during the run but i've found most aftermarket ones (even ones that wraparound) aren't really any better. would really like to find some headphones that allow you to mute them without having to fish the device out of your pocket.  was a bit surprised about battery life. would be better if this one could be charged via USB on your computer. but it takes a AAA battery and only lasts a few hours. i don't know the exact number.  i don't like how quickly the device turns off when on pause. about a minute i think then it shuts off. it then takes 20 sec to turn back on but it does remember where you were in the song which is handy.  the playlist feature is pretty tricky. i was using rhapsody's player (device comes with a 1 month unlimited download from rhapsody which btw is a really great system other than synching playlists with the device) and no matter how many you create in rhapsody, only the first one shows up in the device.  so i switched to MSN's media player. by far the worst system to work work in terms of setting up a playlist. But, it does properly synch the playlists to the device.  For those worried about size, 2GB is more than enough. I have 113 songs on there any only takes up 500MB. I'll likely never use up the space unless i use it for data storage which is a handy little feature.

<Title>pretty good, but no shuffle/random play?
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was delivered today, and I've already filled it up with 2G's of my music.  I bought this just to take to the gym, and I'm pleased with the size and weight.  It is also easy to use, and I don't think it will be a problem while on the treadmill.  I didn't even try the arm band and case that came with it because, well, it's cheap plastic (looks like a kid's toy).  I bought the gel case when I purchased the player, so I went ahead and put that on.  (And I'll be heading over to give that five stars of its own momentarily...)  I took it out of the packaging and plugged it in to my laptop, which is running Vista, and held my breath...  it recognized the device and installed the drivers with no problem.  Drag and drop songs is super easy, and all went smoothly.    I tried using the ear buds that came with it, but without the foam covers they hurt my ears and with the covers they won't stay in my ears, so I'll be using different headphones.  Though I will say that these ear buds were pretty good quality sound if you can tolerate them.  My only complaints so far are that (1) there does not appear to be a random or shuffle function.  I see a repeat loop, but no shuffle.  That sucks, because I don't want to listen to things in the same order each time.  That's just silly!  Which leads me to (2) the EasyStart CD (which I'm assuming contains the full manual) will not run on Vista.  [Hey, I know I should be happy it recognizes the player at all...]  If I want to fully research the possibility of a random feature or figure out the playlist feature (the "Quick Start Guide" was a bit lacking in explaining that aspect), I'm going to have to explore the website, and I'm not in the mood for that headache right now.  I'm all for saving trees by including manuals on disc, but they should be in a .pdf format or something, and not some program file that can only run on XP.    I'll revise my rating if the player decides to freeze up on me or crash like others have.  But so far, it's doing great.  Way cheaper than an iPod, and I love that it uses a single AAA battery, which is easy enough to keep on hand in my gym bag.  No more remembering to recharge batteries!!

<Title>The good, the bad, the ugly
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>-FWIW, I bought a different-capacity m250 model but the review should apply to this model since the features are the same. -The Good features are its cheapness, simplicity, relative ease of use, and rechargeable replaceable batteries (you don't have to send it back if the batteries go bad).  -The Bad features include being out of date. I'd also recommend a zip-lock bag if you use it outdoors or while exercising. -Its completely U-g-l-y feature is a remarkable sensitivity to controls.  If you want to rewind just a little, you have to remember to put it into the Play mode and then hold the rewind button Just Right -- you need to hold it for just long enough, but not t-o-o long.  That's OK unless you  use it while doing something else (like exercising). If you don't hold it quite long enough, the rewind button carries you w-a-y back to the beginning of the track. If you hold it down too long, you may wait for several minutes to get back to your place again. That's perhaps OK if you are listening to a short song, but if you use the m250 for audiobooks, lectures, auto-recordings, or classical music, you may find yourself losing your place. And your patience. A whole lot.  -Hope that helps and hope the newer ones are a bit less sensitive to minor control adjustments, or that they have a different set of controls.

<Title>Slow DL speeds, loose battery cover, cheap buttons
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When downloading music to your M250 it takes forever.  I previsouly had a creative Muvo MP3 player & the downloads was flawless.  Also the battery door is loose & rattles. When you press the buttons, sometimes it takes 2-3 presses for it to register to move onto the next song. Very annoying. I wouldn't reccommend this product to anyone. My advice is to buy a Creative Brand MP3 player since they're close to the same price. Plus they rock. I just ordered a new Muvo m100 2GB MP3 player & should have it in a few days. This SanDisk is going on eBay.

<Title>Feh, I'd rather have something else.
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The SanDisk Sansa M250 is at best, a middle of the road MP3 player. I purchased this bugger shortly before the holidays as a little gift to moi, wanting an upgrade of my older, crappier 512mb player (of which I had infinite trouble, but I digress). I saw it had 2GB, and thought to myself, "Alright!" Some people complain "Aw, man! Only 2 gigs? Lame," but it's enough for my purposes, and a fully loaded memory slot can hold quite a lot of songs. It doesn't have a slot for memory cards, so you only have 2 gigs, period. There are functions for the radio, recording sound yourself, and listening to audio books, but I don't care about any of these to try them out. You might, though, so consider that before you buy it.   The battery is a simple AAA, and is hot-swappable on the fly, and only limited to the amount you have on hand. It lasts about 19 or so hours ideally, but the more songs you have on it, and the longer the backlight is on drains the battery faster. I usually never have more than 100 or so songs on it, but I'll pile more on if I was going somewhere. On the surface it seems adequate, but I have more than a few complaints, though.  The interface is interesting. The songs are listed alphabetically, by song title, but can be broken down into artist/album/etc. However, if your MP3s are not listed properly, the m250 will scatter them about your playlist like so much confetti. It's a real pain to have to go through your entire library and make sure all your files are listed correctly. But that's just me. Maybe a prospective buyer likes randomness in his/her songs. My old player added the files on as you copied them, but lacked the "nifty" subdirectories. But it still allowed me control as to what I wanted to listen to when I wanted to. You can't delete the songs on the fly, but have to do so when the player is plugged in. That is, if your player doesn't do so first (see below).  The battery usage is buggy too. If the battery gets too low certain functions stop... er... FUNCTIONING. The backlight is first to go, making it difficult to navigate in the dark. Then cascade failures happen, and the player freezes and becomes nearly useless until a new battery is installed.  Recently, my hungry little Sansa ate my ENTIRE LIBRARY OF SONGS. I plugged the [...] back in to realize there were no songs on my player, yet memory had been consumed. Was was once 1.89 gigs is now, permanently, 1.29. The firmware update is also useless as I currently have the latest version, and SanDisk has yet to resolve my problem (it's been four weeks already). Their customer service department is less useful than a case of syphillis. They tend to ignore you and your problems, their way of saying "Thanks for buying our product." I've not been able to solve this problem myself at this time. The instruction manual is little more than toilet paper, and offers no help beyond turning the thing on and off.  All in all, this is a Re-Gift to myself more than anything. I let my brother have it, and I bought a much better player that has yet to cause me anguish.

<Content>Loved this product when I first received it - as did my friend - I bought each of us one. Easy to load, lots of memory, almost intuitive controls.  However, it did not take very long for my friend's player to break down - in just a few months.  He used it every day, but then that's to be expected for such equipment.  He had to buy something to replace it.  Mine is still going, but I use it infrequently. Did not feel good about paying so much for something that didn't last at least a couple of years.

<Title>It broke within a month!
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Oh, my poor Sandisk! My m250 finally gave up the ghost a few weeks after I dropped it(a third time but still)and the face cracked. Said odious crack grew and blue stuff started seeping in. It worked, even if I could barely see what song was playing.   The good thing--I suppose--is the size, it will easily fit in the palm of your hand and won't height your pockets down. It was quite easy to organize my music and also worked as a USB Drive when nessesary. Also, I shouldn't expect so much from a cheap product. I got what I paid for, in all honesty.  The bad is still that it broke quickly even for a cheap product and I miss my music being right at my hip all the time. I also must comment that it was a pain to try and get it to play songs in order, most was luck and lable making.  In closing, if you need something around the house or something for the gym that don't need to go with you everywhere like mine did, perhaps with a stronger case your's will last longer than mine but make sure you get a damned good warranty on it.  RIP M250.

<Title>This MP3 is Perfect for Me
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Sansa M250 for about a month and love it.  I use it to listen to audio books while walking my dog or riding the lightrail to work in Portland, OR.  I can easily plug it into my car's cassette adapter to continue listening in the car.  My son has an IPod Nano and thinks it is the best, but I have trouble manuvering the Nano's controls and no problem with the Sansa.  Since my family goes camping a lot, I like that I can change the battery and not need to plug my player into a computer to recharge. 2 GB has been more than adequate for me, but I would probably buy a 4 GB if I had to do it again. I had no problem with the software since Windows Media Player is pretty standard and the headphones are fine (except that the white foam pads got pretty grimy while I was gardening - totally my fault)

But some mp3 players play as many songs as ipods . In the end I like mp3 players especially sandisk mp3 players there the best . And I hope you make the best decision .

<Title>Feature-filled MP3 player
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently got the Sandisk M250 MP3 player for a present, and I absolutely love it! It's really simple, yet it's full of features that I have come to appreciate a lot. I'll give you my pros and cons on this player, starting with the cons, because there's not very many of em.   Cons: --included USB cable is only 6 inches long, and can pose a problem    for those who have USB ports in the back of their computer.  --included case is adequate, but it's a pain to put in and take out the player. The case is made of a soft plastic that sticks to  the player, making it a pain to use. I got the silicon case, and itis soo much better; it is very easy to take off and put on, and also provides better protection for the player. I found it easier to press the buttons on the player with the silicon case on.  --backlight is on the dim side, and could be lighter, but it's good enough for me.  --does not have a clock, like other Sandisk players. I would just like one for convinience.    Pros: --large tactile buttons have excellent response, and are easy to press.  --4 line display gives a lot of info (track name, artist, album, battery life, time elapsed, and time left). --text on the screen is very large, and easy to see.   --very good sound quality (to me) --runs on AAA batteries, giving me the option to carry several batteries on long trips. I bought a pack of rechargeable NiMH batteries to cut down on costs.  --has a stopwatch, and it can run while you play music. It's ideal for me, because I can listen to music and time myself when I go running.  --has a info section that tells you how much memory you took up and how much you got left. It divides it down into your music memory and recording memory.  --FM radio has fairly good reception and you can preset 20 stations. Certain stations are as strong as I hear in my car's radio.  --lightweight, even though it is not really thin like other MP3 players.  --has custom EQ that you can mess around with along with several other set EG like Jazz, Pop and Rock.  --you can alter backlight timer from 3, 5, 10, 35, 45, 60 sec, and always on options.  --you can mess with screen contrast if you got weak eyes.  --supports languages Dutch, Spanish, English, French, Italian, Netherlands, and others.  --powers up or powers down in about 4 seconds; far better than my old Rio Carbon which took 10 seconds to boot up.  --navigation is soo darn simple; it's all done with the main buttons on the front.  --dedicated volume buttons prevent the inconvinience of having to go into the menu to change the volume like on other MP3 players.  --this player can get really loud; using my Philips surround sound earphones, I rarely listen to my music above 1/3 level, even in noisy places.   --voice recorder; I don't use it, but it's nice to have it as an option.   I hoped this review helped!

<Title>Poor machine, poor customer service
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player was purchased as a christmas present, and when opened it never worked properly.  But because it was longer than 30 days after purchase, Amazon wouldn't take it back, and Sandisk won't give a refund but only a new player.  Very disappointed in this player, I can't say if I like it because it NEVER worked.  Never try to return anything to this company, they won't give your money back even if their player is defective and you don't want a new one.

<Title>Frozen, Tech Support Says They Know What Is Wrong But Are Not Allowed to Tell Me.
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the usual freeze problem which is well documented on web.   You load music via computer, disconnect properly, it freezes booting or re-initializing the library, and then just freezes on boot-screen every time you use it. The computer no longer recognizes it, can't play music, it is totally useless.   Have been waiting 14 days for RMA envelope to arrive.   I called, they connected to RMA department, which was closed. This after 15 minute wait.  When I finally got back on, and really asked some questions, they told me they knew what the problem was, but were not allowed to tell me what it was. I am not making this up. I was stunned.   Their policy is to upgrade for free to e200 4GB, but that isn't what I wanted, as I use for camping/hiking, need to be able to switch batteries.   So obviously, they released a product with some major flaw they won't acknowledge.  It would be one thing if their RMA department is on the ball, but it isn't.   So now I'm stuck with an MP3 player it'll take weeks to get replaced, which I like to use for exercise every day.  Avoid this company at all costs. They are dishonest.

<Title>After owning it a year...
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I decided it was probably a good time to sit down and really give this item an honest review.  I purchased this to aid me when I began working out last fall.  I needed something light weight, small and without all the gadgets of say, and ipod.  I just wanted music and enough room to download an array of music that could loop around so that maybe I heard the same song once every other week.  The 2gb affords me with room for 200+ songs.  The AAA battery that goes in it holds a charge for about 2-3 weeks, depending on how often I get myself to the gym.  I keep a spare battery in my gym bag just to pop in when the latter dies...something my workout partner can't do with her ipod. It also comes in handy when doing yard work, cleaning house and jogging.  It fits into a pocket or can be used with the arm band.  The protective plastic cover isn't pretty, but I'm not trying to score with beauty on this. It downloads from Windows Media Player, something I wasn't using until I purchased this, but it has worked out ok. If you're looking for it to do some of these things I have mentioned, then this is a good deal.  Simply music in your hands, easy to travel with and download...inexpensive and easy to use.

<Content>Great product!  My husband and I are both "old dogs" with no previous MP3 experience.  One of my coworkers (geek guy) recommended this product, and he was right.  It's very user friendly, and my husband loves it - he travels a LOT and it was his birthday present for use on the airplanes.  This model allows for audio books, so he can sit back and listen instead of reading.  I also purchased the iRiver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter so he can continue listening while he is in his rental cars.  He loves it!

<Title>So much pain for such a small device
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased two of these MP3 players with 2GB storage; one for myself and the other as a gift to a friend. Soon after I got them I moved back to Turkey. The one that I bought for myself got jammed in day 3. I tried to use the customer service, but they kept sending me automatic messages; they suggested me to format the MP3 player that was jammed and would not connect to PC or pass the "sansa sandisk" screen. The one I gave as a gift also jammed after few weeks. I send mine back to US and paid all the cargo expenses so my sister would replace it with a new one. My friend who lives in Turkey, after 7 months is yet to receive the new one from Istanbul. They asked for several documents although the product was defected and company knows it. They even asked for confirmation email from amazon which I only kept by coincidence. After all the files and the jammed MP3 player was send they said they lost the device that's why they cannot send a new one. It has proved to be the most disastrous gift I have ever given to anyone. In addition, the device is bigger and thicker that it is in photographs and when you use the menu while you are listening to something you hear a tiny scratchy noise every time you move up and down. It is advantageous that it uses AAA battery. However screen lights go off soon after you use the device for an hour or so, you can not change the energy saving settings. This is a mediocre MP3 player and although I am still using, I do not recommend it to anyone.

<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my MP 3 player in March. When I first got it I liked the size of it and the fact that it ran directly off of Windows Media Player.  But, after 8 months of owning my MP3 player it has locked up. It turns on and off, but it won't come out of the initial screen. I have contacted Sandisk through email about a warranty and did not receive a response.  That was 4 days ago.  I would not recommend this product!!

<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player was purchased as a Christmas gift, for a family member. I also have one and other similar SANDISK players. If you are looking for a straight forward player (no video, photos - etc) that just works properly and doesn't take rocket science to operate - this might be the one for you. It plays (MP3) music - very well, uses disposable AAA battery instead of expensive (to replace) Li-Ion and won't cost you a kidney to obtain. A SMART LITTLE PURCHASE!!!

<Content>I purchased two of these for my son and daughter last year for Christmas gifts. At first they were fine, easy to use (these were our first mp3 players)and they really enjoyed them. After a few months my daughters began to act up with the screen and not play, but if she shut it off and turned back on it would be fine. Then a few months later nothing, it quit all together. Then a few months later my sons quit working too. I would not recommend this product at all. VERY DISAPPOINTED!

<Content>I have had this mp3 player for several months and I love it!!  I haven't had any of the problems mentioned in other reviews.  It is very durable.  I have dropped it several times, even spilled a soda on it and it still works perfectly.  As far as the problems with playlists go,  the easiest way to set up a playlist on this player is to set it up on your music service before you sync it up.  Then just go to playlist in the menu and find your artist or album.  I would definitely buy this again

<Title>Works with Rhapsody To Go
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Works with Rhapsody To Go. This was the main reason why I purchased this model. Sound: pretty good, however not as good as players from Creative Labs. Screen: Not very ergonomic, but readable. I would like to adjust scrolling speed, but not possible. Equilizer: 5 standard settings + custom. Works pretty well. Tuner: Pretty sophisticated, with auto scan. Mirophone: available, but I haven't tested. Battery: standard alkaline AAA lasts for me about a week, NiMH 900 mAh lasts forever. Cons: a) looks ugly, b) battery cover loose and must be fastened with Scotch tape from day one. I checked other players owned by friends; all have the same problem. Summarizing: EXTREMELY good value for the monies assuming that you are not obliged to show up with most expensife, fashionable and up-to-date gear

<Title>Sent it back
<Date>Fri Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to listen to three things: cd's that I'd ripped to my computer, Audible downloadable audiobooks and NetLibrary audiobooks. I ended up returning the item after a frustrating experience with their customer service folks who were unable to fix my problems. I could download things sometimes, but the Sansa would index incorrectly. For example, the music will transfer to the sansa but it would not play. Sometimes a chosen song would play, sometimes a chosen song will appear on the screen in pause mode and would not get out of pause mode. When I'd go back to the play menu, all items on the Sansa would list with that song title.  I'm quite technically inclined, so this wasn't operator error. Ended up getting the Creative Zen Nano Plus. It is working very very well.

<Title>Despite High Hopes, a Definite No-Buy
<Date>Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was simply looking for a relatively inexpensive mp3 player to take the place of my mp3-compatible portable CD player, and this one looked ideal.  Like you, I read various reviews online and, probably again like you, decided that it was impossible to meaningfully sort the adoring from the despising.  Well, you can believe the comments of the frustrated.  After my first-night rush to get songs on the thing, I noticed that it wasn't reading the ID3-tag information (e.g., artist, song, album), which is fatal on a device that sorts based on it.  Despite reasonable customer service, the SanDisk tech folks were unable to solve my problem.  In fact, one of them sent me something that he described as a too-new-to-be-online firmware update.  As it happened, the firmware was for a device that doesn't even exist and... it crashed my Sansa beyond repair.  So I returned it and received a new one within a week through Amazon's fantastic service.  A little thought and research, and I realized that the problem that the SanDisk techies hadn't been able to solve was that my computer (just a couple of years old) apparently couldn't work with the unit in MTP (music transfer protocol) mode, so I merely had to change the Sansa's USB setting to MSC mode.    Perfect... well, at least until I tried to load a small label's promotional disc of 100 mp3s onto the Sansa and a single non-mp3 file on the CD crashed the thing again.  This time, Amazon, realizing that the problem was either the product or me, wouldn't exchange it, offering instead (again, with that fantastic service) a full refund.  After further research and impulse, I picked up a Philips GoGear.  (Unfortunately, I couldn't buy it from Amazon, because Wal-Mart is the only store that sells an 8GB version, which is the exact same price point as the 6GB version that everybody else sells.)  Granted the GoGear is approximately twice the price of this Sansa, but you pick up another 6GB of memory and a color screen.  More importantly, the GoGear has the ability to be reset and the included software includes options for further reviving the mp3 player.  And lo and behold, when I tried to load that promotional CD onto it, the software warned me that one file wasn't a recognized format, thus avoiding any problems altogether.  In other words, the GoGear gave the impression that somebody thought the software through, rather than doing what SanDisk seems to have done: throwing its product on the market in too much of a hurry to accommodate the slightest error on the customer's part.

<Title>So Tiny!
<Date>Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>And that's a good thing.  It's light, and easy to work.  I received it a few days ago, and am still figuring out certain functions.  I was sent a free 31-day trial of Rhapsody muscic service with it, and so far I'm having a great time with it.  I wish the back light stayed on longer, or that there was a button I could push to make it go on, but those are the only improvements I'd make on it.  WMA files are smaller than Jpg, so I can get 900+ songs on it.  I've also downloaded two books on it already, and still have a GB of space left.  Forget the overpriced Ipod with proprietary software.  I got this out of the box and had synced music to it within 15 minutes.  Hurray!

<Date>Fri Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the M250 4 months ago to replace a 1gig MP3. It is an great player for what it is (an inexpensive, semi-intuitive player).   Pros: Easy controls, good quality sound, FM receiver, lots of options for playing groups of songs (by artist, album, favorites, genre, year, playlist and spoken word). This is great for me because I travel often and I enjoy listening to audio books.   Cons: The case itself is flimsy and feels like it could break into 1000 little pieces if dropped. I bought the silicon skin for it which give some additional padding and a belt clip (belt clip is not great). The screen could be a bit larger as well. Not the most intuitive menu.  Bottom Line: I recommended this MP3 player to friends and family who do not want to spend the money for an ipod.

<Content>The SanDisk Sansa M250 2 GB MP#3 player has to be one of the best on the market today. Large easy to see and read LED readout and large easy to use buttons makes for super easy navigation through all the players options and selections. Great sound and volume range. Sleek design allows for easy LED readout yet is light enough that you almost forget you have it around your neck. Takes a "AAA" battery that I find much more convenient than a recharge required battery pack (no wait to recharge...just pop in a new battery ...very convenient if you are not near a computer or have the charger with you). Will hold approximately 750 - 800 songs. And the price ......$54.99 .....what a bargain....you can't go wrong and will not be disappointed.

<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm really liking my Sansa Sandisk.  I've had it several weeks now and I use it almost everyday.  I'm on my second battery which maybe is just because it came with a cheap battery.  The battery that came with the player only lasted about 7-8 hours.  Still not a bad amount for how cheap the player is.    Pros of this player small light weight easy to use uses 1 regular AAA battery so no charging necessary decent ear buds good sound   Cons not a super long battery life when you change songs to quickly it locks up (I had to actually remove the battery one time to get it to reset) A belt hook would have been nice (It comes with an arm band but it was to tight on my arm to use)  I've still not figured out the feature to have my own personlized play list but I do like the set up of the menu overall.  You can play by artist or album.  I think I will like it even more when I've figured out the playlist feature.  I would definitely recommend this player as an option to a more expensive IPod.

<Content>This player worked GREAT!!.. at first! I'd seen some reviews about this player stating that it just stopped working, but bought one anyways thinking that mine would somehow be different. Three weeks later it randomly just began freezing when I turned the player on... Luckily it was still within Amazon's return time limit, so I had it replaced.. BIG MISTAKE.. i should have gotten a refund!! Four months later (Way out of the return time frame), my "new" player began to do the same thing!! For the last month and a half I tried emailing Sansa's "customer service" email address, and haven't gotten a single response. This is the worst thing you could spend your money on!! Other people give it great ratings, but that's because they haven't had it long enough for it to break down on them!! Now I've spent 70 bucks and have nothing to show for it...

<Title>Perfect no frills player
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned the 1G version of this player for over a year (purchased from Amazon) and recently purchased the 2G version (not via Amazon).  If you are looking for a small, easy to load, easy to use player that includes FM reception, plays both MP3 and WMA format files, and doesn't include fancy options like video and photo viewing, then this is the player for you.  My biggest concern when looking for a new, larger capacity player was that I wanted one with a removable/replaceable battery (as I dislike having a player that is dependent on a non-removable/replaceable battery).  Unfortunately, those are becoming harder and harder to find.  This player works with either a rechargeable AAA battery or with a conventional AAA battery.  That means far less hassle when I travel or find myself in other circumstances where I don't have AC power available (happens more than you might guess).    I've also found that the FM receiver in this little player is far superior to the FM receiver in several other players that I've tried.  If you want a player that gives you the option to listen to FM radio, this is an excellent choice.     All in all, this is the perfect player for those who just want to listen to music or the radio and are not looking to impress anyone w/ their fancy technology.

<Content>I purchased the Sansa M250 2GB player as new. I loved it so much that I recommended it to a friend who was also in the process of looking for an easy to operate and not too expensive player. She, like me, also loved it.  I had less than 15 hours play time on mine when I got the -Frozen Sandisk screen.  However, I was lucky....my friends lasted less time than mine.  Her player did the the same frozen screen.   I called Amazon regarding a refund and since it was past the 30 day return/refund time frame...I was out of luck.  However, they gave me a toll free number to call the maker.  They were kind enough to do an even exchange for a new one.  They also paid the shipping.  I just had to find a box to put it in.  I'm in the process of waiting for them to send me the new one.....we'll see how it goes.  I was just so disappointed that I had taken the time to put over 450 songs on the thing and it just quits working in such a short amount of time. I do LOVE the player..if the next one works!  I dont think I would go spend money on another one.

And that is why does it play random songs out of order?? i put it in the order that I wannted it in and it goes like in alphabetical order or something maybe it's just because i'm new at this and I just got it like yesterday but I don't know why it does that but otherwise this is great and I strongly recommend this for someone who is looking for something less expensive than an apple ipod.

<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this after seeing consumer reports name the 1 GB version a best buy. Since I own a fair amount of music, I thought the 2 GB would be a better purchase. What a great player! It's super easy to use and great for those of us that just want to listen to music without paying for all of the bells and whistles that come with an iPod (which I would never use). I've recommended this to everyone I know who is in the market for a player. My only regret is that I didn't buy the 4 GB version!

<Content>Very affordable and nice. The interface is very intuitive. Sound quality is good, but a tad lesser when compared to the Creative player. The player doesnt play songs by folders (only goes by MP3 tags) so had a hell of a time finding the song I wanted.  all said and done, a neat little affordable player - highly recommended.

<Title>Avoid this product
<Date>Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first I purchased didn't have the necessary software on it so we were unable to load anything onto it. So I sent it back.  Amazon was very fast with the replacement. Unfortunately, the second was just as flawed as the first. We were (supposedly) able to load 100 songs on it. However, it would only play one group of eight songs. When I tried to delete the songs via my computer, the songs didn't show up.   Exasperated, we sent the second one back and purchased an 8 GB MP3 player from Creative Labs instead. It worked just fine, so we purchased a second, which is also working well (the touchpad is VERY sensitive, though.)

<Title>FALSELY INDICATES IT SUPPORTS AUDIBLE
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this device to play audible format ([...]) books.  It says right on the box that it supports that format..even comes with a startup membership to audible.  WRONG.. I went to audible to activate the device and they told me that SANDISK FALSELY advertised that it supported audible.  They have been waiting the flash codes and sandisk still has not sent them.  I tried contacting SANDISK to complain and get direction but there was no response to my concerns.  I would NOT buy this device again and I am questioning if I should purchase other sandisk products, if this is par for the course for their customer service.

<Title>Excellent Flash Player
<Date>Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Note:  the previous reviewer is mistaken--the Sansa WILL play Audible files.  Just go to the Sandisk website and download the new Firmware update, and everything should work fine.  This is a wonderful little player, even setting aside its low price (I got it for $130 from another site).  The sound quality is very good, and the custom equalizer (which works quite well) allows you to set the music pretty much however you want.  Moving files to the player is simple (I've used MP3 and WMA files so far, and they've all played perfectly)--you don't need to install any new software, just simply drag and drop or cut and paste.  The controls on the player are great:  simple, intuitive, and fast.  You can find any particular song quickly, and you can shuffle all songs or even just the songs by a particular artist.  It won't recognize folders, but I'm guessing this won't matter to most people since the player automatically compiles the ID3 tags for your songs and arranges the music by artist, album, and song.  Additionally, since it's a flash player, the Sansa also doubles as a normal flash drive for data file transfer.  I researched different MP3 players for literally dozens of hours (and actually bought a different one, then returned it), and in my view this is the best value out there.  I highly recommend it.

<Title>excellent little player
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this about a month now and performs well. Great sound, FM radio, voice recorder, what more could you ask for. I get about 16 hours of battery life per AAA. I've also dropped it a few times already and holds up well unlike my previous Rio Nitrus which stopped working after i dropped it.  There is no software to install for Windows XP and its simple drag and drop. The navigation is straight forward you can play by artist, album, and other methods. For some reason though, it doesn't seem to recognize the track numbers in the id3 tag even though it sees everything else fine so it plays them out of order. I believe it plays it in the sequence you put it in the player.  The FM reception is mediocre but the voice recorder is excellent. Also, the picture is a little misleading in its thickness. Its about 3/4 of an inch thick.

<Title>Good, not great, mp3 player with some warts.
<Date>Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got one from CC for $115 less $13 for refund of a Rolling Stone subscription allowance. For a little over $100, it's a very good value. The sound is pretty good (not great) using a set of Sony Fontopia MDR-EX51LP ear buds. Did not even try the phones packed with the player as they look pretty poor. The unit is made of modest-quality and thin plastic, especially the battery cover. (They actually give you an alkaline battery, not a cheap zinc, by the way.) You need to be careful when changing batteries to not break the locking tab. It comes with a clear vinyl (like a cheap rain-coat) cover and an arm band with Velcro. Both are adequate, but no better. The controls are easy to use with no instruction needed. For "books-on-tape" transfers, when you turn the unit off, it remembers where you were on re-start - a good thing, as Martha would say. They have you use either drag and drop in Explorer or Windows Media Player to upload music and near as I can tell any play lists you create in W MP become albums on the player, not playlests. I don't know how to create a playlist on the player as there are no instructions, but there is a playlist category on it. Go figure. W MP is not all that easy to use, for that matter.  Given that a 2M flash drive will still cost you almost $100, a little over that for an mp3 player with a servicable FM radio and voice recording capability is not bad at all, even with its warts. I doubt that other brands at that price level are any better. I'd buy it again.

<Title>Solid player, good value, minor faults
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the 3rd flash based MP3 player that I've purchased (keep bumping up in memory capacity) and I'm very pleased with its performance.  I debated between this and the IPod Nano 2GB and in the end, I just couldn't justify the price difference.  I paid $130 for my m250.  Good quality sound, FM tuner, nice design with good button feel.  Get your ID3 tag editor out because that is how this thing organizes your music.  You can connect it to your computer using MSC or MTP mode.  MSC mode allows your PC to see if in mass storage mode.  You can just drag and drop your MP3/WMA files onto it.  It can also double as a flash memory drive this way.  The battery door does feel flimsy as other reviewers have mentioned -- this is the only negative I have with this device.  Regarding playlist support, it will recognize playlists in m3u format.  It does not appear to recognize Windows Media Player default playlist format (wpl).  Fortunately, you can just tell WMP10 to save as an m3u.

<Title>pretty good for the money
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this a week ago, and have been very pleased with it's capabilities and operation.  I really like the extra space (I still haven't filled up the 2gigs). The design makes it easy to use, and the screen is easily readable. I haven't figured out how to set up playlists yet, but I haven't tried, either.   The one feature that I don't like is the auto-shutoff feature.  When I put it on pause, it only waits about thirty seconds before shutting down.  I think this is a good feature in that it helps you save battery power, but at the same time, it does take about 20seconds to boot the thing up, so it can be inconvenient.   And the thing someone wrote about it not working with Audible? I have had no problems with that (perhaps they fixed the problems between November and now). I have two separate books downloaded from Audible, and both have loaded very well on the player.

<Title>Excellent player, with little flaws
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A great MP3 player, I got one from best buy for like 130 dollars, it has a great backlight screen, and it has an excellent setup.  It weighs ounces, it looks real stylish, but you will need to buy a case since it slips out at times.  I don't reccomend the case that somes with it, it is flimsy and hard to put on.  Get the hard case for 10 bucks from a retail store.  Complete with an equalizer and such, you can set the sound that it sounds ultimate.  The earbuds that come with the player are good, they have excellent sound (although the apple ones are better).  I like the audiobooks you can place on there, and the 26 issues of rolling stone that it comes with, along with two months of unlimited NapsterTO GO.  Overall, the MP3 player is good for someone who doesn't listen to loads and loads of songs, which in that case an Ipod is better.  Yet, for someone with a small wallet and a nice collection of 400 or so songs, this mp3 player is great, and is very transportible.  Azzam gives this "TWO THUMBS UP!"

<Title>Good Product. Have fun creating playlists.
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Physically, this product seems well built and as the other reviews said, the only complaint can be with the battery cover. My only issue was the fact that you cannot create playlists without a headache. I have over 322 songs which I added in folders assuming that the player would allow me to open those folders as separate playlists. That is not the case and if it were, this product would be perfect. All music is not created equally and the tags associated with them are not either. It was impossible to play related music continuously. Not to fear, I found the easiest way for anybody to create their own playlists. This product loves to have a relationship with Windows Media Player. When you use WMP to sync music to it, you can select files beforehand and mass edit all of their tags. By doing this, you will be able to make sure that the artist is spelled correctly. This will allow you to create playlists by artist. The player also edits by album. If you want unrelated songs to play with each other, you can edit all of them quickly so that they all have the same album name you give them. Its true that you would then not be able to search by the real album name but if you want to create your own custom lists, thats the best way to do it with this player.

It restarts where you left off.  Music is easy to load to it with Windows Media Player, it will even allow you to create playlists.  The earbuds that come with it are good, but I prefer a standard headset and use that.  I love the custom equalizer.  So far the battery life is good, I have used it about 5 hours and it still says it is mostly full.  I do think that it feels a little flimsy though.  I would definately buy this again.

<Content>If your interest is having a convenient way to carry music around, this is it.  2 GB is adequate space to carry a lot of music.  The unit is small, but easy to use.  The unit uses AAA batteries which are easily obtainable, but here is a suggestion.  Get a charger and rechargeable AAA batteries and save costs.  One thing. this is for music.  So, if you want to carry pictures, videos or the kitchen sink, look elsewhere.  If you want an easy to use, quality MP3 player that costs a lot less than others, this is it.  I got the first one for a friend.  Now, I just ordered one for myself, based on what I saw.

<Content>I am one who values price versus benefit.  I would rather something work well than have a ton of features.  This, however, is one item that seems to have been thought through well on both fronts--price and features.  I considred an Ipod, until I talked with 5 friends/family members who said they hated theirs, so I looked elsewhere... and found this great buy.  Pros: -Easy and simple controls, easily used (buttons are finger sized) -small and light -uses a single AAA battery.  I bought 2 rechargable and interchange them. -battery lasts a LONG time! -I LOVE that you have to hold the power button both to turn on and off. -I also LOVE that it comes with a "hold" button, to keep it turned on or off, as the case may be. -I use a few different music programs on a few different computers, all of which work great with the device--absolutely no problems. -Transfer of songs is FAST.  Wow.  I thought it would be about the same as my PDA, but boy was I wrong (and I never thought my pda was slow).  Cons: -The athletic strap could be improved, but is a minor annoyance. -I would have liked the volume to be easier to adjust (for adjusting blind, as when I'm running), but again, this is minor.  A great buy!

<Title>Good for Music, Not so good for Audible
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My primary objective in getting another good MP3 player (my RIO bit the dust out of warranty and out of business) was to download Audible books.  Second, I wanted an MP3 player with enough capacity for the books plus a few hours of music.  The Sansa M250 met these objectives for much less than I would have had to pay for an iPod.  The big frustration I have with it is that it jumps forward at least 2 minutes every time I stop playing an audio book.  If SanDisk could fix this, I'd gladly change my rating to 5 stars.    It would also be nice if Audible had a better list of compatible players!!  Currently, SanDisk is really the only viable choice short of an iPod and I just can't bring myself to spend that much money for an MP3 player.

<Content>Originally chose this model to download from Napster.  Of the Napster-compatible models this one was rated highest by consumer reports.  Works great, without a hitch.  No complaints about anything at all on this model, other than the battery life isn't quite what's advertised.  'Up to 19 hours' is what they say, and that's if you're listening at ver very very low volume.  If you're jammin' the tunes then you're not getting anywhere near that.  That being said, overall I'm VERY happy with the model.  Very easy to use, and easy to learn.  The ear buds that came with were ok, but have been replaced by some sony in-ear phones which I rate as MUCH better.

<Title>Just don't do it
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using one of these for six months now.  I bought it because someone stole my Creative player and this seemed to be a better deal on a per gig basis.  Well, you don't get what you don't pay for!  The software is the most stupid software that I have every come across.  And Sandisk knows it but has done nothing substantial to solve the problems.    It's a combination of little things that makes me think that the software was designed by the people who designed 1940's cars and who have no idea of what folk might want with a new-fangled music machine.  Why oh why can't we delete songs / books after we listen to them?  Why is it so hard to be able to view all of the music on one PC but not another - why not fix these settings issues?? Their "help" website is truly useless.  I've had to solve some of the problems by trawling for user discussions.   One aspect that I liked about the player is that the buttons are large.  Well, it turns out that they are still difficult to control - try  to FFW or RWD through an audio book chapter on the subway (bump bump rumble rumble) and before you can blink the player will have skipped to the of the chapter if not the whole book ... and you will have no hope of easily making it back to near where you were before.    I love flash-based players and can't stand the whole IPOD obsession but this player is a stinker.  I give it 2 stars because it does work .. not well .. but it works.  Take a look at Creative's players instead.

<Title>Great little player, but has its quirks
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Audible subscription so I could get the discount on this player. It came, and was easy to setup, quickly transferring MP3s and WAVs, playing them wonderfully. The playlist functionality is a bit quirky and takes some getting used to, but that's not my biggest issue with this player.  My problem with it is that the Audible file transfer is troublesome at times. As of this writing, I can get the transfer working on my work computer but not my home computer. I'm not sure what the problem is, but if you buy this player with the hopes of listening to Audible audiobooks, be prepared to spend a little time with tech support.  Other than the transfer issue, though, I am well pleased with this player, and am glad to have found something that doesn't require me to be as a pod person.  Update, Feb 2007: I figured out how to update on both computers. It's a simple case of setting the right variable in the player's settings. My only other annoyance with it is that with Audible files, it jumps ahead one minute whenever I turn it back on and start listening to an audiobook again.

<Title>Don't buy it!
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased two M250's for my children.  Both kids commented on how cumbersome the operating software was but appreciated having a reasonable-priced MP3 player-- until *both* units failed within six months of purchase!  We contacted Sansa customer support when the first one died, and they informed us that they would send a replacement out as it was under warranty.  SIX WEEKS after Sansa acknowledged receiving the defective unit, they claimed that the RMA authorization had lapsed (we sent the unit in promptly).  Caveat emptor-- if this unit seems inexpensive, it's because it is flimsy and badly supported.  Buy an Ipod or *anything* other than a Sansa.  My three year old Rio S35 has been a more reliable performer than these M250's.  Run, don't walk, from these units, if our experience with their reliability or customer support is any indication.

<Title>Inexpensive, but annoying for file transfer
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player with voice recording that had the largest capacity for less than $100, and I decided on this one.  As far as the MP3 playing capabilities go, this is quite normal. Decent sound quality, recording quality not so bad. BUT, the biggest annoyance I've had is in transferring files to this device. If you only plan to use one PC to transfer files to this MP3 player, you'll be okay. But if you plan to connect to more than one PC, and if the PCs have different operating systems, you may get as annoyed as I am. In my case, I have Win2000 professional at work, and Win XP at home. Win XP does not see this device as 'USB mass storage', but rather as a 'Sandisk m250' media device. That's okay, you can still transfer files by drag-and-drop, etc. However, when I connect to my PC at work (Win2K), it shows up as a 'USB mass storage' device - and, all my files that I transferred with WinXP disappear! In other words, the two file systems are different and I can't copy files (MP3, data files, etc.) between my work and home PC using this player. I thought there was a work around - a single sub-folder called RECORD showed up with both operating systems, and if I copied files to that folder with one OS, the other OS could see it. But it doesn't seem to work all the time.  Other factors: It is quite inexpensive, and has that cheap plastic feel to it. However, they do provide a clear case cover that fights tight around the player (you'd have to remove it to change the battery) - with that case, it feels a lot better, and safer (it won't get scratched if dropped, etc.).  Bottom line: If you want to use this as a flash drive and transfer files, you may want to buy something else. As a flash drive, I'd rate this a 3 star. But since this really is supposed to be an MP3 player, and as an MP3 player it works fine, I figured it deserves a better rating. Also the price is quite unbeatable. So, even though I can't easily transfer files between my two PCs, I still think it deserves a 4 star rating.

<Title>Don't buy a Shuffle, buy the Sansa
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After having tossed my 3rd broken Shuffle, I went with the M250. Small, lightweight and has a display that the Shuffle lacks. I will admit that it is quite possible that my 3 iPod's crash was a result of not ejecting them properly from the computer, but that is not required with the Sansa.  You simply disconnect it and go. Perfect for my 8 and 12 year olds that on occasion would forget the "eject" concept with the Shuffle.  It is so simple, even my wife figured it out.  At around $80 for 2GB, an FM tuner and ease of use, you can not go wrong.

<Title>An excellent mp3 player
<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well...the 10 dollar, 512 mp3 player i bought just died. I discovered that i actually listen to music a lot on the go.  I chose this one because I wanted more space (2GB), something that ran on rechargeable AAA batteries, and something that was a little bit more quality construction-wise than my last.  GOOD THINGS: -NO noticeable system noise (using shure E2C headphones) -Easy "playlist" selection. select play by album or by artist or play all. I haven't experimented with true playlist support because i don't use playlists -drag and drop file transfer and i think it supports the sync thing with WMP 11....but who uses WMP these days... -Decent clickability of buttons. Other reviews are right, it feels flimsy, but its not going to break. -the cheap plastic case does its job, but not with style. I don't care how it looks though because its in my pocket all the time. -recordings sound good. -good menu structure.  BAD THINGS: -no USB attachment except via the provided cord. -the screen is a bit harder to read than my last mp3 player -expensive compared to those cheapy models that i like to buy 8)

<Title>Sansa m250
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is exactly what I was looking for, and at a GREAT price! It holds all the music I want to have on it, and has plenty of room left to record my history lectures. It plays back recordings a little too quietly to easily make out everything that was said, so I hook it up to my CD player's auxilary, which gives me another volume control. The battery does NOT last 19 hours; two have died unexpectedly (after less than 10 hours of use). When the battery meter says you have 25% of the battery life left, the device won't record. It came with a cheap plastic case which would probably last less than a week. If you use this case, you can't just unhook your MP3 player from your belt, you'd have to slide it off your belt. I read a review that said how bad this case was, so I got one of the silicone cases. I cut up the cheap plastic one and wrapped it around my Sansa, then tucked the whole thing into the silicone case. This way, I protect my MP3 player from scratches and the weather. As long as you have a spare battery in your pocket, this device won't disappoint you. But at least when the battery dies, you CAN just put in a new one!

<Title>Good Enough
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a player that plays music without a lot of extra features.  If you want a ton of features, like the iPod, this player is not for you.  The iPod also feels more solid, the Sansa M250 is made of plastic, so I'm afraid to grip it too tightly.  Also, sometimes when I'm recording something, it'll skip slightly so a word will be skipped or be shorter.  Not a huge problem, but annoying nevertheless.  Also, the list of artist can be annoying. For example, if you have one album labeled as "The Singers" and another one that says "Singers" it will lable them in different spots.  You have to remove the songs from the player, change it on Windows Media player, and then re-put them on the player.   I have had my player almost 2 months and have had no major problems (yet).  The only thing I noticed, though, was if you are listening to a song, and want to skip it, and go forward like 10 songs, it will freeze up and say "to continue listening to your subscription music, please sync" and if you don't and just listen, all of the songs in your library will be labled as that one song it got stuck on, and the artits in your library will be the one artist.  But, thankfully, all you have to do is simply turn it off, and turn it back on.   All in all, a pretty good player, but beware, it feels delicate.

<Title>Player Frozen, don't buy
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Sansa M250 for 7 months now and I have used it once in a while, not very often.  Just last week I tried turning it on and the display has the Sansa logo and that's it.  It won't play.  I can turn it on and off but no music.  I hooked it up to the computer via the USB cable but it still doesn't work.  I guess I am out of luck.  Now I don't feel any confidence in buying anything from this company again.   Before it froze it was okay, the battery door is flimsy but for the price it is to be expected.  I have gone online and found that other people had the same problem.  I will have to look for a new one now.  Update: After writing the above review, I contacted Sandisk's customer service, after following their instruction on how to unfreeze the player it still didn't work.  They were very helpfull and pleasant to deal with.  I was told to return the player, they emailed me a UPS label, and I shipped it back.  That was probably 10 days ago.  Today I got the replacement.  I hope I have better luck with this one.  I am glad a got a new one since I started to miss my old player.  I will update again if I have any problems with this new player.  I tried changing the star rating, because of the very good customer service I will rate this a 4 star.

<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these for my son for Christmas and had a terrible experience with it.  I opted for this one because I thought the battery was a better option for a kid than recharging.  Within 20 days about half the screen was unreadable and garbled.  I returned it for another one and that one too failed within 2 weeks when it became totally unresponsive.  No matter what I did it simply would not boot and play.  I finally just returned that one for a refund and bought him something different.  If you can find this for 30 bucks or something it might be fine as a backup that you won't cry about losing or breaking, but as a primary mp3 player there are many better choices.

<Title>Do NOT buy Sandisk!!!
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this player after researching all the reviews; it seemed like the best value for the money.  Didn't need a lot of fancy features, just something to play my language lessons when away from home.  It worked great the first three times I used it.  Now, the screen won't display, though I can still load and listen to MP3's.     After reading several pages of recent reviews, I can't believe that this thing has a 3.5 rating.  I would have rated it a zero, but that wasn't an option.  As an earler adopter, this was an expensive unit and I feel cheated. Sandisk's quality control is non-existent, and the marketing department has figured out that their product only has to work for a week to get good reviews on c-net, ect.      Overall this is a terrible product: proprietary USB cable, lousy user interface, and dead after half a dozen uses.  It seems that SanDisk is only interested in the cheapest gargbage that China can produce and separating consumers from their money as quickly as possible.  I've bought three Sandisk card readers, and two are dead.  No more Sandisk!      I really wanted a 2Gb MP3 with replaceable battery.  Now I'll be looking at the MuVo offering.  It's not fancy, and there are not a lot of glowing reviews, but the 64K unit I bought three years ago still works just fine.

<Title>Some Caveats
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>1. The unit is not flat, as shown in the pictures.  It's nearly an inch thick.  The M200 series as well as the C100 series are all nearly an inch thick.  2. The M250 won't work with Rhapsody subscription music service unless you have a USB 2.0 port.  Otherwise, a USB 1.1 can be used to transfer files, but not subscription music.  3. Overall it's a nice unit. A great value for the money.  4. The arm band is useless. You have to put the player into a clear plastic case, which is very cheesy.  5. FM reception is good to very good.    6. The voice recorder is surprisingly good.  Easily records a conversation in a small conference room.  You need to be no more than 4 feet from the unit to get a good quality recording.

<Title>Great for Unlimited Song Downloading Subscriptions!
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> The SanDisk Sansa M250 has an LCD display with a backlight, however it's often hard to read because of poor contrast. The Creative Zen V and V+ have a much brighter display, are much more compact than the M250, and can display color photos at good resolution (the M250 can't display any photos at all), yet they're also compatible with Napster-To-Go. I'd recommend either of the Creative Zen V/V+ models over the SanDisk M250.   The Play For Sure designation for MP3 players, and its logo on this particular MP3 player, don't guarantee it'll work for a Napster-To-Go subscription. Fortunately, the M200 series of MP3 players from SanDisk (including the M250) do work with Napster-To-Go so you can legally download an unlimited number of songs to up to 3 PCs and up to 3 MP3 players in one household.

<Content>I was looking for a MP3 player with reasonable price and standard features. In the last month I bought Sansa M250 and  since then I am heavily using it without any slightest problem. Sansa M250 met all of my expectations. I am so pleased with it so that I've already ordred for the 4GB-Sansa. It stores songs and provides the search capabilities by "Genre", "Album", "Artist", etc.. I can create my own playlist as well. Its recording capabilities is awesome. And its radio feature is exceptioanlly well - what else you want??  Uploading songs to Sansa is very straight forward. Lots of folk complain about its contrast/backlight and the button areas - but it works very fine for me - everytime.  I am giving this product 5+ stars. Don't fall in the trap of iPod, buy Sansa, use Sansa and live with Sansa!

<Title>Solid Player with a few Idiosyncrasies
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a four star player out of the box. However, with a free Mediamonkey download, you can make this a five star player. First, let me start off by saying that I have owned an Ipod and other popular mp3 players in the past. I have probably gone through four different music players in the three years. And in the course of dumping my money into both music and hardware, I found this Sansa player to be a diamond in the rough. Why? :   Pros:  1.	Removable AAA battery - You can get the fanciest mp3 player but in about a year, expect to shell out another hundred bucks (or so) for a new battery. You can also do it yourself, but that's not the real problem. How about when you want to listen to your player all day at work, while commuting, or while camping? If you use your player on a regular basis or where a power is scarce, battery life is the limiting factor. It doesn't matter how many songs the player holds if it doesn't hold a full charge or the battery can't be changed on the go. This Sansa will have an excellent battery for the life of the player. Just buy another four pack of rechargeable AAA batteries. It only takes one to power this baby. No getting stuck with a player and only one battery. The people who review audio players on Amazon rarely do so six months later when their battery only holds half the charge. Do you really want to pay for a new player next year because of the battery? 2.	No special adapters needed - Guess what? All you need is a USB cable (which is included) to transfer files. I lost my adapter for my IAudio player a few months ago and I couldn't charge it or transfer files for a week. I had to wait for a replacement to come in the mail. Yet another way some other companies make a killing off the consumer (you). They'll make you buy proprietary cables. Not here. 3.	No DRM - I like my files to travel with me. No restrictions on what computer I can use my player on or what I want to do with my files. It also support subscription services and windows files. It also comes in handy as a flash drive for presentations and files. Apple forces you to use only ONE computer with your player.  4.	Flash Based - No more waiting for an internal drive to find my song. I hated the lag with my Ipod and Iaudio player when selecting a song. Being flash based, it also helps the battery life if you like to skip through songs. Being a guy, I like to skip through my songs like I do my TV stations. With a hard drive based player, this type of skipping will drain the battery quickly.  Cons: 1.	Poor software - This is why this player only receives four stars. Don't even waste your time using the installation disk or Windows Media player with this thing. It will cause you to lose your mind. Instead, download Mediamonkey for free. It will index your player and Windows will install your files for you. ***Important***  Even though the manual and Sansa website shows that playlists are supported, it may be a mystery as to why they don't appear on your player. Here's how you do it. Using Mediamonkey, Right click the Sansa Player --> go to Properties --> go to Synchronization Properties --> and ensure that copy playlists is checked with " \Playlists\ " in the destination directory. The player also needs to be in MTP mode while this is done. Settings --> USB --> Auto Detect. This will solve any headache that you may have in automatically entering playlists onto the player. 2.   Clicking Sound - when scrolling through playlists, you will notice that the music breaks up slightly during playback. 3.   No Alarm - I wrote to Sansa asking for an alarm feature in their next firmware update. It would be nice to wake up to some music.  Both good and bad: 1.	Armband: The include armband is thin and functional. However, it's not that attractive. I spent an additional $[...] on the silicone liner. Now sexy's back. 2.	Thick and light: This player is ideal for runners. The controls are strategically placed with large navigation buttons. It can also sustain much more wear and tear than an Ipod or a hard drive based player.  3.	Monochrome screen - a color lcd screen would be nice but by having a simple interface with no frills, the battery lasts much longer and it lowers the production cost. 4.	Small memory size - Even at 4 gigs, the largest Sansa m200 player can only store 5% of my music collection. However, I found that after buying this player (to hold me over until my 60 gig player was serviced) that I really don't need all of that music with me all the time. I began to discover my songs all over again with a smaller capacity player. 5. Backlight - I think the backlight is bright and the screen is very clear. However, when using rechargable batteries, about 15 hours into playback, the backlight turns off. This tells me that I only have a few more hours of playback left.

<Content>I'm satisfied with it, it does everything the specifications say. It was also cheap and now I've found it to be reliable too, I've had it for 3 months with no problems. The only detail I'd mention is that depending on the Windows version you use you can't retrieve the files from one PC in another one; for example you'll be able to upload the files at home but you might not be able to download them at work... of course if the Windows versions are the same you can do it in any PC. Other than that little thing I'd recommend this product to anyone.

<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Over all I like and still use the player daily for over 3 months. There is one problem with it, though but I think I just bought a defected one.  Everytime a new/differnt battary gets bellow half(1/2) its lifespan the backlight won't turn on. I called SanDisc about 3 times(they said it wasn't 'normal'), and they were in the process of helping, 'try this and call us back' type, when I went on a month long trip. So long story short I got use to this little defect and haven't been thinking about returning ("You have a year long warranty, so if the problem persists you can return it anytime and we'll fix it... if not we'll send you a new one" - SandDisc said) So, it is a good product and I would buy it again in a heart-beat but with a little more memory, but I guess there's never enough :D  PS also the whole plastic cassing and buttons 'feel' cheap, and did anyone else experienced 'my' problem?

<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this one because I was so pleased with the m230, I wanted to upgrade in size.  This is a nice little player, especially for the price.  Playing music via favourites, repeat feature, and other menu items is rather easy.  I've found the battery lasts longer on continuous play than when I play it during my commute to work (which is about an hour each way).  If I use NiHi batteries, they last longer than alkaline.  I wish it had a way to plug it into my cigarette lighter in my car so that I wouldn't have to use batteries, but that's just a minor inconvenience.  I like the fact I can play mp3s and wmas.  Sure the sound quality may not be top notch, but it's satisfactory.  I'm also into asthetics.  It's cute.  The downside is that synching music is a nightmare.  I would really like it if I could synch in more than one setting than having things erased each time I synch.  And, it's slower than Christmas.  This is why I can't give it 5 stars.  I'd never tried to synch my other one since it was small.  Oh well, drop and drag it is.

<Content>It works great. I had one before that lasted me a month and then it froze up on me, so i got a hold of the company, i was able to ship it back on their dime and they gave me back a replacement. This one (so far) is working great. I don't have any problems with the head phones and the sound is good. I would recommend this product.

<Title>Great mp3 Player
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was skeptical when I bought this player. I never bought an mp3 player before. For what I wanted to use it for I wanted one that worked on regular batteries. I saw some complaints about the player freezing, which it has, but only 3 times in 4 months so no big deal. Take out the battery put it back in and everything is back to normal. The only real complaint I would have is that building a playlist is very difficult. But if you know anything about digital music there are ways around that. I built playlists in Musicmatch Jukebox and named the "Albums" the way I wanted the playlists to be named and then play albums from the menu on the SanDisc. The AAA battery lasts a solid 20 hours or better and the sound is great. I also converted the files to mp3pro VBR, also on Musicmatchm (about half the file size), and have over 600 songs on this player with better than half a Gig to spare. I highly recommend this as a affordable alternative to IPOD's, but only if you know what your doing with digital music. Otherwise you might be a little frustrated.

<Title>Good Value
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My daughter has the 1GB version of this and at age 9 could easily figure out how to use it.  When I decided I needed to join the 21st century and get an mp3 player for myself.  I did a little research and decided the 2GB version would be good for me.  I find it quite easy to use and it sounds good.  However, after 6 months, the volume control (down) broke.  Since there is a 1 year warranty, I've contacted SanDisk and am waiting to hear back.  I expect it will be repaired or replaced.  My daughter has had hers nearly a year and has not had any trouble.

<Content>Product was shipped and came quickly.  It's a nice, easy to use, less expensive music player.  The only thing we don't like is it's not compatible with some of the lesser expensive music download plans.

<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 Player is much nicer than any MP3 player I have ever seen.  It is very small, lightweight and easy to use. I also like that it uses only 1 AAA battery so I don't have to lug all of that battery charger stuff with me everywhere.  The battery last a really long time too.  The radio is a really cool function, but I don't use it much.  My only complaint is that it is supposed to automatically recognize the artists of the songs I put on it, but it doesn't.  My husband said that it isn't the fault of the MP3 player though, it is because I used real player to load the songs onto the player.  We had to manually insert the name of every song and artist onto another music application to put them on the MP3 player.   Other than that, it is really cheap for all of the functionality and coolness it provides.

<Title>Falls at the first hurdle
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is fine in all but one thing.  Unfortunately, this one thing is  totally fundamental and thus negates any other advantages the product might otherwise have.  The problem is this: it doesn't play tracks in the correct album order - it plays them in ALPHABETICAL order.  I've never seen another MP3 player with this problem...even the 128mb freebie that came with a stationery order.  I rang SanDisk asking when a firmware update to fix this basic problem would be available - I may as well have tried to divine it from tea leaves.  They had no idea, and what's more, the product's been on the market for OVER A YEAR, and they still haven't fixed it.  Useless.  They also told me to simply change the ID3 tags - which doesn't actually work, as the player then plays them in some kind of random order.  Plus, if I've got 500+ tracks going onto this thing, do I really want to faff about changing each and every track tag? No I do not.  It was then suggested I create playlists on Windows Media Player (great customer support this is - .wpl isn't recognised and you have to create .m3u files in Winamp - I had to tell THEM that!).  But why should I have to do that, when all other MP3 players simply play tracks straight away in the right order automatically?! Here's a suggestion from me SanDisk - get the basic functions right before releasing a product!  Avoid this player if you prefer listening to music the way artists intended it rather than the way an inferior electronic device decides you should.

<Content>To make the device play albums in CORRECT track order and recognise playlists: (XP / WMP 11)  Ensure usb setting on device is "Auto Detect" (ie MTP) Sync. using WMP ...et voila  Hope this does the trick for those frustrated (as indeed I was at first).

I did have problems with the original one I purchased and had to send it back to SanDisk, but they were easy to deal with. The design is a bit cheap, in that is it made of thin plastic.  I wish it were a bit more sturdy.  But I try to keep it in the plastic case and the armband, which were included, to give it added protection.  I would and have recommended this model for its cost-per-gig value.  If you want fancy displays and jogwheels, go with an ipod...otherwise, this is a solid MP3 player.

<Content>I received this MP3 player as a gift and liked it so much I bought one for a friend who was traveling to Africa.  A big plus is that it runs on one AAA battery for 9-10 hours (you have to remember to turn it off, and not fall asleep listening).  2 GB is enough memory for me, and the price was reasonable.  I have had 3 books on tape and several music CDs on it, which has lasted me several months of listening time during workouts.  It comes with a clear "skin" which becomes more pliable with time, and decent headphones which can be upgraded if you prefer.  It fits nicely in my coat or pants pocket without falling out.  I would be concerned about having a more expensive MP3 player.

<Title>basic but does the trick
<Date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I knew when I bought this that it didn't have all the bells and whistles of an ipod, so I can't complain that it doesn't have a ton of features. But for the money, it's very convenient. I use WMA formats mostly anyhow so that is not an issue. I bought this for my husband for Christmas 2007 as his first mp3 player figuring he'd lose it or break it long ago... but it is still fine 6 months later and he uses nearly every day, mostly in his car with a cassette adapter. It has no skipping or other problems. We use rechargeable batteries in it, and usually have 2 spares recharged at any time so if it runs out we just pop in another. Would like a new case for it though, the clear plastic one that came with it yellowed quickly, but protects the unit well enough. As others mentioned, the directions are not very clear, but it works pretty much like any other removable disk when you connect it to your computer. People who aren't very computer savvy may need a little assistance the first time, but basically all you have to do is drag and drop files, not too complicated.

<Content>I have had this mp3 player for almost a year now, I use it daily and I have not had one single problem with it.  I'm almost convinced that some of these negative comments are people with computer problems (they just don't know it yet)or possibly the song is defective. Putting music on it is a dream, I drag and drop using Windows Explorer. The computer sees it as a plug and play device.  This player is extremely easy to use, its light-weight very small and quite attractive.  The buttons are in logical places and easy to get used to. The sound quality is beautiful and 2 GBs are pleanty for what I need. It is perfect for anything, the gym, beach, driving, hiking, you name it. (well except swimming, I wouldn't recommend that lol.)  All in all, I am more than satisfied with this player, I have never looked back, I look forward to buying the 4 GB some day, when I have half a million songs.

<Title>MP3 At Its Best
<Date>Tue Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everybody today wants to own a MP3 player over anything else. Although many of us look for a quality one and its popularity, the quality must work just as well. Most of us though consider Apple and the popular Ipod series. Although it is convient and most accessories have been built around the MP3 player series, it hasnt really worked for every computer owner. Sansa, one of the most overlooked MP3 player series on the market, has absolutely delivered more simple and easy to enjoy MP3 players on the go, that works with more quality music download services like Napster and Musicmatch, and this MP3 player shows it.    The Sandisk Sansa M250 MP3 Player holds 2 GB of memory and music. The MP3 player is sleek and convient not just in the price, but the compatabilty. The device works great and in sync with Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10, or higher. It also is easy to recharge on a single AAA battery that can last up to 19 hours, without waisting any money on your electric bill. You can also use this to play music from subscription sites like Rhapsody, and URGE, without any problems. The control is very easy to use and can easily work great on the go. You can use it to play as many as 800 songs in WMA files or 400 MP3 files. The menus are also easy to scroll through, if you want to playback a artist or a specialized playlist you've made.     I absolutely recommend Sandisk, because they have some of the best quality MP3 players on the market that really are worth their value for computer owners everywhere. While other want one where it is more about hype, The Sansa M250 delivers a convient price and delight for anybody who is new to MP3 music players. I love this series a lot.    Price: A-    Quality: B+    Convience: B+    Easy To USe: B 1/2+    Overall: B+

<Title>Not Bad
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For the price, it's a pretty good player.  Would have given it 5 stars, but when you turn it off and then back on, it doesn't pick up where you left off; it goes back to the beginning of the file.  Not a big deal if you're listening to songs, but I wanted it to listen to podcasts.  The typical podcast I listen to is 37 minutes long, so the back to the beginning deal is very inconvenient if I have to stop in the middle.  I decided to use the new 2GB Sansa for music and my older 1GB Zen nano for the podcasts, as it will resume exactly where you left off.  I paid $140 for the Zen over a year ago; only about $85 for the Sansa recently.  I would give the Zen 5 stars.

Last Friday I bought the Sandisk e150 which is also 2GB, but I didn't like it, so I returned it.  You could put pictures on it, but they were so small nobody could see them anyway.  You couldn't preset radio stations and just flip through them.  That's why I got this one, it's all you need.

<Title>If you are looking for an Audio only MP3, this if for you!
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought mine a few months ago... It works great and I have not had any problems (except, for misplacing my arm band but that of course was my fault).  I could only find one company, that sells replacement armband for the M series.  DLO sells an armband for around $30. (I am sure now that I bought a new armband, I will find the old one!)   I was looking for an MP3 player that is compact and has audio only.  If I want to watch a movie it will be on a regular tv!  The M250 is very easy to use, but the instruction manual so small.  I found a more comprehensive instruction manual on-line.... www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/Sansa_ug_Eng_m200.pdf  I use the latest version of Windows Media Player and found the transferring of songs from CD's to my computer to my M250 to be easy!  I really liked that the M250 runs on a AAA battery, because I have a charger.  I do not have to worry about battery problems, like the Ipod!  I think the sound is good, it fits my needs.  I have not used the radio or recorder, so I can't comment on them.  I did my research on the M250 through CNET, Epinion, and Amazon...  The headphones are adequate, but I wanted some of higher quality, so I bought the "Sennheiser MX75 Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Sport Headphones" for around $35.  The Sennheiser has different types of fittings that you can play with until you find the size that fits your ear best.

<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The music sounds great on this model, but the backlight will stopped lighting up if the battery is half used.  Music still play but the backlight don't lit up anymore unless new battery is installed.  This makes it impossible to search for songs or navigate through menus in the dark.  I contacted Sandisk and they confirmed this limitation on the m200 models, but they don't disclose this info anywhere.

<Title>Everything works, playlist problem solved
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is quite a little player.  It can be set to either a Mass Storage Device, so you can drag and drop audio files onto the player through Windows Xp File Explorer or you can set it up to be an MTP device (the actual setting is called 'auto detect.'  I like to focus on problems so people know what they are getting.  But to touch on the positive: everything works on the player and works well.  The equalizer presets, the fm tuner and fm presets, playlists, buttons, backlight, stop watch.  All the functions work.  Problems:  The case and armband.  Simply put, yucky.  But it shouldn't stop you from buying this player.  Plastic construction, but unless you buy a hard drive'd player, there really isn't any other option.  This shouldn't stop you either, unless you are a teenager and plan to beat on it.  Playlists.  EECK! This was a huge pain, but I was able to figure it out.  Here's how:  Player firmware is: 4.04.44A Windows Media Player:  version 10  1. Set the player to be MTP USB mode. (Menu->Settings->USB, select Auto-detect)  2. Create a playlist in Windows Media Player, go to the sync tab, click 'set-up sync', highlight your playlist and then click sync.  That's the only way I could get it to work.  I found other reviews online that had a complicated "make your own *.m3u" file, but I just couldn't get that to work at all.  And for only eighty-eight doll hairs (that's money), a 2 gig flash player can't be beat.

<Title>Please don't buy!!!!
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After reading all the glowing reviews here I thought I had found a great MP3 player at a bargain rate that would hold at least my 60 cd's--not even close. Pulling this thing out of the box it is about as high quality as something out of a cracker jack box! I had the same problem as the others with the weird alphabetical song transfer. I tried ALL of the suggestions on here--media monkey, changing the mode--NOTHING worked! The picture that is up here is completely deceptive. It makes it look like it's as deep as a cell phone. This thing may be small but it's also bulbous and the earphones are horrible. I can't say enough bad things about this product and don't understand how so many people can love it. They've obviously never experienced the marvels of the Creative Zen for which I coughed up roughly twice this but got a product that will last and last unlike this TOY that is completely useless to me that I'm sending back.

<Title>They would not work
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 2 of these for my kids, neither of them would be reconized by my pc to load songs on. I had origianaly thought it was my pc but I have 2 Dell Dj's, 2 Creative Zens and 1 crappy 256k Audiovox Mp3 player which all work fine. I contacted Sandisk customer support through thier website. They were quick to respond, friendly with very good instructions through several back and forth emails so I give them an "A" for effort there. However nothing they suggested for me to try would get these to work.  Maybe it was my pc ? But I doubt that was the case.

<Title>Nice player, just a few minor quirks.
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is all that I need, which sums up what you're getting. The Sansa M200 series is short on bells and whistles, so don't go here if you're looking for photo and video support, or fancy animated menus. It has a monochrome LCD, but it is more than adequate for viewing player and song information. Battery life is great, I routinely squeeze about 18 hours out of a standard alkaline AAA battery, albeit with minimal usage of the backlight. The backlight does what it needs to do when used in dark or low light situations, but it does significantly increase drain on the battery. My one most significant complaint about the player is that the backlight seems to stop functioning once the battery level gets below about halfway, although this problem appears inconsistently; sometimes, I get the backlight to come on when the battery level is very low.  Sound quality is very good, I use a pair of Shure E2c in-ear phones and I don't see a significant difference between the Sansa and my previous player, a Creative Zen Micro. Since I took a cut in memory capacity going from the 5 GB Zen Micro to the 2 GB Sansa, I typically compress songs a bit more than a I once did, but the difference in sound quality is not significant (or even noticeable?) when compressing to 96 kb/s.  The player fits nicely in your hand, and the admittedly weird looking placement of big buttons actually works out very well, especially if you use the player for exercise and want simple play-back-forward controls that don't require stepping through multiple menus. Build quality is a little toylike, I recommend always using a form-fitting case since I'm paranoid I will one day lose the flimsy battery door. Sandisk supplies a pretty chintzy plastic case and armband, with the case feeling like it was cut from an old raincoat. It does, however, provide some protection for the unit. I now have a Sandisk silicone case, which looks nicer and includes a beltclip. The original armband can still be used with the new silicone case. One other beef about the player is that considering it's thickness, it tends to do a fair amount of bouncing if you strap it to your arm during an activity like jogging. Still, it has never fallen off when using either the original plastic or the new silicone case, nor do I worry that it will. Navigation is simple and straightforward, and it is nice that the player recognizes MP3 and WMA tags. Audiobooks work reasonably well, since the player will start where the track stopped prior to powering off. Unfortunately, there is no bookmark feature, so you cannot easily resume an audiobook if you play other tracks between listenings. One feature I truly miss is the ability to create playlists on the player. I believe you can do this prior to syncing, but I now just listen to individual albums or artists, manually changing when I'm looking for some variety.  All in all, this is a simple player with easy navigation and excellent sound quality. Add a slightly nicer silicone case, and this is the perfect companion for travel or exercise.

<Title>Great compared to its competition (the shuffle) and playlist problem SOLVED
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a perfect device for what it should be for - a tiny mp3 player for working out, running, or anything else that could damage a real ipod.  It's also better than what Apple has to offer - the shuffle.  For the same price as the shuffle you get - a screen, 2x the storage, and playlists.  Everyone keeps saying this player can't handle playlists correctly.. and they were right.  Win WMP I've gotten 1 playlist to stick and sync up out of who knows how many I've tried.  Here's the biggest tip ever: USE WINAMP.  Winamp sees the device PERFECTLY.  Better yet, it's as simple as right clicking and picking "New Playlist" that you'll have a new playlist.  Go to the songs in the library, control/shift click all the ones you want, and do "Send To -> (playlist name)"  Easiest thing I've ever done.  FINALLY good playlist management.  I had to dock this 1 star due to the crappy 1/2 power backlight issue (I use rechargables, let me deal with it) and sometimes odd track ordering.  But for competition to the shuffle it dominates (I'd give the shuffle a 3)

<Content>I've had this for a month or so, and it continually becomes what the Sandisc tech calls "corrupted." It plays through my library of books on tape and then refuses to play them again until I reformat it. And reload my Audible library. So far, no satisfaction from the manufacturer.

<Title>Excellent little MP3 Player
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1gb is plenty for me.  Much smaller than Ipod and runs on AAA Battery.  Uses standard 3.5mm headphones.  Backlit LCD is sufficient for me.  You can build playlists in Windows Media Player and synchronize them to the device.  However, my only complaint is that when the playlist is large (one of mine is over 80 songs) it takes a while to load.  Great player for the budget minded buyer.  Definitely recommend!

<Title>Very nice product
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a really nice player.  The controls are easy to use, the sound is nice with the included earbuds, and it seems to be quite durable, given that I have accidentaly whacked it against a few doorframes while walking through them.  The unit was unfazed, and continued playing without problems.  The only problem that I have experienced was that it stopped after adding some more music to it, reaching about 1.3 GB capacity.  The display read Please wait, rebuilding the library, but nothing further happened.  The problem was that the unit was automatically turning off before the rebuilding was completed.  I increased the time before automatic shutoff to ten minutes, and there were no more problems. Very nice product in my opinion.

<Content>Definately worth the investment for the price of the mp3 player. The only thing I wish was better was the armband it came with.My arms are pretty big and it was hard to stretch the armband around my biceps. Also, the armband part that holds the mp3 player is plastic and I think there will be durabiulity issues with it in the long run. As far as downloading songs very simple to use and to learn all the controls.

<Title>Sitting useless on my desk - total junk
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I say useless, I mean "unable to be used" not "has some quirky features I don't like"  It started out OK, but after about a month, it is broken.  The problems started when I loaded about 1GB of music onto it.  I had 2 playlists, each with about 500MB of music.  The music would play fine, but switching playlists would take about 2 minutes.  That's right, with a flash player (ie. no moving parts), it would take a full 2 minutes for it to start playing a song when I changed playlists.  I don't know if it was due to number of songs per list or anything like that.  All I know is that it was totally annoying and completely ridiculous.  When I got sick of it and looked on Sansa's website, I noticed they had a firmware upgrade.  So, hoping it was a bug that had been fixed, I ran their firmware updater.  IT CRASHED!!  My jaw nearly hit the floor when the updater crashed.  For those that don't know, an aborted firmware update is the equivalent of a lobotomy for an electronic device.  For what it's worth, the player worked for another day, but then just quit after that.  I plugged it into the computer to sync some music, and it was not recognized.  So, I unhooked it and replaced the battery, hoping to clear whatever snafu was happening.  Since that (1/2 hour ago), I've been staring at the Sansa bootup screen, hoping against all hope that it will eventually spring to life.  I wanted a good quality, non-iPod mp3 player.  Simple, easy, and inexpensive.  The m250 is none of these, considering that you'll end up throwing it in the trash and buying something else.  Save yourself the trouble and get something worthwhile.

<Title>Broke after having for 2 weeks
<Date>Sat May 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my husband and after he had it about 2 weeks it just stopped working.  I called sandisk and asked them if there was something i could try at home instead of returning it, but the guy said it's broken and that I should return it. My husband and I decided that we did not want another MP3 player from this company because it took us forever to download all his music and then the item broke.  So beware before you buy this product.  I saw one bad review before I bought the product and thought, what the heck, but I wish I would have listened to that reviewer.

The 512 is still working and has had no problems--it's 6 months old-- so hopefully, our lst 2 GB was just a lemon and the replacement will continue to rock.

<Title>Not as slick as an ipod but a darn good value
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall I am pleased with this player considering the 2GB capacity and low price. I have never owned an ipod for my own use but my kids have two Nanos and one Mini between them. In no way is it as cool as an iPod but it certainly serves my usage well (primary working in the yard/shop & listening to podcasts on the way to work)  Pros Easy loading of music - it acts like a standard flash drive and requires no software. Music can be loaded with drag and drop in Windows Explorer. Also, podcasts can be saved directly to the player through Juice without ever touching the computer's hard drive. I am not a fan of the iTunes/iPod interface and like this much better.  Uses standard AAA batteries and therefore you are not at risk of the failure of a built in battery.  Small - fits easily in a pocket   Cons  When shuffling all music, it plays the same song first every time.  Kind of an odd shape  Backlit screen doesn't always work  Screen is very small and can be hard to read  Doesn't distiguish spoken word files (books/podcasts)from music so they will eventually play when shuffling all music.  Battery cover is a little loose and rattles without protective cover on the player.  Due to the AAA battery, cannot be charged in the car.

<Title>Great deal for the price
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> I just got this yesterday and used it a bit. So far its not bad - great price (who wants to go jogging with a $350 mp3 player?) and good sound quality, 2gb is tons of space for the price. Menus and features on the player are easy to navigate.   Sadly there are some limitations, you can't organize into folders and have them show up on the player. I don't know why they enforce that, it seems ridiculous. I use media player and what I do is create a playlist in advance and drop the playlist on the player by sync-ing with media player. This works good enough.   You also can't delete songs from the player, you have to sync to delete things. Also 'sync' was a misnomer, as I loaded my player with stuff, then loaded media player and it said 'put songs here' and the list was empty. But what about the stuff already on it? That showed up in a different window when I clicked on the player in the menu on the left. I added stuff to the blank space and clicked sync, and it worked as I wanted - the new stuff was added and the old stuff stayed, but what the heck? It was very unintuitive, but I have to say that was Media Player - other software may work better.   Another minor issue - been using it two days and its hung twice. I hope this isn't a chronic problem or I will return it.

<Title>Simple, Reliable
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using the M250 almost daily for over 6 months. It has been perfectly reliable and dead simple to use.  Pros:  1. Size and shape make it easy to carry in front pants pocket.  2. Battery life is excellent. I use rechargeable AAA batteries. Battery life ranges from around 10 to 15 hours, depending on how much fiddling I do with volume, track selection, etc.  3. Controls are easy to locate by touch.  4. Display is readable in sunlight (barely).  5. Drag-drop from PC is easy.  6. Replaceable batteries (no device-specific charger needed).  Cons:  1. The plastic case that comes with it is cheap and scratches easily. It's  also a little sticky, so the first few times you change batteries it can be hard to get on and off.  2. Battery cover fits loosely, so you must use the case to hold it securely in place.  3. Display scrolls too slowly, so it can take a while to see complete artist, album, and song title.  For my needs, 2GB is plenty. I typically have 25-30 CDs on it, and change them out every week or so.  I seldom use the FM receiver, but in my experiments I've found that reception is good. It seems to be fairly insensitive to position or orientation - i.e. you can move about without losing the FM signal.  I tried the voice recorder, and results were OK, but I haven't used that feature enough to have formed an opinion.  In all, this is a very good basic MP3/WMA player. If you're looking primarily for portability and ease of use, this is a good choice.

<Title>This One's A Keeper
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have quite a bit of experience with mp3 players, because I've had pretty bad luck with them, but the SanDisk Sansa M200 series (I own both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EIHG96/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9611833-5921769">SanDisk Sansa M260 4GB MP3 Player (Blue)</a> and this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9611833-5921769">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>) has proven to be the most reliable and user friendly, hands down. I have *never* had a problem with this series of player, as I have with *all* of the others I have tried in the past, which consistently break down within months. I really like the fact that it is difficult to accidentally press a button and the sync process has always run smoothly.  You can pop in another AAA battery when you need to.  This is nice because, if you take long road trips like I do and don't always have access to an electrical outlet, you don't have to go without your music.  (That's why I don't care for rechargables.)  Also, the player is easily reformatted and made "like new" using Windows Media Player. The subscription "PlayForSure" option works well (I've only tested it with Napster To Go on my Media Center 2005 Edition PC using Windows Media Player 11).   I've been using this series for about 1-1/2 years.  There are also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BONJXU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9611833-5921769">SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player (Blue)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP50AY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9611833-5921769">SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a> versions, which I have not tried.

<Content>I bought this for my 10 year old and it worked for about 3-4 days.  Then at startup it froze after the welcome screen.  Reset did nothing.  Returned it to Amazon and received a 2nd one in less than a week, which was commendable service from Amazon.  Same thing happended to the second player.  Returned it and bought an Ipod.  No issues so far after two months.  I would not recommend the M250 MP3 player.

<Title>Not Satisfied
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player seemed to function OK for the first week, then it froze and and could not be reset.  Rather than send it away to be repaired I opted to return it and buy a larger capacity player, the Creative Zen Vision M, which I highly recommend.  I do have to mention though that I was incredibly pleased with Amazon's return process, quick and easy!

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Once the issue of connection is overcome (there are two MTC or MPC?) that you can easily work off of the menu, the downloading and editing of music is very easy.  I was amazed at the options of play just an artist, a specific album or everything (if you have the time).  The screen even tells youi what song on what album is playing.  Of course this is my first player of this kind and I think most kids will think this is not a big thing with all the other more advanced toys out there.  For a 54 year old, I still have a hard time finding good HI FI cartridges and stylus for my turntables.

<Content>Sure the thing feels cheap, but it sure gets the job done. Plug it into a USB port and drag and drop in files, you're good to go. I use mine sorta like a Shuffle; just drag in 2GB of stuff and let it go random. The interface is pretty simple to use, and the battery life isn't bad. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.

<Content>I received the item in October 2006 in a very timely manner and it worked great for 2 months.  It could be I just ended up with the one bad one - but it stopped working for no apparant reason.  I did receive GREAT customer service form SANDISK however as they promptly replaced my sandisk and even paid for the shipping to and from.  So I just got my new device and and I'll have to see if it works longer than 2 months before I can make my final judgement.

<Title>Awesome Product
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my daughter the M230 and myself the M250.  I am very impressed with the quality and user friendliness of this device.  No more skipped CD's when I am on the treadmill and it's so small I can store it anywhere! It also comes with an arm band and a case.  It's a cinch to upload my songs and delete them if I am tired of them.  SanDisk is one of the higher quality MP3 makers and definitely worth the money.  I don't need an I-Pod as this does the exact same thing, only cheaper.  If I want to watch a video I will turn on the TV, I-Pod's are overrated anyway. SanDisk is the way to go if you want quality in an MP3 Player.  The volume is awesome.

<Content>This is a great MP3 player; especially for the price. I've only had it for a week, but I love it. Downloaded songs from both Rhapsody and Windows Media Player 11 easily (drag/drop). I downloaded about 13 hours worth of music from my WMP playlist and still have over a GB of space left. FM radio gets good reception, even for weaker signal stations.  Headphones are more than adequate. Plastic case kinda flimsy, but functional.

<Title>Enough storage to statisfy any teenager!
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After much research, I purchased the Sansa M250 as a B-day gift for my teenage daughter. The main reasons for choosing the M250 over the plethora of other players was it's price, extremely small size, STANDARD AAA battery, FM tuner and most importantly, the ability to purchase and download mp3 files from ANY online retailer (not just the iTunes store). (My kids buy songs for [...]). My 11 year old son recently purchased the Sansa 1 GB version because he liked his sister's so much!  The kids use Windows Media Player to manage and download their purchased songs to the player which is really quite simple once you become familiar with WMP. I do recommend that you purchase some in-the-ear style earbuds, since the set that comes with the player do not stay in your ears very well (even the smallest of ears) especially when moving around. Also, the included arm band for using the player while exercising does not fit small arms.  Overall this is a great player and is perfect for kids who can still be cool even without an iPod!

<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did not like it. You can not make it to play files from a given folder, you have to deal with "artist" and "album" stuff, it is really hard to predict in what order it is going to play the files. I use it now since I have it already, but I would not buy it again.

<Content>I was looking for a simple mp3 player that had plenty of memory and was easy to use.  I train for marathons and it works perfectly for my long runs.  Fits nice in my hand, isn't heavy, and has big buttons.  Only negative for me was the head phones that came with.  They only lasted about a month.

<Content>This is a very nice MP3 player for the price. Some nice options also: FM reciever, backlite, equalizer. Easy to use, it only took me about 15 minutes to open it up read the instructions and start copying music. I have around 15 CD's on mine and it's about 3/4 full. Batteries last a long time also. For the price I would highly reccomend. nice to use while exercising also(comes with arm band). I would have rated it 5 stars, but the backlite only stays on about 3 seconds. But over all a great buy!

<Title>You get what you pay for
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this MP3 player for about a year now.  This is the only player I've bought to date and I'm satisfied with it.  It's light, the display is easy to read, the battery life is pretty good for a AA (about 4-5 hours non-stop), and since I don't have a million songs, the 2GB is more than enough.  The Bad: it took me forever to figure out how to build playlists.  The instructions were of no use so I sat down for a couple hours and fiddled until I got it.  The ear buds that come with it aren't comfortable so I replaced them.  The arm band is pretty tiny -- I'm not a huge dude and I have a hard time ratcheting it down.  Annnd . . . now the ear phone jack it going out -- I've tried several differnet sets of ear phones/buds and it's the same result; the music will cut in and out.  In short: this MP3 player does the job for me and I like it.  I'm no audiophile though; if you're serious about what you put in your head, it may be worth it to you to shell out the extra dough for a higher-end player.

<Title>Should have just bought the Apple player in the first place.
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So I told my wife, "Honey. get the Nano."  "No, dear.  It's too expensive."  So we got this.  This thing FAILED after two weeks.  First off--we could only get 512M of the 2G to work on a Mac.  Now, turn it on and the startup just stares back at you.  Looked online at the Sandisk site--no help whatsoever.  We're overseas and getting service is going to be a nightmare.  Too expensive?  What's TOO EXPENSIVE is the price of this P.O.S. *AND* a Nano.

<Title>SanDisk MP3s
<Date>Thu Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the 1 GB about 3 months ago and found it very easy to use, great playback and down loading of music already ripped from the CD into my hard drive extremely simple in the windows explore view.  Liked the 1 GB so much I just ordered a 2 GB so that I can keep one in travel bag and the other for working out at home.  FYI, you can save battery life during music down load as the USB connection provides the necessary power, so just pull out the battery when loading music and away you go.

<Title>Great little MP3 player
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife wanted a small, lightweight MP3 player to use while walking each day.  She is very pleased with it.  It is very small and simple to use after very little time.  I can only speak to the MP3 player portion.  We have not really used the radio or the voice recorder.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see how easy it was to copy MP3s to the unit.  I have never even used the enclosed software.  I use MusicMatch Jukebox on my desktop PC.  It recognized the unit as soon as I hooked it up and made it very simple to copy my playlist to the unit.  It uses one AAA battery which seems to last a long time.  If you want a unit that can hold a LOT of MP3s, offers shuffle play, is easy to copy files to, and also has a radio and a voice recorder while managing to stay very light and easy to carry, then I would recommend this unit highly.  We have had it for 2-3 months, used about one hour per day, and have had no problems with it so far.

<Title>Average device
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have two complaints. First, after synchronizing with Windows Media Player and disconnecting from the computer it says it is rebuilding its library. Once it is done the new files are not showning up in the library. After plugging it back in I view the files on the device through Windows Media Player and it shows the new files there. I have had to remove all the files and upload everything again.   I have an Ipod but I bought this device so I could download and listen to audiobooks from my local library. The downloaded audiobook is just one huge file. My second complaint is the device can only play that file from the beginning. If I stop the playback, which I have to do because I am not going to listen to a 10 hour+ audiobook in one sitting, then I can't continue from where I left off. I have to start over.   I do like this device for basic music and audiobooks from CD. I have even used the FM radio and found it acceptable.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player, I have had no previous experience with MP3 players, and this one turned out to be perfect for me. It was easy for me to operate. I was relieved to find out that it had even more memory then I expected it to. I use mine constantly. I felt the price was reasonable for what I wanted with this purchase. I would certainly purchase this MP3 again if I had to do it all over again.

<Title>Wonderful player... IF it worked
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I LOVED this little player... so much that I tried three times to get one that would work for more than three weeks. They freeze on the start up screen, and there is NOTHING you can do to fix it. I enjoyed this player because it held roughly 500 songs, used one triple A battery, and was very easy to operate. Wonderful, lightweight, compact, and good sound... that being said, it could clean my house and balance my checkbook, but if it doesn't work it is essentially useless.  Keep your packaging and receipt... and enjoy... cautiously.  I had a friend who had to send hers back twice.

<Date>Sat Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is maybe the best mp3 player for the cash.  Its solid state electronics means no mechanical parts to break.  Its light weight make it GREAT to workout with.  Also, it works pretty well w/ Winamp and Windows Media Player.  Sound quality is nice, headsets have good bass and clarity.  Interface for device is simple and effective but NOTICIBLY slow.  Consequently it's a little hard to switch quickly between songs, especially if you have lots of songs.  I would happily recommend this device to anyone looking for a super affordable hiqh quality mp3 player that is not as fast as an IPOD :)

<Content>This was my first and ive hard it for maybe 5 months. i love it.  its easy to use and even easier to transfer songs to.  just plug it to your computer and slect the songs and its done.  i was never into the whole ipod thing and surly was never going to spend that much money for something that i frankly dont need, at least the colors and big screens and movie capability...of course not to say that its not cool, just not needed. i can plug it into my car sterio with nothing too expensive and listen to my music without switching cds all the time.  if your looking for a good quality mp3 player then this is perfect, and 250+ songs is just a plus, who really sits and listens to music for 5-6 days at a time anyways...no need for 60gigs..
