<Content>I tried two of these, and took both back.  Maybe BestBuy just had a bad batch, but both were defective.  It would get stuck, sound like a broken record, and I couldn't advance or go back.

<Title>Nice for what it does
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I already had a 20GB player and needed a small player that I could go running with.  It's small design makes it easy to jog with.  It can fit easily in your pocket or even around your neck.  Because it's a flash drive, it can bounce around without damaging the player.  While it doesn't hold as many songs as my other player (a little over 100 songs compared to almost 5000), it works perfect for what I wanted it to do.

<Title>AWESOME!!! BLOWN AWAY!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hi This is my first MP3 player. I decided on this unit because it allows you to record from any source via the line in jack. I bypassed using my PC and filled the T30 with Classic Rock from my CD collection. True I was not able to fit as many tracks on my player ( files not compressed) I am still very happy with it. I was able to get 53 tracks including some 9 and 10 minute cuts. I bought the Sennheiser PX 100 headphones (also 5 stars) and man I can't stop listening! The only regret is not getting the 1GB T30 but hey that is what my wish list is for! get it you will not regret it. Ps the unit require Windows XP and WMP 10

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought this tonight.  On my XP system, works great. Don't install their "software"; just plug in to a USB port and use MS Explorer (MyComputer) to transfer files.  Sound is very good. Good ergonomics on the buttons: a lock switch to prevent accidentally pressing buttons. Remembers where you where when turn back on. Voice recorder.  Runs on one AAA battery--good if you don't want to hassle with a recharger. I have no idea how long these last, tho.  I'm upgrading from a CD-based MP3 player, and I use this primarily to listen to voice files, so my expectations/ demands are not great. But all said, this is a good buy.  One thing, MS Explorer doesn't do complete file management; for instance you cannot check "disk" for errors, size, fragmentation, etc. SO this bodes for possible problems down the line if/when file errors develop on the chip.  All n' all, glad I bought it.

<Title>Doesn't work with Macs and Linux
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this gadget as a gift and been using it for couple of month now.  It works well, very light, and has a long battery life. There is only one problem - it only works with Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10. iRiver doesn't make drivers for Windows 2000, OS X, or Linux. So unless you have XP, I suggest you stay away from it.

<Title>Great sound, with several drawbacks
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On the whole, this is a very affordable, very versatile MP3 player.    There are downsides however.  For one, the US and EU versions require that you use file-transfer software to load music, and do not allow you to drag-and-drop music onto the device.  That means you generally have to use the super-clumsy Windows Media Player synchronization interface or the super-duper-unstable WinAmp portable media interface.  So, if you can, find a player that allows drag and drop media transfer.  The only other drawback I can see is the somewhat clumsy control scheme (which may just be symptomatic of smallish mp3 players).  There are 2 rows of buttons on opposite sides of the screen, and since the thing is almost completely symmetrical, it is very easy to confuse the two rows of buttons.  And even if you do manage to find the right button, they are sometimes rather difficult to press (at least for a clumsy-fingered person like myself).    Otherwise this is a wonderful little MP3 player with great sound and a very reliable (if somewhat clumsy) firmware.

<Title>I thought the iRiver T10 was great, this is amazing!!
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow, this mp3 player is amazing!! If you managed to get one during the christmas deal at Best Buy like me, you got a great deal! They gave you a 50$ gift card to Best Buy for buying it. It only costs 80$, and is a 512 MB mp3 player! It may not have FM radio function, but you bought this for mp3's not radio. You use Windows Media Player 10 to manage this. It has great design and it looks awesome! If you want an inexpensive mp3 player, that is great, and gives you a coupon for a month of free downloads at Napster To-Go, then you have to buy this one. Forget the iRiver T10, this is great!

<Title>iriver feature cutbacks
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before this one I had an iriver 899, which had lots of customizing features, allowing the user to change recording bit rate, turn the back light off, etc.  I bought this, thinking thta it may be comparable.  I am disappointed. 1.  Even though the specs page in the manual says that the recording time can go up to 18 hrs (at 32 kbps), there is NO WAY to get the recording bit rate lower than 96 kpbs.  There are just 3 settings for recording bit rate and the lowest is 96kbps.  The 899 had many different sampling rate and bit rates for recording.  Plus, on the t30 you can only record in stereo.  The result: large files which are inconvenient to email, etc. 2.  You would think they would let you turn the dang backlight OFF if you want, but you can only get it down to 3 seconds.  That wastes a lot of battery life if you don't need it on.  battery companies must be wining and dining iriver or something. 3.  There are other things on the t30 that iriver has started to cheapen, and for this reason I give the device a low rating.

<Title>A really nice player for the price!
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this little player several months ago and was a little worried about a few of the reviews I read here.  While its true it eats batteries like crazy and doesn't hold as much music as stated, it still holds quite a bit! and the convienience of having so much music easily at hand in such a small package (for me anyway) makes up for the batteries I have to keep around.  The sound is really good for the price, and I didn't have any problems figuring out how it worked or in reading the player's screen.  All in all it is definately well worth the price.

<Title>great little device
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i purchased this device about 6 months ago for one thing:  recording.  you can plug any music source into the jack and record for up to 3 hours at 320k.  i dabble in DJing and i can take an RCA to Stereo mini Y-plug directly from the mixer into the T30, bypass the computer, bypass any other interference and it sounds great.  Once the recording is finished, plug in the USB and use the explorer to drag-n-drop the files onto the computer.   i can also delte files from the player using explorer.  nothing could be easier.   the only problem i have is that it sucks the life out of batteries very quickly.  i highly recommend rechargeables.    as for the other stuff, i wouldnt use it as my regular MP3 player because it is very small, the buttons are not that intuitive, and 512 MB is really nothing to get excited about.  spend a few more dollars and get more storage.

<Title>Adorable but basic little player
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just purchased this player because the Centon that I got for Christmas turned out to be a disappointment.  But this player is light, easy to download, has good sound quality, and understandable controls.    If you want a basic MP3 player and don't need more than about 120 songs, this one is for you.  I used it to get some songs off a music website, and the rest were my favorite songs transferred from my extensive CD colletion to the player.  This makes workouts a lot more fun with only my favorite songs playing.  If, however, you want more extensive memory and do a lot recording, it would be best for you to keep looking.

<Title>Don't bother with this MP3 player!
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I consider myself a well-versed computer user and have used a few mp3 players in my time, including my current 30GB Creative Zen vision M. I purchased (2) iRiver T30 players for my daughters Christmas presents in 2006. Both Napster and iRiver expressed that these players were compatible with the Napster To Go service. I made the choice to purchase based on their compatibility and price, but I forgot the old saying, "You get what you pay for!"  I have not succeed with downloading any music into either of these players as of yet. Both have very old firmware installed and for whatever reason, will not accept the new updated firmware. And yes, I know about having to run XP with service pack 2...that is exactly what my computer is running. After contacting both iRiver 3 times and the seller 4 times, I still have not reached a satisfactory agreement for replacement. I would feel differently if only one player had issues, but both are unusable and I would never recommend this product to anyone. I would, however, recommend Creative Zen products. They are high quality, sturdy and the company stands behind everything they sell, not like other companies that hide when problems occur.

<Title>wonderful player
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player refubished and it was wonderfull! It was my first mp3 player but i didn't have any problems. It arrived MUCH earlier than expected, with every thing I needed. The songs were very easy to load. All I needed to do was dowload windows media player 10 (which they provided)!The menu was very helpful and easy to acess. The player was very durable (I dropped it more than I can count) it even spent a night in the snow which put it out of commision for about a month ,but it came right back after drying out! The only things that would make this player better would be: an armband or case(it comes with a neck band), being able to make a playlist from the player ,and a radio! I am considering geting the 1GB after mine finally gave up the ghost two years later. I defintly recomend this player!

<Title>Good sound, but no radio
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had IFP-895 before, so I expected that T30 has Radio, and I didn't check that. Now I see that it doesn't have. That's bad. The radio on ifp-895 was great! (very powerful...)  I can add ogg files only using Windows Explorer (add to 'data' folder of 'T30' device.)  Some said that recorded files cannot be extracted, but that's not true. You can copy & paste using Windows Explorer.  Sound is great, and when using ogg Q1 (about 80k/s), it can hold 14 folders now.  No arm band like before... so the sale price at Bestbuy or Circuitcity is not a good one, I can say. (No radio you know)  But I think I will keep this.

<Content>I agree completely with the person below. I got this MP3 player for Christmas, and I cannot download any songs onto it, because I don't have a Windows XP. I think it's actually a pathetic way to earn money. To get Windows XP software, it would be an extra $100. There is no way around this obstacle. However, I did burn a few songs off of a CD at a friends house, and the 2 songs I have play well. The quality is really good.

<Title>Amazing Affordable MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have this MP3 Player and truly love it.  It has the same quality as any IPod that I've ever listened to.  The fully adjustable Equalizer Allows you to create just the type of sound you like hearing.  I typically like having pretty strong treble my music and it replicates it fantastically!  With just a quick browsing of the manual you can easily figure out how to maneuver around the menu like a pro!  It does have one minor drawback that was not really a factor for me, but for my sister.  I bought her one of these for Xmas and didn't realize that she didn't have Windows XP but 98 SP2 and it simply won't run on it.  As I said before, it's not a problem for me though!  She'll just need to upgrade to XP and become current with the times!    I would definitely recommend this player to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive MP3 player.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

<Content>My only issue is that some files won't play, at random. Reloading the same file generally corrects the problem, but you never know when you're going to run across a "corrupted" song. I understand that even iPods suffer from the same issue occasionally. Also, skip the tedious Media Player sync process and just drag and drop the files right onto the unit. Much easier. UPDATE: a firmware update obtained at iRiver's website corrected my "corrupted" file issue. The unit now plays every file every time. I'd give it five stars now.

<Title>Warning - Requires WindowsXP!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You need Windows XP and, more specifically, Windows Media Player 10 to make this player work.  If you don't use XP, and I don't, go find another player.  I filed a complaint with iRiver and the person who answered it was arrogant and combative.  I own older iRiver products but my two new T-series players are going back.  With as many choices as there are out there, you can bet I won't be buying another iRiver.

<Title>Nice little MP3 player
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP3 player, so I don't have a lot of experience with these devices.  However, the iRiver T30 works fine on my computer, and transferring files is easy.  If your computer already has Windows Media Player 10, then the included CD-ROM is not necessary.  And Windows XP SP2 already has the necessary driver.    I'm not a huge fan of Windows Media Player 10, but it is necessary if you want to listen to DRM-protected music files with your T30.  For such a small player, the display screen is quite large.    MP3 players chew up battery life, so I would seriously consider rechargable batteries and a charger.    Speaking of batteries, the T30 has a backlight display that stays on for a predetermined amount of time.  I changed it from 30 seconds to 5, which really saves on battery power.  This will cost you an extra $20, but I recommend iRiver's Sport Armband/Clip.  It comes with a soft, plastic shell that fits around the T30 and gives it extra protection.  Using an armband or clip makes transporting the T30 much easier because the included neck strap gets tangled with the headphone wires.   I also suggest you place some type of screen protector on top of the T30's LCD screen to prevent or reduce scratches.  I bought tiny screen protector strips for my digital camera, and placed one on my T30's screen.  As has been mentioned, the T30 doesn't have an FM tuner, but that doesn't bother me too much because I frequently listen to AM stations too.  So until a cheap MP3 player is manufactured that plays both AM & FM, I'm keeping my little walkman.  Before you add an audio track to the T30, make sure it has some type of artist/album info.  Otherwise the T30 may report incorrect info or weird gibberish on your screen.     Be aware that upgrading your firmware (always a good idea) sometimes changes the settings of the T30.  For example, the steps for deleting individual files was different after I upgraded the firmware.  The steps listed in the instruction manual didn't apply anymore.  To those who bought the iRiver T30, discovered it didn't work with Windows 98, ME or 2000, and then gave it negative reviews: if you read the system requirements, which are always listed, irregardless of the website, they CLEARLY state you must have Windows XP SP1 or higher (I personally recommend you have SP2 installed), and Windows Media Player 10.  This info is also listed on the player package, in English and French.

<Title>Nice player
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm giving this player 5 stars because it does what it promises and it does it properly. This isn't an exhaustive review, but a few things I've picked up that may be of help to people:  - I am running XP, service pack 2. I installed none of the IRiver software and, right out of the box, started using the player as any other removable USB device, so I can drag files into it from within Windows Explorer. Not having to install its own proprietary software is a big plus, IMO. I do have media player 10, but since I don't use it to move over any data I can't see that a person actually needs it. - I cannot find a way to determine how much room is left on the device from within windows. On the device itself this information is available, but within explorer I cannot get properties to any files/folders on the device. - The device can function as a data storage device and indeed comes with an empty "data" directory. Take note that files cannot be opened from the device, i.e. if one has a word file, it will have to be copied off the device to be played. This also goes for MP3 files; the only way to play them is through the device itself and plugging it into a comp won't allow files to be played off it (as far as I could tell) unless they are copied off the device back onto a computer. - Its menu system is fairly intuitive and it's quite easy to navigate around to different folders and play the files within them - I bought the $20 sports band and it's a good purchase - I once dumped about 160 files onto it, all very similarly named (1 of 160, 5 of 160, etc.) and after copying, within explorer it seemed that a couple of files had been missed and a couple had been repeated. Upon turning off the device and turning it on again, the directory properly listed itself. I don't consider this a big deal but thought it should be noted.  This device isn't perfect, but it is a good MP3 player. The fact that it takes AAA batteries is perfect for me because I've no interest in replacing a unit in 1-2 years because its internal battery is toast. Furthermore, these AAA batteries will offer more life than a lot of competitor's built in batteries.  At the end of the day I wanted an inexpensive MP3 player that could cover the basics, with no "gotchas" or annoying things like having to put on the manufacturer's bloated software and for me the T30 covers that, so I'm happy.  I agree that it's silly to not support anything except XP, but since the box clearly states that, _stop lamenting the fact_!
