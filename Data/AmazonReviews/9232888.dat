<Title>Sansa Clip 2GB - Great MP3 Value and Performance!
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>  The Sandisk Sansa Clip 2GB is a great value MP3 player.  It has twice the capacity as the iPod Shuffle for about $50.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can get the 1GB version for $35.  Pros -  + good sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner (20 Presets) + voice recording   + nice design with more color options + Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via software + 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Clip Plus + Integrated Clip means no add-on case / lanyard purchase needed!  Cons  - larger body than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  The new Sandisk Sansa Clip has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the compatibility, feature, and price benefits of other MP3 players.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.    The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced VERY well for the holidays.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.  The rechargable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The earbuds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only  time will tell; so far it's holding up nicely.  I definitely recommend the larger 2GB option. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa, Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Overall, an awesome starter unit that deserves a try.

<Title>Can't go wrong
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player so I have nothing to compare this unit to.  I can't imagine anything that could be any better in this price range.  This unit is amazing. The sound quality is excellent.  It is a recorder, an FM player and audio book player.  The size of this unit is so tiny.  This is a perfect item for the gym or for walks.  Out of the box, easy to operate. You won't be sorry if you purchase it. This is a perfect gift.

<Title>Outstanding MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Sansa Clip 2GB about two weeks ago.  I was replacing an old 128 MB RCA MP3 Player.  I wanted something that was compatable with WMA files.  I did my research and found this player to have excellent reviews on numerous sites.  I have not been disappointed.  It is very easy to load music.  You can use Windows Explorer to drag and drop existing music files from your windows directories or you can use Windows Media Player to "Sync" music from your libraries.  I do wish that Windows Media Player was more user friendly, but that is not Sandisks problem.  Windows Media Player does allow you to Rip from CD and sync to the Sansa Clip without using Explorer.  I can't say enough about the sound quality.  With the built in equalizer, it is easy to customize the output.  I have been very impressed with the included earbuds.  I compared them with some Sony earbuds that I used with my previous player and the Sansa earbuds were superior by far.  I have been especially impressed with the range of the player/earbuds.  I can hear things in the music that I cannot hear with regular speakers.  When I first bought the player, I was thinking about buying some aftermarket earbuds, but I can't imagine that the sound could get significantly better than what I am getting with the included earbuds.  The phone plug on the earbuds was even gold plated.  I really like the display.  This gives you many options that would not be available without a display.  I can change settings, chose a particular song, navigate to different playlists, etc.  One thing I was disapointed with was the instructions.  I didn't think that it included enough instructions about loading music using Windows Media Player or about creating Playlists using Media Player. It took extra time to figure that out on my own.  Overall,  I have been extremely impressed by the Sansa Clip.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  In fact, I just did a couple of days ago.

<Title>Great player for value
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first MP3 player I have owned.  I own 1000+ CDs, and at age 37, consider myself a bit of an audiophile.  I have listened to some songs from my phone, but never took the plunge to a dedicated MP3 player. Even after a few days, I don't know why I put this off.  First, moving music to the player was remarkably easy.  I just plugged it in, and the player showed up in Windows Explorer.  I copied MP3s from my computer, with no specific directory/file structure to follow, and they showed up, sorted correctly by artist/album/song, etc. No extra software to use!  No iTunes or WMP or Rhapsody or LockYourMusicIntoOurStore stuff!  Second, this is a fine interface. Yes, it is text-only.  But that is how I always listened on my phone anyway, I scrolled through the album titles and when I found the one I wanted, I hit "play". Naturally, if you REALLY NEED to see cover art, get a different player.  But if you are buying music, and not cover art (and also not little plastic disks and boxes), then get this player.  Now I have already purchased eight albums from Amazon in MP3 format, with no problems putting them onto the player.  Great playback quality, easy to use.  I won't go back... I can't go back...

<Title>beware of rip-off aspects of this device
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player is cheap and easy to use, but comes bundled with a softwre music sales package that *you don't have to install to use the system* but which the documentation makes it sound like you must have to use it.  The Rhapsody system of BestBuy is the software it installs. This wouldn't be a problem, except the software requires you to pay a monthly service charge to use any of the music, and when you download (BUY) something, you will likely not get a set of files you can actually burn to a cd.  Oh, yes, it also overlays DRM on any media you have on your computer unless you say "no" during the long and onerous install process.  In general, cheap, but you are conned into paying lots and lots after you have it. In general, I say avoid. We got to sit through a lot of frustration trying to get the tech support to help. This is not a quality device. I would only recommend as a gift for someone you really don't like.

<Title>Beware Install Trouble
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good product, but the install process can be a mess (check the SanDisk forums, and you'll see there are a lot of people struggling). I have an XP machine and am computer savvy, but it took me 3 hours to get my computer to recognize this player and two frustrating and very unproductive tech support calls (they tried, but they ran me around in dead-end circles that did not make much sense). I *finally* got it to work by reading a random non-SanDisk website that said to turn the player to on, slide the bar to "hold," and then press the center button while plugging the device into your USB port. For some weird reason, that did the trick, even though never suggested by tech support. So, watch out, but if you can get it to install, it's a good deal.

<Content>I was impressed with every aspect of this sansa mp3 player.  Pros:    - The navigation, buttons, and settings on this player are extremely easy   - The screen is crazy bright, I didn't expect to see the graphics / text so clearly on such a small screen   - The radio worked better then any other player I ever owned.   - Sleep timer   - Just plug and play on any computer. Drag and drop your music files (works like a flash drive).     - THE PRICE  Cons:     - Wish they had 4 Gig version, maybe next year

<Title>Very Good / Very Small / Very Simple - just what I need!
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought my SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB Black MP3 Player to replace my outdated SonicBlu Rio S30S 64 MB + 1 GB SD Card MP3 Player (which is great, but lacking USB 2.0, etc.)  Pros:  Compact Light Easy to navigate menus and buttons Great colour Physical volume button in excellent location 2 hr Charge time ~ 15 hr usage on a charge Easy drag-n-drop MP3 transfer (USB-Mass Storage Device) Very low price 2 GB is plenty of space for going to the gym or going skiing all day or in between jobs while in my work-van (using an FM transmitter for lack of CD Deck/Tape Deck/Line-in)  Cons:  My player had much difficulty in the first few hours.  The unit froze at the SanDisk graphic screen after unplugging it from a computer.  I had to search online forums to find out how to use a master reset and various other procedures to unfreeze the unit.  Then I had to go update the Firmware to the latest from the SanDisk website.  My iMac and my XP based PC work great with it, but when I plug it into my Win2000 SP4 laptop, it sees the device and directory structure of the unit, however, the \MUSIC folder is empty.  If I put it on to my XP or iMac machines, they see the contents of the \MUSIC folder.  I'm sure there isa work around or if you started using it with the win2000 machine you'd be okay.  Minor issue unless it effects your situation directly.  Overall:  Very Good player.  Exactly what I wanted, once firmware was updated and I learned how to do a master reset and such.  Make sure you update to the latest firmware immediately after purchasing.  I do not regret this purchase and I do recommend this unit to everyone, except those who wish to hold their entire MP3 collection on their portable unit.  ****/5

<Title>Gift from the Gods!!!
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My recommendation is to buy this MP3 Player. Did you hear that? I'll say it more clearly: BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!!!!!!   Background: This is my first MP3 player. I had been using a portable, plastic casette player with some cheap Sony headphones that had good sound if I pressed the earpads against my ears but had a problem with one of the earpad clips always coming loose. Other than that, I have been listening to a cheap pair of Logitech speakers on the computer and a cd/casette no-brand cheapo player in my living room--not the best set-up for an audiophile wannabe, right?  So, I left my backpack somewhere along with the casette player, the Sony phones and a Chinese language casette. I have an 8 cd Chinese language set, so I decided it was time to transfer the CDs onto an MP3 player so I could practice on the go, whilst entering the 21st Century, technologically speaking. I researched and researched and researched some more and all roads led to this player. Following one reviewer's suggestion, I bought the 2 GB rather than than the 1 GB, which for me is more suitable because of the amount of storage I'd like to have with me.  So how is the player? Well, I'm ecstatic. This has to be a gift from the gods (for me anyway). The size of the unit (smaller than my thumb), the clip, the display, the incredible functionality, ease of setting-up, ease of downloading, ease of re-charging, are all worth the purchase price. This said, what is the most miraculous thing about this gem is the SOUND! It delivers wonderful and big sound with a clarity I have not heard in years--it is as if I am discovering music (and sound itself) for the first time and it is an experience I can only describe as sublime.  I have a varied music collection and this plays everything from Electronica to Classic Rock to Classical well with EQ settings you can change yourself. My greatest surprises have been with vintage rock albums, albums I suppose were first recorded on vinyl, which play superbly. I listened to T. Rex's Electric Warrior, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's So Far last night and was amazed at hearing them and the music separation between the left and right phones--such a wonderful trip--listening to music as it was intended to be listened to--what a concept? Madonna's Ray of Light really allowed me to appreciate William Orbit's production--I heard things I had never heard before. Last but not least, my greatest amazement was listening to Opera. I selected the Classical EQ and listened to an Opera compilation CD entitled Aria: A Passion for Opera--the experience could only be described as revelatory. At one point I was listening to an aria from Puccini's Tosca and without warning tears just began flowing down my cheeks--all this from a player 1.25 x 2 inches. That experience alone was well worth the purchase price--everything that happens from here on is just GRAVY!  By the way, my 8 Chinese language CDs with about 8 hours of lessons, took no time to transfer to the Clip. 2 GB will hold about 30 hours of tunes and other material. The 2GB is actually for convenience, since you can easily delete from the device while it is attached to the computer so 1 GB would be fine if you don't mind the slight inconvenience of deleting music now and then--I'm telling you, this is really an amazing little device. The ipod shuffle suddenly seems like the stupid man or woman's portable music solution.  I have the player clipped to my collar and the earbuds in and I have to remember they're there. Whether listening to L'il Kim or Banco de Gaia, I'm groovin' with the sound. I have the black model, which I find aesthetically pleasing, and I just can't wait to experience the WOW! factor when I show this off to my friends.   Summation: 6 STARS on a 5 STAR scale

<Title>Basic player but great at what is made for.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am coming from a Sansa e250 that the headphone jack broke. The clip's music output is much better than that of the e250. Navigation is more cumbersome due to the smaller screen, but with playlists it is ok. Battery life is less than advertised but that is most mp3 players out there. Construction feels solid but then again so did my e250. Price and capacity are just what I was looking for. Very portable and at the gym it feels great since it doesn't get in the way. I recommend it for anyone that wants a simple music player for a great price. Sound quality is rival to those of much higher prices.

<Title>Best sound for the buck!
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased a bunch of these for gifts after Thanksgiving because they were are sale for $35. At this price they are disposable.  I own Sony,Apple,and Creative DAP's.  This is by far the best sounding of all them.  The sound is very rich and smooth compared to the Apple devices I own.  In order to get good sound out of an Apple device I have to rip at 192 kbs. I ripped a CD in WMA at 160 kbs and did a side by side comparison for over 3 hrs on three tracks.  The clip wins hands down.  I also compared the clip to a Sony with the same tracks at 64kbs Atrac.  I still think that Atrac is a superior format but Sony has discontinued support for Atrac and Sonic Stage is a pain to use.  I like the Shuffle because of the smaller size and sturdier clip but the Clip is just as small and has a better battery life.  Compared to a Apple 5.5 G, Nano 3G and Shuffle 2G the Clip has better detail.  It also nice to have FM radio. Which came in handy when I was listening to Classical radio and heard a piece last night on my car radio.  I wanted to hear who the composer was and didn't want to stay in the car to hear the composer.  It was the first time I used the radio on the Clip and found it easy to use and reception was as good as the car radio.  The navigation to find songs was easier than the Shuffle since the Shuffle doesn't have a screen. It fits under a hard hat or clips to a t-shirt for discrete listening when traveling or at work.  You don't know it is there.  I would recommend the clip to anyone that is looking for great sound that is discrete or works in environments that can beat up a DAP.

<Title>Little Giant
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased an unknown brand of MP3 player for $8.00 less and it lasted about 2 days then shorted out.  When I found this little giant of a player I had my doubts but after reading the other reviews decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  It is very user friendly and is extremely easy to program.  The sound is unexpected for such a small player (about 2 1/2" x 1").  Another great feature is that it is so light that it securely clips onto a pocket, shirt edge, or the lanard of my id badge at work without the need for any addtional holders or armbands. I also recommend purchasing the travel pack that includles an outlet charger, car charger,and silcone protective cover. This allows you to charge the Sansa Clip from a electrial outlet or your car so that if you are not near a USB port you can still charge your player for continuous listening pleasure. That "other" player could only be charged from a USB port, no additional chargers were available.

<Title>Money well spent
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Rating: Possible CON - I feel the build material could be a tad bit more robust. Considering this MP3 player is designed to be attached to your body as you are working out, I think the plastic casing might be a little fragile in the event the Sansa Clip falls to the floor. Then again, the MP3 player is so light that the force of it dropping probably wouldn't crack it. Actually, the only reason this thought came into my head was because my Beagle was eyeballing the SansaClip as it dangled from my computer case. I'm sure one crunch from my dog and this thing would be less than fully functional. Other than the small player being plastic(which is a completely minor gripe since the only small player I know of made of metal is the iPod Shuffle) I have no complaints and believe the device warrants a 5 star rating.  Size: The Sansa Clip is super small. Granted, it isn't quite as small as the small iPod shuffle, but any smaller and the player becomes too small in my opinion. With this size you still have a nice sized screen, easy to access buttons, and yet a small enough form factor to forget you've got it clipped to your shirt.  Features: I won't run down all the features because many people have done that. Suffice it to say, you won't find any MORE features available in an MP3 player of this size for the same money. The newer small iPods with the video can claim video play back, but those are larger than the Sansa Clip. I'd also contend that you wouldn't use video on such a small device anyway. I will say that my FM reception was good on strong stations, but only passable on weaker channels. Don't expect to get that college radio station with that weak signal. Still a handy feature to have especially if your gym puts the TV sound on an FM frequency.  Purpose: Very important is the idea that the Sansa Clip serves a distinct purpose, transportabitlity. The ultimate use for this device is to listen to music while being active. No more goofy armband cases for your $400 video iPod which is too heavy to be strapped to your arm. No more worrying about your iPhone falling out of its case as your go mountain biking. Just clip and go.  Value: $55??? Really?? All this for less than $60? That just says it all really. Imagine you're running with your $400 iPod video and the velcro strap comes loose. SMASH! there goes $400! Now let's say for the sake of argument that some how the Sansa Clip comes loose and smashes into the ground. You're only out $60! Seems like a steal to me.  Connectivity: When I first got mine I went straight to SanDisk's website to download the latest firmware (I don't think this was all that necessary, but it couldn't hurt). You download and intall the firmware updater (a self-running program which requires no effort on your part), then plug in your Sansa Clip. The program updates your device and asks you to unplug it. Done. When I plugged in my Sansa Clip (even before the update) Windows XP recognized it right away and gave me the typical window with choices for what action I wanted to take. I could have opened it in Windows Explorer, but I had other ideas. Each time I plugged it in I would get the same window so using the device is a snap, complete plug-and-play.  Transferring Music: Not recognized by iTunes (obviously) Recognized by Windows Media Player Recognized by WinAmp Recognized by MusichMatch Jukebox (version 10) Recognized by Windows Explorer for drag-and-drop transfers these are the only methods I tried I didn't install any programs and the device didn't come with any CD to load anything anyway. It seems the choice is up to the consumer on how to transfer music.  I used MusicMatch (the version just prior to the blackhole that is Yahoo's version after buying out MusicMatch). The jukebox recognized the SansaClip right away and I had full-functionality. I made a playlist and transferred 370 songs with room to spare. Disconnected and started listening.  Sound Quality: I will admit, I took one look at the included earbud headphones and didn't even bother unwrapping them. I already own several "good" headphones that I prefer. With my Bose Triport headphones the sound was as rich and full as my 80GB iPod video. For earbuds, I'd recommend pairing this device with Creative's EP-630's, they are cheap, light weight, and sound great.  Sansa Clip vs. iPod Shuffle (the small one): Has FM tuner, iPod does not Has screen to view song information and change settings, iPod does not Has 2GB, iPod will but not just yet Has on-the-go playlists, iPod does not Let's you choose song, artist, etc., iPod cannot Costs $55, iPod WAS $79 now $49 but is still only 1GB (2GB version forthcoming) Has a clip, iPod has a clip too! Comes in different colors, iPod does too!  I think the choice is clear.  Hope this review was helpful.

<Title>just keeps getting better!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>great sound quality! had a little trouble with set-up but that was because I plugged into my USB hub without the hub's optional power cord. my mistake! once I used the USB hub's power cord, my computer recognized the Sansa Clip just like it does my flash drive. I am able to use Windows Media Player to 'rip' cd's and then sync them to my Clip. I have also downloaded some podcasts and put them on the Clip. eBay has plenty of generic accessories for great deals. just search on "Sansa Clip AC charger," for example - or "Sansa Clip speakers or noise canceling earbuds." etc. great, low cost alternative to Ipod!

<Title>I use the Sansa Clip more than my iPod...
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Yes, I won't lie, I do love my iPod classic. However, I bought a few of these units as Christmas gifts. When I saw them being used out of the box, I decided to keep on for myself and I couldn't be more pleased.  The tiny size, great sound, and easy navigation make this unit a real winner. Sadly, my $250 iPod classic spends all its time in my car or the docking station - and the Sansa goes with me to the gym, when flying out, or anytime I want a weightless, tiny source of 400 songs on my person.   As for the problems mentioned by other reviewers, I haven't had them. I did have a freeze-up once, but simply holding the ON button for 6 seconds will reset the unit to working order.

<Title>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  so good - perfect companion for Rhapsody
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Let me start by saying -- I have owned and played with many, many, many players in my day.  I recently bought this little guy for my Mother - I wanted something cheap and easy for her because she has no experience.  For $50 at Bestbuy, I am now ready to get rid of my other HI End players.  The most attractive feature to me initially was the size, price, and the fact that it works with Rhapsody.  I could load several hundred songs onto this for my mother. What surprised me was just how well Sandisk pulled it off in this little body.    Two simple improvements over past Sansa items - is that you can drag Rhapsody channels over in addition to albums or playlists.  So I dragged the "50's" channel over and within minutes I had 100 or so songs in that genre.  Previously only Rhapsody branded products could do this.   Another huge plus - you can delete songs directly from the player.  I always wanted to be able to do this instead of having to hook player up to my software and do it there.  Now when you are jogging and you hear an anoying song you can very easily kill it forever.  The product works flawlessly with Rhapsody -- I am sure it works great with any service.  Also has a cool feature where you see facts about the artist -- (this may only be a function of Rhapsody which by the way is also a fantastic service -- you don't need to own a few songs when you can rent the entire world!!!)  Another nice touch is the ability to create a "Go List" which is essentially a playlist on the fly.  You can add or remove songs from the go list directly from the player.  And making this even easier is a new feature where you can set the middle button to perform several different tasks. For example:  you can configure the middle button so that holding down for a few seconds and a song will be added to your "Go List", or a song will be "added to library", or pull up the song ratings menu.   Very convenient.  I like to run - the clip lets you keep a library of music, along with Rhapsody Channels.  The channels are really good because you can pick categories and it loads your player with music.  These channels songs are not part of your library, but as you listen to the channel if you hear something you like you can move it into your library with one click.  It's a great way to explore new music.  Load the player with songs and artist you love, but let the Rhapsody Channels introduce you to new music.  Channels automatically update whenever you connect to the Rhapsody system - so you will always have the latest music.  I really like the "MTV Channel".    Doesn't do video or pictures, but then again you wouldn't be looking at a tiny clip device to do that anyway.  This particular model is 2gb -- they now have a 4gb model.  I find that between my albums and 2 or 3 Rhapsody Channels, I have more music then you could possibly ever need - and it always updates with new stuff.  Bottom line - if you want something compact, cheap, perfect for excercise, I can't see how you can beat this product.  Only negative I can find, as with just about every player except the Sony NWZ-A818, is that the supplied headphones are pretty bad.  With a nice pair of buds the sound from this player is incredible ( also includes presets for different equalizer settings as well as a USER equalizer)..    Well I can't say enough good things. You won't find very many negative reviews I can assure you of that -- this player also makes a great 2nd player that you won't worry so much about because of low price tag.

<Content>I was looking at getting a less expensive mp3 player to use in the gym.  After reading the reviews for all of the different options, I decided on the Sandisk Clip because it received the best reviews.  I'm not disappointed at all with my decision.  I use it more than I thought I would.  It's a great little product if you don't feel like dropping $150+ on an I-Pod.

<Title>I love the clip
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros: -The clip (it's removable too, but I don't see a point to removing it) -Couldn't be smaller and still be easy to use -Has more buttons than all players I've used, which makes getting to what you want faster. -The audio quality of this player is near perfect (on normal eq). -Equalizer is perfect also, in case the recording needs it. -I use it during exercise or just put it in my pocket in case I'm stuck in a waiting room (because it is so small and inexpensive).   -Great battery life and battery meter -Uses standard mini USB and not some stupid ipod cable. This also allows you to charge it with your cell phone charger. -FM tuner. I don't use it much as the quality of FM is not good enough for me.  But I feel the tuner is as good as any portable player.  Cons: -The user interface could be better. If you were to compare this against the apple clip (okay, the shuffle) this has a screen!  I prefer the UI of the Apple nano, but the nano is big and expensive, and doesn't have a clip.  The main UI annoyance I have is if the screen is off, the first button you press only lights up the device. You have to press the button again to perform that action. Because the buttons are 'clicky,' and there's button lock, I don't see the need for the first click.  Sansa could easily release new firmware to fix this.  -Not compatible with iTunes purchases.  This is reason not to buy from iTunes.  Consider amazon's mp3 service instead.

<Title>New technology for a Gramma of seven
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I asked my daughter for a set of headphones for my portable CD player for Christmas.  I was surprised to say the least when I opened this Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player.  I tried to get her to return it, but she "insisted" that I "just try it".  I'm FAR from being Computer Saavy, but I decided to give it a try.  I plugged it into my laptop and Windows Media Player walked me thru EVERYTHING!  I loaded my whole CD library (40 CD'S) onto this thing and I still have 55 MB left.  The sound is so much BETTER than my CD player, and I'm just using the earbuds that came with it.  This Gramma can now go ANYWHERE and do ANYTHING with her music clipped to her!  I almost hate to admit it, but this time my daughter was right on the money.  I can't THANK HER ENOUGH, for bringing this Gramma into the NEW AGE!  It's ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  If you're on the fence, go for it, don't hesitate!  Ten Stars and two Thumbs Up to SanDisk!

<Title>Great bang for the buck.
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this as a gift for a friend, so I don't actually own it. But I did get a chance to use it. For the price, you can't really go wrong. 2GB of storage, FM Tuner and cheaper than a iPod Shuffle. The sound quality is great compared to other budget players I have used in the past. Navigating through the menu was also a breeze. There really wasn't much to it.  My only gripe is that when playback is on random. If you advance tracks, it'll play random as well as if you go back a track. So if you accidentally skip a track you wanted to hear on random, you'll have to go back and search for it. Another thing I had trouble with was connecting to my computer. I've read a few other people having the same problem recognizing the device in Windows. Since its not my player, I wasn't going to lose sleep over it. My friend, however, didn't have any problems connecting.

<Title>Fantastic little player.
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this to replace my 2nd gen iPod Shuffle.  It's so nice having twice the space (at half the cost) and also having the capability of playing playlists or playing by genre/artist/album.  The user interface on the Clip is very intuitive and well designed.  The screen is bright and easy to see in most any environment.  The Clip is extremely light weight and small enough to clip anywhere you desire.  Also, the sound quality is excellent for a player as small and inexpensive as the Clip.  It is a night and day difference with the iPod Shuffle.  And, the headphones included are nicer than I expected.  The player works perfectly in Ubuntu.  Upon plugging it in, it automatically mounts and nautilus opens allowing me to drag and drop music directly onto the device.  Yay for the linux love!  I am only disappointed that it doesn't have a charging dock and it is plastic rather than metal (this does, however, make it weigh less).  It still seems well built and the buttons give good feedback.  We'll see how it holds up over time.  Otherwise, I am highly satisfied and would definitely recommend this player.  I have used several mp3 players over the years (Apple, iAudio, etc) and this one takes the cake.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.

<Title>100% Satisfied
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first purchase of an mp3 player.  I'm a gigging musician who has never purchased anything less than high-end audio components for my home.  My ears are spoiled and so are my family's, so I haven't been too quick to jump on the mp3 bandwagon.  I bought this for my 10 year old son for Christmas.  If you simply want to listen to music, this is a GREAT product.  The sound quality of this little unit is pretty darn good right out of the box.  I may upgrade to another set of ear-plug style headphones to see how much of a difference it will make, but the ones that came with it sound pretty good.  The EQ presets are a nice feature, but the only one I would ever use is the "Jazz" preset - it cuts better at full range than the others for any style of music.  My son was able to figure out how to operate it after a few quick pointers, and I'm sure that he knows it better than me now.  The only drawback, of course, is the memory size.  2 GB fills up pretty quick.  But I knew that going in.  It is what it is - a great sounding entry unit!  I'll probably be getting a couple more for my other 2 sons.

<Content>A fashionable salesgirl at Benetton asked me about my cute little MP3 player. She said her iPod had broken, and she wasn't ready to pay $200 to replace it.  She asked me if the Sansa works with Macintosh.  I said "of course."  I let her play with the Sansa for a bit; and within minutes, she HAD to go straight out to buy one after work.    Why did she fall in love with my Sansa Clip, and not me?  Tiny, cute, fun and easy interface. Check.  Works with her Macintosh and her friend's PC. Check.  Plenty of space for her favorite songs. Check.  15-hour battery life for a girl on-the-go. Check.  Clips discretely to her cute outfits. Check.  Excellent sound quality with nice earphones. Check.  FM Radio that can record songs off-the-air. Check.  She can tape boring lectures with the microphone. Check.  Costs 1/2 of what a replacement iPod would cost?  Check.  Plays her favorite videos? No, sorry.   Syncs with iTunes?  Nope.  But it works great with Windows Media Player and VLC or other non-iTunes players on the Macintosh.  This is just what everybody needs:  A tiny, great-sounding, light, music player that weighs nothing, holds 500+ songs and clips to any clothing. I'm selling my iPod.

<Content>I'm an iPod guy, but bought this to use with Overdrive audio books from the library. It sounds great and works without a ton of extraneous software. The one thing I do wish the unit had was the ability to bookmark, but Sandisk seems to update firmware frequently so there is always hope. The build quality is OK but the plastic is a little creaky. It seems to be a bit fragile and perhaps not up to the build quality of the iPod Nano or Shuffle. Still, I'm glad I bought this - its a great little player and I recommend it.

<Title>Best buy for the money!
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I will preface this review by stating that I am no technological wizard.  With that said the Sansa Clip is on close to the best $60 I have spent in quite some time.  Due to some of my shortfalls in computer operating I had little strugggle getting started with the music downloads, but after a couple of tries I am pretty sure my dad could even do it. ( He still asks me how to start his VCR!)  One thing I was pretty disappointed in the initial charge time one the batttery.  At no point do the included instructions tell you how long the Sansa Clip needs for the initial charge.  I almost returned the Clip because I didn't think the battery was charging.  After calling Sansa, I was told that pluggnig it in to my laptop was not sufficient. I had to use the USB on the back of my desktop and then it still took and overnight to charge. Once I was over that, all has been great!  One last thing: It's not a huge deal, but I am glad I bought new ear buds along with the player (Somkin' Ear Buds). The head phones provided are junk.  Due to the price difference and the ability to see the music you are listening to, I would RECOMMEND THIS OVER THE i-POD SHUFFLE IN A HEARTBEAT!

<Title>nicely designed, but I got a dud battery
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I recently read up on small flash-memory players, and bought the Sansa Clip, which is well-reviewed and reputed to have very good sound quality for a tiny player. I found it impressively small yet easy to operate. The built-in clip is convenient, and the player is not so small that it's easy to lose. The only downside with the physical design is the volume buttons on the right side - it's a little loose and can rattle (other reviewers have noted this too) though that doesn't really pose any problem for the player. Also, the headphone jack is right by the volume control and L-jack headphones can make getting at the volume button a pain. The little screen really makes the player better and menus are easy to navigate. I wish the screen had one more line on it, but not a big deal.  One problem is that the player can't read ID3v2.4 tags, so in the case of longer song or album names, the player will only show the ID3v1 tags which are limited to 30 characters. So I retagged my mp3's for ID3v2.3 which the Sansa will read.  While most people have had good experiences with the Sansa Clip, my battery is a dud and stopped retaining charge within a week of my getting the unit. I can charge it up (which takes 2.5-3 hours, btw) and it shows full charge, but loses charge rapidly over time (though will play fine until time, not usage, has drained the battery). So I'm returning my unit. But this seems to be the exception, and I didn't downgrade the Clip much for this.

And at ~$60, it's by far the best player for the money. (Better than the shuffle or zen stone).

<Title>Great little player with features to spare
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>SanDisk's Sansa Clip is an amazing little device.  I've owned iPods before, and I'm pretty tech savvy. (a computer engineering student in college)  The sound quality is great for such a portable device.  The battery life could be better but honestly, on a player this tiny, I can't see a reason why you'd need such a long battery life--with only 2GB space it's not designed to be brought on long trips or things like that.  Simply enough, you can just drag and drop any music you want on the MP3 player.  Anyway, my point is, think of an iPod shuffle.  Now give yourself an FM radio, voice controls, recording controls, a lower overall price, a higher capacity, and probably most importantly, the ability to CHOOSE a song.  I also love that it uses a standard USB mini port, because I have other cords that are compatible.  The only two problems I have are that I wish there was a power cord for a wall outlet, and it's not possible to copy music from my MP3 player to my hard drive.  But it's nothing worth docking it a star, so I'm going to fully recommend this device as the best MP3 player I've used.  Oh, also, I tried this player using Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) and it does in fact work properly.  I was able to drag and drop music to the player.  The only problem is that I got copies of artists when I did this.  Ubuntu didn't see the folders that I added from windows properly, so I wound up with 2 separate folders for any artists I added with both drives.  (i.e. I added one song by Weezer using Windows, and another song by Weezer in Ubuntu, and the player now shows them as two separate artists, both named "Weezer", but each containing a different song)  So, it will most likely work in Ubuntu, but only really if you add songs using one OS only.  Again, a better positive than negative.

<Title>Much better player than the Zen Stone plus
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa clip is an outstanding player in the compact, on the go field of MP3 players. I've had or have used a few other players in this range and bought the Zen Stone Plus a few months back. The Sansa clip is better than the Stone Plus in just about every way possible. The most notable aspects where the Sansa clip is superior is the battery life (about 2x that of the Stone Plus) and ease of use. The LCD display is also much nicer on the Sansa clip. And of course the Sansa clip has....the clip, while the Stone doesn't, so that's an extra expense.  Anybody looking for a compact player can't go wrong with the Sansa clip. The only down-side I found is that my 5 year old PC with USB 1.1 can't charge the Sansa clip nor will it recognize the clip in MTP mode, while the Stone Plus doesn't have this issue. If you have a newer PC with USB 2.0 it's not an issue. My PC will recognize the Sansa clip in MSC mode, however.

I'm amazed on the FM reception. I have an old Creative Zen Nano which has so-so signal.  The other good thing is you don't have to install ITunes.

<Title>The New Leader In Small MP3 Players
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>BACKGROUND:  I was in the market for a small MP3 player with primary usage at the gym.  I was looking for a rechargeable unit as my previous player ate AAA batteries about every week or so.  I considered three options of which the Sansa Clip was one of them.  I eliminated the iPod Shuffle due to its cost and lack of display.  The other primary contender was the Creative Zen Stone Plus (I rejected the non-Plus model due it its lack of display).  I will reference how the Sansa Clip won out throughout the rest of the review.  SET UP:  The Sansa Clip is about as simple as it gets in this area.  It requires no additional software installation.  My home system runs XP SP2 with Windows Media Player 11.  When I plugged the player in to charge, it was detected and recognized automatically.  I told windows to "Take No Action" as the default behavior when the device connects.  This allows me to maintain complete control over the syncing process.  My unit charged in about an hour.  MUSIC TRANSFER:  You have the option of using simple drag and drop of MP3 files to the device as you would a USB flash drive.  However, using Windows Media Player allows you the more advanced feature of playlists.  Since I primarily use my MP3 player at the gym, I created multiple playlists for warm up, workout, and cool down.  The workout lists are about 90 minutes while the others about 20 minutes.  I really liked that I was able to create multiples of each for variety.  Right now I have three of each with about 1.5 Gb still remaining to use as I please.  Using Windows Media Player, you can sync albums, songs, or playlists as you would with any other device.  The Sansa Clip fully supports all of these options so it is a nice low effort, highly functional set up.  SOUND QUALITY:  This is an area where the Sansa Clip is pretty impressive.  I previously had the Sansa M230, and I can tell a significant difference in sound quality.  I am able to hear a lot more detail in the higher ranges (such as high hat cymbals).  I am using the headphones that came with the unit, but I would image that higher quality headphones would sound even better.  The player also has a series of preset equalizer settings for different music styles as well as one that you can customize.  DISPLAY:  This is a distinguisher between the Clip and the Zen Stone Plus.  The display is larger and easier to read.  The mix of blue and yellow against the black background is also pleasant.  NAVIGATION:  The Clip has a normal four button dial that is common to most small MP3 players.  With the crisp, clear display it is easy to move around and select music by artist, album, song, or playlist.  The only thing that I have noticed that doesn't work quite the way I would like is that if you navigate away from the song that is playing there doesn't seem to be a way to get back to it to see the details of what's playing.  This is pretty minor, though, because I do not regularly navigate away from the song that is playing.  FM RADIO:  This is about what you would expect from a unit with no external antenna.  Strong signals come in clearly, but it is not going to match what you can pick up on your car stereo.  This is a nice to have feature for me so it is plenty adequate.  OPTIONS:  As I mentioned previously, my primary usage comes at the gym.  I had used the song timer to measure the time between reps while lifting weights on my M230.  However, the Clip has a power saving feature that shuts off the display after 15 seconds by default.  However, you can change this to 30, 45, 60, or 90 seconds which should cover your needs.  After adjusting mine, I wake up the display after completing a set.  When the display shuts off, it's time for the next set.  USE ON THE GO:  This is the other area where the Clip separates itself from the Zen Stone Plus.  You can clip the player to your clothes or an arm strap (I use the one that came with my M230).  The Zen Stone Plus requires purchase of a separate armband accessory for an additional $15.  COST:  At base price, the Zen Stone Plus and Sansa Clip are a push.  However if you factor in another $15 for an armband you have a clear winner given the other advantages.  CONCLUSION:  The Sansa Clip is now the leader in 2 Gb small MP3 players.  Give it a spin and you won't be disappointed.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My last MP3 player was a 256MB iRiver with an FM tuner.  This MP3 player is a MAJOR upgrade for me.  On top of the obvious upgrade in memory, this player has an easier to navigate display and far superior sound quality.  The synch with Windows XP is super easy.  I'm a BIG fan of this MP3 player.

<Title>The New Leader In Small MP3 Players
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>BACKGROUND:  I was in the market for a small MP3 player with primary usage at the gym.  I was looking for a rechargeable unit as my previous player ate AAA batteries about every week or so.  I considered three options of which the Sansa Clip was one of them.  I eliminated the iPod Shuffle due to its cost and lack of display.  The other primary contender was the Creative Zen Stone Plus (I rejected the non-Plus model due it its lack of display).  I will reference how the Sansa Clip won out throughout the rest of the review.  SET UP:  The Sansa Clip is about as simple as it gets in this area.  It requires no additional software installation.  My home system runs XP SP2 with Windows Media Player 11.  When I plugged the player in to charge, it was detected and recognized automatically.  I told windows to "Take No Action" as the default behavior when the device connects.  This allows me to maintain complete control over the syncing process.  My unit charged in about an hour.  MUSIC TRANSFER:  You have the option of using simple drag and drop of MP3 files to the device as you would a USB flash drive.  However, using Windows Media Player allows you the more advanced feature of playlists.  Since I primarily use my MP3 player at the gym, I created multiple playlists for warm up, workout, and cool down.  The workout lists are about 90 minutes while the others about 20 minutes.  I really liked that I was able to create multiples of each for variety.  Right now I have three of each with about 1.5 Gb still remaining to use as I please.  Using Windows Media Player, you can sync albums, songs, or playlists as you would with any other device.  The Sansa Clip fully supports all of these options so it is a nice low effort, highly functional set up.  SOUND QUALITY:  This is an area where the Sansa Clip is pretty impressive.  I previously had the Sansa M230, and I can tell a significant difference in sound quality.  I am able to hear a lot more detail in the higher ranges (such as high hat cymbals).  I am using the headphones that came with the unit, but I would image that higher quality headphones would sound even better.  The player also has a series of preset equalizer settings for different music styles as well as one that you can customize.  DISPLAY:  This is a distinguisher between the Clip and the Zen Stone Plus.  The display is larger and easier to read.  The mix of blue and yellow against the black background is also pleasant.  NAVIGATION:  The Clip has a normal four button dial that is common to most small MP3 players.  With the crisp, clear display it is easy to move around and select music by artist, album, song, or playlist.  The only thing that I have noticed that doesn't work quite the way I would like is that if you navigate away from the song that is playing there doesn't seem to be a way to get back to it to see the details of what's playing.  This is pretty minor, though, because I do not regularly navigate away from the song that is playing.  FM RADIO:  This is about what you would expect from a unit with no external antenna.

<Title>Much better than iPod
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my new Sansa Clip. I've had an RCA, a Rio, and a Shuffle, and can easily say this is the best by far. Old Sandisks had problems but this one is bang on.  Sound is awesome. Display bright and user friendly. Tiny design makes it great for the gym. Price is amazingly low for such a quality product. Software works better than iTunes. The headphones are quite good, though I use my apple in-ears with a Shure foam tweak.    My only concern is that they don't have them available in Cnada (sold out here).  Am buying a second for my wife.  Can't go wrong.

<Title>Excellent for gym use and second mp3 player
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item is great I picked it up in black Friday at Best Buy.  This little mp3 player sounds so much better than my Zune.  It has a good bass and works well with my cheap earbuds.  I can't wait to try it with my ultimate ear headphones.  It is a great little device with a clip.  I like this device so much I will try out one of their e200 series mp3 player.

<Title>Sansa Clip 2GB - Great MP3 Value and Performance!
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> The Sandisk Sansa Clip 2GB is a great value MP3 player.  It has twice the capacity as the iPod Shuffle for about $50.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can get the 1GB version for $35.  Pros -  + good sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner (20 Presets) + voice recording   + nice design with more color options + Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via software + 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Clip Plus + Integrated Clip means no add-on case / lanyard purchase needed!  Cons  - larger body than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  The new Sandisk Sansa Clip has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the compatibility, feature, and price benefits of other MP3 players.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.    The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced VERY well for the holidays.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.  The rechargable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The earbuds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only time will tell; so far it's holding up nicely.  I definitely recommend the larger 2GB option. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the CreativeZen, Sandisk Sansa, Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Overall, an awesome starter unit that deserves a try.
