<Title>Gem

<Content>The fingerprints were very annoying at first, but the hard and shiny acrylic surface is quickly restored to perfection with a quick swipe of the thumb. The design is simply elegant in material quality, like a piece of jewelry accentuated with understated OLED animation effects. The built-in clock is a small touch, but the unit's simplicity makes it a handsome timepiece in its own right. Not to mention that this is the best looking USB thumb drive I've seen on the market. Like a sliver of fresh-cut dough the curves make it very pleasurable to the eyes and to the touch. If only they were cheaper by the dozen.  FM stereo presets and mp3 operations are well thought out and simple, and I wonder why they needed twist knobs in the older Core Walkman models. The headphones in ultra/blaring-white (non-gloss cord and smooth buds) sound surprisingly good with my custom setting on the 5 band eq, which is funny because the black version that came with my MZ-DH710 isn't any good. Classmates thought I finally got an iPod, but I just pulled out the slippery blue body from my pants pocket and said "It's a Sony!"   I have to admit I bought a Shuffle at Walmart, and returned it because of the unsatisfying sound. But this Sony has a much better music quality. All that R&D on the MD wasn't all for nothing. Unlike the MD, Sony builds a digital FM tuner into a tiny body, creating a good tavelling companion and a "wireless" connection to the outside world like in the old days. It's good to have an exciting Walkman again.  -------------some more technical details-------------------  Something else to consider when you buy is that the new Shuffle lacks a direct USB terminal (need dock), display, tuner, and is still sharp-edged to the touch, in contrast to the NW-E002F which is all curves. If considering the new Shuffle, please realize what you can get for $20 more in the also 1GB NW-E003F ($100 vs $80).   I use SonicstageCP (instead of the drag-and-drop tranfer utility voidMP3FM) because it's the only way to see traditional Chinese characters displayed on the Walkman. Just used for transfers, so not too bad.

<Title>It;s OK for the price!
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this just for a long overseas trip.  I paid less for this and I am glad I did, had I paid full-price I would not have been impressed.  It does show fingerprints and smudges - a matte finish would have been easier to take care of.  The 'home' button is too close to the 'play/stop' button and when pushing either, I always manage to change the volume on the back.  You can rotate the display to change this (for right-handed or left-handed people).  The sonicstage software is AWFUL.  It took me hours to get just a couple of playlists on the MP3 player.  SOme of that is my lack of knowledge of computer music players, but it is really complicated.   All in all this will work for my trip, but I won't be adding and deleting a lot of tracks.  It's just too complicated trying to work the software and the menu buttons on the player.

<Title>A fricking disaster
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I never wanted to write something bad about anything, but common sense obliges me to inform all the future users about the sorry Sony politic.  You can see a lot of complaints out there on the Web so I will not talk long.  I am a professional in computing and I must say that Sony's "software" is one of the worst of the kind. I could not even get it started on my work computer ! Where I could - it showed instability and inconsistency. I want to use windows explorer to transfer the files ! Sony people should have made the "transcoding" transparent to the users. A simple shell integration would do the trick. Even my girlfriend who has close to zero knowledge about computers hates the fact that she has to install the XZxyyZgh software on her friends computer before they can transfer their favorite music.   One fact:  I will never - ever buy a Sony electronic musical device.

<Title>Great MP3 for the $$
<Date>Sun Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this MP3 as a gift for my 6-1/2 y.o. daughter, who wanted an iPod like mine.  I decided to go with something less expensive and got a great deal on this (mispriced at store!).  Although someone noted the software was horrible, I have to disagree.  It worked beautifully and we were up and running, downloading music in less than 10 minutes.  The sound quality is great.  I did purchase a different set of headphones since the earbud variety are not comfortable.  My only complaint and the reason for 4 stars, is that you cannot go backwards to play a previous song. You must scroll forward through all your songs if the one you want is only one song back.  It's easy to operate though and the "hold" button is perfect to keep things from getting accidentally changed.  My daughter is over the moon and mom is happy with the purchase.  It's great for workouts too since you can hear your own music OR FM, which my iPod Nano can't do.

<Title>I will hesitate now for any sony products
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought it to make a present to my son and needed to return it back to the store. The reason? It is NOT an mp3 player. It sucks. Nobody in my family could use it.  This device does not play mp3. You have to produce files in Sony's closed proprietary format from your mp3 files. Can you imagine? I have 4 computers at home and neither has Windows OS (linux and macos only). However, to use this peace of... sony technology you need to install their windows software and use it to convert and manage songs on the device.  As soon as I recognized that I cannot use the device, I searched online. It seems that Sony only produce devices that actually cannot work without converting your songs to their format. All other players are fine and real mp3 players. All but Sony! They are lying to you: they cannot play mp3. They do not have mp3 players at all. They also restrict your freedom to choose an OS you really like and pushing you to use Microsoft only. I am so upset that Sony is really dead for me now.
