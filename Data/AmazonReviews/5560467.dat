<Title>Cheap and easy = short lifespan
<Date>Tue Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I was shopping for an mp3 player, I wasn't looking for something really expensive, just something cheap and easy to use for when I worked out. It is extremely easy to upload and remove songs from - so easy I didn't even have to read the directions. No software to install. It doesn't hold an impressive amount of songs, around 50 to 55, depending on the length of the songs. I personally did not like the earbuds because they weren't padded and were uncomfortably large for my ears. I would recommend this mp3 player to the person just looking for something cheap and easy to use, but don't expect it to last you a long time - it only took a mere 5 months for mine to die on me, and I took good care of it.

<Content>I have had the mp3 player for over a month.  I use it when I work out and have had no problems with it.  The arm band is the best accessory i've found!

<Title>great while it lasted

<Content>I got this just for walking at the park, so didn't expect much but it died after a few weeks.  It stopped working and would only shut off when I removed the battery. When I hooked it up to the computer again it didn't recognize it at all.  While it worked it was great--easy to use, easy to load songs (I fit about 60).
