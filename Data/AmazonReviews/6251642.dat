<Content>This Player is great. The folks at Creative, or third parties, should not lose the momentum and must start offering accesories for this Player.

<Content>equals no sale. Closed system that excludes me is more "proprietary" than iTunes/iPod combo. You are not forced to use iTunes to use your iPod, any CD can be ripped to it. You are not forced to use a particular OS for your computer either, with an iPod. Not so with this wanna-be. Zen-casting? give me a break!  no zero star option available

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for my son this christmas. He likes it but finds it too bulky and no way near as easy to operate as his cousins iPod video. He's swithcing to the iPod as soon as he sells the Creative. I must say that the video on the creative is very good looking. Sharper than on Apples iPod. But keep in mind that the Zen is a portable videodevice and the iPod is a MP3 player with videocapabilities. It's NOT a Video iPod. Maybe something will incarnate at Macworld !

<Title>Blows Apple Away
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product has it all of over Apple's Ipod.  More importantly it is getting more and more obvious that Apple Fanatics (probably shareholders) go around and give every non-Apple product only one star and then make up some ridiculous negative review.   But the worm is about to turn for Apple as the competition is now coming up with superior products at better price points.  Which brings me to the new Creative M.     Superior battery life, FM Radio free (not a $50 add on like the Apple)and wider compatibility.  Enough said.

<Title>Solid features give plenty of bang for the buck, excellent PMP
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off let me say I have experimented with the iPod Video (friend got it for Xmas) and generally liked it. Just for my needs, it wasn't the right choice. I use XP mainly and wanted more video and song compatibilty options. After much research (iAudio X5, iPod Video, and others) the Vision:M came out on top. Now that I've received mine and had a chance to play with it some, I think it's obvious by some of the alleged "reviews" posted by obvious iPod fans, they really haven't even tested this excellent unit.   Some highlights: 1- works with the subscription based music services, which was high on my list. iTunes may someday offer this option, but at least for now does not. I like to try out all kinds of music before purchasing and can do it with this portable media player (PMP). Sound quality for music is very good, with an EQ to tweak to individual tastes.  2- video quality is top notch, with several different formats supported. It was quite easy to transfer recordings from my Snapstream PVR setup on the PC to the Vision:M, so now I have several episodes of The Simpsons, Scrubs, and 60 Minutes to watch during trips. Nice.  3- The menu navigation is just like the Creative Zen Micro, and I think most people will get the hang of that relatively quickly. It's not perfect but I had it pretty much down in the initial hour of playing around with the unit.  OTHER INFO: I haven't had a chance to play video for a long stretch to determine true battery life, but specs and reviews on sites like CNET indicate it is about 4 hours for video and 14 or so for music. That is plenty for me. iPod is more in the 2-3 hour range for video.  As for size, I've seen some who make a big deal that it is thicker than the iPod Video. However, the Zen feels solid and comfortably fits in my hand. I have no problem at all with the size. It's plenty small.  I've noticed some people claim Creative has ripped off iPod for the look, but really, the Creative Zen Micro MP3 player (about 2 years old) is what struck me as a near replica as far as size/design goes. Similar to iPod Video, sure. But far closer to Creative's already long established MP3 player.  Features like microphone recording, FM play and record, Outlook calendar / contacts compatibility, etc. are nice little bonuses but weren't a real factor in my selection criteria.  With the upcoming vast increase in choices for video, podcast and music download availability (as evidenced by recent announcements at CES and elsewhere), the Zen Video:M should be a great choice for anyone who rates features/quality over the "hipness" factor iPod currently has over the masses. I give Apple credit for how they achieved their iPod success with great marketing and a solid product, I just think if you do your research you may end up choosing the Video:M as well. I wouldn't hesitate at all to steer a Windows XP user to it.  P.S. Tested out the ZenCast feature (in beta as of my writing) and it shows promise as a way to collect video and audio podcasts from a centralized location.   Creative Zen Video:M gets a big thumbs up from me...

<Title>Just trying to even things out.
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hey I think the ipod line of products are fantastic! I think apple is doing some really great stuff. The fact of the matter is that Creative and other companies are doing great stuff too. The zen vision:m is an example of this. Why cant both products be good at the same time?!  Of coarse the reason I chose the zen vision:m is because of its ability to play multiple formats of video. I also have a subscription with napster to download all the music i want for 14 bucks a month. I do not like the iTunes interface and setup...but thats just me. I think that some people are better off with iPods (mainly the people who dont have a clue about technology). I also think that the 2hours of video on the iPod video is not enough for me...again this is not true for everybody. The zen vision:M gives a solid 4 hours of video playback time. Hopefully more people can come to love both products instead of sending hate one way!

<Title>Quality lacking
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this one for Christmas. After using it for a few weeks, it's going back and getting replaced with an iPod. My wife has the iPod, and it is much easier to use than the Creative. The Creative certainly is not as easy to use as the iPod, and it also feels as though it is not made as well. You can pretty much tell after using them side-by-side that this is Creative's attempt at copying the iPod. They do a good job of making it look similar, but it just doesn't stack up to the quality of the iPod.

<Title>A lil dissapointing, but I don't think anyone else could have done much better
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now, I don't see the hype between the iPod video and Creative Zen vision.  I can see why some people love iPod and can think that the creative is just a rip-off.  Well it is not a rip-off, because that's what companies do.  Competition is a vital factor in advancing our race.  Here, I'll do some pros and cons  Pros for creative: -Vivid screen, very nice colors, the iPod video screen is not so good -Compatible with most video codecs when the iPod is not (see specs above) -2 hours more battery lfie for video than iPod -a few more hours of music playback than iPod -When connected to the computer via USB, the battery charges using the USB power -Well made in my opinion, pretty sturdy, however I don't wanna try dropping it. -Connects to the TV and works perfectly (I tried it with a previous AV cable made by panasonic for my video camera) -Great sound quality -DOES NOT CONVERT MUSIC FILES TO AAC.  MUSIC FILES CAN BE DUPLICATED -You can change the background to any image you have on the creative -You can zoom in onto pictures quite nicely -Dubbed the iPod killer   Cons: -A bit bulkier (I don't mind, since it is pretty small to me anyways -Battery cannot be removed and voids the warranty when it is opened -Navigation is different, not hard.  People that are use to the iPod will always think highly of iPod's navigation system -Converting video is slow but I don't think iPod's is any better -The power plug is kinda big and im a bit confused why it comes in 2 pieces -The back is not black as well, I would have liked the back of the creative to be black as well as everything else including the cables etc -The video seek is slow, but I'm thinking that because it is a hard drive and not a flash drive.  I highly doubt any other hard drive based media player can be any faster -$30 over the price of the iPod video 30 gb, but it costs money is your a pc user in order to connect  I can add some more later after I use the Creative Zen Vision: M a lil more.   Overall I give it a 9 out of 10.

<Title>A real Vision M Review...
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>****Updated Review**** 1/17/2006 (original below)  I've installed Windows XP as a dual boot on one of my machines. I was able to install the Zen Vision M and Creative Media Source software without any issues. I also successfully installed WMP10 without issues.  While I was getting my pc ready to install XP I played with the player to see what I could do with it alone. I figured out how to quickly adjust the settings using the slide and tap paradigm. The Zen Touch has a similar paradigm but the Vision M extends it, the touch pad actually has left and right clicks as well. After a bit of frustration I realized that sliding through menu's should always be done with the finger on the surface of the pad, if you lift and reseat your finger the player would interpret that as a "tap" and thus commence whichever setting you happened to be on when you were sliding..I did this a few times before I got the hang of the slide and tap. Also, it took a few minutes to figure out how to enable submenu options using the lower right icon. Once I was up to speed (took about 10 minutes WITHOUT consulting the sparce instruction book) I quickly went through the task of selecting my name for the player, adding a background (I used one of the samples provided in the picture section), setting the date and time. I then moved on to checking out the radio feature, you can set the device to "auto" scan and it works perfectly. It picked up and preset every station inside of 10 seconds, awesome! I live in a basement apartment and I was suprised at how clean the signal was coming from the radio from such a small (read: tiny FM antenna) device. The next thing I wanted to try was recording, from the radio I was able to enable recording, the sub features are really very intuitive. Again, I did this all without consulting the book within a space of 20 minutes. The hardest part was the first 10 minutes of getting used to the slide and tap paradigm. Now on to the XP experience...  I finally got XP up and running, I installed the software and fter the obligatory reboot, I plugged the port doc into the player and connected the mini usb plub into the doc and the doc into the pc's USB port. Within seconds, the sync screen flashed on the player and the pc reported the synch process had been started. The Vision M software loaded up and showed my connected player fine.  The layout is very intuitive and nice, the inards of the device were layed out by category (music,video,recordings..etc.) and subcategories and folders where necessary. I could freely create or delete subcategories under the main categories. I am still miffed as to why this functionality couldn't have been provided in basic form for every known OS but only Creative and Microsoft have the answer to that riddle.  I proceeded to upload a ripped album ( I have several hundred cuts waiting to go on the player) unfortunately, I have USB 1.1 on the box I installed the XP on so the transfer is not as fast as it could be but it is acceptable. The entire folder of 14 mp3's took about 4 minutes to copy to the player. I tested a cut, the sound quality is really excellent. ( I rip at 192kbps)  Now that I have gone through the inconvenience of installing windows XP just to use it, I am very happy with the player itself. It is a shame that broader OS support isn't in place but that should be easily rectified with firmware upgrades (are you listening creative????). As much as I'd love to give the player a 5, the pain I went through to get it to work really demands something lower but not quite a 4. Hmm....I guess I'll have to give Creative the nod, after using the player now for a week I am  really impressed with it's performance in all areas. So 5 stars it is (this should tell you just how good the player is despite the hell I went through to start managing media on it).  Player highly recommended but make sure you have XP!     **ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/13/2006** **ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/13/2006**  How some are claiming to have this at Christmas time in the US when it wasn't even available until this week is telling of the mental disturbances behind some peoples needs to assert the superiority of products they prefer because of one one manufacturer or another. Sad.  That said, here is my real world review of the Creative Vision M. I just took possession of it today, UPS came through 2 days as promised by Amazon.  Previous player experience:  I have used a few other mp3 players but have never owned one until now. I've used the Apple Nano, Ipod Video and the Creative Zen Touch.  Packaging and box:  The box is well designed and sturdy, a sleave and box design gives it a artsy touch, however it makes it more difficult to get at the player..no matter it's just a box.  Player and contents:  Upon taking out the parts I enjoyed the well built and finished look of everything. The cables , port adapter and the player itself are very well made. Contrary to what some have said, the size of the player is quite small in my medium sized hands. I wouldn't want it any smaller, it fit in my hand comfortably and was a lot lighter than the Zen Touch which I bought for my ex girlfriend last Christmas. In comparison to the Ipod Video it's about twice as thick but weighs and "feels" about the same. In the hand they feel similarly, so all talk of the weight/size being a drawback is bunk or those complaining need to do hand strengthening exercises ;) The surface of the player is very cool, much like the Ipod video the black (the one i got) surface is glossy. After charging the battery (takes 2 hours) I turned it on, the screen is quite beautiful to behold with rich vibrant colors. In comparison to the Ipod Video, though technically the M has more colors both have enough that video on them looks amazing, I guess I'd have toplay something on both that stretches the gamut of the players to see which is better.  Software Installation?:  The first major issue I ran into with the player was installation of the software. First, Creative includes a warning card indicating that Quicktime versions 7.0 and 7.0.2 will crash the installation so you should upgrade first to 7.0.3 (which fixes the bug) or uninstall Quicktime, install the Creative software then install Quicktime again.  This isn't the deal breaker however, the insurmountable problem for me is that I use windows 2000 and windows 2003. I don't have XP on any of the 8 running pc's in my home/business network. I own an IT business and have no use for the annoying "features" of Windows XP, why Creative didn't think to maximize software support to as many OS's as possible is beyond me (actually it is not I have some ideas..). Beyond that, why the player just doesn't attach to any pc using the USB port as a drive is also inexcusable.  ****Creative! wake up, many , many users still are on windows OS's that are not XP and if a thumb drive can auto doc without software surely your $330 player should be able to as well!!!****  Now that said, I had to figure out how to add content to my player. I figured Creative has to have software available for windows 2000 so I decided to contact customer support to find out. Page 2 of the "product information guide" indicated that customer support services are located on the installation cd in the "support" folder, I explored the CD and found the english phone number on the "customer support service center" page.  For service in the U.S. in english (french,brazilian,spanish numbers also available):  405 742 6622  I called the number expecting a long wait time, 2 minutes turned to 5, 5 to 10...and then I realized the number was long distance, "complementary" service should always be on a 1 800 number other wise it is not really complementary is it???. The nerve of Creative to call this so called "complementary" service. I hung up quite pissed off. I figured maybe I'll have more luck at the website. I went to www.creative.com/support/downloads , and tried to select my product from the list, of course there is no listing for the brand new "vision m" player.  Now I was really seeing red, how can a company release a product for sale and then not provide the necessary support services??!!. Not one to give up (ever) I decided to see if anyone with my issue had posted to the public forums (always the best place..should have done this straight away)..I went to the mp3 player forums page and queried "vision m and windows 2000" and the results were not encouraging at all, of the 8 total posts that referenced the words together, only 1 had ANY replies. (I guess the Creative support team is keeping away from answering legitimate customer complaints about this issue???)  I dug into the only thread that had responses hoping a solution to my problem would be found there in.  http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=pmc&message.id=4967  Bad news was waiting, only one post was by a Creative moderator and they offered no help at all. I do have a copy of windows XP on site that came with my Dell Laptop, back then I immediately ripped out the XP and put the more functional windows 2000 on. The idea of installing XP is anethema to me just to use the player really sucks. If I didn't have XP I would have no choice but to return the player! There is no way I would give M$ $100 bucks just because Creative has a secret deal to lock us into M$ proprietary protocols.  The most egregious aspect of this situation is that the older players (Zen Touch I bought for ex) did support 2000 in file mode, why Creative went the restrictive route of only supporting the Micro$oft proprietary protocol exclusively has something probably to do with some "relationship" they struck with MS no doubt. It really stinks, here I am unable to use the device on my desired OS. I am seriously debating weather I should just send it back or if I should install XP on a box JUST to use my $330 mp3 player. (which is a pretty deck of card size brick otherwise)  Conclusion:  ***WARNING TO ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS, IF YOU HAVE ANY OPERATING SYSTEM OTHER THAN WINDOWS XP , YOU CURRENTLY CAN NOT USE THE VISION M TO DOWNLOAD OR MANAGE MEDIA. IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 98,ME, NT, 2000, MAC OS, YOUR ARE DEAD IN THE WATER.***  Hopefully with enough of a stink being made of this ridiculous situation Creative will move to provide a firmware update that provides the WIDE OS support that existed PRIOR to this NEW product. The player itself works fine, the sample videos that were on it played with excellent clarity and color, the sound was excellent. The touchpad was a bit sensitive on first touch but that was rectified by turning down the sensitivity in the settings. However, the OS support severely hampers my ability to give this player a top rating. In fact I would have given it a 5 if it just worked with my OS but it doesn't (not even as a removable drive..come on Creative even a $30 USB thumb drive can do that!!!) so I will have to take the rating down 4 points to a 1 out of 5.    ...now I'll have to find that old copy of windows XP lying around to grudgingly install it on one of my boxes.

<Title>Best MP3 player out in the market
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i just got mine last week so i'll just try to list some pros and cons  Pros  - the screen is more crisp and clear, just wonderful compared to the iPod video (this is proof now that the images in the early reviews that the pics for Creative ARE NOT saturated to make them look better) - sound quality is also better, this coming from Creative so for sure - the earbuds were the most surprising thing, they sound fantastic.  I never realised how bad the ipod earbuds were until today(i am a former 3rd G ipod owner) when i walked into an Apple store and did a comparison in the store, then switched it with the Creative ones. The ipod ones don't isolate the sound as well and it lacks bass, as if it isn't there unless you use the EQ, whereas the Creative ones have a nice bass and a fresh clear sound. Even on the same volume the creative ones are considerably louder - 4 hours of video so you can actually watch a whole movie and still have some battery left over to listen to music - 15 hours of audio life, Creative website says 14hrs but on reviews by Cnet on test, it was actually 15 hours. - though bulkier than the ipod video, the size makes it easier to hold, IMO the size is perfect, it's exactly the same as my 3rd Generation iPod with a silicon case - FM radio, great addition if you wanna just listen to the radio sometimes, i do  Cons - Internal battery so you can't personally remove it - the verticle scroll is a little too sensitive, being a former ipod user, it takes a bit of getting use to - buttons are a bit stiff at first, but i notice as time goes by it's easier to press - no "on the go playlist" like the ipod, if there is i haven't found out how to do it yet  i give this product a 9/10, however because of some very biased reviews giving 0 or 1, i am bumping this up for a 5/5

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this player as a gift for Christmas a few years ago. It was the first mp3 player I've ever gotten, and as long as it keeps working, probably the last.   First of all, it is extremely durable. I'm really hard on electronics, but this thing can take a beating. I've dropped it a few times (once into a bathtub full of water... while it was playing) and the only show of abuse is the corner is cracked and it sometimes has a tendency to freeze if it gets too warm. As long as I'm careful, it's not a problem.  The best thing about it is all the space. I have over 1000 songs, 51 videos (mostly short ones I've taken myself, some music videos and some classic Ren and Stimpy cartoons), and almost 800 songs, plus two gb set aside as removable storage... and I have 20 gb left.   Aside from music, video and picture viewing, it can take short voice recordings, has an FM radio (with pretty good reception, too. I can get channels that my stereo can't pick up), removable storage up to 8 gb like I said earlier, and an date planner. I've never used that feature, since it has to be done on the computer, and I don't need it anyway.   The only really negative things I can think to say about it is that the battery doesn't last as long as it says it should, and the touch pad, even on the lowest setting, is a little too sensitive sometimes. Also I think the screen is a little too bright, even on it's lowest setting. The size is a little bulky as well, but for the for the amount of storage space it gives you, it's worth it. And it also tends to freeze, but I just put that down to me dropping it a bunch of times.   I don't know how it compares to an iPod, since I've never used one, but I think this player is worth every penny.

<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product is amazing.  If you are a PC user, and not in need of the "baby-me" features of the iPod this is for you.  Personally I like the product most because it requires no proprietary software to transfer data to the device.  Just plug it in, and drop in the music.  I have had it for about a year now, dropped it a few times on subway platforms... I dont baby it- and it has proved extremely rugged.  Tales of the screen easily scratching (to a point of unusability) are just that - tales.  The controls are a little sensitive, but it is a small price to pay when you consider the limitiations of the zune and especially the iPod.  If you want something pretty buy the iPod.  If you want something rugged and functional, with very good sound quality GET THE ZEN!
