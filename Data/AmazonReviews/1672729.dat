<Title>Garbage!!! Don't waste your money!
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased this MP3 player through TigerDirect.com.   I had to reformat it after only 1 day because it has a glitch that puts it in permanent wait mode until it's reformatted.  Even then it took me almost an hour to do it, because it put the computer on wait mode, too!  Ridiculous!!!  If that wasn't bad enough, the increase volume button stopped working after 3 days.  We were able to turn the volume down to 00 (mute) but had no way of increasing the volume, because the button doesn't work!    This MP3 player is complete junk - I'm in the process of trying to get TigerDirect to replace it ... I've yet to see!  If you want a mp3 player that actually works, don't get this one!!

<Title>Great Little Player, A few Small complaints
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this little 1GB player for a trip because the Sony MP3 player I have can only be charged via a computer, and I won't be traveling with my laptop.  That said, this thing is tiny, weighs nothing, and since it runs on AAA batteries, is great for travel. However, I quickly learned that you can only "lock" the keys while it's playing, and since the buttons on it are very easily pressed, the thing often runs through a battery while in my gym bag! I've started removing the battery when I'm not using it.   I'm not a fan of music software either, and I like that this player comes with software, but also functions like a flash drive, so click and drag works just as well as using their music program.  overall, I'm happy with it.

<Title>Mia Culpa!
<Date>Tue Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will admit when I'm wrong, and, apparently, I was wrong about this MP3 player.  A couple of months after I purchased the Ultra Hydra 1GB MP3 player, I suddenly and for no apparent reason began to have problems connecting the player to either of my laptops via the USB connection; no matter how long I waited, the player would not load in Windows Explorer as a valid USB drive.  I called Ultra Products Tech Support and followed all their suggestions (taking out the battery, trying to format the player, etc.), and the drive still wouldn't connect. After more than 1 hour every time I left-clicked or right-clicked (in Windows Explorer and Device Manager), Windows said the drive wasn't formatted. Nor would Windows actually allow me do a quick format of the drive when I was able to attempt it.  I began scouring the device drivers in the registry of both laptops, looking for anything out of the ordinary and in common between the two. I finally found a driver (IomDisk.sys - IomegaWare) in the registries of both laptops which should not still be there. Sometime prior to my problem connecting the player to the laptops, I briefly installed a Zip drive on both laptops, which I had forgotten about. After I was done with the Zip, I removed the device and uninstalled all related software (or so I thought).  I checked the driver details for the Ultra MP3 player, and IomDisk.sys was listed as the first driver for the device. The uninstall provided by Iomega obviously didn't remove itself completely. (That was a shocker.)  I then did some research on the web, and sure enough, this driver is "crapware" that attaches itself to every media storage device installed on a PC. On the laptops in question, the only thing it was interfering with was the Ultra Hydra MP3 player. I've been attaching storage-only flash drives without any problems. It was just the Hydra that would not load up as a USB drive.  (I have no idea why.  Perhaps Ultra Products Tech Support should look into the issue.)  I backed up my registry on my primary laptop, and then removed every reference to IomDisk.sys from the registry. Rebooted. Reattached the player. Bang. The USB drive loaded immediately.  This completely solved the problem. So, to everyone who read my prior review where I ripped this player a new "one", I was wrong about the firmware upgrade being at fault, or anything else about the player in particular.  In my defense, it was an unfortunate concatenation of events. Since every other USB device was working just fine on both laptops, it seemed reasonable to me that the player had the issue. However, I was wrong.  I still don't think it was out-of-line for me, or any customer, to flash the firmware provided on the install CD. But, lesson learned. Never flash the firmware unless you first talk to tech support.  Anyway, I apologize for the inaccurate review I posted previously.  Apparently, I got off easy on the problems caused by IomDisk.sys. Some of the sites I visited had absolute horror stories of lost hard drives.  To anyone else having a problem getting the 1GB Hydra MP3 player to load as a USB drive, check to see if the following driver exists on your system:  C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\IomDisk.sys  If so, and if you are not using an Iomega device, you may want to investigate getting the driver out of your registry. Do not simply delete the driver. Iomega installs it as a critical driver. If you delete the driver without removing it from the registry, your PC will not boot up.  The are knowledge base articles on MSN about editing the registry. Editing the registry and doing wrong can have disastrous consequences.  As far as the player itself, I like it.  I mostly listen to audio books, but for the cost, you can't beat it.  I keep my player in a case all the time and carefully protect it.  A nice feature about the player regards "folders".  I connected the players to my laptop, went into Windows Explorer, selected the USB drive, created a new folder, and dragged some audio files to the folder.  I stopped the drive, disconnected it, and then used the Menu button on the player. I went to Menu-6 Navigation. From there, I selected a folder to play tracks from. After I shut player off, I discovered when I turned it back on that play resumed from the last audio file I had been listening to.  I do wish there was a programming option in the play mode, instead of only repeat and shuffle. If a future firmware upgrade does add this function, I hope it provides a programming option.

<Title>Make sure you check for firmware upgrades

<Content>Right now this product does not have a "resume" feature, which to me is a must for an MP3 player unless you only listen to short songs - and don't listen to spoken-word programs or books-via-MP3.
