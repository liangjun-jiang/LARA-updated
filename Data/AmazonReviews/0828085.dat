<Title>A little gem!
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Creative Muvo is a great little mp3 player.  Easy to transfer files from the computer.  Although tiny in size it produces excellent sound quality.  The one AAA battery lasts ages.  The scroller, used for accessing menu options, takes a little bit of practise.  Excellent value for money for a quality mp3 player.

<Title>An average player at a good price
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had the Creative Zend Nano 1GB before and the first impression after opening the new player straight from the box is this think is bigger! Though the MuVo has a great advantage over Nano with the built-in USB for connecting to Win PCs with no hassle, no cables. The major issues with the USB is its speed - it took 20 minutes for 300mb to be copied. It will pose a problem if in a hurry and want to refresh your library in a timely manner.  This is the first impression after opening the box and plugging the Muvo to a PC.

<Title>Vastly Improved
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my 3rd Muvo player.  Things that made me a repeat purchaser: ------------------------------------------ + Extremely compact (Roughly the size of a cigarette lighter) + One handed navigation + Excellent battery life (About 16-20 hours on a single AAA) + Crisp, Clear Audio + Customizable EQ + No cables necessary to connect to a computer + No need to install proprietary software (Works like a flash drive)  Improvements with this model: ----------------------------- + 2 GB Capacity + Now features lyrics and 'libraries' for organization + More compact + More customization options + Lyrics display (if you're willing to supply the file)  Complaints with this model: --------------------------- - When you go to skip a folder, it doesn't bring you to the folder that's currently playing, as in previous models, but the very first one in the list.  Somewhat annoying. - No key ring attachment (But there are holes to attach a strap)

<Title>Great player for 90 days, then it died
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Neat little player that worked great for me for almost 3 months.  Then it dies for no apparent reason other than it is poorly made junk.  You hit the scroll wheel and it turns off.  I wish the power button worked half as well.  I'm shopping for a new player but it won't be one from Creative.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the best small mp3 player that I ever had, I bought it for recording my song from the guitar then it becomes my favorite mp3 player, I have a IPOD 20gb but it's bulky and don't have sound recording and it has no file browsing, you have to open terrible  Itunes to upload a single song and you have to add mp3 tags for each songs. it's a pain. But with creative you just plug the usb cable and upload your musics like an another harddrive, you don't need to add mp3 tags, it reads the file name. Record from the microphone or line in it's great. I am sure you are not expecting studio quality it's only good for quick guitar demo.  also it's works with AAA battery, I don't need to wait for charging like IPOD, I have AAA battery charger and 4 AAA batteries, I replace the batteries then the old one is died. I am carrying one extra AAA wiht me and I am always in tune.  it is very light and comes with arm band, perfect for trade mill.  Only thing is lcd screen is small and it's hard to use the navigation button if you have large fingers. I don't mind but my friends father didn't like it.  I think they shouldn't call it creative nano, because it's better then nano, it should have unique name like Creative IHateIPOD :)

<Title>A review with the blind or visually impaired in mind.
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>(I'd like to see more reviews which talk of access issues, similar to the following review.) First I'll give the pluses.  What I consider a plus for the MuVo V-100 is the direct plug and play access without any stinkin' proprietory software to muck around with.  That, to me, is more a must than a plus! Second plus, although, not necessarily anything real big or important, is the fact one can take this equipment apart and just use the guts of the unit, when separated from the battery pack, as a thumb drive. Third plus and must, is the multiple level directories one can work with, the way mp3 players should work in mine humpble opinion, not this single directory junk where the device does it's own numbering system according to when each file was loaded into the player.  That's a big fat minus where the Ipod shuffle, or any other device like that is concerned.  Fourth plus is, of course, the space at 2 gigabytes.  Now for the minuses, which are unfortunately way more than the plusses. Firstly, there are only four buttons or switches on this device, volume up and down, scroll switch, and play/power button. So, right there, you know that the scroll switch is going to be the main controlling factor on this unit as far as moving from track to track, or going through menues which I'll get to in a bit. Secondly, no audio feedback, of course, unless you stay in "Music" or maybe "recorded tracks," and you turn the device on by holding the play/power button for roughly five seconds, then wait for the unit to boot up, which can take upwards of 12 seconds, depending upon how much data is stored. As for the menues -- which are accessed by pressing the scroll switch -- they do not default.  So, even if you memorize the menues, you have to remember where the heck you left off at.  So, if you left off at Microphone, there's a possibility that once you manage to turn the device on, you might be continuing the recording.  Oh, to select what you want in a menu, you press the scroll switch again.   And, of course, there is no audible monitor through the headset when you record.  So, of course, you have to ask a sighted person if the recorder is going. Oh, speaking of having a sighted person help, what is with these stupid symbols rather than actual written text stating where one is in the menues? Furthermore, what is with this bad habit of these devices that stay in a menu for no more than maybe 5 seconds at the most?  For someone trying to help a blind person out, or for someone with difficulty with focus issues, that just does not work, people!  Hellllllllo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As for recording, the quality is poor.  Now, I'm taking into consideration the fact that the recordings are being done in low bit-rate wave files.  However, the recording volume -- or maybe it's the volume setting used for "recorded tracks" -- is very much lacking. We won't discuss how badly put together the mannual provided on the accompanying CD-rom was.  No step by step instructions on how to work the device, just some cursory explanation of some of the features. So, here's my final grading of the MuVo V-100 by Creative.   I give it an A for concept, an A for space,,  However, for ease of use and accessibility, I give it a D minus. Why a D minus rather than an F for accessibility?  Well, as long as you stay in "music" and as long as you don't accidentally press the scroll switch before moving it left or right to go from track to track, or for scanning tracks, then you're okay.  Secondly -- for folks who are left handed, one can go into the settings menu and rotate the display.  I guess that can actually be a help if a blind person is getting help from a sighted person and it makes it easier for the sighted person to se the screen. Creative seemed to have had a neat idea when they made the first MuVo with no display.  However, I got the impression that those particular models were lacking in space.

<Title>Just okay
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a few other flash players and, in comparison, this is the poorest purchase.  I bought it because it plays audible and fits a niche between my 1g players and my much larger ones.  The sound of the music is comparable to the other players.   The cons for me are as follows:  1. I always lock my player both while listening and while off.  The muvo's lock is  in the settings section rather than being a simple switch.  That makes it inconvenient to lock quickly. 2. Transferring files to the muvo takes much longer than with the other players.   3. The usb needs to connect directly to the computer- not to a hub.  It's thicker than a regular usb connection.  On my computer the way the usb ports are set up, it took up two slots. 4. The navigation system is similar to the one on my Iriver t10 but not as stable. 5. A minor complaint is that it came with no case or arm strap. The size is comparable to the Iriver t10  and to the Sansa both of which come with cases. For someone who is new to mp3 players, I would recommend the comparably prices Sansa m250.  It is far simpler to use and has similar features with fewer negatives.  An update: I've been using this player now for a few months.  Far from growing on me, I am even more unhappy with it.  I'd lower my rating if I could.  I alternate between this and my older 1GB Sansa.  It takes  20 minutes to transfer 1 book to the Muvo and 5 minutes for the same files with the Sansa.  Possibly the Muvo still uses the defunct 1.1USB format. The 2GB version of my Sansa is the same price as this player and is a far better player. It also has a radio and voice recorder. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-6925435-5758463">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>

<Content>I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  It works great in every way.  It's also a lot of memory for a great price!  We have already loaded over 300 songs and still have almost half the memory free.  The only negative I would have is that it is a little hard to power up.  You sometimes have to hold the power button down hard to get it to start.

<Content>Anyone have trouble with your computer recognizing the USB connection with your MP3 player?  I have tried numerous times to get my computer to recognize the Creative V100 (has the USB built in, no cord) and the computer simply does not see it.  After looking through Creative's web forum, it appears I am not the only one with this problem with this unit.  I've reinstalled the software and even tried plugging the player in without software to see if my PC recognizes it and it doesn't.  I don't have any problems using my USB port when downloading from my digital camera.  I am curious if anyone has had trouble with the SanDisk M250 2 GB.

<Title>Audio Book Heaven
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned 3 MP3 players prior to this one. 2 iPods and a Phillip's GoGear. All fancy $200+ units. I think the models of those I purchased were probably great for music... but they stunk for audio books. Problems I had were syncing devices, 3rd party programs, extra cradles, wires..etc.... I'm a computer savy person and it was just a hassle to get new content onto those players quickly...  I came upon the MuVo line via a friend with the 512mb one. I played with it for 30 minutes and was sold. In no time I was able to plug it right into my PC's USB port and XP automatically detected it as a flash drive.... I dumped a medium sized book onto it in about 4 minutes and I hit the on button..... and that was it, it started with the first file and kept on truckin. Now the BIG test.... i turned the unit off and prayed that it remembered where i was at in my book... flawlessly it did :-)  I quickly ordered the 2gig version that holds about 3 books worth of data. I could totally get by with just the 1gig, but... regardless, i've got the extra space if I ever need it.  What I love about the MuVo 100 is it's super simple... there are no wires, it plugs straight into a USB port and I've used it on many a laptop and desktop with no problems at all.  I listen to books about 12-15 hours a week.  I 'almost' gave it 4 stars for one little flaw.... you need to pay attn to the battery indicator on the LCD; it's the typical battery icon with 3 cells that start off black... then as you lose battery life a cell disappears... you get the picture. But when you're on your last cell, when you notice the last one go away, replace the battery. If you don't, it sometimes will fail to record where you were at when you turned the unit off and uses your previously timestamped shut off date. The only annoying thing at that point is once you have a new battery, fast forwarding to the where you were at.

<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I chose to go with this .mp3 player for a couple reasons, partly because I didn't feel I needed more than 2 gigs for what I was planning on using it for (turns out I was right, too; I have yet to fill it with music), and partly because I don't like the idea of a non-replaceable, rechargeable battery (for me, I think it's easier & safer to just use AAA's).  The only real drawback for me is that there's no AM/FM tuner. Normally I don't listen to the radio but having it would've been far preferable to the microphone this .mp3 player comes with. If you can overlook that then this is a great buy.

<Content>Just got for Christmas. My home computer does not recognize the player even though it recognizes all my other USB devices including an older MuVo N200. A search on internet reveals many are having this same problem. Their technical support stinks. It's only e-mail and you get a response about every 2 days. Good news is that it works on two other computers I've tried it on. I saw a posting saying that someone solved the problem by adding a second USB card. Have spent over 6 hours on this to no avail. I'll bet it works fine if your one of the lucky ones whose computer recognizes it.

<Title>If it only had a brain!
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Muvo V100 by Creative for its ease of use: AAA battery, & drag & drop from Windows Media Player 11.  The thought that I would have trouble finding the music on the player never entered my mind.  If this thing had a "brain" (you know, like a user-friendly folder system?) it would be a very nice product for the price.  As it is, I have only one music list that it will play most of its selections.  So I will use it occasionally, but after buying a Cadillac (My Sony NWZ-A818 Walkman, reviewed elsewhere), it's hard to go back to the little red wagon.

I tested this device on several PC's and got the same performance.  The older, 1GB Muvo worked fine and copied at acceptable speed (about 10 mins per GB).  This 2GB Muvo is not worth buying; it is a blemish on Creative Lab's name.  They should not be selling it, period.

<Title>Not an Upgrade over the Nano Plus
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own the Creative 1GB Nano Plus with FM tuner, and it is one of the best flash players out there.  It is small, beautifully designed, and full of features.  The only problem was that I outgrew the 1GB size, so I thought what could possibly be better than having a later version of it and a 2GB size?  Well, this MuVo works like an earlier generation of Creative's mp3 players, not like a newer generation.  - I was warned about the transfer speed, but I figured I only transfer music onto the player once every 3 or 4 months.  It takes about 90 minutes to transfer 1.85 GB (that's the maximum capacity).  My 1GB Nano Plus took about 15 minutes (so 30 minutes if a 2GB version of it existed).    - For some reason, my Nano Plus also sounds far better than this player.  The sound is flat on this player.  I tried adjusting the custom equalizer to match my Nano Plus's custom EQ settings, but the sound is inferior compared to the Nano Plus.       - I'm not a fan of the default folders labelled A, B, C, D on this MuVo.  On my Nano Plus, I created my own folders.  I can also do that with the MuVo, but anything outside of the lettered folders is considered part of the root folder, and I can only keep a combined 500 files outside of the lettered folders.  In other words, you'll have to keep at least some files in the lettered folders, and you'll have to remember whether your audio book is in generically labelled Folder B or C.  When you select one of the labelled folders, it automatically plays the first file of the first folder by default instead of letting you select the subfolder within the lettered folder before playing.  Not as easy or intuitive to manage your folders as the Nano Plus.  - The player is lighter than the Nano Plus, but it is also slightly wider and longer.  And the plastic feels very cheap.  The USB drive that detaches from the battery is not easy to remove, and you have to crush the LCD screen to even get a grip on it.    - The only positive of this player over the Nano Plus is that there is a "favorites" option where you can tag any track that is playing (by holding down the scroll wheel for a few secs) as a favorite.  This acts like a built-in favorites playlist which can span across folders.    - I suggest you buy the Nano Plus if it's still available and you don't need 2GB (2GB holds about 600 songs with an average VBR of 128kps in WMA format for me).  And the Nano Plus also has an FM tuner which this MuVo lacks.

<Content>On the pro side: great price for a 2G device.  Good sound and battery usage.  USB makes it easy to download music to.  It uses standard MP3 rather than a proprietary format.  On the con side: they say it uses USB2.0, but downloads are slow.  There are very few accessories that work with it.  I purchased a Belkin device for FM use in my car, and the signal is not stong enough for my car.  The file structure on the device is very clumsy.  In the end, I'd rather have a device that can be used in more situations because more accessories are available.  I may end up buying an iPod anyway, even though I think they gouge the price.

<Title>Great Value - Works OK with a Mac
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Roughly $70 for 2 gig and a voice recorder with great sound. I am happy with this purchase. As a long time Mac user you might expect that I would be like eveyone else and get an ipod. I bought this primarily for working out. It serves its purpose wonderfully and I don't see why I would want to spend more given what I am using it for.  I like the fact that it uses a AAA battery instead of a proprietary rechargable. $5 got me a package of 4 nimh rechargables and it runs something like 20 hours on 1. I have had it a month so far. Have recharged the batteries once and am on my second go around on 1 of the 4.   Creative goes out of their way to make things difficult for Mac users. That said, if you set itunes to import as .mp3 or .wav (I don't like .wav) you can drag your playlists right over to the muvo.   You have to set up your own folders and you may have to rename the song titles as the muvo plays in alpha order within a folder. However, if you can handle this kind of basic file organization, or don't care which order your songs play, this unit will work fine for you regardless of what operating system you use.  I currently have 4 different  1 hour workout folders, a book on mp3,  and another 8 hours or so in 4 or 5 different folders orgainized more by genre that I primarily play in the car through a fm transiver to the car stereo. All that in the size of a pack of gum!  Can't speak to the software as I wouldn't use windows software with it.  Perhaps if money were no object I would get an iPod nano. However, money is an object and while the ipod interface may be nicer, it is certainly not that difficult to manage the mp3 files with this unit. Plus, I still like the AAA vs proprietary battery and the built in voice recorder.   My bottom line is that the sound quality is good, it works, gets good battery life. The down side is that the documentation is in a proprietary Windoze format that I would have to go through more effort than it is worth to read, the interface is clunky, it doesn't display the artist or album tiltle only the song title. However, for my purposes and given the fact that I am comfortable with computer file management, the plusess far outweigh the negatives.  Wade

<Title>Oh how I LOVE this product line
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Creative's Muvo series is really the most ingenious thing to happen to portable music since the invention of the mp3.  Being able to carry and listen to music on what is essentially a thumb drive means you never have to wonder where the USB cable went:  you can swap music to and from the player using any computer's USB port, no software necessary (DRM'd tracks being the exception, for obvious reasons).  This makes it a snap to create new folders and stuff them with whatever goodies you happen to have on your hard drive.  I also love the feature that lets you delete tracks without going anywhere near a computer, which is great if you just uploaded a brand new album and discovered some less-than-listenable tracks while you're on the go.  These players also get amazing battery life as well - I usually get between 12-15 hours from a single AAA.  The players come with a dizzying array of playback options: Normal, Shuffle, Shuffle Folder, Repeat Folder, Repeat Track, etc to keep things interesting.I've been using the 1 GB model for about a year and a half now and couldn't be more thrilled with it.  The 2 GB models were christmas gifts to several family members and have since gotten rave reviews as well. For some strange reason I was never able to find the Muvo series at any of my local electronics stores, but they were well worth the wait from the online retailers. I can't see how anyone would be disappointed.

Amazon only had a 30 day warranty on it and I bought it in the end of  November and it was not opened and tried until after Christmas and it DID NOT work.In cases like that where the item is not going to even be tried out for a period of time,I should still be able to get it replaced

<Content>This is my second MUVO and I find them rock solid players that do what they're supposed to do: play music. And they do it without bells and whistles I don't need. I've bought and returned more expensive players but my MUVOs have never let me down. My little 256 lasted for years and is still going strong. I only bought the 2 gig for more space. I also like being able to pop in a new AAA battery and keep on my way when the old one dies as opposed to trying to find an outlet and waiting for a battery to recharge. I have been things to do with my time. And one AAA easily lasts abotu 20 hours. If you're seeking snob status, this one isn't for you. If you just want one great little mp3 player that'll last forever, then here it is.  Oh, and you can plug it directly into you computer and use it as a thumb drive, too.

<Title>What I've been looking for
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're looking to move your mp3 library to a portable device that you will use everyday, take with you everywhere, hook up to your car, and organize all of your songs easily, get an iPod.  If you're looking for an quick and simple little device that you can throw some mp3s on and take on a plane trip or for a run at the gym, then this is the player for you.  This player works just like a USB pen drive... just plug it in and copy your songs.  No need to install any additional programs!  It's lightweight (good for running/biking), has great battery life (runs on AAA batteries), and sounds great with the headphones provided.  It has some song indexing controls, but they're not too great... better to just let the player go on random.  The only major downside is the limited space.  There's only so much you can fit on 2GB... but in my opinion, that's a decent compromise for the size and price!

<Title>Nice Little Player
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a  nice little mp3 player.  I like the multiple libraries.  You can group the types of music in each library, classic rock, etc.  That way if you set the player on shuffle, you are just playing one type music.  It does seem to take quite a bit longer to load the songs than other players I have.   This is not as inconvenient, if you don't change your music very often.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JFN1XY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-6925435-5758463">Creative MuVo V100 2 GB MP3 Player (White)</a>

<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Was able to purchase from Staples for $59.99.  After I got home, I couldn't separate the USB connector from the battery module.  Thinking that there was something wrong, I took it back to the store for a replacement.  I found out that you really have to pull hard to get the separation and don't wiggle the USB connector up and down.  Just pull hard straight out.  I like the idea that you can download directly from a CD to the device in WMA format.  I'm using the player exclusively for classical listening.

<Title>Almost Perfect
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had one of the little red Creative MuVo players and I used it constantly for audio books - one right after the other for several years.  I also used it when I jogged.  Unfortunately I think I left it in a shower room at a campground, so I thought I'd treat myself to another one.  This time I got the 2GB white version.  Aside from the color... wish it was something other than white, the only thing I dislike is that it did not come with a belt clip.  I can not live with an MP3 player without a belt clip and finding a reasonably priced one that will reasonably fit this player has been very difficult.  That's a real bummer.

<Title>How to Increase Battery Life
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had a much older version of the product for years and it still works great.  Mine has no voice recording or LCD display, so I can't say anything about the those new features, but presumably it is otherwise quite similar to (if not better than, with improvements) mine.  So with that qualification, I highly recommend Creative MuVo in general and plan to buy a newer one with more memory.  HINT: The most useful information I've discovered about the MuVo is that you can *drastically* increase battery life by unplugging the battery pack while it's not in use.  You don't have to completely separate the two parts; just pull them about 5mm apart, i.e. far enough that the USB is disconnected and the MuVo can't be turned on.  Otherwise there's a constant, small power drain even when the MuVo is off.  I don't use my MuVo everyday, and if I leave it plugged together for a week the battery will be dead, so I just leave it slightly unplugged.  It's possible this aspect has been improved somewhat with newer models, such that it would drain more slowly than mine does, but some battery drain is inherent in the design.  This kind of power button basically has to stay "semi-conscious" waiting to be pushed.  But if you disconnect the USB plug, it's the same as removing the battery entirely.  Also, other reviewers noted that the MuVo V100 plays MP3s in order of filename, folder by folder.  If so, that seems great for full albums, since the default for most CD-ripping software is to name audio files starting with track number.  (Or you easily rename them later with such software as the extremely useful "MP3Tag".)  On my older model, however, MP3s are played in the order that they were copied onto the flash drive.  The tricky bit is that Windows does not copy files in the order you'd expect.  For example, if you copied a whole album at once, Windows might actually copy the files in this order: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,2,3.  Almost in order, but with one or more from the beginning shifted to the end.  You can work around it one way or another if you care to trouble yourself, though apparently it shouldn't be an issue with the MuVo V100.  But it's the kind of Windows idiosyncrasy it can come in handy to be aware of, just FYI.

<Title>Excellent mp3 player!
<Date>Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I debated whether to go with the Muvo 100 or an ipod and I'm glad I went with this one. What I like:   -you plug it straight into the computer and can just drag and drop whatever you want into it. My husband has an ipod and personally, itunes is just plain frustrating as a middleman.  -it runs on one AAA battery and it lasts a LONG time (and its easy to carry a spare).  -it has three "favorites" folders (Library A, B and C) to sort your music into. Side note: I've also used one of the libaries to hold an audiobook that had too many tracks for the "root" menu. It worked wonderfully. -it is light and small and I can stick it in my pocket or clip it on. Side note: if you get the armband for it (if you cant find it, look at the Creative website for it), it comes with a silicone case with a clip on it and you dont have to use it with the actual armband.  -it puts each audiobook into a folder (you can create folders). On my husband's ipod, when he goes to the "audiobook" section it doesnt list just the books, it lists all the tracks for every book and you have to scroll thru them all. Of course these are imported books from a disc, not downloaded from itunes or audible. It may be different if we used that instead. Side note: dont try to rename Library A, B or C...it doesnt like that. -it's price! I didnt want to spend big bucks on something that can break so easily. If I break this one it wont be hundreds of dollars down the drain. (I've had it 3 months and it's actually pretty tough!) -you dont have to worry about fingerprints or scratches  What I dont like: -I'd like more than 2GB, but it's not a deal breaker (I can get 3 of these for the price of an ipod nano!). -no bookmark feature. I listen to a lot of audiobooks and it does start playing where you left off, which is nice. But if you go listen to something else (like music), you lose your place. -you cant arrange the folders however you want, but this is a fairly minor issue. At least you can create folders!  The main problem I have is the bookmark feature. That would be really nice. But all in all, I like this Muvo a lot. My husband's ipod is the brand spanking new 160GB one and I was overly impressed with the space!! But I was less than impressed with the player itself. It's big, bulky, and not as user friendly as you'd expect for the price. At least with this 2GB Muvo, you can afford several of them!!

<Title>Great Mp3 Player- easy to load and use
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Easy to load and use Great sound even with supplied earbuds. Plugged the Muvo V100 in the usb slot and xp saw it as a hard drive in 30 seconds. copied and pasted 500 mp3 songs to the Muvo.  Very easy.  It did take time to upload, but I haven't loaded the Creative cd yet or uploaded any patches.  anyway the USB port I have is 1.1 not usb 2.  This is not a problem as I don't care how long it takes to upload, Windows is multi tasking so I surf the web, read e-mails, while it uploads.  easy enough for even my Dad to use.  This is my 3rd generation of Creative flash MP3 Players.  I use it riding my Harley.  I have 3 years of great music.   Creative did it again,  I can't wait for the 4 Gig Flash Players to hit the market

<Title>A Great Value In a 2GB MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought it for myself because I've been using a walkman while I work for many years now.  This is as light as a BIC lighter in your pocket and the quality of sound is superb.  I bought some rechargeable batteries for it and each little AAA last me probably 10 to 12 hours.  It is so small and light, I carry it in my front pocket while I'm listening to my music, books on tape, etc.  The software that manages everthing is a little challenging unless you are pretty good with computers and programs but it has been great for me.  They need to upgrade the software so it's easier to manage and rearrange your music on your computer and get it all organized properly on the player though.  If you can get it for $75 or less like I did, I think it's great to have.

<Content>I really can recommend this one if you are looking for a small player with huge storage space and good sound. I am using it mostly to listen to podcasts am really happy with it. Not to forget, it's really cute.  Only downside so far: Controls are a bit comlicated to operate. If you are looking to store huge collections of music and want to skip between different tracks you probably should look for something with a larger display and larger controls. For my podcasts, to which I listen in sequence, this is not an issue, though.

<Content>pros: -  no proprietary docking station or cable to connect to your computer -  small/light -  flash-based -  price -  battery  cons: -  slow download speed.  I have the older 1GB version, and it is faster than this unit (????) -  NO CARRYING CASE.  This makes no sense to me - there is no case shipped with the unit, and I so far haven't found one online.  So, I find I still use my old 1GB player at the gym and jogging. -  folder structure on the unit is a step backwards from the older 1GB model.  It has folders A, B, C, D which reappear even if you delete them.  Plus, navigating folders is more difficult than the 1GB model.  Not sure why their firmware would get WORSE in some respects from previous models???

<Title>Great Player (But They Shouldn't Have Messed With a Good Thing)
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had two Creative MuVo players before this one: Creative MuVo 1 GB player (the red one) and 512 MB version (blue). My husband accidentally destroyed his (the blue one) so I gave him my red one.  Well, I was finally getting around to replacing mine, and I was looking for the red 1 GB player. Unfortunately, it's discontinued. Should I buy the new V100 2 GB, I wondered? (One of the reasons I didn't because it was white. What a let down compared to the great-looking previous versions. Ugh.)  I impetuously bought a Philips 1 GB player, but after looking at it in its package once I got home...I just couldn't open it. It was chunky looking--a gray rectangle the size of an extra-large Wrigley's chewing gum package. Plus, the USB wasn't connected to the player like the Creative MuVo's.  So I returned it to Stuff Mart...and then bought the MuV100 2 GB. I've been using it for a few days now and it plays just as great as the older version in terms of sound. In fact...I think it plays better. I'm listening to all my Rush songs and, I swear to God, I'm hearing things I've never heard before!  However, navigation is a pain. I can't figure out how to arrange the folders--they've added extras like "favorites" and such...ack. I just wanted a simple player to arrange my music by folder!  I've even tried to mess with the Creative Media Solutions that comes with it to organize the music, and I can't figure it out. So I just went back to burning, going to My Music, and sending to my J: Drive.  I love the fact that the USB part disassembles and goes directly in the port, as opposed to having to use cables (which is what most, if not all, MP3 players other than Creative use.)  There is supposedly a feature where you can get lyrics, but I don't plan on using that feature, nor the recording features.  The earbuds are large like the other ones--and not very comfortable. I'll no doubt be switching to my other headphones.  The reason I gave this MP3 player four stars is not only because of the color and frustration with navigability, but also because of the lack of the rubbery plastic holder that came with previous versions. That's right--there is NOTHING provided for hooking your MP3 player to your pants or belt.   However, my husband happened to save the holder from the MP 3 player that he dropped/broken--and it works fine with this MP3. Whew!  Light as a feather with good sound, the Creative MuVo V100 is a fine MP3 player. I just wish Creative hadn't messed with a good thing by complicating the menus...

<Title>Thumb drive with a player, nothing more
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the V100 as a very basic player with easy connection and management. Overall, I believe I got just that - the connection is easy, and management is simple file management: copy the files you want.  Where it gets interesting is the folder structure; most people organize by folders if they have a library of any size - Artist\Album\&lt;tracks>.  This structure CANNOT be copied over to the V100 unless you want to navigate to each directory...which isn't practical.  For a 2G unit, this lack of folder capability makes the product unusable as you'll need to navigate your online storage to copy files over, and then lose any type of order on the MuVo...it's just one big pile o' music.  If your interest is in a thumb drive with a player, then this is your baby.  If you're looking for a portable player that will carry some of your organized library, look elsewhere.

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this .mp3 player to replace my Samsung YP-T7J player since it can hold 2X the music and I can replace the battery while the Samsung rechargable lasted only 8 hours on long trips.   The problem I encountered when using the Muvo supplied software, it put half the songs in an individual "folder" format for each song and the remaining songs in individual .mp3 files without the "folders".  Problem with this is the player cannot access the .mp3 files in the folders, only the individual ones.  I'm at a loss why it does this and cannot access the songs in "folders". I tried everything and finally just erased them in the player.   I'm not a tech wiz so I might be doing something wrong.  Only fact my Samsung never had this problem and is much easier to operate.   It's annoying Creative doesn't explain how to properly download files into this player.

<Title>Best... MP3 player... EVER!
<Date>Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are two things about this player, in my opinion, that make it far superior to any iPod out there:  1. You don't need any stinkin' cable or dock to charge it or connect it to a computer.  It runs a very long time on a regular AAA battery and it has its own USB connector built in.  Just plug it into any computer's USB port and voila!  Which brings me to the next great thing about this MP3 player...  2. There's no need to use proprietary crap software like iTunes!  When you plug it into your USB port it automatically creates a new temporary drive letter for you to copy your files to, which is so much simpler and more convenient.  Now for the bad part.  File copying to this thing is painfully slow.  They probably used cheap flash memory to keep the cost down, I'm guessing.  So, if you're in a hurry that can be a little annoying.  But I'm usually not in a hurry so it's not really a big deal for me.  The other little annoyance is the earphones.  I don't know if it's just the shape of my inner ear or what but they really start to hurt after a while.  So I just bought a new pair of earphones.  In conclustion, I definitely think this is the best MP3 player out there and the convenience factor puts iPod to shame.  Go get one.

<Content>While everyone might own an Apple IPod, I prefer creative. My first MP3 player was Creative and I liked it because you didnt need a computer to transfer files. Plus, Creative actully gives you the tools to work the player. I was shopping for Apple IPods and found out you needed to buy the charger separate. This player only comes in white, I would have prefered anther color. Anther problem was after I bought the player, Wal Mart was selling it for almost twenty dollars less. Needless to say I was very upset. I enjoy Creative products alot, despite my other two reviews. I like how the MP3 player slides out and just plugs right in. So if you want to save a ton of money, pick up one of these players. You wont be disappointed.

<Title>Tiny, lightweight, relatively low $$, and gets the job done!
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My review is more one to clear up an issue that some people seem to have with the MuVo V100 in regarding music organization.  I'm a drummer and I was looking for a small mp3 player that would allow me to easily load and listen to songs that I wanted to practice with as I was really getting tired of fumbling with CD's. I didn't want to spend a whole lot, but I still wanted one that was relatively easy to load songs on to, would hold a decent amount of songs, was somewhat organized, and in my case as a drummer, was loud enough for me to hear over the drums. So I bought the Creative MuVo V100 2GB.   I'll be honest, I didn't do my research on this and I know nothing about mp3 players. I bought it because I knew Creative as a reliable name for mp3 players, and the price ($70 at Staples) was right. So far I've only played with it for about an hour, but I don't regret my purchase. tHE MuVo V100 is small, lightweight, and plugs directly into your computer USB with no cable to mess with. Great!  The first thing I did when I got it home was loaded the software that came with it. Personally, I don't think it's necessary as it's much easier for me just to copy and paste music onto the device. I'll probably wind up deleting the software. Once I decided how I was going to transfer my music I set out trying to organize it once it was on the device, and this is my main reason for writing the review, to clear this matter up. At first, and after reading some of the reviews here, I didn't think this was going to be very easy or possible. The device allows you to place music in the root directory, or in 3 sub-directories: Library A, B, or C. At first I thought those were the only places you could organize the music. I tried creating a new folder off of the root directory and putting music into it but it didn't work the  way I thought it would. I was discouraged because I thought, as one reviewer put it, that I would have just one big pile of music. After some fiddling, I found out that is not the case. You CAN organize your music by different albums or whatever folder name you would like. This is how you do it:   1) Connect the device to your computer.   2) Either drag and drop a music folder over to the device's root directory, or create a new folder titled whatever you would like, and put the music there.   3) Unplug the device, put it back together and turn it on. When it loads, press the jog wheel and choose "Skip Folder". Once you do that, you can choose either one of the Library folders or the root folder. Choose the root folder. As soon as you do that, you will be delighted to see that your newly created folders are there! Simply cycle through them and pick the one you want.   I don't know if you can drag and drop a folder that has sub-folders or create them yourself, as I haven't tried that. So for now I'll just say that if you're going to create a new folder or drag one over to the device, make sure the music is in that folder, not in a sub-folder off of it.  NOW you can have your music arranged by album or however you like. The only thing I found is that even though you pick a particular folder of music to listen to, when you choose it, it will only put you at the beginning of the songs in that folder, not in that folder itself. So when you get to the last song in that folder, instead of bringing you back to the beginning, it will bring you to the first song in a new folder.  Hopefully this clears that issue up!

<Title>Just 2 things I'd change about this player!
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great, 2MB player for the price. No special software or DRM to fool with, and unlike the "snotty iPOD" it accepts the WMA format. It's straightforward USB-in connectivity makes it a true plug 'n' play peripheral device that's easy to use. And the sound is outstanding, via any headphones you want to use with it. (The ones that come with the unit are okay but there are better phones out there; but for the price, I won't mark Creative down on that score!) I really have only two suggestions as to how to improve this MP3: (1.) the battery lid is held in place only by a flimsiest plastic tab, and I recently dropped mine and now I'm scotch-taping the darn batt. lid on! (2.) And my other "gripe," which some people here have cited already is, "How 'bout some colors other than white, Creative?!" That's been too long in coming, especially for a good MP3 player that's been on the market for quite a while. Fix these last two oversights and I'll happily give you that 5-star rating!

I use it exclusively for listening to books. It is EASY to load - I especially like being able to insert the player itself directly into the port instead of dealing with cables! I would repeat D. Logan's review almost word-for-word because I found all his 'pro' comments to be true. The only 'con' that matters to me - no bookmarks. I can live without bookmarks because it does pick up where I stopped, but I would prefer the option of repeat or skip....   I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone wanting to listen to audio books!

<Title>Still not Perfect - but good
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had various Creative devices for a couple of years; the Creative MuVo TX, the N200, the Zen...and all but the Muvo TX had the same problem - the battery cover is held on by a tiny tab of plastic that breaks really easily.  Unfortunately the V100 battery cover seems to resemble the Zen rather than the somewhat more sturdy MuVo TX.  I also agree with the posters who find the folders annoying.  My books, music etc. are just folders at the root level which works ok for me.  Apart from that, it's a nifty little player. I don't know about bookmarks, but I can stop a book, turn the player off, and when I restart it, it's at the point in the book where I stopped - that's good enough for my purposes.  And I got the 2 gb model - more room!

<Title>good product but where is the Amazon customer service!
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The creative MP3 player is a great little friend to have, at half volume it is louder than an I-pod at full volume!  It is easy to download songs to the player even though there are not a lot of instructions that go with it.  The USB port comes in very handy with labtops etc.  You can put songs in 4 libraries and it even has a graphic equalizer.  It also comes with a handy dictaphone which is good for students to use.  However I started having lines run through my player after 2 days use, creative were helpful but Amazon have been pathetic in dealing with the return. I have been waiting since January for Amazon to give me a refund. They claim they could not deliver the package to me for some unknown reason (undeliverable) even though I had my new address on the return item box!

<Title>Declining quality
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased one of the Creative MuVo TX FM 1GB units about two years ago and spent hundreds of hours listening to books on tape and downloaded lectures on it.  I loved this thing and when the jog wheel/switch finally gave out, I ordered its successor, the MuVo V100 2GB player.  What a difference - they've cheapened the quality of the plastic so that the whole device flexes.  I don't care to see light through the gaps in an electric device. I couldn't believe that this unit would last as long as the previous device, so  I immediately returned it and ordered another MuVo TX FM.  I'm not sure how much longer this older unit will be around, so I may have to order a second as a spare.  BTW all of these units have the same multifunction jog wheel/push button switch and it is their one great weak point.  Too much stess is put on that one critical piece.

<Content>Great for simple-minded people who don't want to deal with larger video-based mp3 players.  I bought this about a month ago and use it when I jog.  I had to buy my own case for it, but I am satisfied with a cheap one I bought from CaseLogic.  As for the player itself, I have found the built-in USB drive extremely convenient, as I can add or subtract music anytime and anywhere I am near a computer.  The sound is just fine for a jogger who needs background music, but I haven't compared it to any other player.  It's definitely a big step over my Rio player, which broke and needed software AND a cord (no good).  I would suggest this player to anyone who wants a good value for their money, and doesn't necessarily need/want a top-of-the-line product.

I have a previous model that came with a clip, but it doesn't fit this new one.

<Content>Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. The display is small (no fancy menus like Ipod)but works well. Sound is excellent.  Be sure to install the drivers and software. The software is small, simple and EASY to use - or you can just COPY/PASTE files onto it.  If you DON'T install the drivers it only works at USB 1.1 speeds and takes a LOT longer to load songs. With drivers you get full 2.0 speeds.

<Title>Best deal on the market for the money
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In my opinion, for the money I feel no other player offers as much.  I already have another smaller 512 MB Creative product that I keep as a backup so there weren't any surprises when I got this one in regard to the interface.  If you load your music as a folder you can then choose to play your music as per each album.  The battery life seems good.  I really like being able to use AAA batteries in it; I never have to worry about running out of power.  As others have commented, it is no USB 2.0 interface.  If you need to reload your music often, this is not the player for you.  It took around an hour to load 2 GB's.  I think the sound quality is good.  I had a Rio that had a more sophisticated interface but the workmanship of the actual product made one question if they even field tested it before they sold it.

<Title>A few other observations
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everyone else has covered most of the pros and cons pretty well here. I would like to add that it has multi-language support: English, Danish, German, Spanish, Suomi, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish, and several Asian languages I can't read. A lot of my music has the ID3 tags in Russian and it's not one of the supported languages. The Cyrillic shows up correctly for .wma files, however, but not for .mp3 files, so I can't read most of the song titles. (**update** Cyrillic tags do display- I had to change them from ID3v2.4 to ID3v2.3 - freeware program Mp3tag will do it)   That's not such a huge problem because the line for the song title (actually pulled from the ID3 tag, not the filename) is tiny anyway. The elapsed time display is three times bigger and bolder- why? Who's idea was that-someone who probably doesn't use mp3 players. I'd rather be able to read the song title. But I can't figure out how to navigate to particular songs anyway. Best used in shuffle mode stuffed in your pocket (because it has no clip, case, or other means of attaching to anything).  Will not plug into the back of my Compaq laptop without unplugging the laptop's power cord, which slows the transfer down even more. Recognized and installed in Xp without loading the bloatware from the disk.  All in all, it's a good value for the price and it plays fine, which is what an .mp3 player is really all about.

<Title>My first step into the even more portable realm
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having decided to go to Japan without my vast library of CDs in their original form--I'm burning them on DVD+Rs and will take them that way--I figured a more portable form of music player would be more efficient for a crowded country.  While riding on the Yamanote Line in Tokyo, I was struck by the sight of teenagers carrying around their portable MP3 players aboard the train and found myself grossly inefficient and past date with my CD player.  It was with this state of mind that I finally decided to join the even more portable realm with the Creative Muvo.  Its relative smallness, slightly larger than a pocket lighter, fitting in my jeans pocket or polo shirt pocket, boggles me.  Its 2G capability was something I was willing to settle for, as given my collection, 512 songs would be scarcely sufficient.  There is indeed a shuffle option, and with its no-repeat dynamic, it's like walking around with your own portable radio station.  One can fill up the player with random songs from the PC.  That I may experiment with in the future, though given my collection of oddities, that may prove disastrous.  I filled it with only a fraction of the songs on my PC, which doesn't take an exhaustive amount of time, and I observe it does play the songs alphabetically in order of file name.  But it does read foreign characters, as I have some Japanese pop songs on there, so it is smart.  It goes down to a third of its size when detaching it for plugging into the PC for downloading, so quite a technological marvel there.  For the price I paid for it, a worthy investment.

<Content>this is my second creative mp3. my first (the zen nano plus) lasted over 2 years through rain, sweat, dirt (trail running). i searched high and low to see if there was anything better for running and did not find it. the flash memory is perfect for the jarring it takes. it has an optional belt clip (i hate the arm thingy). it's the smallest thing out there that's not an i-something. i got the 2gb this time. the technology has improved since my last purchase and while it won't shuffle between folders, each folder will now hold 500 songs. the headphones still suck and are obviously not made for runners so i'm using some from sony that have more comfortable earbuds. i love that i just pull it apart & it is it's own usb to my computer. so easy. no wires. also, i love the fact that it uses 1 AAA battery. no recharger necessary. one battery lasts a long time even for 5-6 hour training runs. it's a great product and a huge value for the money.

The set-up on the computer take less than 5 minutes even for a computer idiot like me, the fact that it is it's own USB simplify thing to no end. For loading and rearranging files or songs you just need to know how to drag items with your mouse - no kidding - that's it! Five left thumbs up!!!

<Content>Even if you already own one of those mega-mp3 players, like an iPod, you could still one of these.  This is a great little device for the money.  Because it is flash-based, it can go many places that you really won't want to take an expensive mp3 player.  I have used it while painting my house and while snowboarding.  I'm not afraid of hurting it.  Even with all the abuse I have given it so far, the device isn't phased in any way.  It just keeps chugging along with great sound.  The best part about it is that when I want to put a fresh collection of songs on it, I just pull it apart and it becomes a thumb drive!  No wires or cords to lose!  If you are thinking about getting one, stop thinking and just get it...you will be happy that you did.

<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had bought the smaller Creative Zen mp3 last year and loved it. This one, the MuVo, has great music capacity for the price.  Three minor drawbacks though:  1. The usb connecter is part of the device & not a separate cord. It is chunky and barely fits beside the other cords on the back of my laptop. I had to angle it in there & try not to disconnect at the same time.   2. The Zen comes with a neck cord, the Muvo does not.  3. The ear buds are plastic w/o covering & continuously slip out, so I've been using the Zen's earbuds, too.  Still, the Muvo is a nice little device. Great sound, easy to use, long battery play.

Battery life is good, sound is good.  Headphones aren't top quality, but good enough for the gym.  If the toggle interface was a little better, it would be a five.  If I could, I'd give it a 4.5.

<Title>Base player with some issues
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player is good, now that I have got around the issues.    First I like the no cable part.  I have two others players and it is a pain to go find the cable.  If it holds up, it is the good part.  It was cheap for a 2g player.    The issue is the file structure restrictions.  Most rippers put songs in a Authur/album/songs format.  The MuVo only allows folders two deep. If you are use to moving the files yourself to the player, it will likely not work, as you'll have too deep a file structure.    To fix it you cannot move the files around.  I tried that after figuring out the problem.  You have to reformat the player before making the correct file structure.  Lastly, their own software will instill the files incorrectly.  I find it hard to understand how a new user would be able to use this product.  All this frustration is enhanced by the slow file transfer.  While it says it is 2.0 it has the speed of 1.1.  Will work with 2.0 is not what they are claming when they state it is a 2.0 player.   I got this for my wife, and she likes it.  She would rather have a way to pick CD's but most base players will lack this function.

<Title>Great MP3 player for size and cost

<Content>The size of the player is perfect, small and yet easy to handle.  The use of one replacable AAA battery is a major plus.  The controls and menu are easy to negotiate.  The LCD screen is small but readable even with bifocals. It tells you the title of track, number of track and the lyrics being played.  I use it primarily to download audio books and find the player great for this purpose, even when driving.  The 2 GB size holds alot of books and songs.  Mine holds about 20 full size audio books. The software that comes with the player is very easy and convenient to use.  Downloads are quick.  A single battery last approximately 18 hours.

<Title>Fine Machine

<Content>I purchased this player just for audio books and it works great. When you turn it on it remembers where you were in the book when you last shut if off. Really works nice. Get a good set of headphones for real pleasure.  The case is a little flaky. I used some clear book tape to reinforce the joints and it much better. Many hours of play time on one AAA rechargeable battery. I recommend it.
