<Title>Excellent Little Player
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a good little player.  The menu is not as appealing to the eye as an iPod but just as easy to use.  In addition to playing music it also plays FM radio and takes voice memos.    The battery life is good and on top of that the battery is replaceable.  The FM radio reception is also excellent; my house gets poor reception for many FM stations but they all come in cleanly on this player.    The main downsides here are the fact that to transfer music you have to use Windows Media Player (Napster, Musicmatch, etc. can also bu used).  By default WMP transcodes MP3s to WMA and changing this setting is buried in a location wihtin the player that isn't the first that most people would look.  The player itself, without a case, feels a little fragile.    One big beef I have regards the playlists for the player.  The documentation that is available for the player (either the paper one that accompanies the player, the one available online or any help files on the SanDisk site) is very incomplete.  It only outlines the basics, and not very completely at that.  There are two access modes for the player and those modes control how music and playlists are stored on the player.  If you want to have playlists created along with music added to the player then you have to have the player in Auto Deetct mode.  The player will stay in this mode but can be switched out automatically by the likes of the Audible player when it transfers tracks and will stay in MSC mode until switched back manually.  How to work with this has been posted on my blog (which is a reposting of the response I received from the SanDisk tech support).    http://crichton007.blogspot.com/2006/01/sandisk-sansa-m200-series-mp3-player.html  I recommend this player, especially if you're looking for an alternative the more expensive iPod but be prepared to sacrifice some intuitive enhancements that you would get with an iPod for the money you will save.

<Title>Best Value in a flash-based player so far
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the m260 (4Gb version) from Circut City for $169 As others have said, it's easy to use, very attractively priced, sounds good, and doesn't require any additional software beyond WMP10. Initially, I could not get mine to sync with Napster-to-go on a notebook through a USB1.1 port. Moving to another notebook with USB2.0, Napster syncs fine (Janus not compatable with USB1.1?) I haven't tried Audible yet, but I see there is a firmware update for the m250 to fix the reported Audible bug.   Note - there are two sync settings: MSC and MTP. Use MTP to transfer protected content, then switch to MSC and transfer unprotected content several times faster using Windows Explorer (treats Sansa as a USB drive). Another observation: this player looks strange, until you find yourself holding and operating it single handed. Screen size is small but perfectly adequate. Though it's thicker than other players, it's less noticable in my pocket than a set of keys. The only regret I have is that I've just seen Sansa's forthcoming e200 series (March 06). For the price of an IPod nano, it looks just as attractive but far more capable.

<Title>Good for the price - bad firmware
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought the 4MB version and have been pretty satisfied with it so far.  A little thicker than other players due to the battery, but I don't have to worry about recharging another portable device before I head out.  Incredibly light, so it's great for the gym.  My big complaint is how the unit handles playlists.  It's tru that you can drag and drop mp3 files very easily in Windows explorer using the MSC transfer mode, and you can then sort through those files on the player by artist, album genre, etc.  If you want playlists, you have to transfer them in MTC mode from Media Player or Musicmatch, etc, and the songs transferred for that playlist cannot be individually viewed or played, because the playlist transfer does not carry the mp3 tags with it.  I wish SanDisk would fix the firmware to address this issue.  Overall, happy with my purchase but hoping for a firmware upgrade.

<Title>Could be better
<Date>Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm happy enough with it's playing but I'm giving this 3 stars based on it's lack of documentation.  No where do I see that you have to change the 'advance' setting to "on" in order for the playlist to function.  No where does it say the playlist you create will disapear everytime you connect the device to the computer, whether you sync or not. I shouldn't have to search this information out on the internet and even requested a replacement from Amazon when I thought my device was not functioning correctly.

<Title>Could be better...
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros:  -- Inexpensive. High GB/$. -- Lightweight -- Runs on AAA (I personally prefer alkalines because I can replace them unlike the built-in rechargables. Also, rechargable alkalines are cheap) -- Comes with nice arm band and a cover. (Cover is thin though) -- Bright display  Cons: -- User interface sucks. It takes some time to figure out what is where. -- Good luck if you want to create playlists. See other reviews for the same problem.  -- Very small display.  The things that I can live with but I wish it... -- had a better sound quality. It is not bad but there is room for improvement -- were smaller. Kinda bulky. Buttons are unnecessarily big and display is small. -- had a color display.

<Title>Handy player with a few kinks
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This time I made sure to buy a device with PlaysForSure compatibility and this SanDisk has it. Great. All the features of this player are great -- with much of the exact same functionality of the iPod (with a slightly less intuitive interface). I'm fully satisfied with it.  The only issue I have is that the player seems to spontaneously decide that it doesn't want to play (Rhapsody) subscription music. I haven't tried it with any other subscription service (yet) but after a couple hours on the phone with SanDisk (the first time) and Rhapsody (the second time) the solution both times was to delete the "DRM" folder in WindowsXP. (This has all sorts of negative consequences.) I can't be sure the problem is the player, but it would seem to be the case. For this amount of money and with the PFS certification, I would expect to have avoided these sort of major issues. Disappointing.

<Title>Perfect for what I need
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've seen several reviews for this player (a couple comments here, but mostly on other review sites) that have basically stated that it's "just not an iPod".  Well, yeah..it's NOT an iPod.  I don't think SanDisk is trying to be an iPod with this player, and I'm thankful they're not. I wanted an MP3 player so I could listen to music while running.  I needed something small, lightweight, easy to operate without having to break pace - especially when on the treadmill - and something that could take the bounces and jostles associated with running.  I didn't care about the iPod brand, being able to watch TV/video, color screens, or having double-digits worth of GB memory. This little SanDisk player is great for me.  Within hours of it being delivered to my front porch, I had several CD's worth of music loaded on and I was listening with no problems.  It was super easy to load music on it using Windows Media Player.  It did take some reading to figure out how to work all aspects of it, but that rings true for almost any electronic device.  I did the various functions while reading the instruction manual - the one on the included disk, not the super brief quick start guide - and was able to figure things out the next time with no problems.  And with 2 GB of memory, I have plenty of room for my music.  I've loaded probably 10 CD's on it already, and I have plenty of room to spare. As for using it for my intended purpose - while running - it's wonderful!  I used the included plastic cover and armband and off I went.  I'm able to skip songs and change music while maintaining pace.  The sound is great - even with the little foam earbud covers, even despite the noise of the treadmill.  It's definitely much easier than trying to deal with a discman and one single CD.  I've used it for probably 3-4 hours already, and the battery indicator has dropped just one section. A tip for the instruction manual - pop in the little disk and use Windows Explorer to find the pdf file, then copy it to your computer.  This makes it much easier to come back and look something up, rather than having to wade through the disk's contents. If you want a very nice and perfectly functional MP3 player - and don't need/want the iPod brand and price - then this player will easily meet your needs.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Great but...
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great little MP3 player especially if you want to be moving while using it. Unfortunaley, there is a known problem with the player that Sandisk has not been able to fix with new firmware. At random times the sound will emit a crackle and skip (remember what a scratch did to your LP playback?). Sandisk customer support tried to help, but finally advised me to return the player if I was not satisfied. I used it for Audible books. I've tried two of these and both had the problem. Luckily Amazon is most gracious with returns.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned three SanDisk Sansa M240 models that store 1GB. The first one I purchased with a in store warranty, but the player did not work right out of the box. So I took It back and got a second Sansa which developed an intermittent short within two months causing sound quality to diminish significantly. I took the second Sansa back and cashed in my warranty on a third SanDisk Sansa m240 1GB along with buying a second in store warranty. In two months my third SanDisk Sansa m240 developed the same intermittent short. I'll cash in my warranty on a different player this time.

<Title>For the price, this is a great mp3 player!
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second sandisk M-series. I previously had a 512 MB that I used for two without a single problem. I replaced it simply because I wanted a larger memory capacity. There are a lot of more expensive mp3s that might be a little better in terms of featues, but the small gain comes at a much higher price. For someone who's not a techie (like me), this is extremely easy to use. All I have ever had to do was connect it to my PC and drag-and-drop music files. Flawless!

<Title>M250 alot for the money
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My previous MP3 players have all been iRivers, so I'm spoiled. The iRiver iMP-350's (I have two), are CD and CD-RW driven, and have a very extensive feature set that is obviously iterative and well thought out and is the result of several product cycles. I also have iRiver H120 and H140 harddrive player/recorders, and they are supported by Rockbox. Again, powerful very extensive feature sets for these products.    In comparison, the m250 is very simple, but it doesn't sound noticeably worse playing my MP3 files. 2 GB is about 3x more capacity than the iMP-350's have (my H120 and H140 have 30 GB and 40 GB HDs respectively) and the FM radio sensitivity appears to be significantly better than that in any of my other carry-along electronic devices, including those expensive iRivers.     Pros:    Graphic equalizer is a great feature, however it only works for files, not FM radio. It's 5 band and you can increment or decrement each band individually and save your settings when using the Custom option. I've not looked at the preset EQs. Knowing that I'm deficient above 3000 hz, I just boost the two highest ranges.     The AAA battery concept is terrific. I have AAA rechargables and will always have the power I need. I don't believe battery life is going to be any kind of issue with decent rechargable NiMH AAA's.  The FM radio reception is exceptional. The weight room in my gym is a basement and I've never been able to listen to any but the most powerful stations in there with any of my on-person portables. That rules out my favorite station, a 500 watter. I've brought my Sony WMF-FX465 cassette AM-FM walkman in there and all my iRiver devices and none of them got more than spotty reception of that station. Even my radio-dedicated Aiwa CR-LD101 is unable to get a clear signal in most places in that room. However, this m250 gets near perfect reception in nearly every location! I probably won't push my luck down there and will keep it in mono mode in the FM settings, but I'm floored that I can actually get decent FM in that room.    Volume is more than adequate even with my low efficiency Etymotics ER4S earbuds. I think the included earphones sound fine, and they actually fit quite well and I would use them in most places, however they don't have the sound-blocking ability provided by the Etymotics, and that's why I won't be using them in the weight room, on airplanes, etc.    The AB repeat is a very nice feature.   The m250's hold switch is another crucial feature, much appreciated. My iRiver devices all have this but the expensive Aiwa AM/FM receiver does not, and it's sorely missed.  I really like the ergonomics. People complain about the toylike aspects, but that doesn't bother me. It seems sturdy enough, so far. The flare at one end is perfect for knowing where you are in the dark. With very little experience I already am able to use all the functions in complete darkness as long as the backlight is set to at least the minimum non-zero setting, 3 seconds.     Cons:    The iRiver players support subdirectories as a way of organizing your music. You can elect to play the selections in a particular subdirectory, for example, or repeat a directory, a song, randomly play the contents of a directory, or the whole device. The m250 is far more primitive. I'm not yet in the habit of using MP3 tags for my files, but the m250 is going to force me to start using them. For me it would be easier to just keep things organized using directories.    The armband is something I probably won't use, or sparingly. It's necessary to remove the plastic cover in order to change the battery, and it's not easy to do so. I'll just keep the m250 in a pocket, when possible.     The player does remember where you were in a file if you turn it off and then turn it back on. However, if you change to FM radio and back again  to file play mode (or to a different file) it forgets what file you were listening to and where. I play a lot of really long files (3 hours or more), so this is a minus.     I had a defective m250 before I got my present one. The first one had a version 4.x firmware, and the latest 4.x after installing the Sansa firmware updater. Since I often play MP3 files that are in excess of 3 hours, it's nice if I can fast forward at more than a snail's pace. The first m250 I had featured an accelerated fast forward when you kept it on for a while and I could navigate to the middle or end of the file rather quickly. The new player came with October 2007 2.2.5A firmware, and the updater will not upgrade it. Evidently players using version 2x firmware will not accept version 4x firmware, and probably vice versa. The player I have now will only fast forward at a very slow pace with no acceleration, and in this I am disappointed.  Evidently a firmware defect, the m250 I have (and the previous one) lacked the stopwatch feature (until I stumbled on a way to bring it out of hiding, see below).    Finally:   Here's a VERY helpful portion of a review I just spied at cnet (after enabling "Smart Menues" I DO have the stopwatch feature!):  "The user manual STINKS, I feel very bad for non-techie types. I'm guessing most people won't be able to use the unit to it's full capabilities. Check out "Advanced/Smart Menus", you use the left/right navigation to move around menu options (instead of having to keep hit menu & start all over from main menu, Smart Menus brings you back to your last place in options)."  Having turned on Smart Menus, the Stopwatch feature appeared in the top level menu. It remains there now whether Smart Menus is enabled or disabled. Obviously, the feature not appearing initially is a bug in the firmware. Smart Menus is totally undocumented in the manual. I wonder how many other features are undocumented or improperly documented.  If you happen to find a Sandisk device that's promoted as "refurbished," I suggest you give it a wide berth. Sandisk does not have a reburbished products program and if you find one, it's something set up outside of Sandisk's system and Sandisk will not honor the warranty. In the event that you have a defective device, you will have to deal with whoever you bought it from.

<Title>My old 512MB was better in some ways
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>While I enjoy the increased memory for more music and the recognition of more file types, I miss the old buttons I had on my 512. Buttons simply offer more tactile feedback than the membrane areas (I guess that's what they're called) on my newer m250. Sometimes these membrane areas don't respond and the A-B function I bought this unit for?; fugget about it! It's very difficult to isolate small segments of music with the new membranes. This is very important for me to learn a piece of music by ear. If I had known about these drawbacks prior to buying this 'new and improved' model I never would have bought it.
