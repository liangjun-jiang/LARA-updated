<Title>Useful & Versatile
<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this primarily to store pictures from my digital camera for a trip to Europe.  It performed flawlessly, the battery lasted long enough to transfer photos each day for 7 days & it still was only 1 bar down.  I was able to create folders for each day of my trip in advance and transfer the photos from my camera into the right folder for each day.  As a bonus I loaded some mp3 files and listened to music on my flight.  After the trip was over I was able to show my entire family my photos on the tv screen, that was great. When I got home it was quick & easy to transfer all the photos, in the separate daily folders, onto my computer.  This was well worth the price.

<Title>Great Player USB Host Works with Canon PTP Camera 
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So this is my fifth hard drive mp3 player. I have been using this nice player for over a week now.   Sound quality is very good with senn mx500 / shure e3c and so far i see no review complains about it.   Transfer file is very simple with drag and drop.  USB Host works great with my canon S2 camera.The latest firmware supports PTP camera and all new canon should have PTP but check before you buy it. If your camera is not a massive storage device and doesn't have PTP, a cheap card reader can solve the problem easily.   Video playback is super. It can play high resolution video that means you will have less chance of re-encoding your existing videos. Even if you are encoding the video for the first time higher resolution equal better TV out quality. You can transfer the video back to the computer or PDA anytime for viewing and no worry about the quality.  The LCD is bright and sharp so watching movie on it is enjoyable.   Battery life is ok and it's not that bad. In one day, I got 1 hr 30 min music (mp3 192kps)  + 3 hr 40 voice record  (32kHz 3 separate files) +45 min video 800kps + 50 min music and my battery had one bar left. Yesterday, I went to sleep with my archos on, I woke up in the morning after 6+ hours and wow it was still playing the videos (2x 45 minutes 500kps 320x240 divx.) The battery bar turned red though :)  Btw, if you want to play the videos in the same folder automatically, you can set the "playmode" to "folder" and "Repeat/shuffle" to "Repeat"    Great price with tons of features. You can't go wrong with this.

<Title>do NOT hesitate!
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i just got this cool little device two days ago and can't say anything but good things about it. i'm always skeptical about reviews, and this one had nothing but good ones. it has been mentioned the screen is small, which was my concern, but it turned out bigger than i pictured and VERY good looking. this plays ripped dvds/tvshows flawlessly and the audio is fantasic. if you are considering buying thisd over your standard mp3 player or the apple movie player i would HIGHLY recommend the gmini 402.

<Title>glad i got this over ipod
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just recieved this device, and after about two weeks of using it, it is just amazing. I dont understand why anyone would buy the much more expensive ipod video($400), when you can get this for roughly 250(got mine for $237). The music capabilities are anything you would expect from an mp3 player. The sound is good, and the interface is comparable to ipod, maybe not as good. The video capabilites of this device are what make it special. Archos states that the player will only play Divx mpeg4's but that is not true...it will also play any xvid coded videos without conversion. The reason i gave this device an 4 instead of a 5 is b/c the coversion software that comes with the player sucks. I've tried to convert 10 different videos with different settings and no matter what the sound is always faster then the video. Basically, if u dont have videos that will already play on the gmini without conversion, dont count on the conversion working. Luckily, most of my videos or movies were alreayd divx or xvid encoded so they worked.

<Title>Nice device with some software issues
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall, this is a nice system.  The controls are not as intuitive as with other players; so if you hand this to someone else, they'll fumble with it for a little bit.  The sound quality is very good if you replace the supplied buds.  Battery life is adequate.  Screen resolution is fine for most purposes.  I would say that the average camera's LCD does a better job of displaying photos than the Gmini.  The issues I had was in getting the device to sync to my PC using Windows Media Player.  It would copy some songs, and then freeze in the middle of the next.  Disconnecting and reconnecting the device would help sometimes (but would leave multiple copies of the song on the Gmini occasionally).  Other times, it remained hung at that song.  Archos customer service suggested it was an issue with the USB and that I should upgrade my chipset firmware.  This was strange, considering other devices have no problems syncing.  On my own, I found that if i configured the Gmini as a hard drive, instead of a Windows device, the sync worked perfectly.  It appeared to sync slower, but at least it was reliable.  The other issue I noticed was that the song/artist names that were used in the Gmini was different from that shown in WMP.  For example, it would preface the song name with the track number (those downloaded from Yahoo! music).  Other times, it would refer to the artist as "Various Artists" when the artist name was correctly shown in WMP.  Deleting the song from the Gmini, updating the tag data and re-syncing fixed these issues.  However, it would be nice if the data was identical to WMP without the extra work.  Also, this is one of the few devices that displays the control screen on the TV, and not just the media.  However, the lack of a remote doesn't make this very useful.  To wrap up, this is a nice device with the given limitations.  I would still recommend it.

<Title>Awesome player for price
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the first portable MP3 player I hav owned and I am VERY happy with my purchase. I recieved my Archos Gmini 402 three days ago and I got almost everything down.  The good... - The player is very compact, smaller than you think. I can fit it into my jean pocket but Ill be picking up the carrying case for it soon.  - Video Playback. Its cheeper than the iPod video and has a longer battery life for video viewing (iPod about 2hr./ Archos about 4-5 hr). Its only sports a 2.2 inch screen but the picture is very crisp, sharp, and colorful. I have put on four tv shows on it and a movie and have little to no problems making out everything. Its great!  - It acts as a external harddrive. You just plug it in via USB port, and you can drag and drop all you want. You dont even have to sync it through Windows Media Player to transfer your music or videos. You can also tranfer things off as quickly as you put them on. It took me about 25 minutes to transfer my 11 gigs of music onto the player.  - Voice recorder and picture viewer. Ive played with the voice record and it is very simple to use. It also captres voice very well. Pictures are also very beautiful on the player. Very colorful and sharp.  The bad... - Battery life. Listening to MP3s will last about 10 hrs. and video playback about 4-5 hrs. I would have atleast like to see 15 hrs. for MP3 play.  - Navigation. Going through the Gmini simple, but scrolling through a big library of music with a directional pad is going to take time. If you are a fan of the click wheel, you will notice how much slower and longer it takes just to go from "A" to "Z."  - Bundled software and converting video files. The instruction manual says it will only play MPEG 4 files but it will also play DivX files also. So if you have any video files in that format, you can just drag them into your video folder and it will play just fine. But if you dont, you can try to use Virtual Dub and the Archos MPEG 4 reader software it comes with.  However, the insruction manual does not help you at all on how to use them and is useless if you have no clue what you are doing (like myself). However, after 2 days of tinkering with it, I figured it out a simple way of "converting" files to make them playable. Just load your file onto Virtual Dub then go to.... video > compression, then pick eaither MPEG4 or the DivX codec for compression then save it as "segmented avi."  Overview...  All in all, this is a VERY solid player. Plays music and videos, view pictures, delete files, create folders and playlists without having to connecting it to your computer, voice recorder, and it acts as a harddrive all for around $240. Great player for a great price.

<Title>King of Video MP3 Players
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Archos Gmini 402 is possibly the best video Mp3 player on the market today. I just got this player on Christmas and it is awesome. In one day I put 20 albums, 14 Family Guy episodes, The Family Guy Movie, and 2 Simpsons episodes on it. I still have 14GB left. The games are pretty cool, but you only get short demos, but I didn't buy a video mp3 player for games. They do come in handy when you are bored.   Just quickly, here are two cons that I can think of, the scrolling is kinda slow, and volume isn't too loud if you are a person that likes to blast music.   In the box you get the mp3 player, headphones with their own volume control, a converter to be able to use 2 sets of headphones at once, a charger, a cord to outplay music or video on the TV or Stereo, 2 USB cords, and a protective pouch. It also has a owner's guide and some fold out instructions.  I am also pretty sure that it works with Napster, it has the Plays for Sure sticker. The software itself is about 1.35 GB. I know this because I accidentally formatted my Gmini 402. It got rid of everything. But I was able to put my music and video on it in about 15 minutes, and retrieve all of the demos off of the Archos website. The only thing that I lost for good is the read-me files that are in 6 different languages, If you just don't understand technology then you might need it but it just freed up more video and music space for me! Anyways you can just go to the website and look at the read-me there.  I have read a few other reviews on the Gmini 402, and I guess a few people just do not know how to use mp3 players. TRUST ME, the Archos Gmini 402 WORKS with Windows Media Player 10 and Windows XP. It says it on the BOX! It is so easy to use too. Just drag the music or video that you want into the Sync list and make it go. Some video files are not compatible with the Archos Gmini 402, but Windows Media Player automatically converts it for you. It takes about 5-7 minutes to convert a Family Guy episode. That is pretty fast compared to other programs.   The battery life for the Gmini 402 is 4 hours video, 10 hours music. It takes about 4 hours to go from a dead battery to a full charge. Ya so the new video Ipods can do like 18 hours of music but please, 2 HOURS of VIDEO!!! You can't watch half of the movies you put on it, unless there is an outlet nearby. And, the video Ipod does not come with cool 3D demo games. Oh yah, if you have read any of the newspapers lately, some have had articles that critisize the video Ipod and PSP because it is hard to put video files on them. It's true, it is very difficult, my friend just got a video Ipod for Christmas and he has to convert all of his video files into MPEG4. He had to get special software too because Apple only allows Itunes. Jeez what a rip. He can only enjoy 2 hours of video, no cool games, and he has to endure hours of converting. The Archos Gmini402 can play MPEG4, WAV, and AVI formats in video. I think that there are more that I have forgotten but I hope that you get the point.   The Archos Gmini 402 is the best video mp3 player that you can find for the low price. It is cheaper than most video players. Did you know that the Ipod Nano is 200-275 dollars depending on the size of the hard drive. Don't go wrong and buy some other mp3 player, trust me, you will regret it.

<Title>Using the excellent Gmini 402 on Macs
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using this fine little music player for several weeks now on my iMac G5. While I'm sure the vast majority of people who purchase this product (and the below reviewers) will be using Windows machines, I figured I'd give a heads up to those who might like to know how it runs as a replacement to the iPod on a machine with OSX.  Using it with iTunes:  I initially had pretty serious conversion issues with my Gmini and iTunes. By default, iTunes converts music files into AAC format, which the Gmini doesn't support. I had to convert my 500 or so songs into mp3 format, which took about a half hour or so and set my CD burning preferences to mp3. Since then, I haven't had any problems, but iTunes-purchased music cannot be converted. Luckily, I haven't been privy to purchasing much music on iTunes. Almost all of my music has been from my own CDs or through downloads at allofmp3.com (which is compatible with the Gmini). If most of your music came from purchases on iTunes, this device probably isn't for you.  Archos has an iTunes plug-in that allows iTunes to read the Gmini, but it's not as advantageous as you might think. An icon for the player appears in the "Source" bar on the left of iTunes and you can click and drag songs into it. But it won't tell you if you've already installed the song on the Gmini (so you could get the song twice) and it doesn't put the songs into the Music folder on the Gmini. Of course, iPods automatically update in iTunes, which has its plusses and minuses.  An easier way to transfer songs to your Gmini is to just go into your iTunes folder via Finder and drag the artist folders onto the Gmini's Music folder. This not only makes your Gmini's folder nicely organized, but it also looks identical to your iTunes folder, making it easy to compare what music you have on the two sources.  ID3 tags on iTunes (song titles, genres, album titles, etc.) appear just fine on the Gmini. I haven't quite figured out how to get album art to show up on it, though. I don't imagine it will be too difficult.  Free podcasts (almost all are free) are fully compatible with the Gmini, provided they're in mp3 format (most already are). I didn't want them getting mixed up with my music, so I created a new folder on the Gmini titled "Podcasts" and dragged the files there.  General stuff:  --Uploading photos onto the Gmini really separates it from the iPod. Photos show up beautifully on the Gmini's screen, and you can still zoom in on them. One complaint is that I can't view them while listening to music, though. My camera was also incompatible with the Gmini at first, but after updating the Gmini on Archos' Web site for free (took about three minutes), it works fine.  --As other reviewers mentioned, the Gmini's microphone is suprisingly good. I have a digital recorder, but the thing stinks compared to the Gmini, both in terms of recording quality and length of recording (the Gmini's hard drive is much larger than most digital recorders).  --I haven't gotten into videos on the Gmini, but the demo video it came with looks great on the screen.  --The iPod has more status than all other mp3 players on the market, but when most of my friends see my Gmini, they say, "Oh, wow" and want to pick it up. It really is a cool little device. I have also come across many a scratched iPod--the devices seem prone to it--but I have had no such problems on my Gmini.  --Having a charger for the Gmini is much better than it only charging when plugged into a computer, but dual compatibility would be nice. Instead, it needs to be charging via the adapter when plugged into the computer. It's a minor nuisance, but I suppose it's worth it when you're on the road and you don't have a computer with you.  Overall:  The good: The interface--not the buttons--is very user-friendly, playback and recording is truly outstanding, the screen is beautiful, uploading photos from a camera is very convenient, the device plays pictures, video and music on a television  The bad: Some compatibility issues with iTunes, battery life should be longer, you can't view photos while listening to music  The bottom line: This is the best mp3 player I have come across (and I have quite a bit of experience with iPods). But it's so much more than an mp3 player.

<Title>Well, how fun!
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Gmini402 rocks for these reasons:  1. - It can be recognized by any computer as a hard drive. You can store anything on it.  2. - It reads WMA files, which is what I tend to use for my music.  3. - You can watch Divx and Xvid encoded avi files. No mpegs, but it's pretty easy to convert them with VirtualDub, which it comes with.  4. - It comes with an extra cord so you can plug a flash drive directly into it. I've also been able to connect my external maxtor 120 GB hard drive directly to it. You can listen/watch files and copy them to the Gmini without going through a computer. Genius!  I've used it everyday for the past 2 and 1/2 months and love it. Ipods have their use, but are over-rated in my opinion.

<Title>All though the perfect media player, it still has some minor faults
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Alright. First off, im a freshman in highsckool and i was lookin for a mp3 player for a very long time. what i wanted in a player was: color screen good sound quality friendly userface something that noone on the subway has decent batterylife  Im tellin it front-up. i didnt want an ipod. because everyone had it and i didndt find it sepcical. i also needed to buy a player in the price range of anything less than 250; i didnt want to spend all my money on an mp3 player and in a couple of months some really flashy multimedia thing with the best screen or soemthign like that comes into the market. so i decided to buy the gmini 402. what caught my attention was: color screen video playback nice screen userface Good music transefer (no itunes, wateva juss drag and drop) very compact noone else in my skool had it very good reviews (from amazon, etc)  With that out of the way My REAL opinions on this player follows:  Music: Archos really did a good job making this a music player. this player is actually very small, but the layout of this player makes it easy to go thorught music. the only thing though, is that the up and down scroll is pretty slow compared to any touch-interface, f.e ipod, iriver, creative... etc. the sound quaility is great, and the player automaticllay divides the music songs into title, album, artist, playlist, year. it also has a "browse hard drive" folder, which brings you to just looking at the folders of how you put your music in drag and drop. i think the volume goes very loud, no eq, but the bass booster and stuff are decent. also shuffle, intro, repeat, folder repeat, etc. All the basics. ANd it shows album art too (not jpeg album art, some wierd file. if you want to put album art, go to www.gmini400.com and go to thier album art tuturial.  Video. this is the main function i use. drawback: this screen is incredibally small. and thats why i gave it a 4. no matter how i look at it, the screen is small. i would like at least a 2.5 inch scren (.3 inches makes a big difference measuirin diagnolly). but this video playback is great. even though u can only put divx and avi, i found a lot of sotwares that can convert my moives and dvds to put on my gmini. but  IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO OPERATE VIDEO EDDITING AND CONVERTING SOFTWARE, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER. It took me a month to figure out what im doing. However, you can buy those "easy solution converters" for around 10 -30 dollars. but i dont have a creidt card and i dont want to spend money, so i downloaded beta software or software from uknonw sites. i have over 10 softwares just to convrert my videos. a seruis pain in the butt. each video takes around real time, if it is 1 hour, takes 1 hour. if you dont know what your doing, and you dont want to spend money on easy conversion softwares, i suggest you buy another video player with more supported codecs. THe video browsing is very nice though. two pane broswer, thumb nails on the right. file name on the left. get some pictures of the GUI from www.dapreview.com and go to thier galleris. clikk on archos, and look at the av400 one. its the colosest to the gmini402. video playback is very sharp, no dropped frames, and can change the vdieo into 4:3, 16:9, full sscreen, and auto. very nice  Photos.  i dont use this a lot. partly becuase u cant listen to music while you look at photos. and i find it borin to look tat them. the only reason i use this feature is to set up my a nice wallpaper of a comic book figure or nice scenery. could be 1, 4 or 9 thumbnails. the browser is same as the video, thumbnail on the right and filename on the left. refresh rate is decent, not too fast.   games. these games SUCK. and all of them are demos. mophun engine is very useslss. if you do want to play games however, buy a gmini400. i heard they have A LOT of emulators and hacks and watever. you can play sonice and i eaven heard of doom. but these games really suck  audiocorder this feature is really really hot. my friends like to fool around and freestlye sometimes. and we got MAD instrumentlas on my player. so we play the instrumentals on thier computer (trsanfer with usb to computer), and play the instrumentals. i record all thier raps, and it is so clear. very nice feature. one time i recroded myself and i heard a girl halfway across the room. very nice. you can also purchus a microphoen but im not a seruis musician.  Batterylife this batterylife is alright. i usually charge it once a day, after i get home. i take the subway to scool, 2 hour ride round trip. i listen at lunch, and sometimes in some periods when the teachers dont care. so about 4 hours. i have only 1 or 2 bars off (out of 4)  screen this is the only part of the player i really disklike. its the sharpest screen, very nice, but a bit small. its perfect for some 15 minute viewiing of a freestlye or a dancing clip or several music videso, but if you watch a whole movie, your eyes are going to hurt.   Usb host i only used this thing 2 times, and it took a while to trasnefr. first time was from my cannon camera to the gmini. theres a special cable you have to carry around if you think ull be transefering stuff. it took me about 1 minute transfering 5-8 pictures. the good thing though, is i stole some of my friends music from his mp3 player. plugged it in, and took all his songs.   conclusion overall, very nice player, tons of features. sum it up, video, music, audio, and photo are all good. the screen is sharp but small, player is very small, definley fit into your pocket. batterlife is decent. i hope this review helped you guys. i decided to write one because reviews helpe dme decide to get this. i have some regrets now, but if you always think not to buy anythin, and wait for something better to come out, ur never goin to buy anything.

<Title>I love my Archos Gmini!!!
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Arhos GMini 402 for about a month, and I absolutely LOVE it! It is one of the most versatile devices I have ever owned, and it beats the pants off of ipod! From the moment I turned on the Gmini, it was near perfect. I love the fact that I can use it for video, music, pictures, games, as a voice recorder (great for a college student!), and as a portable hard drive. I also use it in my car - it works flawlessly when used with an FM transmitter, and I always have my music with me! The earbuds that come standard are great and have good sound quality, and I love the volume adjuster right on the cord, it is a really handy feature. I had read that the navigation was tough to use on this, but it only took playing with it for an hour or so to get the navigation down, It is not quite as easy as the click wheel, but it is not hard to use at all. Also, I love the fact that you can hook it up to your computer as a removable disk drive and just drag and drop your music and photos. The only thing that I would change is that if I had to purchase it over again, I would spend the extra money to get the version with the digital camera and camcorder in it. I have absolutely no complaints about the Gmini! It is awesome, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality media player that outshines ipod by far!

<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this thing for almost 2 months now and I absolutely LOVE IT. I use it everyday and the battery life is never an issue when I'm listening to music. I wish I'd bought a car adapter so that I could watch movies and charge in between because one full-length movie will take most of the life out of the battery, BUT you can get away with a movie and a few hours of music if you don't leave the backlighting on all the time. Its very intuitive to use and the instrucions it comes with are clear. It was essentially a plug-n-play device because I already has Windows Media Player 10 on my pc and I'm yet to have any problems with it at all. I haven't put any pictures on it but from watching movies I can say that if you put high quality stuff in you certainly get high quality out. And it was able to convert almost every file on my computer to a usuable format...there were 5 it couldnt take care of out of around 2 thousand. I rave about it to everyone.

<Content>This is possibly the greatest MP3 player/Video Player I have ever used. I did a lot of research before I purchased and played with many a device before I settled on the Archos Gmini 402. The only complaint that I have is that you have to wear the headphones if you want to hear the sound from a video. That is the only reason that I gave this player 4 stars instead of 5 (Mainly because I couldn't give it a 4 1/2). If you are looking for a well rounded MP3 player with video and photo capabilities, this is the one.

<Title>A very versatile little entertainment machine.
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player about a month ago and I have to say it has had quite an effect on how I view entertainment.  For one thing, the mobile video has a lot more uses than you might think as you find times when you are waiting and have it on your person, you can easily watch a movie and not notice the time pass like you normally might.  The screen is definitely viewable even though it is pretty small.  People say that this player plays divx but they are being a bit misleading.  This player plays, without re-encoding a very specific formatted version of avi, which is xvid encoded mpeg4 with mp3 audio.  It does not produce AC3 surround sound output, even downmixed.  If you download a lot of movies, you may find this important to know.  However, a lot of material is pre-existing in this format.  By far the best feature of this player is the ability to use it for TV-Out and the ability to make playlists on the fly.  The TV-Out makes it possible to show all your friends the cool movies you have without changing formats or burning disks, etc.  Another great thing about it is the USB host port, which most people don't realize not only can host a USB hard drive, but I recently discovered is a powered port (maybe this is part of the USB2.0 spec I don't know) and the power allows you to power up a set of USB speakers.  I discovered this on my own as I plugged in a set a speakers I didn't need that I got with a computer I bought recently and the speakers powered right off of the player itself.  Which makes this player a great unit in a portable boombox type configuration.  With the ability to make playlists on the fly, you can completely DJ a party using this unit and a set of decent USB speakers.  If you are over someone's house you could technically carry all of this around with you in your car, and in a boring moment you'd have at least a little bit of entertainment.  Personally, I use this for playing music to go to sleep to at night since it fits quite nicely on my nightstand.    However, this unit does everything it's supposed to do and even a bit more with some experimenting.  The USB 2.0 Host was a fantastic idea and I'm glad that they implemented it.  Technically, you could probably use just about any low-power USB device as an attachment to this unit.  So all of those USB flashlights, etc. would probably work using this unit as a battery, while you are listening to music.  Amazing sub-feature...  There are a couple drawbacks.  I found that the player was not very good for use in the car because you simply can't operate the interface effectively and quickly with one hand, so I use my other MP3 player in the car.  It is though, perfect in just about any other situation.  Highly recommended and worth the dollar amount.

<Title>Worst product ever purchased
<Date>Thu May 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After searching around and looking at other reviews of this product I decided it would be an excellent media player.  I purchase the product and was very pleased with how the product functioned.  After 8 days of casual use the product would not start up past the Archos welcome screen.  After 3 attempts at getting the RMA department to get my address information correct for a RMA, I then sent the product in early Jan 2006.  After a week I received an email from the service department to notify me that the repair would cost $80 without a proof of purchase (PoP) within a year that it was received my their department.  No problem since the product broke after a week of use, so it was well within Archos 1 yr warranty.  I first attempted to send the PoP by email to the department without any luck.  I then faxed the PoP to the RMA department on four separate dates.  Each time I called the RMA department the status of my RMA was still "Waiting on PoP."  I was told many times that RMA department manager was looking into the issue and that he would call me back.  I began to get sick of hearing that a manager would call me back.  After several attempts to actually speak to one of these managers I finally talked to Paul.  Paul gave me his email address at Archos so that I could email the PoP directly to him.    Paul also explained to me that the Service department had been moved to another location.  This was the first time I had heard of this information.  He also explained that the Service department had just started shipping out repaired items in the last couple of weeks.  This is April now.  No wonder the RMA department was never getting my PoP to the Service department.  The Service department did not exist at the time.  What kind of RMA department has no idea that their Service department is not operational?  Also, what kind of company closes their Service department to move it to another location?  Archos.  So, I start to feel like things are going to be moving.  The next time I call the RMA department I find that my product is fixed but has not been shipped out.  You would think that their Service department would ship the items they've had their inventory the longest, first.  Not Archos.  I'm still waiting on my product.  That's right its now 11 May 2006.  My current status of my RMA is that a Archos RMA department manager is looking into it and will call me back.  Do not waste your time with this product.

<Content>you can save a [...] load of money by buying this from dish netowrk, they call it the pocket dish, but it does the same exact things, the only different thing is that it is dvr compatible, so if you have dish network, you can plug it into you dish dvr and put tv shows in it. its only 150$ over there. thats over 50% cheaper.

<Title>Functionality: 4  Reliability: 1  Customer Service: -2
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The device worked well and was a joy to use. For about two months. It then refused to turn on. I had to send it back to Archos. About a month later I receive a replacement. The replacement had a shoddy D-pad and couldn't recharge. Obviously nobody even checked to see if it worked before sending it to me. Had to send it back. It's been about 5 weeks so far and I have to keep calling, listening to some lady who only works there 2 days a week complain about all the problems they have with the warehouse. I regret this purchase more than anything I've ever bought.

<Title>Terrible Quality
<Date>Tue Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved my Gmini 402 as a gift a year ago.  After only a few months it had already broken (the headphone jack broke).  Though I sent it in and had it repaired, when it came back it could now only hold 18.3 gb rather than 20gb!  I called customer service (finding the number was an almost impossible feat) and the person on the line dismissed me saying that I didn't know anything and that nothing was wrong.   I find it a difficult gadget to use and it takes a long time to find what you're looking for.  The more you have in it, the longer it takes to find the song/album you're looking for.  The video screen is just to small to be practical and it only plays files that are supported by Windows Media Player so forget about any RealMedia or Quicktime files you may have. I would not recomend Archos as a company to buy anything from. And I certainly would not recomend this product to anyone.  Period.

<Title>Nice little player
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Gmini 402 about 2 months ago. I love it. I use it to play MP3's, take pictures and shoot videos. It also doubles as a portable hard disk drive. I've found the player to be reliable, the sound quality to be good and the picture quality to be good. The player allows for the creation of playlists and for the export of playlists from your computer to the player. It can be connected to a Windows machine as a windows device or as a hard disk drive. I found it easier to use the device connected to the computer as a hard disk drive.  I found the device to be relatively easy to use.  I've knocked the player around a few times, but it still keeps playing. The only other device of this type that I ever had was an RCA Lyra which I also liked. I haven't used and IPOD, but from what I have read this device seems to be in many ways superior to an IPOD that would be in the same price range. The creation of playlists could be a little more intuitive, but overall I give this machine 5 thumbs up.

<Title>Digital Camera Owners, Beware!  Recorders Rejoice.
<Date>Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I originally purchased the Gmini 400 because I like to travel with my digital camera and unload photos so I don't have to carry a lot of CF cards.  The 400 did this just fine.  Then a few days after purchasing the 400, I saw the 402.  It looked like a nice upgrade and it has a universal download feature so any digital camera could (theoretically) dump photos on the drive.  Well, my two Canon cameras both generated error messages and Archos Tech Support has yet to explain what's happening.  The bright side of this picture (get it?) is that it actually works with an optional USB 2.0 CF reader which I can take with me. Problem Solved but not very elegantly.  The real bonus is that I took my Gmini to a concert last night and I stealth recorded The Steve Miller Band and the recording is fantastic.  This little guy records .Wav files and the quality was amazing.  I use external pinpoint lapel mikes from Giant Squid and a battery box.  I could have easily gone 3-4 hours or more on a single charge.    I also loaded 20 hours of TV shows which I can watch on the plane if I don't get tired of staring at a 2.2" screen.  A ton of child photos and... wait a second.. I don't have any room left on the hard drive to use it for traveling.  Oh well, I will unload the concert files anyway.  You can delete things on the fly so I may keep the TV shows and dump them if I need the space.  One other thing; the 400 came with foreign power adaptors, the 402 does not, but it does come with a wonderful belt case and the 400 did not.  If Archos can deliver on the original promise and allow my to jack my Rebel XT directly, this tiny multi-media center would seem perfect in every respect.  I would have rated it 5 stars had this feature worked.  Sound Quality.  I consider myself an audiophile and have returned other players which sounded bad to my ears.  The sound quality of the Archos 402 is superb, exceeding my expectations.  Remember, I didn't buy this to play music but it's really a versatile device.  I highly recommend this device over an ipod and most of the Creative players.  It is tiny, feather weight and easy to carry. I bought it here at Amazon, they let me return the 400 with no restocking charge and get the 402.  For just under $300 I thought it was a great buy.

<Date>Wed Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recived this last night and it kept me up playing unitl  1 am.  This does everything is says it does. I was able to transfer all my mp3's over.  I can watch some of the movies I had on my pc.(some need to be converted, but they say that upfront). I got this to backup my photo's on the go.  No problems with either of my two digital cameras. I gave it 4 stars becuse I would like to see better play of video.  The manual is not the best but this divice is not hard to learn. The only note I will make is that I had to change the usb settings to hard drive to sync right with my pc.

<Title>Glad I waited til I saw this one
<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the unit in three days, that's amazing.    After playing around, I finally got down to some serious testing.  It works great with my Minolta (aka Konica/Minolta).    I had absolutely no problems with JPG; however it didn't recognize the video (.mov) so it wouldn't play it.  That doesn't matter, I was able to save the file, transfer it to my computer and it played on the computer.  That's the main purpose for which it was purchased.    My iDrive quit working while on an Atlantic crossing cruise and I could not retrieve the pictures.   Luckily, I didn't trust this drive and had the ship's photo gallery copy my cards onto cds.  With the 402 I'll be able to see what's being copied.  It didn't recognize my Canon ZR65 camcorder which takes stills on an SD card as well as video on tape.  That isn't an issue now because after some thought, I took the card, put it in the Minolta and they transferred fine with all the ZR65 data.    I find it easier and sometimes the only way to delete certain files is to connect the 402 to my computer.

<Title>Archos Gmini 402 lemon
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have an Archo Jukebox 20 and found it to be superb. I decided to upgrade to the 402 which tech support tells me has been out about 1 month. Buyers beware: the player would not synch to Windows Media player 10 with XP as the OS. I am not a novice to problem solving hardware and software. I spent many hours reading the material that came with the player, reading the .pdf online manual, downloading drivers, trying to email (any English speaking) tech support and calling tech support to be left in the eternal waiting phone line. I have yet to hear from tech support via email except for a canned reply from one of Archos many tech support countries.  Today, I repeated the process. After 20+ minutes I reached tech support by phone. We repeated the processes I had tried. After 1 hour, of my phone time, I am told that it "might be" my 1.0 USB connection. I update the driver for my USB to no avail. So after about 7 hours of trying to work this easy to use player I am left with what to do. I have no certainity that it will work with another computer while my return of merchandise clock is ticking.  You lose Archos; a once loyal customer. You put this player out before you developed your website to answer questions specific to the Gmini 402 e.g drivers, software; you don't advise potential customers of system requirements beyond Windows Media Player 10 and XP as an OS and your tech support is poor even if one is able to make contact.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my player for about a month and love it.  Some of the features I like the best are the ability to play back movies on a TV with RCA connection cables that come with it and the ability to do line in recording.  I recently recorded for 2 hours at sampling rate of 16kHz (lowest sampling rate) and it created about a 400 meg file and still sounded good.  Also my son loves the games that came with it (just samples).  I would recommend this player.

<Title>Gmini 402: fun little media player...
<Date>Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got a Gmini 402 a few days ago, and I've gotta say, I'm thoroughly impressed.  I'm a college student and I've seen all of my friends walk around with the trendy ipods, but I decided I wanted something a bit more interesting, so I decided to put my money in a Gmini.  From the moment I pulled it out of the packaging, I was immediately enthralled with it.  The player is made of a sleek silver aluminum that feels very durable.  The buttons can be a little hard to push down, but you adjust quickly enough.  It turns from a small annoyance to just commonplace without much thought.  The unit itself is about the size of an ipod, unlike the other, less discrete PMPs out there.  The input jacks are easy to figure out and the host usb port seems to be a great idea.  I've got a digital camera that I could probably use it for, but I just haven't gotten around to that just yet.  The battery is decent:  about 10-12 hours for music that I've noticed (although the manual estimates about 10);  I've gotten about 4 hours of video out of it in one charge.  Music: Transferring music from the computer to the player couldn't be easier.  It's recognized as an external hard drive by the computer, so all you need to do is copy/paste your songs from your computer to the Music directory of the Gmini hard drive.  Navigating through the songs isn't as easy as the iPod's click wheel, but you get used to it quickly.  The backlight turns off when you're listening to the music, so you don't have to worry about the battery running around before you expect it.  The included headphones are nothing to write home about, but when is that ever the case?  =)  I replaced it with a better pair of headphones and the music sounded excellent.  If this unit was just bought for the mp3 player function, I'd be perfectly content as is...but there's more of course!  Video: This is obviously what catch most peoples' eyes about this little device.  The installation software for the video conversion software is already in the device as a file in the hard drive, so you don't have to worry about having another installation CD to keep track of.  If you accidentally delete these, or something unfortunate happens like you need to reformat the HD or something, you can get the software easily from Archos's homepage.  The software itself is incredibly easy to use.  Just choose the movie you want to convert, pick the folder you want to save it to, and choose Gmini 400 as the "Target" (device you want to watch it on).  It automatically chooses the optimal format and compression that fits best for the gmini 402.  The conversion is slow, but almost all conversion software likes to take its time.  Once you're ready to watch it, just load it on the unit and you'll find that it's a clean, crisp, smooth image on the lcd screen.  It's small, but I've found it perfect for personal enjoyment of a movie when I'm on the train or something.  Games: The Mophun games that come with the unit are somewhat drab, and I'd have to say that this part didn't live up to expectations, but I also didn't want to spend 6 dollars per game to see if there were anymore that might appeal to me more.  All in all, nothing big to complain about.  Others may like the games more as they're a pretty decent way to waste a little time here and there, if you're not too picky about complexity of games and whatnot.  Recording: I use the Gmini to record lectures all the time.  It's not so great in huge lecture halls, but still managable.  I'm happy enough with it, however, and it's convenient as well.  Helps when I miss something during lecture and I don't need to carry around another device for voice recording.  Conclusion: This is a great little unit, I'd have to say.  The upsides overwhelmingly surpass any downsides it may have.  Apple is coming out with video iPods now, but I'd still say this has the new generation ipod beat.  It has a handy little voice recorder, has games (while not my personal favorite feature, could still entertain).  It also has a cool FM radio/remote control accessory that I'm planning on purchasing too.  So if you want something to stand out in the big ocean of apple iPods and can do more for pretty much the same price, I'd say get this.  You'll never be happier with a purchase than when you first watch a movie or a tv episode on this thing.  It just makes you happy!  =)

<Title>An iPod Killer?
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really dig this unit. It's about the size of any 20 GB iPod, and probably about the same weight. It does NOT feel chintzy, even though it's so small. I'm listening to it right now.   The interface may not match the iPod in terms of ease of use, but once you get the hang of it, it's fine. It just takes a little bit to figure out which button does what.   The only complaint I have about the GMini 402 is the fact that the left directional control feels a little loose... I doubt this is part of the design, but mine feels a little wiggley and it bugged me at first. Doesn't matter now, it has never affected usability. With that out of the way...  The sound quality is great, and you have pretty good control over  equalization - I had no troubles here. The headphones provided are the typical ear-bud type, which I don't generally prefer but these have grown on me.  The digital volume control takes a second to kick in, as the screen turns off after 30 seconds (to save battery), and the screen has to fire back up to register a volume change (you do this by pressing UP on the directional pad), but if you keep it at about 80%, you can adjust the volume with a little control right on the headphone cord, which is a really useful feature.  You don't have to pull the thing out of your pocket to silence/quieten it.   Obviously it holds 20 gigs of music, so that's good. Personally that's about half of my collection, but for most people 20 gigs should be more than enough.   It plays video: this is a great feature, however it's not something I use every day. The device comes with a program that helps you convert video (it converts at about 1:1 speed) to the format used by the device (MPEG4). It's REALLY NICE to have the adapter that comes with it, you can plug it into the device, then into the back of the TV (rca jacks-white, yellow, and red plugs), then change one setting on the unit and you can watch anything from the thing onto the TV, full sound and video quality. That feature is amazing.   The games are pretty basic, though I was surprised to see a couple of 3D games. They are all demos with 2 levels, though, and I don't imagine myself paying $6 for a little game like that, but they're better than cell phone games...   The battery typically lasts somewhere around 7 or 8 hours, which is a little short compared to an iPod, but if you were using the unit, you wouldn't care! It takes about 3 hours for a full charge from nothing.   Transferring music to it is easy too, as the device can be set up as a hard drive (drag and drop) or as a windows device, where you can use Windows Media Player to "synchronize" whatever you want to the device.   For the same price as a 20 gig iPod, this unit offers many more features, and doesn't look half bad either, if you're going for style. When you pull this thing out, people notice. If you're in the market for an MP3 player and want to stand out above the crowd of white ear buds, definitely give this MP3 player a shot. You won't regret it, I don't.

<Title>Lovn' my Archos
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased a 20gig Photo iPod which I returned after a week. I then picked up the Archos Gmini 402 which I've had about 2 weeks, and I love it.  Here's why:  1. If I connect it to one of my friends machines it won't wipe out all my songs/videos and automatically load my friends songs onto it much like an iPod does. 2. I can move songs off my Gmini and onto my computer if I want. You can't with an iPod. 3. iPod wouldn't let you play songs that you put onto it in hard drive mode, Gmini doesn't have that problem. 4. The Gmini has a in-device browser system that lets you reorganize and retype file names if need be. (can't remember if iPod had that ability) 5. Can record audio without any additional gear. Or you can attach a better quality microphone through USB cable. 6. Plays AVI, WMV9 video files. Hell it even plays the  NTSC ~AND~PAL format... I don't know any home DVD or VCR  players that do that. 7. No proprietary synch! I can hook it up to any computer with a simple mini-usb plug.  The few drawbacks:  1. The interface isn't as `intuitive' as the iPod BUT it's still user friendly and easy to use. You gotta admit that the iPod interface is near brilliant. 2. Not as many accessories on the market as for the iPod. (I only found two or three options for a good leather case). Maybe if it gets more popular this will improve. 3. Audio doesn't stop when the earplug is accidentally yanked out. 4. No Quicktime movie driver. ; ;  Simply put, since Archos doesn't `assume' you're gonna go out and pirate stuff and provides a machine that has freedom to do what you want with it. A company with this kind of insight, as opposed to Apple, is why I think this will be light-years ahead of the Video iPod. Apple has great design, great marketing, and a dedicated fan base but... their products just don't meet up to the money you pay for it.  Viva la Archos~!  And to answer a language question: Yes it does display Japanese text. I have a few Japanese podcasts and it displays the ID3 tags just fine. You have to load it onto the operating system yourself though, it's not automatically installed. It's simple to do and already stored in the Data folder on the device, you just move it to the /system folder. It will only give you the option of displaying one of 2 forms of Chinese or Japanese (unless they provide more languages on the website) and you can only view one foreign language side by side with English.

<Title>Best media player on the market
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The archos gmini 402 is by far the most versatile and powerful media player on the market to this date. Not only does it offer the ability to play your standard music files but it plays video, and displays pictures as well. Some of its best features are:  - Nice clean screen with fast refresh, which is good for watching movies. - The device has it's own OS and filesystem which is extremely easy to navigate. - Comes with it's own USB 2.0 built in to the device, which makes plugging other devices directly into it and transfering files very easy. I tested this with a 500 mb file transfering from 1 archos gmini 402 to another, it took about 8 minutes to transfer a file just on batteries. - The battery lasts a long time. - Has it's own equalizer. - The device's design resembles that of a small game system, and is very intuitive to use and navigate with. - The built in microphone is very clear and is one of the best selling points of the device, especially if you are a musician or need it for meetings. - THe ability to output video and audio to an external device such as a reciever is one thing the gmini 402 offers that other devices don't.  The only problems I've found with the device is that you need to manually shut down the device when you're not using it, it seems to go into a standby mode which uses up battery life if you don't. Another thing which the device might have but I haven't spent the time to look for is some sort of way to lock the keys so you don't accidentally press buttons while it is in your pocket.  For the price, and it's features, the Archos Gmini 402 is by far the best media player on the market, none of the ipods can compare, in fact I sold my ipod to help get this one.
