<Title>Great deal
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>A Zune is worth a thousand pictures!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great item, bought my wife the ipod she wanted, and I got this same time. Both are great, do not let anybody tell you otherwise<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>. If you can get this for less money, than why get the ipod? (plus the screen is great, a definate plus over the ipod)I had considered the itouch since I was looking for best bang for the buck with the best screen. I am so glad I did not get the itouch! A friend has the itouch, and it is great until you realize that you are constantly looking at it through you finger prints (that sucks).I will update if necessary.

<Title>much better than an ipod
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son bought one and when his brother's ipod broke, he wanted a Zune instead.  It has an FM radio, you can easily transfer any music, great features, and the price was much less than an ipod.  We will never buy apple products again as they are too proprietary.  Our whole family will be buying one.  You can also search around and find better deals on the Zune.  Amazon had the black one for $50 cheaper than the others.  GREAT PRODUCT

I was hoping to move the music, pictures and videos from my computer using the Zune as an external drive. I find it very cumbersome!!!

<Title>First time MP3 buyer
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Buying a hard drive MP3 player was the correct choice for me,this was the first generation Zune 30 Gigabite player and I was able to download all the updates to go with it. I already have about 85 cd's converted on my Zune, and soon my whole collection will be portable. .That still only uses one third of the available memory.The 3'' screen is the best for pictures and I plan on downloading a movie or two also. I like it that the album covers are displayed and it is very easy to use and navigate the players  menu too. This Zune has an FM radio, another feature I wanted. Most stores are just starting to carry Zune accesories, but they are easilly to buy online, with a large assortment to choose from.  Most importantly I only paid $159.95 on Amazon.com and with free shipping and no sales tax the internet is the best way to buy n ew MP3 players. The enclosed ear buds and need to be replaced right away, I purchased a pair of Sony's Right away and later a set of V-moda in ear canel type that I really like. The case is flimsy and I am looking for a plastic box to use as a case. I deffinately reccomend the Zune....

We have found the synching gets trashed when synchin while using the computer online so he does it when the computer is not in use.  It takes some time.  He is very happy with it.

<Title>Zune 30 - Great product, Great price.
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got my Zune at a great price, and never thought I would use it as much as I do. If you have a MediaCenter PC - This is a MUST HAVE! You can record TV shows, and movies, convert them to Windows media files, and take them with you. If you get the home dock and connect it to your TV, you can watch your shows right on the TV. It holds more music than I even know. Check out the aftermarket programs designed for it and you can really do some cool stuff. The screen on the 30 is big enough to actually enjoy watching. The new software adds features it did not initially come with, like podcast support, and full menu control with the remote. Seems very well built, and the accessories are top notch quality. Like the Ipod, all the accessories are pricey for the original Microsoft stuff, and I suggest you stick with original made accessories. Others I tried did not fit it quite right, I have a friend who got a cable from an online store that damaged his, buyer beware. If you have an XBox360, this connects and you can watch all the photos, videos and music right thru it very easily. The wireless sync is GREAT! I just need my Zune anywhere in the area of my wireless router, push sync on the Zune menu, it opens up the program on my PC and updates by itself. I don't need another sync cable for my computer.  I like it better than my Ipod, mostly for the wireless abilities, and the battery life. It also does NOT scratch like my Ipod, and the newer ones have a real glass screen to avoid the problem. All in all I'm quite impressed with it.

<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Light, Compact, Heavy duty.When you turn the Zune sideways while you watch music videos or movies its like a widescreen movie. It's amazing! It's similar to the Ipod but with a way bigger screen for almost the exact same price or less. Another family member has the Ipod nano and for the same price I got 30gb. The size is a bit thicker but that doesn't bother me. I've synced movies on from dvds and they look great. So if your looking for a new mp3 player put the Zune on your List.:)

<Title>Hard-to-find item found - Before Xmas!!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My girlfriend loves red, so when she "hinted" at mp3 players (by looking at those "fruity" ones), I knew what to get her. I have owned every brand of mp3 player under the sun, and I can say the Zune is the best bang for the buck - especially with the new software upgrade. I didn't think I'd be able to find an affordable 30GB red Zune in early December but Amazon not only had one (and I mean 1 in stock!) but their fast, free delivery got it to me in enough time to wrap it and get it under the tree. She was blown away, I scored major points :) and life is good! Thanks Amazon!

<Title>Can't live without it! Threw the iPod away!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I couldn't wait for the Zune!  My father bought one and he loved it!   He's purchased quite a few cheapy mp3 players thinking he really wouldn't use it.  Well I think he'd agree that he can't live without it.  He's ALWAYS got his with him.  I don't think he listens to the radio anymore!  So he bought me one.  I loaded it up and I rarely listen to the radio anymore either.  It's so easy to use.  I am a bit disappointed with the latest version of the software, but the Zune people are working very  hard daily to vamp it up! If you join the Zune network they actually answer the forum questions and let you know what's going on.  It just keeps getting better and better.  So I bought this one for my daughter.  We are three generation of Zunies!  And each of us feel the same way, if the house caught on fire, (I was going to say we'd run in to save our Zune first, but on second thought) we wouldn't have to run in to save our Zune's because we'd have them on us!  Sound quality is awesome, the amount of music you can fit on the Zune is perfect.  30G is more than you think!  I can't think of a negative to say!  Join [...] to stay informed!!

<Title>the only choice for people who don't like Apple products
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This music player is great, after installing the software it automatically pulled my entire music library from Windows Media Player onto the Zune in a matter of minutes.  The graphics and colorful menus make it easy to use, and the product easily woks with other Microsoft products.  Everyone I show this to at school tells me they wish they'd known about the Zune when they bought their Ipod.  If you prefer Windows Media Player, this is defiantly the better choice.  However it is a little bulky and lacks the all the cool touch sensitive features that you'd find on an Ipod.

The only thing I don't like about the 30GB is the size.  It is bigger than my 80GB.  But none the less the screen size is so much better than ipods.  And I can tell you that at the store I work at we have never had a return on a zune nore have we sent one off to get fixed.  ipods come back all the time.  This product gets an A+

<Title>Zune horrible user interface - No way to add music by folder, Software is bad, too
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I finally got the doodie-brown Zune that I ordered from Amazon on Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving). Got a GREAT deal on it, but was unable to have it shipped until December 31.  Yah! I get it, open it, load software, configure, attempt to load my massive  music collection. However, at this point I notice that the memory hog Zune software leaves a lot to be desired.  The only way to add music to the Zune it by selecting it from a list that displays cute little album covers. There is not a browse folder option, as ALL WINDOWS machines and even the iPod have... let me repeat, there is no way to go browse for a certain file to add to the Zune, you must painstakingly go through an entire collection of little pictures to add music. Really, Microsoft, did nobody think to add a Browse by.. folder view option that is SOOOOO prevalent in ALL Microsoft software, up until this point?  I have an iPod, too... I really thought that iTunes was the worst software ever, until I got the Zune.

Through the Zune software while syncing, a few of my CDs listed several multiple tracks (`Frankie Goes to Hollywood' goes a long way).  For a first MP3 player, the Zune is a good product.  30 GB will take awhile to fill.

<Title>4 stars!.....? I think?....
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well, when I ordered my zune from here I was overly anxious to get it. When I finally got it, it was deffinately what I expected (atleast for 2 days). I could put my music on it and watch videos with relative ease. The videos were A LOT less pain to put on than the ipod (because you have to BUY your own converter for the ipod) and I also liked the way that the albums displayed their album art. The video playback was very clear on the screen. Of course the one thing that threw me off was the upload and converting the videos. Instead of telling you the percentage of all the videos that have been converted, it only told you the percentage of one at a time. This threw me off cause the video would get to 100% and then reset to 0% so I thought it was broken. It wasn't, but it was slightly confusing. So all in all I liked the player a lot at first. But then like the 3rd morning that I had it I went to turn it on, and the screen wouldn't work! It just displayed a black screen with pixalated gray on one side. (Not a good sign) So I call up the service center and right away they are convicting me of dropping it (this didn't set well with me). But unfortunately/fortunately I had already dealt with their customer service before (Xbox 360 RROD?) so I just kept cool and said that I needed to get it sent back to be fixed. So they sent me a box and I sent it in, and haven't gotten it back yet. It has been probably 1 week now, but it sounds like it will be A LOT longer than that. I'm sorry but they should just take your credit card info and send you a new one and have you send the broken one back. And if you don't send the broken one back, charge you for another one. You shouldn't have to wait weeks for your product that you spend good money for. As far as the product goes I'd say it probably deserves a 4 stars. But as far as customer service 0 stars. Terrible.

<Title>Player Good...Zune software BAD!
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I think my review will mirror most out there: from a hardware perspective the Zune is a great player...even better than the iPod in my opinion as it has a radio and better video.  However, the applause ends there..the Zune software is horrible. It makes duplicate copies of songs on the player, sync's stuff you tell it not to, and adds incorrect album art, artist and album info to roughly 30% of the songs on player.  The software alone is reason to look elsewhere.   These are remedial issues that Microsoft should've fixed before bringing the product to market.

<Title>Great and more Great
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First let me say that the menu system on the Zune is far. I mean FAR superior to any other MP3 Player (i-pod included). Only 4 stars because a click wheel would make the 30 GB Zune hands down the best device out there. Screen is bright and huge. Great battery life. The Zune software is awesome. The only cons I have are: No click wheel, The player itself is too big, video takes a long time to upload and not a lot of accessories. A great player for the price but, If you want to spend a little more the 80GB Zune is the best player out there.

<Title>Great Product but needs better support from Microsoft
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love the Zune physically - large screen, large hardrive, easy to read menu and easy functionality.  But the Zune Marketplace is so BAD!  compared to iTunes it is a joke!  they don't offer audiobooks nor movies/tv shows for download.  and since they don't honor DRM it is hard to find downloads.  Microsoft needs to either step up to the plate and develop the marketplace or just release it as a standard MP3 player.

<Content>So far so good.  My wife is enjoying her new toy.  I think the bulk of our CD collection if not the entire collection has been ripped ans synced up to her Zune. I will post if I run into any technical problems with the product. The price I paid for this amount of storage vs. buying the name "IP_D" was well worth the money and cheaper too!

<Title>It exceeded my expectations
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It was an incredibly deal on Zune player at last holiday season, so I decided to give it a try, so clicked to order. I was very interested in what software giant can offer in own player collecting all the best from players offered by already established companies on this market as Creative Lab, and Apple. My Zune 30 was delivered prior Christmas and was waiting under the tree until the clock chimed 12.  As a theater begins from a coat check as DAP begins from a packaging. Every company considers packaging really seriously and tries making it most attractive and innovating. I remember packaging of my first 3g iPod when I really had no clue how to open it.  After removing two sticky clips I slid top of box very easily and got an access to the content of packaging.  Zune took center part, headphones took left part  and an interface cable was in right section of the inner box.  Another section accessible from top contained a pouch, manuals, and software.  Comparing packaging of Zune, Zen , and iPod I'd give 1st place to Zune and  the last to Zen.  Although Zen has most technical information on the box, not so many retailers have actual device in stock reachable by consumers, so the information doesn't reach consumer until he/she really purchased it. First what I did was comparing sizes of iPod and Zune. Obviously Zune is slightly bigger, however it fits comfortable in hands and pockets. A plastic case seems fingerprints free and probably scratch resistant as well.  Screen is huge. Controls look Ok. Play and back buttons are a bit small, but easy to press anyway. You can notice that navigation dial of Zune is also smaller. General problem is that you can miss actual button, for example press center button instead of arrows.   I tried a pouch, it fitted very perfectly. I remember a very loose pouch of Zen, when I could fit two Zens in it, and as result my Zen slid down and has been fallen on a granite floor. Part of its case was broken, luckily it continued working well. However Zune's pouch isn't suede one, as iPod has.  Now I was ready to charge and try it. I connected it to USB port, however it didn't start charging until I turned on computer, although USB was powered all time. An interface cable has protective caps on both ends, similar to iPod's interface cable, however it wasn't fitted so perfectly, I had problems to disconnect it from Zune's end. I hoped to see Zune in Explorer as a standard MTP device after connection, however Vista didn't show Zune anywhere. I remember I could copy music to Zen instantly after a connection ( Zen is MTP device as well). Ok, I decided to play with Zune interface a bit. It came pre-filled with some music, videos and pictures. User interface appeared quite intuitive, screen is big and I was impressed. I tried FM tuner, reception was clear and easy to tune on different stations. I was only wondering when DAP will start incorporate HD tuners? I tried to figure if I can records radio, however it seems not possible. So now it was time to fill it with my own music now. Since it didn't work out of the box, I pulled CD with software and started installation. First step of the installation was obtaining an update. So if you start using Zune in fields, then no way to make it working without an Internet connection. The actual update installed  first Zune management program and then begun updating Zune firmware. I heard that Microsoft issued 2nd generation of Zune, which is generally just a firmware update for 30gb version of the device. An updating firmware took some time, it seems similar to iPod procedure, a new firmware image gets first loaded on a hard drive of a device, and then it gets flashed. UI of Zune looked quite different after the updating firmware. Text of menu items became even bigger; color palette was changed from brownish colors to dark gay ones. New items appeared in Settings menu, and total music navigation got change offering multiple choices switching from artists to albums view and versa. I'll tell about navigation ability of Zune later.    Zune management desktop software  As I already mentioned, you can't use WMP or just Explorer for Zune management. It is certainly drawback, which is dictated by a simple monopoly rule - "We're confident and do know how to do better, if you do not like something, then tell us and we will correct it, do not correct it on your own". Anyway, Zune software is quite innovative. It inherits some principles from iTunes providing 3 panes Artist-Album-Song view.   The  UI is completely custom, and it mimics a tabbed access to different functionality of the program. You need some time to get used before taking all advantages of new UI. I'm still learning it. Some things are quite not intuitive, or require too much extra clicking, for example you can't correct artist/album/song/year in one place. I haven't found how to change genre and year at all.  Zune software uses concept of synchronization a local library with a device. You can beef content library without a device and mark items for future synchronization. A special place is reserved for library, however items being already on a disk can remind in an original location. Zune software recognizes three communication areas as Zune, CD/DVD drive and community input box.   A killing feature of Zune was an introduction of a socializing feature in opinion of Microsoft. You can see a clear notice of it on Zune's box.  I really do not see much benefits of that, it is probably because of age, tastes and so on. At least social feature should look something different, can be much more clear how to use and how to get benefits from it. As I mentioned, Zune management software has context sensitive UI, so when you are in device mode, you can configure Zune wireless network making it connected to your home WiFi. WEP is supported and the program is able to discover available networks and generally easy to use. However finally the Zune wireless capabilities are completely useless. I tell below why. Ripping ability of Zune software quite good, you can choose several format of ripping, including Microsoft lossless, and MP3. MP3 ripping is quite fast, mostly real time of speed of CD copying, Ripping quality supported up to 320Kbps. However Zune uses less comprehensive DB than CDDB, so many my CDs especially European made weren't recognized.   So let's conclude on Zune management software:   Pros  Innovative UI Easy navigate and find Most of available compressed and lossless audio formats are supported WMV, AAC, MP3 Cons  No software alternatives Not flexible in change or retrieve all song information Connected to not so comprehensive variant of CD DB Limited support of video formats (WMV only) No support open format as FLAC or OGG Zune firmware  General UI  As I mentioned, Zune UI looked differently after firmware update. Again, UI is completely custom and innovative. Menu items are just oversized text with wide using sparkling video effects for highlighting and selection. Microsoft chosen an opposite color schema to Apple's one, so all texts are white on dark or black background. However everything is readable quite well. Navigation is very intuitive. Microsoft was in a difficult situation since a touch dial ring, and a slide bar were taken by other vendors. However a classic arrow managed scrolling and navigation work quite well.  I was even impressed that Zune supports national alphabets in the scrolling directory.  Generally arrow controls provide a very revolutionary two-dimensional navigation, so I can easily manage album or artist selection from the same view. Actually selection a category as artist, song, or genre converts items of it in a scroll vertically list and selection any item from the list converts previous navigation to horizontal with a vertical scrolling of a new selection. Play now screen shows oversized album art, play progress and song, artist, album info. For some reason the screen doesn't have track/song number in the list. Long song, album, or artist name isn't scrolled and just fades out. However it is auto scrolled when selected in a list. White color of play progress doesn't look good when album art has white background. Another problem is that screen is readable when backlit is on. It is very annoying, since you need to press the center button to read the screen.  Sound and video quality  Sound quality is really good. It is a bit different than iPod. I'd say that Zune has a little dip in mid range. Zune is also less loud. My major claims were that Zune doesn't support volume or equalization control per song or album bases. regarding video, I can't tell much, because I do not have videos in WMV format. Certainly big, and bright screen is good for viewing videos, but lacking in supporting different formats limits using Zune for this purpose.     Wireless  I still do not understand why this feature is in Zune. I didn't try it for Zune to Zune communication, however it is useless for sync purpose. It is easy to setup wireless to be connected to home WiFi, however Zune drops connection unless song really short. I did all recommendations from Microsoft site, but nothing helped. Actually one of the recommendation to have Zune powered. It means you need some wire anyway. What really would be nice, if Zune provides a  kind of simplistic browser allowing to look for files in music directories when some specific service is setup. I'd develop such feature gladly, I hope Microsoft listens me. Another disadvantage is if you have radio on, then it shorts battery life substantially.   Conclusion  Pros  Big screen, easy readable, good contrast and colors Nice UI FM Tuner Two-dimensional navigation    Cons  No clock No smart lists No statistics Short battery life Lousy wireless  No recording No disk mode No song position in a list and list size No scroll names in play now Progress bar invisible on certain album arts No volume normalization No per son/album equalizer Screen invisible without backlit    Recommendation   I'd recommend Zune to persons who listen music occasionally and own a relatively small songs collection. Zune is perfect for children though. However Zune is useless for serious music enthusiasts. All my recommendation based on price under $100.

The Sync on the zune is faster than the IPOD. The shortfall is Marketplace doesnt have as much, but anything in the itunes can also be put on your zune.

<Title>Good gadget
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This digital player have a lot of things great. Is very easy to use, after half hour you know how it work, the package is pretty small, just come with USB cable, headphones (I never used it)and CD, in my case this CD doesn't work at all, I use Win XP in spanish, so I have to go to Zune web and download the latest version of the software, the good thing is in the same process my zune update his firmware.  The new firmware look better than older one, also activate the ability of connect my zune with the computer by the wireles network on my home, so, say good bye to the cables on the desktop.  Following with the Zune, the screen is just fantastic, the construcci�n is pretty, with a material like a glass, but,must be better if protect the unit with a silicone case, I bought an acrilic one but in time it look very old and, I dude it will resist a fall.  You have to know the Zune come almost alone, if you want enjoy it more, you have to buy the silicone case, the wall charger and the cables for put it on your audio receiver or TV.

<Title>Get an Ipod
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I used my Zune for 9 months, then, downloaded the software "upgrade".  Not only did the "upgrade" screw up my computer and other music software, the music on the Zune suddenly deleted when the Zune was not even connected to the computer.  My Zune is now a very expensive paperweight.  After attempting to get assistance from Zune Help (these are people who know less about the product than I) and realizing that they would never be able to offer anything of any relevance that I hadn't already tried, I bought a new Imac, a new Ipod, and exported my music to an external hard drive, then uploaded all to Itunes on my new computer.  This solved my Zune problem.

<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My bf's zune worked right away and mine had a few issues with software. We have the same computers and same zunes! It's pretty freaky. My zune itself was fine and came in great shape. My computer had some kind of issue with the driver ( Error 10 ). Vista has some problem with giving permissions. If you have this issue, I'd check out support at Zune official site. Chose community support first with the forums. I found my answer there and will hang out there and see what else they suggest. Right now my zune is up and running and I've got lots of cute little backgrounds in my picture reserves. I also watched some videos and listen to music and the headphones are very decent with sound quality!! I never got it to wirelessly sync, but my laptop had a problem as well so I'm sure it's something to do with upgrading to vista.   Also it's outer casing is much more scratch resistant than an ipod. My ipods all turned out looking 5 years old within one week. I'd protect yours as much as possible. So far the zune is really good about this and it looks really great so far! The radio function is also great. The stations are very clear and some have information on what station it is + what song they are playing! Very awsome!  Well that's all I have to say so far! I'm enjoying zune. Satisfied with the style, the looks, the play, the purchase!

<Content>I had my Zune for a few months when my computer and the Zune software suddenly stopped recognizing my Zune. After deleting the Zune software and reloading it my computer recognizes the zune, but the software still doesn't. I have done everything that the Zune trouble shooting guide suggests, and to no avail. The internet is full of discussion boards about the same problem. Many times the people in the discussion board note that the Zune hotline could not fix their problem either. I never had any problems with my ipod. I have decided that the money I put into the Zune was a waste.

<Content>I've only had this for a few days, but I am loving it. I must say I ordered this from Amazon the day before Black Friday for $89., and if it hadn't been so cheap, I wouldn't have bought it. I have a 1GB Creative Zen Nano that I also love. The unit is very substanial. It has a solid feel. The picture is great, as is the sound. I love that they just upgraded the software to allow wireless synching. I wish it came with an AC adapter. I listen to a lot of podcasts from NPR: Wait, Wait, Car Talk, Story of the Day, as well as music. I used to have to be careful to erase the podcasts so I wouldn't run out of room. There's no worry about that now. One thing that puzzles me is why so many mp3 players, this one included, come with magnetic headphones that stick together. Yea, it looks cool, but it doesn't really have any function. and magnets and magnetic media don't mix.

<Title>Microsoft Zune- the MP3 player for tech savvy people!
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune is not going to ever kill the iPod. Not as is, certainly. But that does not mean that the Zune is a bad product. Quite to the contrary, the Zune is excellent. You just need to know your way around a computer to fully enjoy it. Microsoft is certainly not known for their user-interfaces now are they? :P  When comparing the Zune 30 to the new Nano (8 GB version) the Zune comes out on top in every area except battery life (and even that is close).  Price- The two players are about the same now, but around Thanksgiving the Zune (Brown) could be found for around 100$.  Capacity- 30G beats 8G ANY day of the week. Even if you don't need 30 gigs of space, it's nice to have the option isn't it? However, it is important to note that the Nano is flash based while the Zune has a hard drive inside. That means you shouldn't use it as a hackey sack! But I like to think humans are more intelligent than that.   Screen- The Zune has a 3 inch screen. The new Nano has a 2 inch screen. And yet they both sport the same screen resolution. Now which screen do you think it will be easier to watch movies/view images on?  Size- The Zune is bigger than the Nano, and that might be important to some people. I like the size because it suppourts that lovely screen.  Battery- The Nano lasts 6 hours longer for music playback and 1 hour longer for video playback. However, charging time is the same for both devices.   Radio- The Zune gets FM radio reception and even station/song data can be displayed on the screen if the staion suppourts it. The Nano does NOT have a radio.   Album art- Album art displays so large and pretty on the Zune screen! I love looking at my art. I can't say how it looks on the Nano because I don't actually own one.  Software- The Zune software was recently upgraded, and device firmware was too. When is the last time Apple upgraded an iPod's firmware? (iPhone does not count, that was to stop the haxx0rz). I'm talking about updating the firmware just to make the experience better for the customer. Also the Zune software is prettier than iTunes.  Earphones- The packaged earphones are pretty good, but they happen to be too big for my ears and hurt. Obviously this is a personal problem. :P  Zune D-Pad vs iPod Click wheel- I can use my Zune with gloves on! Yay! Seriously though, I prefer the D-pad to the click wheel, if only because it feels like I have more control over it.   Zune Marketplace- Purchase DRM free music using Microsoft points (or real monies if you prefer). Actually own purchased songs! Yay! iTunes music has a DRM on it, meaning you can't do what you want with it. (Like putting it on a Zune, right? Right? I kid, I kid.)  So I guess that's it! Every bit of media I have is on my Zune, and I'm only about a third full!

<Content>We have all been turned into Zune lovers..have recently purchased the Red, Black, White and Pink..loved them all. Red could be less frosted as to not look "hot pink". Love the large screen for viewing pics, download time is next to nothing. Music is easily transfered, have it set to automatically rip any cd inserted. Transfer is fast, Charge holds forever. Seems like it is huge at first, but so light and really not as big as it seems. Fits comfortably anywhere. I wore it while waiting in the long check out lines in my jacket pocket and forgot where I put it. So really not bulky or heavy at all. Nothing but good things to say so far.

<Content>I absolutely love my Zune and I haven't really found anything that wasn't good about it except that when you charge it you have to have the Zune software open on your computer (but it isn't really that tedious, just charge it overnight so it's not in your way). An average charge lasts all day and I've never once had my Zune crap out on me while I was listening to it!  But, a note to people like me who usually turn their computers on Standby at night -- your zune won't charge if your computer's on Standby.  I give this product an A+++

<Title>Zune Doom
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased a Zune 30gb a little more than a month ago, and last night, it just stopped working.  Because the store where I purchased it isn't planning to get any more in (and now I know why), I had to call Microsoft to get them to repair or replace it.  Know how long that's going to take?  It will be 13-20 days for them to ship me the box, examine the player and repair or replace it.  And that doesn't include the time it will take to ship it back to me.    Upon calling them, it became clear that their biggest concern is customer fraud: they were very insistent to tell me that they would be checking to make sure the player wasn't dropped or have any kind of water damage, and they didn't tell me much else.  What kind of customer sevice is this??  As for the actual product, well, it has bugs aplenty, and appears to have some useless features, such as the wireless sync option, which does not work.  The fact that it does not come with a user guide was also disappointing, and it was pretty much hit and miss figuring out how many of the functions work (there is an online guide, but one has to click on the Help icon to see the link for it).  The battery life was also disappointing, as the specs indicate it will have power for 12 hours.  This was not my experience, as the battery life declined steadily until the fateful night that it stopped working altogether.  Also, I found out that the battery cannot be changed by the user, that the player must be sent to Microsoft.  Although the design and screen were lovely eye-candy, the player itself isn't worth the money, in my estimation.  My Creative Labs Zen mp3 player was not only easier to use, but I could change the battery myself.    Bottom line: Bad, bad choice for an mp3 player....

<Title>Great device...
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As an adult I figured it would be smart to research the MP3 field before I asked Santa for one for Christmas.  I'm glad I did.  I love my new Zune.  The price I got here was right-on!  Shipping was timely even though Santa waited to the last few days to ask the Elves to send it.    The original earbuds are too small for my ears, but I have tried a couple of mid-level replacements and have returned them as they are no better.  I am now awaiting the Bose in-ear set.  Hopefully these will be a better fit, and I can not blame Microsoft for that as, like I said the others were similar in fit.  The only thing I can say that is negative is about the software.  I expected, as an IT professional, for the software for a Microsoft device to be real simple, functional and intuitive.  I am not impressed thus far.  I have researched this and I am not alone in my opinion.  I am expecting a major update to come soon.  I hope so as this software work like a Beta product.  This why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.

The screen is amazing and the new firmware looks great. Video and music playback looks great.

<Title>This Zune is Great!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the 30GB Zune for my son for Christmas in Dec 2007. I was torn between the ipod and the Zune, but since my son had thousands of songs from his DVDs and MP3 collection which the ipod would not play, I went with the Zune. I was a little concerned by a number of the negative reviews about the Zune PC software.  But I was amazed.  I installed the software on both my Windows XP and my sons Windows VISTA and it was the easiest and fastest instal I have ever done. It installed flawlessly and it recognized the devise immediately, it recognized that a newer version of the Zune software was available and after checking with me it then unstalled it smothly and quickly with no intervention on my part.  It then asked me if I wanted to load MP3,JPEG, and video files from my compuer and allowed me to override or limit, then it synched up the files flawlessly and was ready to play.  The music was great and the large screen (twice the size of the ipod) looked fantastic.  Manuvering around and using the Zune was easy and fun.  If there were problems in the Zune software earlier, they appear to be fixed because everything was easy, smooth and worked great.  I highly recommend the Zune!  Apple better watch out because the new Zune clobers the ipod hands down.  I highly recommend it and I am going to get another for my other son!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>

Documentation and help section is very poorly put together.  Would have been nice for Microsoft to have made the unit work as a portable hard drive For the discounted price the Zune is a great mp3

The product was purchased at the end of November for a Christmas present once opened on Christmas and a week later would not hold a charge.  I contacted ACORR to let them know the product did not work properly and I was informed that becuase I purchased this product over 30 days ago there was nothing they would do to fix it.  I would agree if this was not purchased for a gift and would have no way to know if this worked until Christmas.  I will never purchase any product from this vendor again and feel that that they we not willing to provide any customer satisfaction.

<Title>Great Entry into the PMP market
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Microsoft's first foray into the digital music player realm is, in my experience, a great success. I got my Zune on sale, and it has since replaced my video iPod as my MP3 player of choice.  The first thing one notices about the Zune is that the screen occupies most of the space on the device's face. The 3" screen may seem like a small difference from the 2.5" screen of the video iPod, but the difference is very noticeable in practice! The software for the Zune, especially the 2.x software that Microsoft pushed down to the first-gen Zunes (giving them all the software features of the second-gen Zunes), is very tight and responsive, and looks great. While listening to music, all the information about the current track is prominently displayed, with the album art (if available) taking up the majority of the screen. One nice feature of the software is that I can enable and disable shuffle and repeat with just a few clicks while playing a track, as opposed to on the iPod, where I have to go back out to the main screen, then to Settings. The Zune is far more convenient in that regard.  The Zune supports podcasts with the 2.x update, though it still lacks audiobooks, which is a serious disadvantage to those who enjoy listening to literature. The built-in FM tuner is nice for when I'm walking the streets and feel like flipping over to NPR for a bit.  As it is, the Zune is a solid device. It's a good competitor to the iPod as-is, and well worth the money.

<Content>I love my zune. A little bulkier, but the interface is better than an Ipod. I have never really gotten used to the scroll wheel and the directional pad is great. Probably not an exercise device, but totally pocket-able.  The screen is huge and bright and I have watched several movies on plane trips without any problems, and the battery life is probably good enough for two+ movies on a single charge.  If you can find one of these for less than $100 I'd grab it. 30GB will be enough to store all of your music and the video playing is about as good as it gets for the price.

<Title> Zune and i-Pod owner
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune is great.  I bought the Zune to escape the monopolized i-Tune music source for i-Pod music.  It didn't present any problems in loading the software or the Zune with 4000+ pictures and 1200+ songs.  I recently plugged it in to charge and it synced with additional pictures and new music from Christmas without a hitch. The only message I received was do to the fact that I had hooked it into a multi USB port and that it might perform better being plugged in direct.    The directional wheel is much easier for a man's thumb to operate and the screen size enables you to see the Menu choices much easier. It's seems to have a good weight to it also feels like it's made with more quality and no need for "screen protectors".

<Title>The Zune is NOT difficult to use or install
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Okay, so when deciding to purchase this Zune I read this review on here about how this guy couldn't get the Zune to properly sync onto his computer.  I thought maybe I would have the same problem.  Turns out I didn't, and I guess the reason was I have a brain in my head.  This isn't rocket science people.  All you have to do is take the Zune from the packaging, connect it to the USB drive with the cable given, and load the CD that came with it.  There are step by step instructions that should prompt you.  The only problem I had syncing at first was my inane ability to follow the Wizard Install program for the new hardware detection.  Once I followed those instructions, everything worked fine. Now I can use my Zune and i know exactly what I'm doing.  The buttons are better than an iPod no stupid moving your hand over a wheel crap, and it's more user friendly.  Seriously, the one thing I really hated about the iPod was the wheel you use to go forward and back.  So if you want a player that has the chance of living longer, iPod fail rate is 1 in 100 or something like that while I think Zune is 1 in 3,000 or 5,000, then pick up the Zune.  Zune has proven to be a much better music player than my iPod.

The Zune software is much faster at ripping CD's than my old Microsoft software.  I put a couple of videos on the Zune, including the LSU-ARK Football game.  It converted the MP4 to WMV format, which I wish it would not have done, but that is OK.  The unit has a nice solid feel to it.  I use it when I work out and on the plane.    Looking at the price point versus the competition you can't go wrong.

<Title>Great hardware, miserable software!
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 30GB Zune is a great product which I was able to find at a great price (about $100 in brown--shop around).  The Zune itself is well-designed and easy to use.  I can't quite understand the choice to release it in brown, but it saved me $40 over the black model, so no complaints.  The hardware itself is simple and comparable to an iPod at a lower price.  There is also a world of accessories you can buy for the Zune, both made by Microsoft and other companies.  Microsoft has some nice, if overpriced, packages for cabling, car travel, etc.  Altec Lansing has a nice speaker system you can find for about $50 where you can drop the Zune in and play from it, using a remote control.  They have belt clips, long-life battery packs, FM transmitters, etc. The Zune comes fairly bare-bones, not even with an AC charger, so expect to pay extra for some of these accessories.  For all the variety, they can get pretty pricey.  You can check out the Zune boards to stay abreast of sales on Zunes and Zune accessories, and read about the latest products, etc.: http://www.zuneboards.com/  The main problem with the Zune, however, is not the cost of the accessories; it's the software.  It's pretty easy to use once your songs are set up, and syncing between your Zune and computer couldn't be easier (plug in a cable, start the software, and it does it for you).  However, getting the software to label your songs as you'd like and keep them that way is a nightmare. The software will not readily permit you to change the artist on an album once the album has already been burned.  It makes changing artist names on tracks and sometimes even genres or song titles horribly difficult, sometimes accepting the changes, sometimes not.  It will even make seemingly random changes, after you've spent a lot of time changing things to be just the way you'd like them to be.    If you're purchasing a 30GB Zune, chances are that you, like me, have a lot of music to put on there.  And you'd probably like to be able to easily organize and locate it.  The software will be a potentially insurmountable obstacle here.  I really like my Zune and I'm pretty savvy with computers, but I've been pounding my head against my computer screen with this software!  I will probably have to soon bite the bullet and call tech support.  I couldn't find any solutions online that helped, though I did see a LOT of posts from people who were frustrated with the software taking so much customization and being so difficult.  In truth, 80% of your music will be organized quickly and correctly with Zune's software, but the 20% remaining may be drive you mad...or toward the nearest iPod.

<Title>Great device better with upgrade
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had to write a review ever since Microsoft came out with their latest firmware update.  I was already a huge fan of the device.  The large screen, and simple interface was my motivation for wanting this in the first place.  The firmware update made the interface even better and also provided additional stability over the earlier version.  The provided headphones are ok, but not as good as the ones that come with the accessory pack.  Definitely fork out the change for the kit or buy a nice set of headphones.  Pros - Great interface with large font for menus - Built-in FM radio is a benefit I hadn't wanted until I started to use it - Besides the FM feature, having pictures, videos, and music in one device is great - Great screen!!  Watching a movie in a bus/train/plane is very easy on the eyes, although the arm gets a little tired. Small and very sturdy feeling.  Feels like it can take a beating  Cons - I wish the wireless feature worked without any limitations.  It would be so great to be able to use it more.  I just shut it off to conserve battery since I'll never have a need for it.  The wireless sync is no easier than plugging it in via USB - The desktop software is better with the new version but still pretty sluggish if you have a large music library.  It can be frustrating at times. - The EQ settings are pretty weak and offer very little/noticeable improvement.  A custom EQ would be great.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and I've owned the 30GB model for more than a year.  It's selling for a great price, but if you have the money, you may want to opt for the 80GB model.  The interface is the same, but the controls are nicer.  The only limitation I've had with the 30GB model is the number of movies I can load up.  Since I already have a huge music/photo collection.

<Content>This was the best price on the net period, easy to use a little thick for my taste but is 30 GB so that compensates. I really like the Zune much more than the Ipod classic, i have yet to tried the new touch but at 16gb for 4 times more i dont think so. I hope MS make something with a querty keyboard and wi fi and they'll have me hooked. This has radio, video, photos and audio that at least one better than apple. The scrolling feature of the other MP4 players is the one thing is lacking you have to press up or down to move you cant use the middle botton as a scroll wheel, that probably is a 2nd gen feature.

<Title>Great deal at $99
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this from Dell for their $99 price which included shipping.  Originally this was for only the brown version, but Dell ran out and substituted a white model which was nice.  I'm running the v2.3 firmware and I have the latest version of the Zune software.  I've had no sync problems.  The software is excellent and it's easy to manage my CD collection.  I have zero complaints about this product, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $200 price people are asking.   Pros: 1. Zune Software is easy to use 2. Zune UI is easy to use 3. Music quality is good 4. Wireless sync now works 5. Seems to be well made Cons: 1. A bit bulky 2. No auto rotate feature on the videos (doesn't auto-sense like an iPod phone). 3. Supplied earbuds are not that great (iPod owners complain of the same issue).  I got this as a Christmas present.  I liked it so much, I got two.  What I like best is that this simply does what it's supposed to do.  It's simple.  It was also a bargain.  I use it with an Altec Lansing docking station and that's also very nice.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQLPZE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Altec Lansing M604 Powered Audio System for Zune</a>.

<Title>Great Value!!
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased three of these through other retailers for about $100 average. When you take a look at the Apple Competitor (ipod video) that goes for $250  you can really see why this product is getting more and more popular. The first versions really needed updates to the software which I have to say took a while to come out but now that version 2.0 is out and fully tested I really like a lot of the new features. Only think I would really like to see is a more user friendly version of the song library software, and support for flac format. Despite this I still give it 5 stars. 30 GB, Wireless, plays video good sound quality... it's a winner.

<Title>holds you hostage just like the ipod
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zune itself is great. Easiest interface i have ever used, great idea to include wireless zune to zune connection. The problem is that The bulk of my music came from yahoo music jukebox. Well the zune doesnt support that one type of specific file, so i am out of luck. I have a creative zen sleek, and i plan on getting the new creative zen. DEFINITELY SENDING THE ZUNE BACK.  p.s. I cant even figure out how to get video onto the zune unless you buy it from the zune "marketplace". Whatever.

<Title>Works well, better than a Video Ipod
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I already have a 30GB apple Ipod when I received this as a gift and I am pleasently surprised at how well it works. The only advantage which the Ipod has is that it is physically smaller (although not lighter), but the user interface of the zune is significantly better with the large font much easier to read. The use of the more normal (i.e. not clickwheel) controls giving better control than the Ipod. I say this after having use an Ipod for almost four years and the zune for about 4 days. I was surprised that microsoft paid as much attention as it did when you switch between different menus. The transitions are done well, and the structure is intuitive. I had no problems in loading up the zune software with vista home premium and found it to be just as useable and easy to use as itunes with an ipod (which I run on a seperate mac.)  I am not sure what the problems other people have seen as none existed when I ran and synched my zune for the first time. I am now quite happy to give my old Ipod to my wife and use a better product.

<Title>Vista users beware! Software update does NOT work well
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Without typing up a long statement, I bought it for a christmas present this year. I was going to pre-load it with media, but I was never allowed to. Why? First, the sync cable refused to operate properly. A call to Zune's customer support line "fixed" this. They were more than willing to send out a new sync cable...which after 12 business days, still has not arrived.  So I run out and find an original zune sync cable in a store. Zune would pick up a charge, but still wouldn't sync up. So, I call customer support back and basically get the troubleshooting steps in the box.   I go to their support page, scour the message boards for solutions (seemed as if every 3rd post was a problem like mine). Nothing works. Now, luckily, I am very familiar with computers, so going into the device manager isn't nothing new. But, it had me thinking...what about a dad who just knows how to turn on and off a computer? Why is this process difficult for someone like him?   Long story short, there is a vista conflict that makes it so zunes would not properly sync up. It maybe has been fixed since my purchase of a few weeks ago, but I wouldn't assume the best.   Worst customer service experience though. I would have rated this one star, but I do like the design. Haha.

<Title>Microsoft Zune 30GB
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got a brand new Microsoft Zune for Christmas. Only got to use it about 3 times before it stopped working. My wife also bought me all kinds of accessories to go with it. So, we have a lot of money invested in it. Apparently, there is a flaw in how the carrying case is made, and it makes it seem like you need to insert the power adapter into to port upside down. The port is not made in a shape that rejects the incorrect plug in, so the result is bent prongs on the port. Microsoft will not replace. I am out about $300.

<Title>Be Patient when setting this up the first time...it's worth it!.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Some end users have experienced an "issue" with their Zune when they first try to use it....including yours truly...all I can say is...Patience, Patience, Patience...the Zune IS worth it.  Not all Zunes have an initial "issue" with the battery not charging and the screen freezing, if yours does....it is a very MINOR issue and is easily corrected as I mention below.  First, I bought the Brown 30GB for my husband as a Christmas present this year (2007) instead of an iPod for several reasons, but mainly because: it has an FM radio; was on sale (the brown was much lower priced than the other colors the day I bought it off Amazon...it's a cool chocolate brown with a green tint to the case); and because I did not want to fall into the whole iPod craze (I'm not a big fan of Appleand have been a Microsoftcustomer for over 20 years)....we are both VERY glad I went with the Zune.  Secondly, to save you the frustration of having to search the Internet for a solution to the minor, yet irritating issue with the battery, like I had...THE main thing I must recommend for a relatively smooth install...BE PATIENT...Do NOT connect your NEW Zune to your computer until after you install the Zune software FIRST (which is what Microsoft recommends). I would also suggest downloading the newest version off the Zune software/firmware site from Microsoft (version 2.3 or higher) because with the 2.3 update, Microsoft apparently corrected an issue with the battery not wanting to charge correctly and the screen freezing, which is what ours was doing when I first tried to charge it (software update:  [...] ). After I UNINSTALLED the old version and installed the update...the Zune worked perfectly and has continued to do so. Note: For some odd reason, installing the CD version and clicking the "Check for Updates" did not install the 2.3 version, so, do a complete download off the URL above.  I would also recommend that you RESIST pressing the power button when you first take it out of the box because it would have very little power and could get stuck on a screen with an exclamation point inside an illustration of a battery (which is easily fixed if it does happen because this is what happened with ours) and instead, begin charging your Zune....either from a USB 2.0 port on the BACK of your PC or with the AC adapter that comes with the travel pack. If you use the USB port, be sure to install the software first. Also, Do NOT try charging it with an external USB Hub even if the hub has its own power, which is what I initially did try; this method didn't work well enough to charge the Zune effectively. You should let your Zune fully charge for 3 hours prior to using it.  Because I did not download the software/firmware update first, (I used the supplied CD) I actually needed to let the Zune battery completely drain two or three times because the screen would get stuck, first showing an illustration of a battery with an exclamation point, then when the illustration showed a battery with a plug....I simply unplugged the Zune and left it sitting on my desk with whatever illustration was on the screen until the screen went blank (a few hours). This happened when I used the CD software that was supplied with the Zune (the CD part number 1006 X12-6319303). After I installed version 2.3 off the Zune/Microsoft site (version 2.3 - 1145), there were no more issues with the battery not charging.  If you experience any other "issues"....this site might be helpful: [...]  The FM Radio works great!...and the overall sound of the music is simply wonderful. You can adjust the sound in the Settings using the equalizer feature.  I have been using the Zune Marketplace (via the Zune software) to purchase and download songs, which has worked extremely well. I initially bought 4000 points ($[...]) which applies toward the purchase of individual songs or complete albums. Basically, the songs are 79 cents a piece...very reasonable. The Zune also comes with a mix of some pics and songs pre-installed.  In a nutshell, it is my honest opinion that the Zune is a much better value than an iPod and I would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to purchase a digital media player.

<Title>Great hardware; HORRIBLE software.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased a 30gb Zune on amazon for an unbelievable price (less than $60 shipped brand new!!!) and received it early december.  Here are my thoughts after nearly a month of ownership.  The actual player is great.  I mean truly excellent.  I feel that it is very well made and has a beautiful screen.  It is also very versatile with podcast support, video support (I probably watch just as much video as I listen to music) and wifi sharing.  For those wondering, MS has stated that games are on the way!  Overall, I much, much prefer my zune over my buddies IPOD video.  The IPOD video screen is just too small for me to watch video.  I'm not an audiophile, but I think the music is pretty even sounding between the two.  Better quality earbuds help a lot in this area.  So if I love it so much, why only 4 stars???  The Zune software is truly, truly HORRIBLE.  I mean, to the point where it feels like a beta horrible.    I am not really heavy into music organization and even I think that the zune software can't organize music correctly to save its life.  It will randomly sort songs and assign album art.  It will also randomly split apart albums based on god knows what.  There is no way to easily tag music in the zune software itself.  It needs to be done with 3rd party software and maybe the zune will accept the changes.  Creating playlists is also needlessly difficult.  You cant sort playlists (that I can find anyway) so how you put them in is how you are going to hear them.  A real PITA when you are creating a TOP 40 playlist and cant sort by their position on the countdown.  You also can not sort video AT ALL.  Yes, you are going to have to scroll through your entire video collection to find what you want.  There are also people reporting massive software failure (see zune.net).  I have fortunately not experienced anything of the sort.   The good news is that software can be fixed and the zune team has promised patches to fix most of the issues reported (here's hoping).  They seem to be dedicated to getting this done right.  So would I recommend the zune?  Well yes and no.  I think that the zune is a great value at a price point of around 100 dollars.  For 150 and up, I would say wait to see if MS makes good on its promise to fix its busted software before purchase.  My first review here... hope someone found it helpful.

<Title>One of the best items I have ever recieved
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Over this past holiday season I was lucky enough to recieve a new 30GB Zune. I must say for the week and a half I have had it it has not let me down at all. It was one of the most amazing items I have to this day. The screen shows clear images and movies. It plays all of my favorite movies and clips. Getting the music, videos, and pictures on the device was very easy; the software almost did it for you. The Zune is very easy to use as well. I love my new Zune and I have run in to no problems at all. Infact my cousin is having more problems with her Ipod. Which at first I believed to be a better product until I was able to compare them through use. If I had a choice whether to get the Zune or Ipod by far I would chose the Zune.

The Zune marketplace never works... so forget an interface life that could match the iTunes. I would have appreciated a list of pains with the software before. As far as the music play and video is concerned, its pretty good. A lot bulky though. I guess they need to be a lot more aggressive in making it as popular as the pod.

<Title>love my zune
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I opted for the Zune 30 over the Zune 80 because I'm hard on my toys and I needed something that will tolerate me occaisionally dropping it or tossing it into my purse that doubles as a briefcase and general catchall.  So far, so good.  I've been learning on the fly because I refuse to read a manual and I haven't gotten stuck yet. It seems as simple as anything else I've tried - truly plug and play with the basics. I haven't gotten onto the Zune "Social", but if it's nearly as uncomplicated as the rest, it's more than worth the price. My only caution is it comes bare bones (no headphones, sync cables, etc.) so be prepared to shell out extra or seek out a bundle when purcasing. I found a sync cable that came with a car charger/wall charger which works out for my needs just fine for now.

<Title>Truly Terrible Software Design
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My expectations were fairly low, I just want an MP3 jukebox to use in my car and with my stereo receiver. So... the sofware crashed a few times on installation.  It did sync my files, but many albums/folders won't play correctly, edit correctly, and it's not because of copyright protections. I suspect I have to re-organize and dummy things down for the Zune to get to play folders properly.  Otherwise it's OK, but if you use a computer based mp3 player like WinAmp, working with Zune is like playing ping pong with the village idiot. The interface does not run smoothly on your desktop, it repeatedly hangs-ups and I'm talking about running it on XP, SR2.  I have to say it's very disappointing to see a company like MSFT put out a product that seems 3-4 years behind the curve software-wise. Yikes!

<Title>The Zune... its good.
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is cleverly conceived.  Sure, it's a LOT like the ipod, but lets be honest... what other kinds of designs are there that are easy to use and easy to control, and manipulate?  To stray too far away from a similar design would be to try to reinvent something that already works..... very well might I add.  The zune does not have a spin-your-thumb-to-scroll interface, but it does have a click-button-to-scroll and hold-down-to-go-fast option.. I enjoy that better, I can select the music I want faster and with more precision.   I enjoy that all versions of the Zune are compatible with eachother so far, and I hope that doesn't change.  The Zune sync software is incredibly easy and user-friendly, itunes is very clunky and very hard to figure out (my 400gb music collection lags my computer down hard, where the zune software loads quickly and smoothly)  The radio feature is pretty amazing.  The one downfall is the lack of licensed products for the Zune, you cant just goto the dollar general and pick up a dock like you can for the ipod, but that does ensure quality, when you do find something that connects to your zune, you know it will work for real and not just for a few hours.  I have heard of problems like the Zune randomly turning off and such, and my mom has had it happen twice, each after she listened to it for 8 hours at a time.  So it might be battery related, and It might not be.  Who knows.  I have yet to have that be an issue.  The sound quality is very good and the earbuds that come with it are pretty decent too.  I highly recommend the Zune, there are peripherals for it just like the ipod, but you just have to order them from the internet mostly; though Office-Depot does carry a Zune Dock Stereo system.

<Title>Terrible software, exceedingly fragile
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Zune at the beginning of December. I installed and used the Zune software (which is extremely inferior to iTunes), then had to download a separate ID3 tagging program to make everything show up properly (with compilation albums, you would either have 1 album with all artists being Various Artists or 25 different albums with different artists.   The real kicker, however, is that after 2 weeks the LCD cracked. The outer casing, however, is fine. I had my iPod for a year and knocked it around numerous times without a hitch. I had the Zune for two weeks, never dropped it or anything, and now the screen's pretty much unviewable. The worst part is that it's not covered under Microsoft's warranty. Great.  Most of my friends have older MP3 players and are looking to upgrade. I'll be making sure to dissuade them from choosing the Zune.

<Title>I'm Happy with my Zune
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I decided on the Zune 30Gig unit primarily based on the very attractive price and the capability to wirelessly synch.  I bought it to replace a large CD changer on my Stero system.  So far so good; I am really happy with it.  It was easy to set up and synch with my music and digital still photo collection.     I have it interfaced with my receiver and TV using the Zune dock and remote.  This works nicely for listening to the music collection while watching slides.    There are some things that don't work as I expected.  And you have to figure them out by trial an error because the operation manual is not very detailed.  One thing I discovered is that the wireless networking is disabled when the NTSC video output option is enabled.  So you can't control the sync operation via the Zune remote because you can't see the options on the TV.  And I haven't been able to figure out how to initiate the synch operation from the PC.  You seem to have to initiate the sync from the Zune device.  It automatically connects to the wireless network, synchronizes the collection and playlists from the PC and then disconnects from the network.  It would be nice to be able to initiate a synch session from the PC.  In my opinion, Zune support software on the PC also leaves a bit to be desired.  It doesn't have all the functionality of MS Media Player; I find that strange.  In an effort to make it very simple to use (I guess), it operates differently from most other Windows applications.  But other than these minor shortcomings my experience with the Zune has been very good.

<Content>Both my sister and my dad now have matching Zune players; I am planning on purchasing one as well. I have played with both and heard their reviews of the product. What I have determined is that the hardware is incredible for the price. I was shocked at the screen quality! Unfortunately, there are some glitches with the software, however, it is manufactured by Microsoft and they are constantly updating. The social share feature is relatively worthless as you can only transfer three songs at a time which only last for three days. My opinion, though, is buy it. Microsoft is selling the hardware cheap to compete with Apple's ipod and the software is bound to improve relatively soon.

<Content>Ok.  This isn't the new Zune, it's the old one.  But for the 89 bucks price tag we paid during the pre Christmas sale, the 30G will hold all of my music and all of my pictures.  We are very happy.  The only drawback so far is the FM transmitter needed to listen to the Zune on our car stereo has terrible reviews, so we are doing without.

<Title>Stock up on Tylenol if you buy this...
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 10 year old son got the Zune for Christmas from Santa.  I had nothing but problems from the get go.  After 7 hours and three calls to Tech Support (which were friendly and didn't keep me on hold much) the device completely locked up and I was instructed to wait 3-5 business days to get the box to send it in for repair.  Add 3-5 more for it to reach them, 10-15 for the repair to be completed, and then 3-5 for it to come back.  Throw in a couple of weekends and it's nearly a month until my son can use his defective product.  I took it back to the store where we bought it and we got an I-pod instead.  After 2 hours he was watching videos and we had installed most of his CDs.    The software was horrible.  There was no manual for use included, nor was there any documentation on line.  Very few songs were in the Zune Marketplace - you had to go to outside sources and then try to download them into the Zune software.  I couldn't even get it to work with Windows Media Player made by Microsoft.  Tech Support was unable to get it to work either - whether that was a software problem or ultimately a problem with our device I do not know.    As this was our first portable player ever, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I thought I would be safe and happy with a product that had the Microsoft name on it.  I could not have been any more disappointed.

<Title>Do not purchase a refurbished unit
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product was purchased as a christmas gift and was a real disappointment when the software that was included did not allow the unit to sync.  Sync is the process which allows media to be downloaded from the PC or laptop to the Zune unit.  I installed the software on both a desktop PC as well as a laptop PC and the result was the same in that the Zune was never detected by the PC.  Both of these PC's are running microsoft windows XP.   Bottom line is that the Zune is not useable which is an extreme disappointment especially for a child who had hoped to receive this for christmas.  Therefore, BEWARE when you purchase refurbished electronics as software is tricky and if not up to date can cause problems.  I will never purchase refurbished again.

<Content>My 16 y/o son got this for Christmas this year and absolutely loves it. It did take a while to get the software to load, but we were forewarned that may be the case, so no worries there. He loves the big screen that goes horizontal when the zune is turned. I love the fact that I was able to get him 30, count them 30 Gig for 130.00 instead of a measly 4 gig had we gone with the nano. There's no question, and NOT just for the money, the zune rocks!

<Title>ZUNE review
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Could not believe the price.  Thought I would get it AFTER christmas, but got it in 20 days of ordering.  My kids told me it was last years model, but it still has all the bells and whistles.  They love it!  I wish I had ordered more for my other kids.  TWO Zunes for less than the price of a new one today. Only one problem.  One of my daughters set her's up at home with dial-up internet.  Took a while, but no problems.  My other daughter set her's up using high speed wireless internet at college.  It WOULD NOT set up.  She came home and used the dial-up and was up and running in a few hours.  Sure dial-up took longer, but it worked.  I still need to ask the girls about the wireless capacity of their Zunes.  I hope they tried it out!

<Title>Good hardware, bad software
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently got a 30 Gb zune for Christmas and have encountered numerous situations both good and bad. The Zune itself is a nice little player, it looks great with a very easy to use system. The sound quality is good, the option to set pictures as a background is always fun, and the screen is beautiful. The only downside is microsofts annoying habit of including vital system operations in the memory, so you actually only get approximately 29.5 Gb, no big deal. All in all this looks like a great little device, but as soon as you connect to your PC (and you must) it turns devilish.  The first thing you may notice is that as soon as its plugged in, either to charge or to set music, you can't listen to it. While plugged in it is completely useless. Sure, I can overlook this feature. Then you start with the software, holy cow the software.   The Zune software will have to update itself about a zillion times before you can use it. Then when its ready to use, you must 'sync' anything you want with your Zune. Of course this process is imperfect specifically if you're trying to re-sync something for the purposes of organization. Of course the worst part is the complete inability to organize your own collection. The Zune probably takes pride in doing this for you, unfortunately pride is only one of its sins.   It can't seem to get any albums or artists right, particularly if its from any source other than zune marketplace. The result is lots of songs organized under "unknown artist" or "various artists" when you know there's only one artist and who it is. Then it will probably break up your album into 5 or 6 "unknown albums" and assign it an arbitrary cover art from some other place in the software. Finally, the coup de grace, you can't manually input album or artist information for individual songs. So, you're finally stuck with either tons of unknowns or grouping them into awkward groups that don't have anything to do with each other.  Unfortunately, this makes the clever menu system on the Zune itself completely bogged down with tons of random and incorrect information. You have to wade through the forest of menu to reach the correct "unknown album" for you particular song.  Typical microsoft: Good hardware, terrible software. Its too bad, cause I really liked the thing initially.

<Content>What a great deal on a great competitor to the over-priced iPod.  Although the product was priced for shipping after Christmas, it arrived two weeks early!! How often does that happen?!?  Microsoft is continuing to work out the remainder of the quirks with protected media, but I think that will be solved soon.

<Title>in love
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm so in love with my Zune. I got the NYLON special edition, featuring sweet decals of drawn diamonds on the exterior. I really can't get over my Zune and feel the need to let everyone know. This pink color is so nice, and the NYLON design makes it even better. The size of the screen is perfect, video clear, and it allows you to view things widescreen like the iPod Touch. Unlike the iPod, the Zune allows you to really show off the system's aesthetic beauty with gorgeous graphic design. You can select your own home screen background picture, and choose between the 78 NYLON covers given on this edition free. Not only does the NYLON edition come with free pictures, but free videos and songs. I had no problems with the software and can't get over how pleasing to the eye the graphic design is. ITunes definitely does not compare, and the Zune Marketplace is a lot better, in my opinion. Along with looking good and having great artists, the Zune Marketplace has a picture gallery, a bio, and other features of each artist. Plus, a song is only 79 cents! The only thing I don't like about the software is that there isn't a "Recently Played" or "Just Added" playlist, which iTunes has and I found useful.  I don't use the social wi-fi thing, but I don't really mind. I think the radio feature is amazing. You have access to radio and the song name and artist shows up.   To sum this all up, the NYLON Zune is one of the greatest things I've ever bought because of its aesthetic beauty, functionality, big crisp video and images, great sound, and overall coolness. I won't stop letting people know it. When I showed one of my friends my new buy, his response was "...Maybe I shouldn't have bought my new iPod.."

<Title>Nice... but
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first portable media player, before i used to play media in my iPaq, but i the experience was not too good. I just have it since a few days ago and i like it, the sound and the video are good and it have tv output and that is something i like, but there are a few things wrong with it, first installing the zune software to get it recognized with a nightmare, i spent several hours to get the firmware updated and it synchronizing to my computer, after this initial issue got solved i have not have more problems with synchronization while connected with the usb cable, but i have not been able to synchronize it wirelessly, it recognize the network but for some reason when i try the synchronization it doesn't works.  I hope in next firmware updates this get some kind better.  I am still like it, because i love to been able to listen anywhere a good part of my music collection and to watch some videos and tv shows on it.

<Content>I hated the Zune! I tried to use it for a few days and was not happy a all. It would not download songs from the Zune Martketplace.  It would not tell me how to get them to download. It only told me to go to some forum and post all of the infomation about my zune.  I was not going to do that. I just bought the stupid thing already it wasn't going to work right!  So, I have already returned the Zune and bought an Ipod instead.  MUCH EASIER!!  Very happy with the Ipod!  I did not have the patience for the Zune.  Maybe if I was more tech savvy it would not have been so bad.  I just want something I can download songs to easily and not have any problems. Not the case with the Zune.              Good Luck!

<Title>Hoping to get my money back
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received a 30 Gig Zune back in early July. It was the greatest toy I'd had in 20 years. I raved about how much fun it was. I spent weeks perfecting the music and pictures I wanted on it. I loved it. It was easy to use, easy to update and change, easy to search for music buried in my large files... And then... just in November, I happily downloaded the NEW generation Zune software and it absolutely ruined everything. I can't even imagine what Microsoft was thinking. Why would they destroy this product? The new software is a terrible, terrible, terrible train wreck. The entire Zune project department should be fired. My Zune is now a $200 piece of junk. And there are chat rooms full of people saying exactly the same thing. You can't even get technical help. The Zune won't update. The music and pictures are all wrong. The meager instructions that appear when you plug in the Zune are indecipherable and unhelpful. For example, there is an inexplicable icon to click --if you feel lucky or daring-- that says "Forget this device." That is exactly what I plan to do--forget my device. Luckily, I bought an extended warranty with it in July, and now intend to seek a full refund.

After 3 hours of trying to work through error messages (not enough space on computer....it's brand new!) and get the Zune to respond, I then spent another hour on the phone with Tech support.  Sorry, no fix...so in 10-15 days, I will supposedly get a 'new' one.....we shall see!  I see if I can gonow and cheer up the very disappointed teenager!

<Title>Lacking, Lacking, Lacking.  And that's the Good Part.
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'll begin by saying up front "It's not an iPod" and leave it at that.  I won't go on about how many features should have been like an iPod... it's a Zune.  Now, considering this thing fresh and without prejudice... The Device itself is good, as good as the Zen or Lyra, but the software support is absolutely hideous.    Viewed as a "system" (both hardware and software) it significantly misses the mark.  I agree with others, I *wanted* to like this thing, but can't get past the extremely limited software interface.  You *cannot edit tags*, such as adding your own artwork to each track.  The software natively rips CD's into DRM .wma files.  It adds tags to my .mp3 music - tags that could be used to identify my home computer, for what purpose?  To make MP3 collection more traceable I suppose.  Did I ask it to do that?  The documentation is sparse.  This is not because it's 'so simple to use' that you won't need documentation.  It is fairly simple to download the software, install, and start using.  It'll scan your music, pictures, and videos and want to add them to it's "music library".  Oh yeah, it'll also want to make itself the *default* music player of your mp3's.  It'll create this rather confusing and difficult to sort/navigate matrix of album cover thumbnails.  It'll download and write tags into your existing MP3 files as to how to *purchase* these very tracks from the Microsoft Marketplace.  Hum... let's see... how to buy my own music?  Wow!  Thanks Microsoft!  Overall, this thing tries to be an iPod and fails miserably.  Yes, the screen is bigger and brighter.  But No, the navigation is clunky - no scroll wheel.  The lack of MP3 Tag modifications makes sorting of anything more than a few dozen albums a complete nightmare.  Yes, the FM feature is really nice.  I'll be using it when I can't find my own music on the Zune.  Yes, having it communicate with the XBOX360 is cool.  No, it won't bluetooth or communicate with a non-Microsoft product.  Where it not for the tens of millions in research and development by Microsoft to create the 'iPod killer', I would think this product were just a bad joke.  But it is not.  An amateurish attempt - without consideration of what is happening in the world of digital music.  We spent the $180, got the Zune and the 2nd MP3 player of the house, and discover it's just not worth it.  Next time around, I'll live with the slightly smaller screen and get another iPod.
