<Title>Upgrade from Micro Zen
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First let me say this, no subscription service Apple, no dice.  I want a choice and ITunes does not cut it.  I really don't care how "popular" and "cool" it is to have an Ipod.  I owned one and after using subscription music services I won't go back.  I have used my Zen Micro with Napster and Yahoo Music Service, both are excellent.    Decided to upgrade to the new Vision:M and I must say Creative has done a wonderful job.  The user interface is improved, mostly due to a larger color screen.  All 4 buttons are now real buttons, not a touch pad.  They also added Forward and Reverse buttons on the side of the scroll bar.  Addition of accessory port on the bottom is a huge plus, even though there are not many devices yet.  Battery life is very much improved, watched 2 hour video and listened to 3 hours of WMA protected files and still had half the battery life.    Software could be improved, Creative needs an all in one solution.  I had to use third party programs to download album art and convert video for the player.    Video looked great.  On the down side, dongle required for USB and charger.  There should be more accessories available in a few more months and I would like to see better cable options for video and audio output.

<Title>Great Player, A good choice.
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>  I would first off love to say that I respect apple and the ipods are great. But, when a better product comes along lose the fanboyish attitude and open your eyes. THough its all based on opinion. Anyway the Zen vision:m is an amazing player. Its got a beautiful screen and amazing video quality. The navigation system is quite interesting and takes a couple of days to master. Its touch pad is sensitive making scrolling easy. ALso in my opinion its a sleek player. The smooth black with the white backplate is elegant. Also, the blue lit buttons add to the effect. The earbuds were comfortable and the audio quality and the amount of sound impresses me. It is bigger than a 60g ipod but I have become used to the feel of 3rd generation ipods and this one feels comfortable in my hand. The software was basic enough and I found it easy to use. Also what I like about this player is the ability to set backrounds. I don't know if the ipod does it but this is one of those little features that I have come to love.   A note to those who like to make the ipod and non-ipod arguments like its life and death. Calm down creative has been making jukebox ipods before apple and ironiclly holds the patent for the touch technology for the two. Also there mp3 players generally recieve positive reveiws. Its all opinion, this is a place to review not to bash things.

<Title>Wonderful except for the touch pad
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After having done about 20 hours of Internet research and then going to a vairety of electronic stores, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision M (Black) because of its features and sound clarity. This is my first MP3/Multimedia device, and I am amazed with how easy it is to "rip" CD's and video. I strongly recommend this one for beginners because its variety of  features, including using it as a "flash drive".  The video playback is as good as any newer computer monitor or the handheld TVs which have recently come on the market. It is much better than the Portable Play Station.  However, and here is why I gave it 4 stars, the touch pad and button controls are extremely hard to get used to. The first thing a new user needs to do is change the sensitivity from "high" to "low". This is no easy feat because the instruction booklet, at least the English version that I got here in Tokyo, does not do a good job at all of explaining how to use the pad. It was very annoying and frustrating to learn that to go from the vertical menus to the horizontal menus that I did not need to tap the pad, just glide my finger over to the left or right. Even now, I have not figured out how to use the keyboard to input my name into the owner information.  Honestly, Creative could have come up with a much better designed touch pad and button system. If this were a first generation MP3, or if touch pads were a new item, this one's problems would be acceptable; however, since this is not a first generation concept, what were they thinking?   I asked a few friends and family members to try it out and they said they would not purchase it until the touch pad is improved.  For me, and I am the principle user, I hope that I will get used to it and figure out how to use it. In the meantime, I'll just do without using the keyboard.  Of course, I must learn how to navigate between menus.    The touch pad aside, the battery life, the picture and sound quality, the voice recorder, the FM radio, the organizer, and the really easy way to load music and video make this a pretty good product.

<Content>I just bought one for my brother in France. It is really cool! Smart screen and amazing video quality. But some concern comes to the adapter. As Amazon's description says, 'Power Adapter with 2 interchangable plugs'. But there is only one US plug in my box. I thought there should be another EU plug. Have I missed sth or I got this missing-part box from amazon unluckily? Feel free to contact me kangtong61@gmail.com

<Title>The Amazing Mp3/Video player 
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an amazing gadget. After waiting for more than a month, (I just got it today) I couldn't believe how innovative this toy is. Indeed great things come to those who wait. 262K Screen, beautiful if you see it for yourself. You can view photos while listening to your music, which has great sound quality. And the customizable wallpaper is an awesome extra. Support to multiple video format is fantastic. And I won't get stuck to using iTunes.  I just had to adjust on how to handle the touchpad, quite annoying at first but you can adjust to it pretty quickly. This is not even available in our country yet, and Ipods are abundant here but the only reason they are selling better is due to the good marketing strategy of Apple. Well, I'm a smart buyer and I won't buy to marketing alone. Overall, regardless of the minor issues, this is a great buy. Try it. Ipod is great too, but this one's greater!

<Title>Great player but set touchpad sensitivity to low
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This a great player.  Buyers might be put off by the touchpad the Zen uses because its so unwieldy to use at first but just know its the same technology laptops use with their touchpads except this one is shaped like an oval that's up on its end.  But as another review mentioned, one of the first things you should do is change the sensitivity of the touchpad to 'low'.  A touchpad on **normal** sensitivity setting is great for navigating a big laptop screen but for the Zen's relatively tiny screen (great screen btw) you'll be all over the place.  But trust me once you buy this player, one of the first things you should do is to set the sensitivity of the touchpad to low.  Everything I've tried with this mp3 player is great, good interface, fast, long battery life, the Zen is just very well designed.  Although the interface/buttons on the player are good, there is a little bit of a learning curve to figure out what all the buttons do but with some practice and consulting the user manual (which is kind of meh in my opinion), it can be mastered in a few hours.  BTW, don't get the Toshiba Gigabeat mp3 player.  Its a total piece of crap compared to this.  I bought the Gigabeat, found out it **couldn't** play mp3's compressed at 64kbs, 44khz (even though the product description AND the user manual says it can).  I'm returning that POS.  But the silver lining is that I would have never discovered the Zen if I hadn't tried out the sorry Gigabeat.

<Title>I love this MP3 player
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research before I ended up buying the creative zen vision m.  After my research it came between the iaudio and the zen vision m. I didn't even consider the ipod video since these two players had better video quality play back then the ipod video.  They also had more features and more formats when it came to video.   I ended up getting the zen vision m because for 30 bucks more I thought it was great having the extras.  The audio is great, and video playback is great.  What I love the most about it is that I can click and drag my video files into my zen vision m not having to convert it first.  The only thing is that I wish battery would last longer.  I've read reviews that made the zen vision m seem really big, but in all honesty it is bigger than the ipod video but it can easily fit in your pocket.

<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M is an excellent player.  I prefer Windows Media Player to iTunes, so I'm glad there is an alternative to Apple.  The Creative software that comes with the player is very good for those people not in love with Windows Media Player.  The sound and video is of the best quality I've seen in any player.  The controls and usability are of the greatest design. I highly recommend the Zen Vision:M

<Title>Same as iPod, but more versatile
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a 60GB Ipod video for x-mas, and almost opened it, until I read that this was coming down the pike. After a bit of inverstigating, I realized, that I would be spending a lot of time converting video to have it run on the Ipod, but that wouldn't be the case with the Vision:M.  To get video from my Tivo to my Vision:M is a breeze. Only 1 very quick conversion is needed using DirectShow Dump (about 2-3 minutes per 1/2 hour of video) to strip the Tivo code and leave a plain MPEG-2 file that can be viewed on the device.  The screen is phenomenal. It's why I got this instead of the original Zen Vision (I wanted the bigger screen, but heard lots of bad things about the Zen Vision's screen).  Album art works pretty well, but not great.  The headphones, I thought, were pretty darn good, but I upgraded anyway b/c I had the $$$ available.  It's does everything I wanted/needed a device like this to do. I have a few complaints though:  - THERE ARE NO ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR THIS THING!!!! - 30GB goes quickly with 192kbps MP3 files, and video and pictures. - some videos build audio sync problem as time progresses, but this is easily corrected with a quick Pause/Play. - it scratches just as easily as the Ipod, so do yourself a favor and order an Invisible Shield at the same time. - the little adapter is a bit of a pain as I'm probably going to have to order at least one more to be my "travel adapter".

<Title>Wish I'd bought a video Ipod
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Vision:M is a decent little player - except for the "little" part.  30GB for a video/mp3 unit is not enough, especially when the Video IPOD offers 60GB - 2x the drive space - for $50 more.  After loading my average size song collection of 15GB, my Vision M has only enough room for about 2 - 3 hours of MPEG-2 (TIVO) video.     Creative would have been better off leaving out the seldom used FM and digital dictation functionality, and putting a properly sized hard drive to serve the core MP3/Video purpose.

<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Allright, I don't normally review things I buy, but I think the purchase of a good music player is important to everyone's mental health so I'll consider this my good deed to the world for the day...BUY THIS THING!  Everybody is looking for different things in their mp3 players.  Here is my situation - I decided to switch from minidisc to mp3 because I have a huge music collection and I wanted to be able to take it all with me wherever I go.  I was one button click away from buying a 30 gb ipod when I saw this online and researched it.  I have had it for a couple weeks now.  I'll make it simple since there are lots of reviews on here already:  -the most important things to me are sound quality, battery life and overall quality, which is why I chose this over ipod.  I tried out some ipods and the Creative killed the ipod in all of those things.  I bought some decent headphones and the sound quality on this thing is INCREDIBLE, I am a musician and my life has now been blessed with new listening experiences daily.  The battery life is great and I have watched full videos and music and photos (I put 10,000 of my digital photos on it as well as 22 gigs of music).  The overall quality is great, it feels well built and the screen is simply amazing. I haven't encountered much scratching at all but who cares about that outside of the screen?  Just cover the screen with a little screen protecter you can buy anywhere and you are fine.   I am also easily putting podcasts on here and you can use any podcasting service if you link it to the zencast software that comes with it!  The downfalls I have encountered have to do with the occasional difficulty I have tranferring everything the right way from one place.  I am able to get EVERYTHING and every video and song format I want on the player (including Quicktime files) but sometimes I have to try the different softwares that come with the player...there isn't one central place to do everything.  I am going to try to do everything from Windows Media Player now cuz I hear that's the way to go. In general, it just takes some patience to figure out the software and controls.  I continue to laugh at all the ipod owners jumping on here and smearing the Creative Vision, but I have to admit that if I had dropped all that cash and got sucked into Apple's trap, I would be pretty angry myself after seeing this come out.  With this player I have full freedom and consider it an extension of all the files on my computer and subscription services, rather than only what I can pull through itunes.  I have no problem with the size and I take it skiing with me.   The bottom line is it's a sweet player, great quality, with the player's positives much outweighing its negatives.   It has so many little details and options, making it that much more fun than what ipod has to offer.

<Title>Spiffy gadget
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was actually waiting for the pink one to be released, but I couldn't wait to get my hands on this, so I went with the black one. It didn't disappoint me at all. The video quality is really quite astounding. I was worried that movie subtitles would be hard to read, but that isn't the case at all. The sound quality is pretty good, though I don't know how everyone else rates it--some are satisfied, others seek something better. Since I'm not really looking for super crystal-clear audio--as long as it doesn't sound crackly or like it came from the bottom of a well, it's all fine by me.  I don't know why some people have issues with its thickness and like to compare it to the thinner iPod, but it's a nice and light little thing, in my opinion. I've tinkered with some Creative players before and always found the touchpad a bit fiddly, but it's really all right once you get used to it.   I've also checked out the reviews and saw that some people have had issues with the software. Perhaps I'm just easily pleased, but I had no problems with transferring data or media to my player, and I can even transfer my stuff without installing the software.   And yes, to corroborate earlier reviews, I have also had some problems with the earphones, since they don't stay in my ear very well. I'm not sure however if this problem applies to everyone. The shiny surface also tends to scratch easily (I kept my player in the included pouch and it still got some scratches), so it would be really cool if something like the iSkin were developed for the Zen Vision:M.  Overall, this is a pretty nice gadget, guaranteed to keep you entertained for a long time as well as turn some heads.  Edit: Ah, it seems I was lucky to have bought this player early on, since I got it with the included AC adapter. I've been using this player pretty consistently and I must say I STILL don't have major problems with it, apart from a fairly slow start-up, and for some reason, the clock sometimes resets to a different time, so I have to adjust it all over again. Also, it froze on me once, and that was around four months ago. And that's about all the wrong I've found with it after six months of use.

<Title>This thing is fantastic.  It's not hype.
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, so I've had this thing for a month now.  I've got the hang of it and I'm impressed.  Here's the deal...  I looked for about 2 weeks researching every possible mp3 player out there.  I looked at Ipod, I looked at Creative products, Philips, ect.  I decided on the Creative Zen: M.  I'm not sorry.  I'm in Iraq and since I'm not home I can't speak for the way Ipods act back home.  But I can say that almost EVERYONE over here has an Ipod due to having absolutely nothing to do on down time.  The sand is just eating these Ipods up.  EVERYONE's Ipod freezes up, they have to clear them out, or they just stay frozen.  I've heard (just a rumor) Ipods' customer service on the phone is 49.95.  I just didn't have the scratch to risk having them refer me to their website for almost 50 bucks.  I read all the reviews and here's what i get: Ipod vs. Zen pros and cons the thing is the pros of Ipods are rediculous More stylish, more popular, the wheel thing, itunes (not a pro in my book), wow, allow me to catch my breath. Is this all? Zen pros 14 hr battery life, 10 hrs voice recording (very nice for putting comments or stories on cd's), awesome music management software (not exclusive to one format), (if style is an issue) 5 colors to choose from, video playback is awesome (also a pantload of formats for compatibilities sake), theinvisibleshield.com offers a film that's just unreal to protect the screen (Ipod too) I say dodge the Ipod like the plague(sp?) because people are just not happy with them.  If you think I'm biased that's ok, but Ipod owners told me not to get one. Buy one, the product speaks for itself.  Creative's track record is pretty good too.  They've owned the CES show for a while now with Best In Show products.  Zen: M was this year's, and for good reason. Peace.

<Title>Hands down the best
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all [i] was sucked into buying an ipod (the fourth generation click wheel) and loved it. I used limewire for a while(it was illegal though), but when i got a new computer i decided to stop and use iTunes. Well to say the least iTunes has a TON of songs, but i hated the fact that there was other music stores that didnt charge .99 cents a download. So that was the major facor into me deciding to switch to a new mp3 player. Basically all the kids in my school have an ipod video or an ipod mini, so you know i kind of wanted to be different. So i did some research and stumbled upon this CNET thing on the best new mp3 player and the vision M was there. Now the first thing that came to my mind was the fact that it looked similar to an iPod, but after i did my research I realized that it was far from it. The PROS: Best screen quality for videos- has something like 265,000 colours while the ipod has 64,000. Also you can change between 6 different backgrounds, which is a small but yet cool feature.  Long Battery Life- I used to charge my iPod every night but with the Zen I only charge for two and a half hours every two or three days, which is great if I forget to charge it one night i dont really have to worry about "Is it going to die on me" factor. By the way its amazing because you can plug it in for around 45 minutes to charge and its halfway full when you pull it out. 2-2 1/2 hours to charge fully.  Controls- I peronally love the layout of the buttons and ill exlplain them to you too. The one on the upper left with the arrow touching the dot is your "short cut" button. What that means is you can set it to on your setting and set it to bring you to a certain page in you player ( I set it to "Artists") so that when you are listening to a song and dont want to go back you just press that button and BAM you are there. The button underneath it is the back button which is just to go back. The button on the top right is the Play/Pause button, and the one on the bottom right is the small menue type button. You can use this to delete a track from you player(+)at any time. The controls are pretty basic to get used to, I picked them up in around ten to fifteen minutes. By the way on the long touchpad button there is to little small buttons to the left and right that is the Forward and Back buttons used to cycle through songs.  Navigation- When you are in any of the sub folders for music you can hit the side button next to your touch pad and access a small side bar that has all of the letter in the alphabet. You just scroll down with the touchpad while it brings you the beginning section that starts with that letter. Which save you all the time of scrolling through thousands of songs.  Video- I used windows media player to transfer music videos onto there and it transfered in about 10 seconds for a 3 minute video.   Programs- I use Window Media Player to transfer songs, which is basically like a more advanced version of iTunes, and its pretty easy to get used to.  Sound- Better than the iPods in my opinion. I played the exact same copy of a song on my ipod and on my zen at the same time with a different headphone in each ear (the song opened wiht a slow but loud drumming) and the zen beat it by a mile. To describe the sound its  basically like your watching T.V in a way its sort of all around you and right next to you.  Size- I don't see why everybody is complaing about the size. its basically about the size of the 40g 4G ipod. It feels comfortable in your hand. The front is pretty scratch worthy, but not too bad. I ordered an invisible shield from www.shieldzone.com and i could rub a coin all over it and just wipe it off and it looks brand new. The best part is you dont need to worry about the back getting scratched up because its like a sand blasted back. On the back the zen logo is indented with a ripple effect which adds some nice touch. Here is a website that shows a comparison to the ipod video (but if youve ever held an ipod video in your hand they feel somewhat uncomfortable, the zen feels sturdy but light) (...)  THE CONS- Album art- O.K i have strived to get the album art onto the Zen but to me its literally impossible. Its not like itunes where you can just copy and paste a picture from amazon if you dont have it. I went to creatives online support and followed the instructions, which include, deleting a hidden folder on you zen, saving the picture, resizing it, import it, open it and choose the cover style. Its just crazy for creative to do everything practically perfect and screw up on a small thing like album art  Customer Support: Not really part of the zen but I called the technical support (for the album art)and i had to wait on the phone for 45 minutes, which is far from reasonable for a technical support (all the while listening to some sort of Japanese techno) and when the guy answers he reads me the thing from the website and says hes not to familiar with the vision M. So i called again (another 45 minutes) and the lady sends me a software up date for the wrong player. So i call back again (40 minutes) and now im really mad, and that lady puts me on hold and talks to her supervisors about how to do it and just redirects me to the online website which didnt even help me in the first place. So you get the picture on why the technical support stinks.  Forgot to add i subscribed to Rhapsody for 15 dollars a month and now have unlimited downloads ande everything so that made this purchase all the more worth while. All in all the Zen is a great produc, and in my opinion kills the iPod video. BY THE WAY IF YOU DONT HAVE WINDOWS XP DONT BUY THE VISION M BECAUSE IT WONT WORK ON ANYTHING ELSE. Just wanted to let you guys know how much I love this little gadget

<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a techie geek, and I rush out to buy the latest gadgets.   Here are my observations about the Zen Vision:M  30GB  Positive +  It probably IS better than the video iPod overall.  It has twice the video battery rating, and it supports many more video and song formats than the ipod.  Also, it is Windows SurePlay compatible, so just about any online mp3 store's files will work on this thing.    +  it supports many video types including my home mpeg2 and avi videos from my home movies.  +  EXCELLENT customer support at Creative.  I had a couple technical questions and they were very attentative and gave individual care.   (I dont have experience with Apple's service)  +  Years from now, youll be glad you have this device, vs an ipod..  because once you buy an iPod and iTunes files...  youre STUCK using an iPod for the rest of your life to play those files.   Stay away from proprietary products if at all possible...  so those thousands of music files you have from Itunes, will ONLY play on Ipods...  youre locked in.  Negative -  I'm dissapointed there arent ANY accessories out for this thing yet, besides the basics like charger, battery, a/v cables.  I would like to see some of the cool accessories the iPod has.  -  it's a little pricey and costs MORE than a Video iPod.  For the extra money, they shoudl throw in the a/v cable to connect the Zen to y a tv or home stereo.  -  As far as useage, the only frustrating thing about the Zen is the scroll button....  its way to sensitive, even on the lowest setting...   it gets easier with practice, but I still occasionally hit the wrong button or select the wrong song, because of the scrolling feature.  Overall, its a good product and I have no regrets.

<Title>Good Grief
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Simply put, this device is amazing. Before buying, I read dozens of reviews from users and tech sites and tested out friends ipod videos. And still, when I got my hands on the Zen Visoin M, I was amazed at the picture quality, radio performance, ease of use, sound quality, album art display...good grief....it is just an amazing product. Yes, there are minor annoyances (such as black version collects fingerprints like crazy), but overall it is well worth your money. 95% of you will be super satisfied with this product. I sure am.

<Title>Why this rocks the ipod...
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Man. Where to start. Reasons why the zen rocks the ipod. 1)the color screen is simply AMAZING. 2)all high quality movies gotten off bittorrent are 90%  divx and xvid. meaning you dont have to go through the  demeaning process of converting videos. 3)And for the ipod, if you do convert your videos, they are restricted (quality wise) to the point that apple forces you to buy their videos off itunes to avoid stabbing yourself. 4)Battery life. Conpared to the Original Zen PMC (12 hours of video life!) the zen sucks. But against its current opponent, the ipod, the zen wins by 2 hours. Thats one more movie/4 more episodes of family guy. 5)The shortcut button is an excellent idea.  P.S. Sadly the only reason people find the ipod as a excellent mp3 player is that apple advertises the hell out of it. The ipod is actually a good mp3 player, it just isn't excellent like all of apple's herd of sheep think it is...

<Title>Why Would You Buy An iPod???
<Date>Sat Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Simply put, this is the PERFECT device for users of music subscription services like Napster to Go and Yahoo Music Ulimited.  For subscription support alone, this device is the hands-down winner versus the iPod.  At less than $10/month, you have access to over 1M tracks, versus $0.99/song with iTunes.  Game Over!

<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As far as storage space is concerned, the iPod is a better bang for your buck. While Creative claims to have a 15,000-song capacity, it is making this claim based on a 64kbps audio file. I don't know of anyone who has a file lower in quality than at 128kbps file. Apple is up front about their capacity. For their 30-gigabyte iPod, they claim 7500 songs at 128kbps (to get 15000 you need the 60gb, something Creative doesn't offer). Your Creative player would have the same capacity since it also has a 30-gigabyte drive. Cost: $299 for a 30gb Video iPod or $329.99 for a 30gb Creative Zen Vision: M. Take your pick.       to clear that up  it holds 15000 128kb WMA files, which are evedently half the quality of mp3, but i can tell no difference.

<Title>BETTER Than IPOD by far
<Date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's see..., you can get the Ipod for "less" because it doesn't come w/ the AC adaptor($40),the integrated FM radio($30+),a pouch and other stuff included with the Creative Zen Vision. It also supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. The quality and feel of the Creative Zen Video are better, not cheap, it is sturdy. You can record directly from the  integrated FM radio. 32 station presets let you switch stations whenever you want. You can also select from a myriad of online music stores - Napster To Go, Yahoo! Music Unlimited, Rhapsody To Go, and many more. With PlaysForSure support, you will always be able to play any digital music you purchase. You can even download your favorite TV shows.  ZEN VISION:M supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. Ipods are for people that get things because everyone has them, not because they do quality research. The battery last longer on the creative and it is replaceable, on the Ipod after 18 month you have to send it back to them and have it replaced and pay over $150. If you want an excellent quality product, go with this one. They had started to come down on price (I got my for $289 here)and you don't have to spend money on extra stuff already included. Do research, Creative had been around for many years and they had won many awards for their MP3 quality products, Including this one.

<Content>Had the player for a few weeks and love it.  You cannot beat the clear videos.  I bought mines in Baby Blue and get stopped everywhere with people asking me questions.  The only complaint I have is the album pictures, but I keep it in my pocket while listening to music so it's not a major problem.  Don't fall with the majority (IPOD), be an original and get something that's worth the money.

<Title>Better than I thought
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recently bought this player and i have to admit it is much better than i thought it would be. I know it's lame to compare everything to Ipod but since it is the most popular player i will compare it to Ipod. Sound - way better than ipod (Creative have more experience with sound than Apple do) . Battery - lasts twice as long as Ipod (this is why it's thicker than Ipod). Screen - resolution is four times higher than on ipod 5G. Video Formats - supports Divx and Xvid  among others, unlike Ipod where Apple force you to use their stupid mpeg4 format. Interface - same. Navigation - once you get used to the touchpad, it's fine In my opinion these are the most important things to compare. i also noticed that the price for this player has just dropped down to $300.00. GREAT PLAYER!!!!!

<Title>Nice, solid player
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros:   --Great capacity and media abilities --Stable environment --Good controls (takes a little while to get used to but very flexible once you do) --Easy software as well as many software options (not limited to iTunes) --Reasonable battery life (8+ hrs. just playing music) --Very crips, clear display --Excellent sound and flexible audio controls --Shortcut button is customizeable Cons:   --Screen scratches and smudges easily --Lack of accessories --Proprietary charger/USB interface (also meaning you can't charge in the car until they make such an accessory)  I use my Vision:M daily in an industrial environment and have even dropped it twice, but it did not even stop playing.  I purchased a "Marware SportSuit Sleeve" (says it will fit all iPods including new 3G iPods but easily fits the Vision:M) and it is a great case for those who will use thier player in a variety of conditions as it has padded sides and plastic inserts for impact protection, repels water, and has a removeable belt clip.  The only downer to the SportSuit is the headphone jack location, but the flap closure is flexible and can easily be secured by going around that once your headphones are plugged in.  All in all I am very pleased with my Vision:M and highly recommend it.

<Title>Truly amazed!
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Vision:M for about 2 weeks now and I can't get enough of it.  The first time I turned it on, it had a crisp, colorful, and bright screen.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how bright the screen was at only 50% brightness.  So far, I have 2 complete movies, 4 episodes of my favorite show, hundreds of songs on it and I'm not even close to filling up the disk space.  I use my Vision:M at the gym almost daily and it's kind of fun seeing people next to me on the treadmill look over and their eyes widen a bit when they realize I'm watching a movie.  Sound quality is more than you can ask for with its customizable EQ.  Battery life is great.  Like I said, I watch movies on it frequently and so far, I've watched 2 full movies without having to recharge it.  Only thing that can bum me out (but not much) is that it already went down in price.  I bought it for $329, and now it's at $299.    As time goes by, more accessories will be available.  I'm sure of it.  Accessories I plan to buy as they become available:   -A/V cable (to connect and view media on TV)   -iRiver fm transmitter (heard good reviews on Amazon.com) Accessories that I've purchased already:   -Boxwave Flexiskin case (silicone case that fits well)   -Boxwave screen protector (doesn't completely cover the front and sides, but combined with the Flexiskin, does its job well)  All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this product.  iPod who?

<Title>Another reason to want the Creative Vision: M
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is awesome! Sure it's bigger than an Ipod, but in this case, Bigger IS better...  There's even more reason to love this thing, the price.  I usually buy from Amazon.com, but found a promotional code from another source and was able to purchase this for $249, no tax, free delivery! For that price, there is NOTHING out there which can touch it.  The only recommendation I have is to pair this thing with a some Sennheiser PX100 headphones. You don't know what you are missing until you do...  Get this thing while it's in stock. Many places don't have it on hand!  PS - Do yourself a favor and download Total Video Converter ver 2.52. Free for 15 days of use and it converts EVERY format, including flash and shockwave video (GoogleVideo & YouTube) into ANY format you want, including Ipod! You will be thanking me!!!  PSS - http://home.comcast.net/~othastar/Music.html = TONS of music videos already converted to MP4. ENJOY!!!

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great looks, great sound, great software. It can take any video file you try to put it, even if you have to convert it with the included software, unlike the other big named mp3/video player. I have seen the ipod video and was shocked when i saw the menus. No images, no color, no nothing, just simple text with the options. Zen Vision:M at that aspect is 10000x better looking with it's wallpapers, decorated menus etc (for those that say the ipod is much better looking than the Zen). I'm very glad i bought this one, unfortunately it was only available in black, which is where it comes it's biggest problem. The Scratches!! i can say i couldn't be more careful with it, and yet its all scretched up. No big deal if you're looking at it turned on, because you can't notice them with all the beautiful colors of the screen. it's when it's off that you can see it. The other negative point (and i really can only find 2) is that against the sun, you can't see the screen very well. maybe i should tinger with the brightness level, since it's at 50% as it came from factory.   Overall it's one hell of a good player (music/photos/video). Every friend that i showed it to, was amazed with the quality of the screen and the movies.

<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent product and great alternative to Ipod. Ipod's are "horrible" for licensing. The Creative product works great with all media except Apple's, of course. Great menu and controls. Fantastic playback ability and picture quality (brightness, contrast etc.) Took a little while getting used to the slide bar, but much better control that the ZEN touch, my previous media player. Battery life is pretty much what they report. Accessories are starting to catch up as well. The screen scratches easily, but I hear this is the case for all players. The case included with the device is on the cheap side...looks like something a 13 year old Dungeons and Dragons player would carry around.  Biggest shortcoming is the inability to check file sizes in a Windows explorer type window. I've used up 28GB and can't figure out what's takin the space without wiping out and recopying the device.

<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Zen Vision: M in order to replace a Sony PSP which I was only using for music.  I was going to get an iPod until I saw that the Zen Vision:M had received the Best in Show award for the Consumer Electronics Show.  Not knowing enough about technology to rate the specs myself I relied on that rating.   Overall I am happy with it.  What I like the best is that the Zen Vision does not inhabit your computer like iPod.  I don't have any unintended software popping up because the Zen software was installed.  Loading music , pictures and videos is simple enough and it's easy to control which files do and don't get loaded.  With my daughter's iPod, MP3s get loeaded automatically which they don't want.   The only thing I'm not as happy with is the control pad.  It's not as intuitive and user friendly as iPods.  Once you get use to it, it's easy enough but I still like iPod's control touch better. Overall, B+.

<Title>In a Zen-Like Place
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Zen on 2/9/06 and have been extremely pleased thus far.  I would give it 5 of 5 stars, except that I have not had it long enough to truly test its durability.  If I haven't broken it in a year, I will concede the last star ;)  Good: + Works flawlessly with subscription services.  Unlimited downloads for $15 per month beats other pay-per-song services hands down.   + Easy software interface, easy to rip, store, move, and create play lists from your media. + It seems very durable (I've dropped it once).  + Software interface structure is fairly configurable.   + I've downloaded photos but no videos yet.  Visual quality is pretty good given the size of the screen.   + Excellent sound quality from the audio mini-jack.   + Sounds fabulous in my truck - I hooked it directly into my head unit by buying an IP Bus cable (for my deck) and an RCA to mini-jack cable.  The result is awesome static free listening.  Bad: + Software is included, but very average compared to others. + When ripping CD's, you cannot play the tune to hear if it's one you really want, so you have to keep another "media" player open. + Music is not sortable by anything other than artist, which is clunky - however, you can use Media Player to rip and synch. + The included ear bud headphones are awful, although maybe it's just my ears - be prepared to buy your own.   + The touchpad slider is a royal pain to operate - after a month, I still haven't mastered it.  + It comes with a "flannel-like" pouch that will protect it, but is not conducive to easy use.   + At date of purchase, Amazon did not carry a compatible case.  None of the "mall-type" electronics stores carried anything to fit it either, but I was able to find one via an Internet search for about $30.   + The owner's manual is pretty weak (very basic), but after a few hours, I had most of the features figured out.     In all, I am very happy I went this route and would recommend the product to anyone who is looking for this type of player.

<Title>My honest opinion...
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't worry, I'm not a nine year old who just got this and just thinks it's awesome. I'm almost 13 and know more about computers than most adults. Music is my life, I love it. And I wanted the best mp3/video player out there. I didn't really want an iPod; I heard the battery isn't that great and it felt really wide and too think in my hand. Anyways, everything about this mp3 player is great. It looks pretty ugly in the picture, but looks better in person. The screen is great, I love watching movies on it. It is kinda bulky, but I don't mind much, especially while I'm watching Law & Order. The only reason why I'd ever get an iPod is to download all of the Law & Order episodes easily. My pictures look great and the music is awesome. I use Napster, and it's all quite easy to use. I've even been able to put album art on it using Windows Media Player. For the tech geek, this is a must-have. The only thing I don't like is how easily it gets scratched. It's horrible. But you can't notice them while you're watching something. Hopefully, ZENcast will start soon, then I'd be set.

<Title>Best Mp3 Player! Video Ipod Killer
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Best Mp3 player on the Market!  Yes it does look similiar to the video ipod and a little thick but its got WAY more feature than the Ipod.  Do you really think they designed, developed, and put this into production all since the launch of the 5G iPod.   Clearly they have been working on this for quite some time and I doubt all you Apple fanboys will give Creative the credit of being, well, creative enough to steal Apples design before it was released.  -- The screen is just awesome, Ipods screen looks Washed out and its only 65k colors compared to the Creative Zen Vision M 256k colors. Thats a Big Difference!  -- Its only .3inch thick. Its not that thick, its an average DAP thickness - the iPod is just anorexic, almost too thin to be comofortable/natural/ergonomic.   -- The battery life is definitely better than the ipod. 4hrs compared to 1.5hrs in a video ipod! One of the reasons why its a little thick.    -- Well Lets look at this the video ipod 30GB is $299 but do you get an FM tuner? Voice Recorder? Power adapter charger (not the USB cable charger)? Pouch?  -- If you add all that, it will be more than $399 and the Creative Zen Vision M comes with all that.   -- The creative definitely does not feel like cheap plastic, Its really well built and Solid!  -- Lets compare the video features Creative video playback easily handles MPEG, DivX, XviD, WMV9, and Motion-JPEG. Ipod is limited to Quicktime and Mp4  -- Supports Tivo To GO! Ohh Yea!  --Light-up Buttons  -- Organizer syncs with outlook > Calendar, Contact, Task list On the Go!

<Title>Best mp3/Video Player Out There!!!
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i'll keep this short and just explain what i like and don't like about the Creative Zen Vision:M 30GB mp3 and video player.  what i like: ~~it has great color display, more than the video ipod. ~~video quality looks excellent, even with small subtitles, you can see everything perfectly. ~~i like the fact that it actually plays mp3s, and not the proprietary formats that ipod converts to. (important because you can use your zen vision:m as a flash drive for importing and exporting videos, pictures, and mp3/wma) ~~IT PLAYS DIVX!!! i watch a lot of anime and other TV shows, so it was very important that it plays divx formats (avi), and it does.  and it also plays windows media video (wmv).  where the video ipod requires you to convert these formats to mp4 or quicktime movie files (they suck!). ~~and for any other audio formats or video formats it doesn't support, the software it comes with allows you to convert it into a playable format, such as converting audio to mp3 or video into wmv formats to be playable on your player. ~~battery life on the zen vision:m is great.  roughly 2.5 hrs of video and 14 hrs of audio. ~~has the fm tuner, voice recorder on it, and displays still pictures.  not much to say about those features, other than the zen vision:m does a good job with it.  what i don't like: ~~some picture displays are pixelated. ~~the wheel on the ipod is a lot better for searching through music and video files. ~~a little bulkier than the video ipod. ~~organizing playlists and searching through files can be somewhat troublesome, but not really a big issue. ~~lack of accessories available for purchase for the zen vision:m, but not directly related to the playability of the zen vision:m.  ...so that's it.  my quick review of the Creative Zen Vision:M mp3/video player.  and my recommendation: GET IT!!!  you won't regret it, i know i haven't.  as you can see from my review, the pros far outweigh the cons, and it's just an overall excellent player.  well, i hope this has been helpful.  and good luck with your Zen Vision:M player purchase.

<Title>Not a massacre, but gives the Video iPod its 1st loss (albeit split decision)
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this device a couple weeks ago and have been very happy with it.  I have not yet exhausted the battery, with moderate to heavy use from full charge.  The video quality is VERY good - at 2.5 inches, you'd be hard pressed to find anything better.  The breadth of formats available for video is spectacular.  If you try to pop something on it that is not compatible, it will attempt to auto convert.  Here's where the first chink in the armour is found - conversion takes FOREVER!  Not that conversion is a simple process, but it does take significantly longer than external conversion applications.  This is price we pay for convenience I suppose.  Audio quality is very good, I would suggest that you purchase a decent pair of headphones to replace the buds included in the package - they are no more than sufficient.  Accessories are not redily available yet, but they are out there for the diligent searchers.  I have not used the microphone functionality, and I doubt I ever will; so I have no comment to make to its viability.  The controls consist of a touch pad style scroll pad, with left-right momentary contact buttons, and four other buttons.  There is a great feature here that you don't find elsewhere - one user customizable button which you can set to any function available from menus.  If you want to Randomize All Tracks at the push of a finger, set it to that feature.  If you need to see videos right now, you can set that too.  The tactile buttons are very responsive and feel solid - a lot more useful than the kludgy pressure sensitive ones on prior Creative players.  The software for adding and removing files is pretty good - iTunes is better, but it's not a runaway.  The one thing that almost was enough to shave off the fifth star - there's a dongle to recharge/transfer/connect to external vid.  I hate dongles.  No dock, just a little dongle that I am sure I will lose.  I can get over it, but it does not make me giddy with delight either.  Using this device for heavy bouncing activities - running/jogging - may be less than spectacular.  It's a hard drive, not solid state.  I lift weights, bike, and treadmill/stairstep machine with it, mostly without incident, but running might leave you underwhelmed (have not really even tried, but occasional bumps lag it.)  That's what you get for this capacity, so I don't fault it for that.  Overall: GREAT device, highly recommended if you don't have to walk lock-step with the prevailing iPod masterdom.  Pros: Beautiful video display.  Sexy blue on black backlighting. MANY video codecs supported!  Very good battery life.  Good button response.    Cons: Dongle!  Lag time when changing menus can get frustrating when you want to grab something specific while shuffling all. Slow vid conversion.

<Title>Better than Ipod!! and cost less
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's see..., you can get the Ipod for about $10 "less"(?) because it doesn't come w/ the AC adaptor($40),the integrated FM radio($30+),a pouch and other stuff included with the Creative Zen Vision that you don't get w/ the Ipod, actually I believe the Ipod only comes with a usb cable. The Creative Zen Vision also supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. The quality and feel of the Creative Zen Video are better, not cheap, it is sturdy. You can record directly from the integrated FM radio. 32 station presets let you switch stations whenever you want. You can also select from a myriad of online music stores - Napster To Go, Yahoo! Music Unlimited, Rhapsody To Go, and many more. With PlaysForSure support, you will always be able to play any digital music you purchase. You can even download your favorite TV shows. ZEN VISION:M supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use.  Ipods are for people that get things because everyone has them, not because they do quality research. The battery last longer on the creative and it is replaceable, on the Ipod after 18 month you have to send it back to them and have it replaced and pay over $150. If you want an excellent quality product, go with this one. They had started to come down on price (I got my for $289 here)(the white and the pink are $280ea. today) and you don't have to spend money on extra stuff already included. Do research, Creative had been around for many years and they had won many awards for their MP3 quality products, Including this one.

<Title>DOA products from Creative, buyer beware
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this for a present today, purchased from another website, and it came to me dead. I get a blank screen and none of the buttons work. I get a charge on the battery, and I'm able to get to the recovery screen, but none of the recovery methods work. Looking at Creative's discussion forum, it looks like a good percentage of others are experiencing the same problem. What's bothersome is that it's an official Creative forum on the product, but Creative does nothing to address the problem at all. If you're feeling lucky, go ahead and make the purchase.

<Title>Zen Vision M Black
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this product. I was wanting to get an ipod a long time ago but never had the money, then the ipod with color came out and I began saving money. Not to long after the ipod video came out. I was not sure what to do, get the ipod video or wait for apple to stir up something even greater. So I waited and waited for a few months. I was at Amazon about to buy the ipod when I saw the Zen vision m. I read loads of reviews on it. After reading reviews it was easy to decide that the Zen vision m was the way to go. It is way better then the ipod. It has longer battery life, better screen with more colors, supports a huge amount of video and audio formats, has a built in radio and voice recorder. It can even record radio. I have has it for about a month now, and I love very thing about it except a few things. I strongly recommend getting new headphones ASAP. The headphones it comes with are pure garbage. They do not block out any noise at all. When I sat in a hallway full of people, it was almost impossible to hear the music even at full blast, plus you are hurting your hearing. Another bad thing about it is that the front of the device scratches very easily. Within about 5 minutes of handling it I got a few scratches. It also smudges very easily, and when I tried to wipe it with a t shirt it got rid of the smudges but it added more scratches. I strongly recommend getting a case or an invisible shield for it. You can get one here http://www.shieldzone.com/ Besides that the product is amazing. You can use it as a hard rive. When you put it into hard rive mode, and you plug it into a pc, the pc recognizes it as a USB mass storage device, and not as an mp3 player. I think that is very cool and useful. The screen is much brighter then the ipod. It is not as easy to use as an ipod at first but with about 10 minutes of messing around with it you will be a master. The voice recorder is very good also. I use it sometimes to record lectures at school. The quality is very good. the only down side about the voice recorder is that when you play it back there is a continuous humming sound which is caused by the hard rive in the player spinning at high rpm's. The mic is very sensitive and catches that sound, however it does not bothersome and the lecture can still be heard just fine. The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because it is prone to scratching and smudging. I don't quiet understand why a $330 device scratches so easily.  I tried to include the most aspects about the product as possible, and I hope I was helpful in making your decision of whether to buy it or not.

<Title>Anyone for a lemon?
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product with high hopes after having had a 5GB Zen Micro for a while and loving it, until the contact point for the earphones became loose.  I wanted a bigger MP3 anyway, and the early reviews for the Zen Vision:M seemed so positive.  And for some reason, I was leery of having an IPod on my Windows PC.  But now I am sorry I every bought this.  First, it took about 5 weeks for Amazon to finally ship it to me.  This was frustrating.  Then, when I finally received it at the end of February, I eagerly loaded it up with music.  That went quickly and seemed to be fine.  But when I tried to play it, the touch pad controls would not work.  I could only get Album of the Day to play.  I contacted Creative by phone, and I must say they were helpful (I give them 3 stars for service).  The tech person agreed that the product was defective and instructed me to mail it back to them for fixing or replacement.  I was somewhat dismayed to learn that it was likely I would get a refurbished (like new, he said) replacement.  In any case, I spent $12 with UPS to send it to Creative and, to their credit, I received it back within 14 days.  I again loaded it up with music -- although I found that my Dell MusicMatch Jukebox software worked better for this purpose than Creative's software.  After a few false starts trying to get the touch pad to work, I finally got the hang of it and I was happily up and running.  I really like the screen, btw.  It's large, colorful, and easy to read in even low lighting or bouncing on the subway.  All went well for a day and a half.  Then, on my way home from work the other night, the player just locked up on me.  Refused to jump to the next song; the touch pad would not respond; and I couldn't shut it down with the on/off switch.  It just glowed eerily inside my purse.  When I got home I took a pin, inserted it in the reset hole at the bottom, and, again to its credit, it "rebuilt" and once again was working.  I've yet to try it again and will on the way home tonight.  Bottom line is that the player looks good, has a nice hefty, quality feel to it, and sounds great.  But the electronics don't seem to be of the quality I expect, not for that price. I will see how it goes before I insist on another replacement.

<Title>Not up to mark
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A lot has been written about this player. However, I find the materials used sub-par and of poor quality. The screen and front face scratch so easily that within 10 days, the player already looks like 2 year old. I have a three year old Dell pocket pc which my kids use all the time to play chess and solitaire. After three years, its screen is much better than Zen's screen after 10 days. I always carry in the supplied pouch and even use it in the pouch still there are so many scratches.   Creative sells this player for $329.99 ( at least this is what I paid). Does this kind of price justify such poor materials? No. Looks like Creative is keeping all the money while putting nothing into product quality. Had it not been for Amazon's poor return policy (in case you haven't noticed, Amazon now refunds only 80% or less on opened products), I would have returned this player.  There are other problems also. I subscribe to Yahoo Music Unlimited service. If I create a playlist in Yahoo music engine, I can sync the player and can see this playlist fine. Now if I need to transfer any other video/music to this player using Windows Media Player, I have to put that file in sync list and sync the player. This erases the playlist created by Yahoo music engine.  The outlook sync requires installation of Creative software. As per company policy (which is almost universal in all companies), I cannot install any personal software on the office PC. There goes the outlook sync.    Albun art does not show up correctly for some songs though it displays correctly on Windows Media Player. I tried the fix given on the Creative support site but it does not work.   No support for synchronized lyrics and DVD closed captions.  Do not waste your money on this one.

<Title>Amazing mp3 player!
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've only had this thing for a week but I can't help myself from writing a review right now.  I am still awed by the crystal clear resolution of the screen and the smooth playback of videos.  I've always liked Creative's sound and the Zen doesn't disappoint.  The player is easy to navigate as well; though there are many menus to go through, that just shows that the player gives you many options to work with.  I'll never buy ipods because sound (must have custom equalizers, boo Apple), screen quality and battery life are most important to me in an mp3 player, and the Zen Vision: M beats the Ipod Video in all aspects.  Not to mention the Vision includes an FM tuner and a microphone recorder as well.    As for the complaints about the player scratching easily, don't worry too much about it.  All I did was slap two Belkin PDA screen protectors over the entire face of the player right away, and so far I have had no problems with scratches.  You can hardly tell there's anything over the screen either. I bought the screen protectors as a pack of 10 at a dollar store a long time ago. They work great for all my mp3 players.    I've had the muvo2, ipod mini, the zen micro, and the iaudio X5, but the Zen Vision:M is the best buy at the $250 I paid for it.  This player exceeded my expectations.  And if it lasts for more than a year, I'll be completely satisfied with my purchase.

<Title>Buy it, but get a case before you touch it.
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>FOR: memory; multi-functional (radio); battery life; uses MS media player and you don't need to load any of the provided Creative software.  5 stars for the device  AGAINST: Butter is more scratch resistant; lack of case with the product (comes with some silly little sock thing); lack of accessories available; Software that comes with it is poor and overly complicated (but you don't have to use it). 2 stars because of the lack of accessories, even direct from creative there is a poor selection  I'm giving 4 stars overall because I believe the device itself should carry more weighting than accessories.  If you choose to buy this product, buy a case and a protective film for the screen, as soon as you take it out of the box, put the film on the screen and put it in the case.  The screen scratches extremely easily. The screen is very soft and even cleaning it with a soft lens cloth instantly scratched the heck out of it.  This is my first MP3 video player, I'm frugal so never want to buy anything twice and try to get things that are ahead of the technology so they last longer.  Hence I stayed open minded and I researched MP3 players for many months before committing to buy this one.    I travel internationally a lot by air and wanted something small enough not to be burdensome and at the same time multifunctional to reduce the amount of other unwanted gadgets, this has video, music, talking books, pictures, radio, clock, organizer, contacts.  Also I wanted enough memory that I did not have to keep changing data before/after each trip.  The better battery life for video also helped me in my choice of the Creative Zen Vision MP3 30GB player.    If you want a multifunctional device as I did, I recommend you buy the creative Zen, it is a very good player.  The issue I have with it is the lack of accessories.  Creative, please provide a decent case, and use a harder more scratch resistant material. Amazon, if you are going to stock this product please give me a decent range of accessories to choose from.

<Content>If you travel a lot this is for you, video and sound quality is the best, 90% of the movies or videos I download can be played on it without any conversion (divx xvid wmv, etc), sync with Media Player 10 is great. Recommended - I love it.
