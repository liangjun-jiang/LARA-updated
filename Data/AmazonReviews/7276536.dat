<Title>a great player for the money

<Content>I bought this player to use during my cardio workouts.  It works great and stores plenty of music.  I also use it to share photos with my workout buddies.  I get lots of compliments on it.  One of the most common things I hear is that people who own more expensive name-brand media players did not get the handy neckstrap that this one came with.  
<Overall>5
