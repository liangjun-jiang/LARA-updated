<Title>Awesome product
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product couple of weeks ago and this product is better than what it looks and talks about. Compared to all the MP3 players available including IPOD, this 2GB has along with MP3, the FM, Video, text and the photo  viewer option. Also, there is no iTunes. The browser is very pretty and the the player itself is very sleek. Looks like a very hifi cellphone. Havent found any dislikes yet and I dnt think I will.  Forgot to mention since it is so good, the sound quality. Never thought samsung can come up with such a thing. Buy it.

<Title>The darn thing froze up
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got my player last night after 3 days.  I am very happy in the time that it arrived, however when I went download my music, which was only about 131 songs, the thing froze on me.  Now all I have on my screen is "Transferring files, Do not disconnect"  and it has said that since 11:30pm.  Now it is 5:35 am and it still says that.  Unfortunately, I had to disconnect it so that I can return it.  Little thing is still on.  I mean the sound out of it was great and the size is great for the price.  Didn't find any cases or accessories in stores for it.  So now I have to wait until Samsung opens to call and see if I can't get a new one.  Overall, besides this problem, I liked it.  I even came fully charged and with sample music so you could hear the quality.

<Title>Don't be fooled, keep shopping

<Content>In short, the product looks nice and has a cool looking menu with pleasantly futuristic sounds the beep as you navigate throughout. This however is the product's ONLY redeeming feature.  I read some skeptical reviews on my blackberry before making the final purchase, but I figured all the bugs I read about were probably infrequent and would not happen to me.  The problem most likely originates from the proprietary software, included in order to sync up your media with the player. At first glance, it looks simple and easier to use than itunes. While itunes can be a pain to work with, at the end of the day it WORKS, which is more than I can say about Samsung's software.  After adding media to your library, you drag it onto the player, simple enough, except however if you attempt to bring over too many files at a time, the software shuts itself down, refuses to restart, meanwhile the unit itself continues to beam "Transferring files, do not unplug" although it is actually doing nothing.   All you can do now is it unplug the unit and reset it. Attempting to simply power the product off or back on again does not work, and there are no instructions (naturally) with what to do in this case. I managed to figured out on my own how to reset the unit, by pressing the 4 side buttons simultaneously.  At this time the unit restarts itself, with the media you have loaded ready to enjoy! However, you can not add any additional media because now the software (right along with windows itself) no longer recognizes the unit (most likely due to a corrupt file caused by having to reboot the unit or by the bogus software shutting itself off).  I had the pleasure of repeating this process 3 times before I did my blood pressure a favor and returned it to the store.   At the end of the day (literally), I wasted HOURS trying to load this player with 1GB or so of music without success.  I was initially attracted to the products by its slick exterior and the marketing material behind the product at best buy listing it's additional features (video, picture & text viewer, voice recorder, etc). I didn't have the opportunity to sample it in store because the display unit at Best Buy did not work, which would prove to be clever foreshadowing.

<Title>Great Little Package
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Far from a tech junkie I found this small wonder perfect for my needs. I'm 59 yr.s old and wanted a FM radio to listen to while sitting on the beach or mowing the lawn... since receiving it I've downloaded many songs and was  surprised to learn how easy it was to navigate. I am absolutely amazed of the sound quality coming from such a tiny package. Battery life before a required recharge is great. Very pleased with the product. Highly recommended...<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXMVGU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9764866-8178068">Samsung YP-T9JQB 2 GB Digital Multimedia Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Great player... if you can actually get your music on it
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am going to echo many of the other reviews on this product.  The pro's... 1.) affordability.  I bought my 2 gig version for about half the price of an IPOD. 2.) player functionality can't be beat.  In terms of what this mp3 player can do, it blows the IPOD out of the water.  Disregard the fact that I'd never use a voice recorder or an FM tuner, the player itself has cool functions for everyday listening.  My favorite is the 'Street Mode' that seems to give it a bass boost and cancels out noise without increasing the volume and shattering my ear drums.  Con's... The only thing I can say is I would not buy this product ever again, and urge anyone shopping around to look at the CREATIVE players or just go with an IPOD over this Samsung.  The software that comes with it is probably the most user unfriendly thing I have ever encountered in my entire life.  Some of the reviews before spoke of the player freezing in mid download, but I've never experienced that.  My issue is that dragging music onto player, or making playlists and then putting the playlist on the player doesn't actually do anything.  The worst thing is, if you want to add a song to a playlist, you can't just add the one song.  You can try, but what happens is you end up with a playlist with ONLY THE ONE SONG YOU WANTED TO ADD!!!  Instead, you have to recreate the playlist and have the player download all the songs all over again, overwriting the previous ones, JUST TO UPDATE the playlist with one song.  It is the most time consuming and frustrating experience I have ever encountered with a piece of electronics equipment... and I work in the IT industry!  Do yourself a favor and go with something else.

<Title>Nice Player
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very good mp3 player. I like all the functions especially the record fm radio for if i have something i can't listen to right away, i could take a listen later. The battery life is great, one 4 hour charge lasts me about 5-6 days for about 2-3 hrs a day. The size is also a plus, No big Bulge in my Pockets!! The only thing i don't like about the player is the ability to manage playlist. Otherwise this is a very good mp3 player.

<Title>inexpensive and nice bright display
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The display on my SanDisk was just too dark to use in normal daylight so I ditched it for this Samsung model.  I'm glad I did. The sound quality is a notch better than the SanDisk and I like the custom equalizer option.  The display is BRIGHT.  I also like that i can simply dump mp3 files into the samsung's music folder directly from My Computer in WindowsXP.  No media player software needed to move music files onto the player.  It isnt perfect though.  The are a few important buttons on the side and you cant easily feel the difference between them when you are walking around.  They are way too small and too easy to accidentally push.  The large front button is great but the side buttons could use a redesign.  The earbuds that come with it are huge!  I dont know who has ears that fit these things.  You'll want some better headphones than what they give you.  Overall a great player for the low price.

<Content>I PURCHASED THE ITEM IN JAN. 08 AS A FACTORY REFURBISHED UNIT FOR $64.95.  FOR THE PRICE I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE UNIT.  EASY TO TRANSFER SONGS ONTO IT FROM EITHER WINDOWS MEDIA 11 OR SAMSUNG MEDIA STUDIO.  DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD FOR IT'S SIZE AND ALL FUNCTIONS ARE EASY TO NAVIGATE AND USE.  ONLY 2 PROBLEMS, THE HOLD BUTTON ON MY UNIT STOPPED WORKING AFTER A FEW HOURS USE AND SOME OF THE WRITING ON THE DISPLAY IS SO SMALL IT IS DIFFICULT TO READ.  FOR THE MONEY I SPENT I'M VERY SATISFIED.
