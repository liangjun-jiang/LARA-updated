<Title>Its good but its not amazing.
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I bought this for my self thinking that I was gonna have an amazing mp3 player since it was made by philips which is amazing in technology. I lean to them as my favorite company any ways to the mp3 player. I got the mp3  player and i put a song on it and decided to listen to it seeing how clear  the sound was it was kind of clear but not totally. So i thought ok not bad  but then i decided to take a run with it and i could barely hear anything  except for the on coming traffic it wasnt loud enough and sometimes it  would skip not very much but some times. I could only store about 8 songs  cause most of my songs were 5 mega bytes so i was mad about that.

<Title>Portable

<Content>I think the RUSH design is the most compact and stylish players around, it is small and light enough to fit into my palm or pocket and I can use one hand to work it.

<Title>Underwhelming
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This player looks more impressive on the box than in my hands. It's bigger than I had thought, and feels kind of cheap.<p>The LCD is not backlit, the maximum volume level is pitifully low, the interface is confusing (explain  what &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; buttons mean), and the software  that ships with it (the freely-downloadable version of Real Jukebox) is  minimal.

<Title>Music lovers or just plain lovers?
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>When I first saw the Philips SA101 Rush 32MB MP3 Player, i was spellbounded - what an incredible bit of beauty!! Almost a year after it's release, it's bright LCD screen and that sophisticated charm about the object remains - even though it's little 32MB chip is out-of-date compared to the new 6 - 10 GB chips now available in the market. <p>Don't buy it if...<p>----&gt; you're not the music lover whose going to take it to a space journey using the full 6 GB available in one of the new ones (the battery will prob. run out much before the space, mate!)<p>Buy it if: ----&gt; you're that simple person, not looking for a complete music industry in your pocket, but a little device to play you your fave 8 - 9 songs while you walk the dog....<p>Overall - this cheap gadget attracts attention, and gives a good performance to the average listener ... remember, it's not what's insides that counts - it's the outside....

<Title>overal quality
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This mp3 player has good music quality, organization, and a nice heavy duty case.  It suits my needs perfectly, not something that you will put all your music on, just your favorite songs.  The bookmark function also is quite nice, especially since i like some parts of songs better then others.  My ONLY complaint about this mp3 player is the lack of bass, and no bass boost.  Overal this is an excellent product and I highly recommend it like all other philips products.

<Title>INCompatibility, INCompatibility, INCompatibility, IN.....
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>NOT compatible with Windows NT or 2000.<p>NOT compatible with standard SmartMedia File Systems (so you can't swap cards with someone or download using diskette or pcmcia adapter for SmartMedia).<p>NOT compatible with newest version of RealAudio and the old one provided has some big bugs.  Like dropping laboriously typed titles for home-made mixes.  Like not being able to print play lists.  Like hanging on attempts to delete songs from Rush.<p>NOT compatible with internal rechargeable batteries - and it chews its 2 AAA up in 1.5 hours or less!<p>NOT compatible with jogging since the &quot;case&quot; is a keyring and it bruises your body parts if you let it bounce in a lower pocket - or flies out of a shirt pocket - it needs a good sports case.<p>NOT compatible with usefulness.  No ability to restart from beginning.  No retainer on USB data port cap.  Can't read mode status due to 1 mm characters.  Must always use &quot;hold&quot; slider as buttons are sensitive and you burn out your AAA even faster while it plays on the shelf.<p>(Philips user support site does NOT reply to requests for help or info such as &quot;when can we expect windows 2000 drivers?&quot;.  This review is of the new 64MB Rush.)

<Title>What's the fuss?
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>So, most of the people complain about it not being compatible with Win2000? Rest assures that this no longer is valid! I upgraded to Real Jukebox 2 since the one supplied with the CD didn't work under Win ME and Win2000. Although strongly advised not to upgrade, I went ahead and upgraded to JukeBox2. I downloaded a couple of songs onto the player and test listened to them, and it worked! Win2000 doesn't recognize the USB device (the Rush), but if you supply the CD that came with the Philips Rush it will take the driver found on the CD. The Philips rush is a pretty neat MP3 player, small enough to put it into your coat pocket (the advantage over MP3CDPlayers) and has enough storage for 1 hour of near CD quality music (enough for the trip to work and back home). However it does support the RealAudio formats, hence possessing longer playback times when listening to news and similar. I agree that the power consumption of the Rush is horrible! If you decide you want this device, then BUY RECHARGABLES (best Li-Ion). Those should keep the power expenses at their minimum (my previous RIO300 had a similar problem). NOTE: The Rush doesn't recharge the batteries although an adapter is included in the package! You will have to use external recharging devices! The supplied carrying bag looks nice, but shouldn't be used (it easily opens when jumping around). Otherwise I am happy with the RUSH, it's running smoothly and happily under Windows2000, Windows ME and Windows98 (I tested it under all three operating environments).

<Title>Broke after a week...
<Date>Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I was really happy with my Philips Rush MP3 player. It came with a lot of cool accessories (car adapter, belt clip, power adapter) and was small enough to fit in my pocket during trips to the gym. It also came with great software (Real Jukebox 7). However, after a couple days of use, the Previous and Next buttons on the Philips Rush did not want to work all the time.  I had to press the buttons very hard to move to the next or previous song. After about a week, my Philips Rush decided it didn't want to turn on at all! I even tried different powersources, but to no avail, it stayed off. I took it back to the store for a full refund and am now on the hunt for a new MP3 player.
