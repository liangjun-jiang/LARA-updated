<Title>1 star but if I could I'll put 5 negative stars!!!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll need some self contro to stay polite, to write this review. I bought mine in november, but after one months the device refuse to work anymore, for no reason there was no way to switch it on anymore. During this first month, I won't say that was the perfect MP3 juke box... It bugged at least twice a week, in a way that sometimes I don't know why but I have till the battery was flat to restart it! But for that I was lucky cause the autonomy is far from the constructor datas, the most I was abble to use it was suring maybe 6 sometimes 7 hours... Otherwise I was slow to load the menu play a song or just respond to single command, the sound  wasn't really great, very flat even with the personalized equalizer... Oh I forget to mention the picture, I was only able once to load picture on it, and then never again, I try everything even restore all the factory parameter and delete all my music there was no way!!! So I was happy to contract the extra warranty, best buy give me a new one, my first surprise was that I didn't find the radio on the menu there wasn't any way to turn the radio on, but I didn't really care about the radio... So my new one was just like the old one, same battery autonomy, same weak and flat sound, same bug, but at least it worked for more than a months this time!!! Now it just died again, for no reason??? I'm glad to read other review like this one it means that's not my karma fault!! Just Philips... I came to best buy again, they proposed me to change it, but there was NO WAY!!! So I choose another brand, I hope that ipod will works better, and plus the new one is thinner, so I'll see!

<Title>Pathetic Product, Atrocious Customer Service
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will never - ever - buy anything from Philips again.  This purchase was a Christmas present for my son.  Within a few days of opening it and following all the instructions to the letter, the screen fried, making the unit unusable.  I contacted customer service, and a very helpful agent gave me a support tag number and shipping information.  It was all a ploy.  Philips took their sweet time sending out a replacement unit, and when they did, they gave us an expected delivery date that has long since passed with absolutely no concern about the status of the delivery.  Their attitude is, "hey, we shipped it to you."  Philips' Customer Service is, in a word, shallow.  They cannot tell you who they used to ship replacements, and that department doesn't much care.  Instead, they have to put in a request for a tracking number which can take an additional three business days.  We have already spoken with the vendor.  As soon as this thing ever gets here - if it does - it's going back for a refund and we'll buy a different MP3 player from a company that can at least pretend it knows what it's doing.

<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went to bestbuy to get an ipod but ended up buying "Philips HDD6330 30 GB MP3 Player". I am impressed by its performance. I was little skeptical while buying, as this being a new product from Philips. I got the 2 warranty which costed me another $30 and I am glad i got the warranty after looking at the reviews here. But quite frankly i didnt hv any problems till now. The product looks great!! its nice that they hv a inbuilt voice recorder which records pretty well. i would recommand this for the price. the only drawback is, it doesn't have that many accessories as an ipod.

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Fri Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Picked this up at the local best buy, and of like most of you i was skeptical about the new unit, however i really was impressed with how it operated.. ESPECIALLY processor wise, very quick interface. I've had it for three weeks now and it hasn't given me one issue yet. Always boots up and plays..  And by the way, this was a replacement for my samsung YH-820 that died within 6 months, that was the worst unit ever for many other reasons. I never purchase warranty plans, but you require it on these things..

<Title>Philips' customer care  SUCKS!!!!
<Date>Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sorry but there was no better way to put it.  First of all, I bought this product on Tuesday after coming across it on AOL gifts. I lost my IRiver 40 gb (or it is somewhere in my house) so I decided to buy something different just in case I find it. I'd sell it on Ebay and move on. Anyhow, I went to BestBuy and purchased this product Tuesday evening. It is now Saturday, FOUR DAYS later and I have finally got this thing to work. Now , I am not new to mp3's. I have been using them before they became popular. However, I must say, Philips has the WORST Instruction Manual, description of requirements, and customer service.  First issue- After installing the software, the player would not work. It was being recogognized by my computer but not by the installed software,WMP10 and the Device Manager. Between Tuesday and Wed, I called the  support team  EIGHT times. They couldn't figure out the issue.They had the basic by the book responses. If I could reach into the phone I'd slap them . I held out hope though. I then realized by my own pc's  help, that I needed a high speed USB.  A 2.0 USB, for those who don't have one. We have two pc's and  the one that I loaded the software on is the one that I use  and contains all of my info. It had everything but the  hi speed usb. I loaded the software on the second pc, an hp media center h660 series and it worked perfectly fine. Problem is, how am I supposed to get my songs if it is on the other computer??  So I call the clueless people, cut the crap with the  tag number they like to give you out and gave them the reference number from the previous calls. Now I asked if the problem could be the usb. They couldn't say yes or no. I would have to ask my pc's maker. They don't know.   Great.  Dummies.  THEY SHOULD HAVE HAS ON THE REQUIREMENT LIST- WINDOWS XP SERVICE PACK 1 with IE 6 512MB RAM more than 300 mhz. USB2.0 HI SPEED  Had I known this, I woul dnot have wasted a day. So now Thursday, I go over to Radio Shack and purchased a PCI card. This is a USB 2.0  port that I must now physically install into my pc. Of course, for (...), the pci card is being recognized but it's drivers wont install. So, render it useless. I also purchased a Router to connect my two pc's and just transfer files. (..), and also useless. I do not have DSL and I only have one Ethernet cord. "Go by another one", you say. For what? I don't have DSL and I don't intend on dragging my basement pc to my room in order to transfer files onto this dumb non computer friendly device.  So, after many hours of frustration , I finally managed to get somewhere. I abandoned my other pc and used the HP . Now how did I get my songs? I spent two hours saving them on memory cards from my camcorder and digital camera(Now I wish I had sprung for the 512mb). 2 memory cards, 2 and a half hours, transfering 800 files.   Finally the songs are loaded , they go onto my device. Now for the pictures...where the hell are they? Oh they say they are there but I don't see them.  So guess what? I call the monkeys(no that's not fair, they(monkeys) would have figured this one out)-scratch that, I called those people that call themselves customer support and  told the woman I am not seeing my pics. So she asked me if I used Windows Explorer to transfer the pics. Now if it says use WMP10, then why the hell and how the hell can I use Windows Explorer. Then she tells me to do a device repair. There goes my 600 and some odd songs and some valid time in my life. Did it all over again to factory settings and no pictures.  Well, I Thank GOD that I know how to read. I went to their support site and found the cause of the issue.   If your pictures are not showing, the great possibility is that your philips plug -in is not installed . I checked my add/remove programs (go to control panel) and low and behold it was missing. So after reinstalling the second cd and 5 mins later, the plug -in pops up as it should. I rebooted and tried transferring pics again and now all is well.   Couldn't the rep tell me this in the first place? No. Because they do not know what the hell they are doing.  Ok. so now things are working well but by the sound of the other horror stories, who knows how long that will last. Lucky for me I paid that extra cash and bought the 2 yr warranty through Best Buy. The only reason that I did not give up hope is because it is so cute and has more to offer than the silly IPOD that everyone and their mother thinks is the greatest thing on the earth.  One thing I wish it would have is a carrying case that is attachable to the hip for running or   just period. I mean the concept of the product is good but it was not well executed.  The guy that I'm dating kept doubting it after reading these reviews and told me I was looking at Fashion before function. Sort of true, that is why i kept it. Aside from the smudging, I think it is fierce. Niceely built, sleek and cute, so I held out hope. I don't understand how people complain about the contollers, seeing as they are touch pad but I guess I am doomed to find out.  (...) After all of that trouble , I want some of my money back. I'm also taking the Router and PCI slot back to Radioshack. That's a good hundred dollars right there almost wasted. Almost.

<Title>What the heck???
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really really wanted to write a good review about this product.  But unforunately I can't.  I received this item as a Valentine's Day gift. (cool right)?  Wrong!!! When I received it it worked fine for a day than all of a sudden the device was not being recognized by my pc.  I thought well let me contact support and they can help me.  After a long chat on the web they had me download a patch to make the pc recongize the player again.  That went fine.  Then the player freezed up a few times.  Again I thought hey it's new technology so it's bound to have some bugs.  Well I downloaded 1500 songs into my player and I thought it was the coolest thing since high def tv's I was so happy with it that I went out and brought another one for my partner.  That's when things started to get ugly.  I went to download some pics and surprise they were not showing up in my player.  After venting some I went to the philips web sight to trouble shoot.  I tried everything they said on the website and still no pictures.  It shows that they are there but when you go to view them they are not there.  After six hours lots of cussing and a headache I decided to give up for the night and call cs in the morning.  Well I called cs and what did they do NOTHING, NATTA.  The first thing that they had me do was repair my player.  That means that you completely delete everything in your player.  Now I knew it wouldn't work because neither player was able to load pics.  But I decided to try it.  Well guess what now I have an empty mp3 player that still doesn't load pics.  Then they got really brillant and wanted me to uninstall my windows media player, meaning I would lose the songs stored in the library.  Now we are talking about 2000 songs, they will be in the pc but you have to go through all the trouble of adding them back to your library.  I asked them well what if that doesn't work?  The answer was to try another pc.  Are you kidding me?  I just brought this laptop about two months ago and your telling me it's the pc's problem.  Please!  So now I have two players that aren't working properly.  The only other thing they said I could do was set up a repair and wait till god only knows how long to get them back.  Why should you have to send a product in for repairs that you have only had for a few weeks?  It is taking all my control not to take the thing outside and run it over with my car.  If it wasn't so expensive I probably would do that because I am that mad.  This product does have some cool features like the voice record and fm tuner.  But be warned if you buy it.  I really wish I would have seen the reviews but hey it was gift.  So I had no way of knowing how big of a headache it would be.  If I spend nearly $300 for something I expect it work properly.  The music sounds good the touch pad is sometimes too sensitive, than other times it doesn't want to work.  They had some great ideals when designing this product but when it comes down to it is it really worth it?  I say no but that's just my opinion.  I am returning this thing tomorrow and I'm thinking about just going with the ipod.  I'm so mad I might just get the money back.  I hope this is helpful.  My advice is be careful it may or maynot work properly for you.

<Title>Philips is not a worthy mp3 maker
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>"Absolutly dreadful", as Simon would say...my mp3 somehow managed to turn my computer upsidedown and nothing will work. Not only that but the player itself refuses to work while trying to download my first CD on the day I purchased it, it just froze and now all it wants is to be hooked to the computer and its been that way for hours. I am returning it back to Best Buy where I got it.  A complete waste of time and money. Not even a single day of it worth while.

<Title>I like it when it's working.
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's really unstable and unreliable from my experience with it. When I first got it, I really liked it. It was rather easy to use and the sound quality was more than I could ask for. Didn't use the head buds it came with, I prefer large bulky headphones. :D I got it as a Christmas Present from my parents, specifically for I trip I was taking to work on a project. I would be needing it because I was making makeshift desks and my computer was no longer an adequate Mp3 player anymore. Not exactly portable. This would be my first portable mp3 player.  I was a little suspicious of the touch...button---light things at first, but they grew on me because it could brush on the floor and it wouldn't be effected. I could care less about fancy interfaces or how it looks, just as long as it works. I wanted it for one thing and one thing only, to use it as an mp3 player. And for a time, it was good. It worked, with a small complaint about how long it took to transfer files. But that was no biggie, at the time I only had 2,000 songs. It only took a few hours...  But then one day I pause and get up to go to the bathroom and come back to find that it was frozen...the screen was on and the hardrive was dead. For a while there, I was panicking. Then I went to the ridiculously-over-the-top FAQ and found out how to reset it. I thought my problems were over, I was liking it a little less though, but heck, it was a minor bug and I thought that would be the end of it.  How very wrong I was.   After that I had no problems for a while. It was working and I was very happy with it. It was somewhat reliable, although I couldn't figure out how to do the playlists. (I was liking having the one it came with) And I didn't want to use Windows media player, the program is a little on the evil side. It worked just fine with dragging the files via Windows Explorer.  One day, I turn it on, and the list of songs is empty. There's nothing....I panic. I plug it into the computer and discover that all the songs are still there, mysteriously though they do not show up on the device. I do what I've done before, I get rid of all the songs and start again. I finally give in and see if "syncing" is any faster. It was fast at first, then it slowed down, then it stopped completely, then (biG surprise :O) The program crashes. Thanks a lot WMP. T_T  My collection has grown...a bit since then, too. So now I'm stuck with an empty unreliable buggy mp3 player. Looks like my computer is currently my main jukebox.  Overall nice concept. I don't care for fancified things, I like it when they work, but this machine is unfortunately style over substance.  They should have worked out the very apparent bugs before releasing it. They were in such a hurry to release the Windows answer to the Ipod, which in itself sounds like something worrisome.  I give it two stars. Easy to use and rather nice...when its working. Usually it isn't.

<Title>Frusterating, buy something else
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player since November and I am now putting it on craigslist so that I can buy a real mp3 player. I seem to have some of the same issues others have had.....the player is great when it works, but I have frequent problems.  It constantly freezes.  Sometimes after freezing, it won't recognize any of my songs (playlist shows zero songs).  Connect it to the computer and look via Windows Explorer....yep, they are there, but the player will not recognize them.  One time when re-syncing with Windows Media Player, either WMP or the device deleted a whole directory of my songs on my PC (luckily I back up my files to an external hard drive, so I was ok).  I figured that I could live with this player given some bugs...but it crashes so frequently now that it is too frusterating to use.  Oh...and don't even try calling their customer care.  First off, it does not even seem like they know their products.  Their only remedy is to delete all files from the device and re-sync.  And like other people have said about their customer care, they don't seem overly concerned that you are having problems and seem like they just want to get you off the phone.  Bottom line.....get something else!

<Title>Nice toy...
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well my brother has this nice and cool looking Jukebox player.  It has 30gb which holds up to 15,000 songs! :o  It doesn't have a click wheel but it does have this line/track looking thing which I think is kind of better then the click wheel.  It looks better and it's less hand movement :)  I also give it 2 thumbs up because all of the buttons light up :o! The buttons are kind of like censors....  The only downside to this nice looking toy is that its kind of difficult to add album art and pictures onto it.  Also if you purchase this product I highly reccomend you to purchase another set of headphones/earphones so you can prevent ear damage...  This Jukebox player also comes with a case! so you wont have to purchase a $30 case that will end up ripping....  It is also very VERY easy to transfer music to it :)

<Content>I actually went from a Dell jukebox 20GB to this thing. gotta say, it was pretty weak. I loaded it up full from the 2nd day on and maybe this was the problem but I'm not sure why it glitched out on me all the time.  I had to buy a 1gb player as a backup to my commute!  in any case, you can't edit songs on the player itself, playlists are annoying to edit - but I did love the playlist on the fly function - and the software is like the commodore 64.  brutal.  I had this thing less than 6 mos and sold it for cheap.  never buy this.  never.

The touch screen does just that, responds to your touch, like the iPhone. In fact it looks just like the iPhone, same black, sleek, look. I am so glad I didn't get the iPod. My friend's iPod, when the battery died, lost all the data including ALL that music. iPods are known for their crappy battery problem is all I can say. This player will NOT let you down.

And even worse, their customer service does not care about you, they dont even act like they do. I have gone so far as to complain to the BBB and my Attorney General because this has happened TWICE within a span of slightly over a year- AND they wont give me a refund AND also claim that it is my fault.

I've had this MP3 player for less than four months, and the battery has already began to die on me!  After looking at reviews on Amazon, I found out it's a common problem, and the main reason to avoid this device.  One year warranty, you say?  Don't count on it!  Philips Customer/Technical help is both unapologetic and rude.  They've sent me in circles many times.  Giving me false "reference numbers" and worst of all, false hope that my MP3 player will every function normally.  Remember; you get what you paid for.  Sure, the Philips Go Gear is much cheaper than most other MP3 players, but the quality and service that goes along with it is terrible.  Think about it before investing your hard-earned money on a substandard music player.

<Title>Buy an iPod Video instead
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item from here and sent it back the same day. My reasons for buying were:  * sound recording * huge capacity for my audio books * cheaper than iPod * I really won't be watching videos on it  When it arrived, everything was OK until I realized that the vertical pad didn't fast forward/rewind the song played. You need to keep the forward/backward button pressed and it will fast forward/rewind, but at a very slow speed. For me, the reason for buying such a large capacity mp3 player was long audio books, and there is no way I can feel comfortable without the ability of quickly going to the place I want in the file. Utter disappointment. iPod has a superb wheel thing that lets you move to anywhere in the file conviniently. Right after I realized that the iPod video can also record with an external mic, there was no reason left for me to keep this product. I paid about $20 more for a 30gb iPod video now. Well, sometimes you gotta go mainstream. Plus, iPod has a huge user community and all kind of software is out there. I didn't even try to use this on my Linux box, the player just didn't qualify for other reasons.

<Title>I'm quite frustrated with this product and Philips
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this unit a  few months ago and was very pleased at the outset. Though it took me a while to get the songs and my pictures in properly, the ability to have a large part of my music collection with me at all times outweighed the negatives. However, I'm not so pleased anymore. Its happened at least twice now that I power on my unit only to find that all my songs are gone. The unit won't recognize them. Its happened at the most inopportune times, too, right when I'm about to work out and need loud music to take my mind off the pain! The instruction manual was no help, the web site was no help, but more astoundingly, Philips customer service was no help! Like others have said, they seem to have no more knowledge about the products than their customers. This has proven incredibly frustrating. Philips should not be in this market and I, for one, will not buy anything else from them.

<Title>Philips Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can not believe that a compnay as large as philips would have such terrible customer service.  I received this player for Christmas as a gift.  Well it worked fine jusst unable to find many accessories for it. Well in March this thing just freezes up and I cant turn it off. Well finally it goes off and then I cant get it back on. Call customer service and they were no help so they requested I send it back to them for an exchange. And request that I do delivery confirmation. So somewhere there had to ding for it in order to insure delivery.  Well they keep it two weeks and I call Monda and they say we havent looked at it and call back in a few days. Well low and behold the next afternoon there is a fedex package on my door. I open it and there is a orange and banana in the package. So I call and they give me the run around. But the bottom line was they did not request that someone sign for the package and it was left outside on the balcony in an apartment complex. Im not sure where the mishap happened but....I sent Philips a player and feel they should take every measure to make sure I get one back. So now they are telling me that unless I can send a receipt I will get $179.  And if I get the receipt I can get what I paid minus taxes.  I cant understand why Im having to pay out the pocket the difference when I sent them a paid for device. And customer service has been so rude and I plan to tell everybody I know that you have better be a technician if you get this cause Philips wont or cant fix it. I will NEVER BUT ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM AND I JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN GET A CREATIVE ZEN.

<Title>Frustrating: poor quality all around
<Date>Thu Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must constantly reset the device; the sound quality is sub-par; the processor is slow; the USB/power-cord combo is bulky; works only with Windows Media Player (e.g. not with Rhapsody).  Get a Zen Vision instead.  Worst $300 I ever spent.

<Title>Don't judge a book by it's cover
<Date>Thu Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you notice almost all of the good reviews are from people who don't own one or seem to have had one for about 12 hours. Its a pretty little thing, with its slick looking face & touch sensitve buttons and slide. The navigation is ok, which also looks attractive. Everything about it LOOKS great. Thats where it ends. I am on my fourth one because they keep breaking themselves, so thank god I got a 2 year replacement. If you push buttons too fast, it will glitch itself, and you have to use its software to erase everything, and on two of my other ones that didn't even fix it. I have RhapsodyToGo and it doesn't work right now beacuse of it. I don't have the time or energy to list everthing thats wrong with, so do yourself and everyone else a favor: don't buy it. Tell everyone you know not to buy it. Philips should be ashamed of such a piece of junk.

<Title>Buggy Firmware, Slow, Lousy Headphones.  I got burned.
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For my first mp3 player, I wanted to avoid the iPod, because I wanted to avoid using iTunes.  I got this player for Christmas 2005.  I liked it because: (1) it worked with Windows Media Player (2) the large 30GB capacity (3) the slick look. (4) it displays pics (5) it supports album art (6) it has a radio and voice recorder (7) the handsome up/down scrolling method (8) support for protected .wma files (9) upload songs from any PC  But here is what I DON'T like about this player: (1) It installs some questionable services that cause Windows probelms and don't seem required to run: i.e. LimeAlive.exe.  If you don't install their software, the device won't recognize the songs you've uploaded. (2) It is SLOW to respond.  If music is playing, and you click &lt;&lt; or >>, it might take up to FOUR SECONDS for the device to respond to a button press.  By this time, you've already clicked another button, thinking you missed it the first time.  This is my biggest complaint about this item and seriously hinders any user-friendliness. (3) Scrolling through your track list takes FOREVER, especially if there is music currently playing.  I had 7GB out of 30GB filled, and you must scroll and scroll and scroll to get through the song list. (4)  My system has locked up several times.  The instructions say something like, "don't panic, just do a soft reset by..." etc.  If you don't know how to do a soft reset, your player may just play until the battery runs out. (5) One day, the player just stopped seeing any files on the drive, even though the files still existed.  Philips support said there was a corrupt database, and I would have to re-image the hard drive back to factory spec, and then upload all of my songs again.  TERRIBLE!  There was no work-around for this, and hours were wasted re-compiling and uploading tracks. (6) Philips says up to 18 hours of battery life.  Yeah, Right.  Maybe if you have the radio set to an AM station on volume 1 with the display turned off.  I'd say more like 8 or 9 hours of real-time use. (7) The headphones were lousy.  I replaced them within days.  And still, the volume is so weak, you'll never listen to anything under half-volume.  Mine is maxed out pretty much all the time. (8) I bought a dock from Philips' website so that I could plug in at work or at home.  It was $40.  And it included: a dock.  No cables.  Cables were an extra $25 or so.   (9) Ever seen an iPod scroll through hundreds of pictures with lightning-quick speed?  You won't see that on this model.  Expecially if it's playing music. (10) Philips never bothered to email me back about these concerns.  There has been no firmware update from Christmas 05-June 06.  I would not buy this item again.  I would not recommend this player to anyone.

<Title>What the h--- does "Sync" mean?
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I CANNOT figure out how to just ADD songs to it.  It seems to re-write everything everytime you "Sync" it to the PC.  Which takes forever.  I can never seem to replicate its shenanigans.  And it labels an album as a Playlist, in addition to listing the album.  I only want playlists that I crate and label.  It does not play well with windows media player.  This has eaten way too many hours.  I want a player where I can FIND A SONG when I want it.  I play a lot of world music and cannot remember the foreign titles, so I want them in playlists.  I use it to study a language, so I want to be able to go right to a lesson.   And the controls are finicky.  It's easy to go past the selection you want.  It does not always respond to 'key' input.  A $200 headache.

<Title>Upset to Boot
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this HDD6330/17 only to discover that it will freeze.  I got it replaced but the second one froze, too.  I got a refund.  I called the technical support of Philips and visited their website to learn why.  I had to go through many links before coming across the one that would answer my question.  What was said under the tech support did not match what had happened.  It was suppose to just unfreeze and not erase the music following the steps, but it erased all of the 386 songs that I had sync to my MP3. My thought was if it freezes again, will I have to continue to reload the songs?  But the question was answered because it would not sync any of the songs again. The instructions from a live person said hold down the "on" button while pressing the volume "plus" button until it turns off, and he said that it was in the manual. WELL!! I was insulted by his tone of voice for not going to my manual first.  I am a first time buyer of the MP3, and was shaken when it froze. I froze.  I did not call back when my music was erased for fear of another ice tone of voice as to what I did.  I would not recommend anyone to purchase Philip MP3 because of the technical service person, and it was nothing in the manual to say what to do when you cannot replace the music that was erase.

<Title>Works great so far
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am surprised to read all the bad reviews.  I purchased this item just about a week ago and it has not given me any trouble so far. I upgraded from the HDD070 which only has 2GB capacity. I've had it for 2 years and never had a problem with it either. Did not want an Ipod because everyone I know who has one say they break within a year and frankly I find them to be a little over-rated.  I like the sleek design of the Philips HDD6330 and I find it to be very user friendly.  Very quick to upload music.  Since I am only interested in the music funtion, the pictures, recordings and radio functions are only added bonuses to me. Just like a few other reviewers, I agree that it has too few accessories.

<Title>Please don't!
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Please don't purchase this MP3 player.  I purchased mine right after they came out.  One of the reasons for this was that I was told (Best Buy sales person) that this Mp3 player was capable of acting as a hard drive for my camera.  After hours of searching that night online, I found no such adapter.    A call to the Philips USA customer service yielded the response that such an adapter was in their system but they couldn't find any.  They assured me that it would be found easily by my honeymoon (the reason I needed a hard drive for vacation photos).  From that point on it was a combination of "they shouldn't have promised you that" and "I think we can still get it to you in time" all the way until the day I left.  Months later I did buy the adapter, only to find out that the list of 50 cameras it fits are NOT a starting point, it is an inclusive list (I own a slightly newer version of one of the cameras).  Have they released a new version of the cable that fits any cameras made since the HDD6330's release?  Nope.  That brings me to my next issue: forget getting accessories now.  After about 2 years, you already can't find accessories.  The Philips USA website offers only three accessories for the device and two of the three came with it.  And the website is about the only place you'll find accessories.  Best Buy has none and mine never did, despite selling me the piece of junk.  Pretty obvious that this product is destined to be supported about as long as it actually lasts in your possession.  That brings me to my last point: be careful!  I did something to anger its internal gremlins and now it won't even function.  Either I exceeded its size or its just disliked one of the audio or photo files (photo files never did display on the thing) but now it says "please Connect to PC" but the PC (nor Philips own software) recognize the device because it doesn't reach a fully powered state.  No option to clear the hardrive without connecting it to the PC so, I am screwed.  I would send an e-mail or use on-line help but both of those are and have been down on Philips USA's site for a while.  Only option is to place a call to the same people who couldn't give me a good answer on a piece of plastic before.  I have tons of confidence in their ability to diagnose a software problem... (sarcasm attached).  I will eventually buy an I-Pod down the road as, when this device worked, I did enjoy the entire hard drive MP3 thing.  And, as much as I dread becoming an Apple drone, I'll buy an I-Pod because they are proven technology with real support behind it.  Maybe a Zune but I really can't imagine running the early adopter risk on an MP3 player again too soon.

<Title>Love/Hate Relationship
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like that it's a 30 GB mp3, but it's kind of hard to use. It uses Windows Mediaplayer, which is nice because more types of files can be compatible than an iPod, but I can't figure out how to put pictures or videos on it. Also, my left headphone didn't work until about 8 months after I bought this. I liked it because it was cheaper than an iPod, but now that I look back, I would have just spent the extra $100, although the headphones are better than iPod and the charger has a wall/computer USB in one and the carry case is nicer. The volume is rather low, however. I don't really recommend this.

<Title>Dont be Afraid of It - Excellent Little Player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player has gotten a lot of bad print - almost all of it seems to be on older firmware.  I don't doubt that people had problems, but it looks like Phillips has gotten this thing pretty well straightened out.   Mine has the latest firmware and works like a charm. (It's easy to upgrade using the Device Manager.)   My son, and Ipod addict, saw it and the first thing he said was - "Want to trade?"    The interface is really cool but may take a little getting used to.  Sound quality is excellent. One reviewer complained about static when the eq was set to SRS WOW - It's not the player.  Mine did the same thing until I upgraded the head phones.  I bought it for Rhapsody to Go.  It works great with it.  (Rhapsody could do a little better job with their software but don't blame Phillips for that.)     Pros - Excellent sound, especially with a headphones upgrade; easy to use, cool controls (not mechanical).  Works well with Rhapsody.    Cons - Not as many features as an IPOD - such as not as many EQ settings.  The volume won't hammer your ears like some players but its loud enough to leave my ears ringing.  Some of the newer MP3 players have more features like video and more flexibility downloading photos.  It can take a couple of seconds moving between menus.  That doesn't bother me.    It really depends on what you're looking for.  But for $199 and 30 Meg, it's a pretty good deal - especially if your main thing is the music.

<Title>Good MP3 Player for someone who knows how to use it.
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First Impressions: Awesome looking MP3 player. Awesome interface after you get to know your way arround, and get used to the controls. Good audio quality, no problems there.   A Deeper Look: The black face of the player does often get smudged and 'greasy' , but nothing a quick whiping back and forth on your shirt wount solve. Syncing the device was challanging. I would have rather just opened the device as an external hard drive and maunaly dumped the data into it but unfortunatly Philips, in all its wisdom, changes they way things are labed and organised and I could never find the song I wanted. SO, a hard  swipe of the hard drive and a proper syncing and all was well!!! At leasd I knew where things were, even if they were labeled Philips' way.       Extream Negative: My screen broke!!! I didn't drop it, I didn't smash it, it just broke!!! However,to end this section on a posative note (I waited untill I had actualy done this so I could include it in my review) the Philips Costomer Service crew I corresponded with, Mario and Lavurn, were very help full and my device is currently in the proccess of being exchanged.

<Title>The problem's not with the player
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wish I'd given as much thought to purchasing this mp3 player as I give to professional system evaluations. But the experience has been instructive, since it reflects what often happens with new, complex toys.  I chose the Philips player because (1) it's not an iPod, (2) it's made for use with Windows, and (3) it has lots of storage. Why no iPod? Don't like proprietary systems (as if Windows wasn't proprietary). Why Windows? All my stuff is Windows. Why lots of storage? I have a goodly CD library.  Over the last three months, my thinking has sorted out. First, the machine is handsome and well-made. The only drawback, and it's a serious one, is that eventually I will need to replace the battery. The cost has been mentioned elsewhere. But there's a bigger problem: when I get ready to replace the battery, will Philips be providing support? I worry about this when I see that the store where I bought the toy three months ago has not stocked any more since Christmas.   (Note 1: The earphones come with three sets of foam plugs, for three different sizes of ear canal. All well and good. But what happens if you lose a plug? Can you get a replacement? Philips sells a package of accessories for $40[!] which might have extras in it. But my local vendor does not stock it.)  (Note 2: Another thing in the accessories pak is a carrying case. What you get with the toy out-of-the-box is a nice, tight-fitting sleeve that has no facility for attaching it to anything. After much searching, at a crafts store I found a large, simple pin used by knitters. For $1.29 I made the sleeve into a pin-on pocket that goes great on my sweatshirt.)  (Note 3: The toy uses a standard 30-pin IO port at the bottom and a standard small stereo plug at the top. The advantages of standardization: for $20 I interfaced the toy to my old Kenwood stereo amp through the phono input [which, in case you forget, has a preamp built in]. The disadvantage, so to speak: there's no guarantee that the Philips machine will fit into docking stations designed for the iPod, which also has the standard 30-pin port. The Philips machine's footprint may well be too large. So test first.)  Second, I've spent an ungodly amount of time fighting the toy's integration with Windows Media Player. The toy comes with WMP 10 on CD. But it took a call to Customer Support to learn that that version is customized with plug-ins specific to the Philips machine. That means you can't just use the copy of WMP that came with Windows, and you can't respond to Microsoft's nags to upgrade to WMP 11. Philips has accommodated the WMP 11 beta, but the company provides no information about when WMP 11 (and necessary firmware upgrade) for the HDD6330 will be available. Again, will it ever? (Update: A different Philips Customer Support person denies that the WMP provided with the device has custom plug-ins. I leave it to you, the reader, to decide the implications of that.)  Third, Philips' business partners--Microsoft, All Music Guide, and the mp3 download vendors--do not have their ducks in a row. Microsoft doesn't provide adequate documentation for the WMP database and the problems it can create for Microsoft's filenaming system. You can specify a standard filename for your files, then find that half the files never get registered in the database because the filenames are either too long or use unsupported foreign characters.   As for AMG, that company and sometimes Microsoft too are credited as the source for the album information you download. But transcribing that information has been outsourced to many smaller companies, each of which has its own standards (if any). There are lots of errors, and AMG refuses to take responsibility for their subcontractors' errors.  I can't say much about the download vendors, since I don't buy from them. But I do know that different PC manufacturers have deals with different vendors, and you can't change that in WMP.  In sum, an interesting toy like the Philips HDD6330 does grow on you, but if you're an adult who cares about music, be prepared to spend a lot of time doing what Philips, Microsoft, and others should have done for you.

The included ones, the Etymotic ER4S, the Koss Sporta Pros, 2 versions of the Extreme Isolation Headphones (one 32ohms, one 64ohms) and even some pair of beaters lying around.  Harsh, nasty, unpleasant.  It never produced any MP3 with anything but a digital, harsh quality to it.

<Content>When I saw the different mp3 players online I figured I wanted one that held an large amount of music with different options. So that made me compare the Philips and Creative Labs and when it came to the end I discovered buying the philips because of the price and the source of something reliable. When I received this mp3 in the mail I liked it's style and options that came with it. And so far it seems to work fine except the factor that finger prints are easy to view on the screen but otherwise this is something I would recommend to anyone who likes music and wants something at a good price range and that's reliable.

<Title>IPOD Killer Wannabe
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If Philips would just put a little more into this product it definitely could be an IPOD killer.  I too purchased it because I did not want an Ipod and the price was so much better.  I read alot of the negative reviews but also positives.  As an FYI on a case, look for Body Glove's Cellsuit for Smartphones - get the one that will fit the Treo 650.  I have a Treo and realized that this player was almost the same size, it works wonderfully.  Also, the complaints about the screen are solved by investing in Boxwave's screen protector - protects against scratches also.  There are many positives - sound is awesome; built in radio is a real positive. I found it extremely simple to connect to WMP and the Philips software which was required was a small price versus what an Ipod requires.  I agree with some of the negatives - volume level is off, you have to almost take it to the max to get a decent level.  Battery indicator is off, it shows almost completely depleted after a short period of use.  Wish there were more accessories, but it keeps me from spending the thousands that you can invest with an Ipod - I really just do not understand why Philips is not investing more in this product.

<Title>WAY UNDERRATED
<Date>Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'll start by saying that I've owned this Mp3 player for a little over a year. Because of some of the scarier doom and gloom reviews I have been reluctant to post a review... I didn't want to jinx my good luck, and I also wanted to make sure I had enough time to find all the little quirks and/or issues that could arise... but now I'm ready...  after all this time I still find myself occasionally in awe of what a sleek, and sexy machine this is... the blue glow of the touch screen contrasted with the smooth black surfaces makes it by far the best looking mp3 player on the market. At first I was afraid it might not be durable but it has taken its fare share of bumps, bruises, and even several drops with no adverse effects... The surface does smudge with finger prints, but as many people have pointed out, a quick wipe off with your shirt sleeve can make it disappear. I actually placed a clear plastic adhesive protector on top and have had no smudge issues since.  The sound quality with the provided headphones is average at best, but why anyone would buy a 30 gig mp3 player and then use stock headphones is beyond me. A small investment of a decent pair of headphones upgrades the sound quality from average to excellent.  Transferring music files via WMP has never been an issue for me. I've got maybe 2500-3000 songs. No complaints.  Pictures and playlists were a little bit more complicated. I had to do a little research on the Philips website to figure out some the file name issue, but my problem was actually so simple I felt dumb afterwards. I've since added a couple hundred pictures and a handful of playlists with ease.   The battery life seems to be okay, I usually only use it for a max of maybe 4-5 hours in day so I couldn't really give an accurate estimate on that... Some reviews have expressed a fear that they'll have to one day replace the battery, but I haven't had that issue. But I will agree with several reviewers who have said the battery indicator is suspect. It's usually okay, but I've had a couple of instances where after maybe an hour or two of listening the indicator started to blink like the battery was about to give out, but then it played for several more hours with no problem.  The only other issue I can think of is that my player would occasionally (once or twice a month) freeze up and I'd have to do the manual reset (power off and hit the volume up button) but everything would always load back up with no problem. The 30 seconds without music being the only consequence... but since the last firmware update I haven't had a single freeze.  I'd like to see some more accessories available as well... but aside from that, I've had no issues. Best Buy seems to no long carry the item, so maybe there is something to some of the negative reviews... but all I can attest to is the fact that I've had a great experience with my Philips player.  I have no reservations what so ever in recommending this player, especially at the current price of $160.00. That's a steal.

<Content>I've read most of the reviews and I must say that most people don't read or understand how these products work. That's why products like the IPOD are so successful, they are meant for people who can't think or care to read how a it works are frustrate easily. While the gogear is not without its issues it is a solid mp3 player and meets the needs of the general public. But when you read these rants that people go on, it seems more are concerned about it's look rather than the value.  Remember, if you don't want to think then you must pay!

<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I haven't had any problems with things disappearing or anything like that.  It has frozen probably 3 times in the 4 months I've had  it.  I set it down for a few hours, let the battery run out, and charged it back up.  Everything was still there--no problems (it's possible I have a bad mp3 on there).  The only issue I'm having with it isn't the mp3 player--it's me being a Linux-noob (trying to figure out how to mount it so it can copy and paste like an external hard drive).  The slide is really easy to use, and I like the fast scroll feature on it.  I also really like how I can change the volume while it's on hold.  It is a bit quiet at max, but it's loud enough to drown out the noise my brother and sister listen to.  At max it's a bit too loud to be good for your ears anyway.  I'm pretty happy with it.  For those having problems with syncing STOP USING AUTOMATIC SYNC!  Just set it for manual sync.  Then it just adds the new songs, and it's very very fast.

<Content>I've had my Philips HDD6330 for about a month.  Overall I've been very pleased with it.  The Sync feature to automatically transfer new music from your PC to the player took about 20-30 minutes to figure out (a CD that walks you through the process was included with my player).  I had one issue where new licensed content from MSN Music wouldn't load onto the player.  The customer service rep was courteous and helpful, and their advice solved the problem.  Fortunately that problem has not recurred.  I have not had any issues with locking up or loss of saved music that I've seen occassionally from other reviewers.  Regarding other players out there...I passed on the IPod because I didn't want to deal with only having the option of downloading in the Apple's proprietary format or .mp3.  I was very interested in the Creative Labs Zen player, but availability was poor and I didn't have time to wait for back order shipments.  Since I don't have a need for playing video, the HDD 6330 suits my needs well.

Here is what I've experienced with my Philips 30GB player: 1)Customer service is friendly and they go out of their way to help you with your questions. However, some people don't bother reading directions and they end up damaging the player or doing things incorrectly. 2) The battery life will only give you the max if you know how to charge a battery.  If you don't do it right then you will not get the max time out of your battery. Again, read the directions! 3) The product has as much, or more "cool appeal" than the IPOD, and why pay $200 for a 6GB Ipod when you can spend $230 and get 30GB? 4)The music transfers a lot faster than I thought and it's so easy to do, however, some people don't read directions and they don't understand how to transfer playlists or individual songs. 5) The headphones are OK to start, and the max volume is good for me although if you like your music very loud then it might be an issue. 6) Occasionally the system freezes, but it's so easy to re-set it. 7) No mp3 player is without its flaws. 8) It's great to have the built-in radio, something the Ipod dosn't offer. 9) It comes with a nice case which saves you from buying one for $30 with the Ipod. 10) You can transfer data from your mp3 player to your computer, unlike the Ipod. 11) Overall, I am so glad I went with this over other players. This one doesn't have video, but all I care about is music, so if you really want video than go for another player.

<Title>With Newer Firmware, Much Better
<Date>Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At first, I was telling people to not buy this product because of the hogging system resources and slow response on the player. Now that the new firmware has (finally) been released, the product is much better. It almost never freezes on me, the response time is much quicker and PC-player sync times are much shorter. The battery life is not much to be praised for, but it lasts around 9-12 hours for me.

<Title>Stay Away, FAR AWAY!
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought 2 of these (for my wife and I) because they were $100 off at a local store.  At first when I was only putting 10-20 albums on them they seemed to work just fine.  Then I started ripping all of my albums and trying to add them as well as some pictures that I was trying to put on, and everything broke down.  Where to begin...I spend days trying to fix these things, reading about them, trying to auto sync, manual sync, reset, anything I found posted by anyone to get them working properly, with no success.  Half of the time when I plugged it into the PC it thought that it was a brand new device and tried to re-sync everything from scratch, but then ran out of room since it was already all on there.  Syncing took hours (20GB of songs) and then when it was done most of the time none of the songs were accessible on the device.  And both of them had the same problem.  I don't know if it is windows media player, this device, a combination, but after the first week neither one worked well again.  The only good thing about these is that the store let us return them for a full refund after our month of agony.  So now we own an 80 GB and 30 GB iPod and have not had any of the problems we did with the Philips devices.  As a side note, both my wife and I are computer programmers, so it is not like we are technologically impaired.  I spend days trying to debug these things, and am usually very good at finding ways around bugs, but these were riddled with them.  I don't know if every windows based mp3 player has similar problems or if it is just this one, but I do know that our iPods work much much better.

<Title>Love times 2
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product for my husband about 5 months ago because it had so many functions (in-line recording (from say a CD player, radio, anything that has an audio output jack), a voice recorder, an FM tuner, photo capabilities, etc.) and options for adding music and other audio files that I could not find per se in an IPod or in a Creative MP3 player.  I brought it home for him, set it up for him, and eventually wanted to steal it from him.  So, a few months after purchasing my first one, I bought a SECOND one for me.  And, I'm still happy with it and he is still happy with his.  These MP3 players need someone who isn't all impatient and all fumble-fingers.  They also need someone who will take the time to read the manual and understand a few things about the player like the soft-reset function and the need to update the firmware when new firmware comes out.  Maybe the IPods and the Creative MP3 players aren't in need of so much love and care, but maybe it is because they don't offer all the functions and capabilities that the Phillips HDD6330/17 30 GB MP3 Player.  However, as far as Creative players go and customer service issues, I have found Phillips Customer Service to be more pleasant and helpful than Creative's customer service.  (I contacted Phillips Customer Service not because of a problem but rather looking for an additional accessory for my MP3 player.)  With regard to Creative, one time I ordered an MP3 player from Creative online and after waiting about a month and not ever receiving the thing, I finally contacted customer service who said that they were in process of moving their factory and implied that somewhere in the bowels and depths of their website it said that (although I never found it) and that somehow I should have known that the MP3 player I had ordered as a gift would not come until they were good and ready to ship it (although I don't know how I was to divine such a thing since they certainly didn't mention it as I was placing my order for a birthday gift for my little sister).  So, in the end, I ended up cancelling my order with them and going another route which by that time was an emergency birthday buy since I had to ship it to another state altogether.  So, the moral of the story is, I don't think any company is perfect and the helpful customer service agent comes with the luck of the draw.  I have found Phillips and two of Phillips' 30GB MP3 players to be wonderful products for my needs and that of my husband's.  Would I buy a third 30GB MP3 player from Phillips -- Sure I would and with pleasure.  *******Update - December 20, 2006******* I thought you might find this interesting.  The other night I was bringing my Phillips 30 GB MP3 player in from my car.  I had it in a bag but was carrying other things in as well but I guess at some point between going from the car and into my house, it slipped out of the bag and fell on the ground unbeknownst to me.  The next day, it rained during the night and in the morning.  I didn't know that my MP3 player was out there laying on the ground in the rain until later in the day (around 3 p.m. maybe a little later) I went out to my car to do some errands when I found it not too far from my car.  It had a little mud on it.  I was afraid that it was ruined.  Cautiously and with my fingers crossed I started it up and, thankfully, it booted right up with no problems.  I don't recommend this as a test to see if another branded MP3 player could or would stand a night on the cold ground enduring a few hours of rain, but I do wonder if I had bought a different MP3 player how it would have came out of the same conditions.

<Title>Do not buy! BAD CHRISTMAS GIFT!
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Looks sleek, but has no accessories!  Freezes up all the time, and it rearranges all your song information even after you have adjusted the tags.  Good luck finding your music.  I bought this because I am not an Apple fan, and I trusted the Phillips name to continue to produce quality products.  But they are slowly depleting their product line.  You can tell by the lack of retailers that supply their MP3 products.  When you do find one, they are generally marked down so significanly that it's apparent they are on clearance.  You can't even get docking stations, cables/connectors, or speakers from their website anymore.  The email contact information for all their MP3 merchandise is mysteriously unavailable right before Christmas.  They blatantly aren't behind this product category.  I will never buy a Phillips product again.

<Title>Well-designed, but with a significant flaw
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used this player for about a week when my Zen Micro's audio jack died. I really liked the sleek design, with the touch-sensitive light-up controls, and I found the directional UI to be very intuitive.  However, the reason I returned this player is because the interface was slow. Painfully slow. It often took up to 5 seconds to transition between screens, especially during playback. This was completely unacceptable, so I exchanged the player for an 8GB Zen Micro Photo.  It is a shame, though, since if this had been better tested and marketed, it could have been a true iPod-killer.  One other thing to note: the bundled headphones are beautiful. They are of the canalphone type, and they fit well and have excellent audio quality.

<Title>This is my THIRD GoGear!!!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been reading all these reviews about the GoGear and had to share my experience with the product.  I bought the 2G about 2 years ago, and filled it to capacity, it fit almost 500 songs comfortably. So bought the 6G, and pretty much filled that to capacity, almost 1,000 songs plus pics w/ no problems, SO  I bought the 30G, I have 1,386 songs so far and still I have over 22G left, this thing is amazing, I'm sorry to all those who have had problems with GoGear, Like I said this is my 3rd with absolutely no problems whatsoever, I sold the first 2 to a coworker for her kids and they've not had any problems either, or she would have told me. I just bought my husband the 6G for Xmas, and will probably buy one for my son.   Couple things- When you're listening to a song and want to scroll for another one, you have to PAUSE the song you're listening to and then scroll, the songs will FLY by, if you don't, it does lag a bit. When you find the one you want, simply hit play and it will pick up where it left off. And I love how you can hit the right arrow and it will go to the next song immediately.[...]
