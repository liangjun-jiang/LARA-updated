<Title>THE UNTENDED UNDERLING IN THE iPOD FAMILY
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to buy a no-nonsense mp3 player to keep me company while running. No video, no funky display menus, no labyrinthine software to work with. If I wanted to spend half a day getting my music in order I'd shell for the 80 gig iPod.   So I got myself a Shuffle, by far the sleekest small pod in the market.   But boy did I regret it.   After the one-time registration and initialization (which is not optional) the lemon wouldn't get the songs on it, thanks to the infamous "Disk not found error". Googled for it and discovered websites that are brimming with untended complaints; I'm on Windows XP, but the glitch seems to pervade operating systems.   Spent a day battling with the idiosyncrasies. Downloaded and installed an extra utility that Apple's Help site recommends. Enabled the Shuffle "for disk use". Reset it to factory settings and tried all over again, five times. And I'm a fairly persistent tech-savvy one. I did everything that's needed and more, but the stupid thing will still not remember the settings, will not let me change songs, and so on.    Tired with all of this rigmarole, I got a Creative Zen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S5TYQI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">Stone Plus</a>. It's a little larger than the Shuffle, but you can see why--Shuffle doesn't have a display and it uses the same jack for charging and earphones so you can only do one of those at a time. Stone Plus on the other hand connects through a small non-spaghetti USB cable, comes up instantly as a new drive on your PC, you copy the mp3 files from your music folder to this drive, and you're done.   I was up and running in 5 minutes flat. Can't help kicking myself for having fallen for the iPod luster.   Without becoming any clunkier in any meaningful way (both the doohickeys are pretty small), Stone Plus shows me the song that's playing, which I don't see on Shuffle. Stone Plus has an FM radio, a voice recorder, a timer, and a digital clock--none of which the Shuffle has. It charges in 5 minutes, which the Shuffle doesn't. I can use iTunes or any other tool or even nothing at all, but with Shuffle I am in an unhappy marriage with iTunes. The Stone Plus will hold about 1000 songs in comparison to Shuffle's 200 at the same bit-rate.   Because this is Creative, the company known among geeks for its speakers, the ear phones that come with the Stone Plus have a fabulous combination of bass and treble that will please the most fastidious connoisseur. After hearing them Shuffle's white thingies sound tinny and childish. I got my Stone Plus with a clip that makes it much more practical for running.   And all of it at 60% of the cost of a basic bare-bones Shuffle.   Sorry, Apple folks, in the small-mp3-player market Apple is simply the beautiful blond bimbo who trips on high heels at ten paces. If you're in the market for a nifty little mp3 player, skip the Shuffle. Even in the 3rd generation it's a 3rd rate contender.

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - A steep price for a starter MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> The iPod Shuffle second generation is a great MP3 player for working out or running, especially if you are a die-hard Apple fan.  However, the steep price means you had better review all your options before you choose this.  Pros - Small size - Nice case design - Many color options - Highly durable player - Apple reputation  Cons - High price point - Less durable shell - Proprietary dock for syncing - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability - iTunes software with limited formats (MP3, AAC) - No screen, FM tuner or line in recording - Competing products offer more capacity for less $$  The Form Factor  This little guy is small!  The body has a spring loaded clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt without any extra case.  Apple added a few extra color options with the 3rd generation, including the popular purple.  It comes in a composite case. The 2nd generation's case seems more durable than the 3rd.  The basic controls remain the same (fast forward, rewind, pause, and play) to access your music collection.  There is a headphone jack which you also use to mount this on the sync dock.  A standard USB B port would have been preferable to this as well.  Storage Capacity  Apple made it available only in 1GB sizes, same as the 2nd generation.  It would have made more sense to bump it up to at least 2GB.  The competing Zen Stone Plus by Creative offers 2GB (twice the songs), an FM tuner and the ability to see song titles for less money.  Sandisk also has some lower capacity Sansa models at similar price points. Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB MP3 Player Zen Stone Plus 2GB Black <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP50AY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk Sansa c150 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD40N8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">Sandisk Sansa Express 1 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IM9542/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Durability  Apple definitely deserves point for the more durable player in this group.  Even with the new player composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse.  There will be some failures, but for the most part these hold up well.  Software  When you only have 1GB to fill, having to use iTunes software to do it seems excessive.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  For those that care about file options, Apple's software allows only MP3 and AAC.  You can convert other formats to these, but be aware of the limits.  Sound  The sound this unit produces is pretty good for it's size.  However, it's just ok.  I still feel the first generation shuffle sounded much better, but the trade off was it was much longer.  Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $65.  Sandisk Sansa has similarly priced models.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.  Overall this is a good player at a price that could be less.  Weigh your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>  shuffle problems
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product from another store. Within 8 months it quit working. The salesperson said they had a lot of problems but I liked its convenience and size so I just got a new one. It too broke within another month. This time the sales person said: what do expect for that money." Huh? I refused another one and got my money back.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHGJ50/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5192348-2910412">Apple 1 GB iPod shuffle Silver (3rd Generation)</a>

<Title>Ideal for a runner
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The shuffle lives up to the Apple ads. Extremely easy to use, while very light.   I replaced an MP3 player that I use for running that died, so I was extremely interested in the clip feature. At first I was skeptical that it would actually stay in place -- thought I would have to purchase the armband. I was pleasantly suprised. In fact, ran ~13 miles while it was hooked to my waistband and it didn't budge. There are a few arm straps that you can buy from aftermarket vendors (e.g. DLO), but it's not necessary.  If you are going to use primarily for running/exercising, I would opt for the shuffle over the nano. It's very rugged, inexpensive and simple to use.  Enjoy.

<Title>Piece of Crap
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am so disgusted with this product.  I expected to be able to use it right out of the box but instead I have to wait 4 hours for the stupid thing to charge.  It is basically useless until it's charged.  I just think Apple should make this thing usable out of the box instead of a dead lifeless piece of crap.  I am very disapointed.  I didn't buy this so I could sit and wait 4 hours to use it.  The battery should already be charged when you purchase it.

<Title>I'm Won Over from being Totally Uninterested in an iPod
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I listen to a lot of music, most of it classical. I review classical CDs here at Amazon. When my daughter-in-law gave me the iPod shuffle for Christmas I didn't even know what it was or what it was capable of. But since she showed me how to use it, how to download into it and the other little things one learns to do, I've become a convert. This little package of amazing engineering is a real jewel. My only concern is that I'll wear out my ears using it.   I think the best thing about it that I can use it while working away in the wee hours when to have loudspeakers going would wake the family. And, of course, on walks, which are a regular feature of my life in this small town where one walks everywhere rather than drive just a few blocks. Just load up a program -- it's easy as pie to load the shuffle with a program that you're interested in -- and start walking. I've been able to use my expensive over-the-ear headphones with the iPod, being amazed that this little thing can drive those big headphone speakers.   It loads quickly. Downloading an entire CD will take only five minutes if that long. Sound quality is just fine. I don't detect any significant degradation of the sound.   My daughter-in-law is getting tired of me thanking her for the gift.  Scott Morrison

<Title>Why so complicated and unfriendly?
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a long-time pc user with a lot of experience on the marketing side of the industry, serving as a consultant to several of the largest OEM's. I'm also a stickler for customer service.  As further background, I have owned several generations of MP3 players, and struggled with crummy documentation and interfaces. Well, Apple is the champ of user unfriendliness. Forgetting for a moment that once the Shuffle is up and running it sounds pretty good, lets just think about you, the customer.  - Horrific documentation in the box to let one know that one has to go out and find, independent of any pointers, the software to make the device operate (come on geniuses at Apple, why not a few web pages in the quick start guide)  - None, zip, startup software --- not even a readme file to help  - Absolutely no drag and drop capability (I bought a third party program to do this)  -iTunes takes forever (and on my computer is always trying to connect me to the web site; all I want to do is listen to selections from a thousand or so cd's I've made into MP3s)  - Cannot use iTunes on more than one computer without having to erase all songs from the device (what kind of stupid system is this? One travels and visits a friend and wants to borrow a couple of tunes; you're dead in the water buddy)  Then there's the battery matter. Wear one out and, for all intents and purposes, you're out the cost of a new Shuffle. Go figure, but isn't Apple the company that killed the concept of backward compatible software for its customers.....)  I'll load mine up with a few hundred tunes (it does play MP3 Pro, my preferred mode) and use it sometimes on walks and airplanes (which its excellent volume level will give my noise reduction headphones a boost), but for normal listing -- choosing a select few albums and playing whatever tracks I want to hear, I'll stick with my other players (a current favorite being a little Lexar device that plays directly off a Lexar Sport flash drive, has a display, runs on replacable AAA batteries and isn't all that much larger than the Shuffle and its associated dock and cable).   Bottom line: A highly specialized little device that seems an afterthought to plugging iTunes purchases and not caring much about creating a good impression of Apple. It took me the better part of an afternoon to get this thing working so I am modestly comfy. You pays your money and you takes your chances that you'll be back in the bad ole days when getting anything to work was a chore. Come on Apple, hop into the 21st century and  think simplification and 'customer first'.

<Title>Technically challenged?  The ipod shuffle is the gadget for you!
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I confess, I am technically challenged.  I've held off getting an ipod because I thought I would never be able to figure out how to use it.  Well the introduction of this new shuffle and the thought of having all that music in that tiny little clip-on was too much to resist.  Well I got one for Christmas and just looking at that tiny thing was fun.  Apple did a great job of packaging it in a nifty clear plastic box.  The instructions couldn't be easier and they include a little cheat sheet that you can carry with you until you get the hang of it.  The software was easily downloaded even for someone like me.  Charging the shuffle takes a few hours and it simply plugs into your USB port on your computer.  I tackled all that last night.  Today I decided to download some tunes off a CD into the ipod via the Itunes software.  It couldn't have been easier.  Plug in the ipod to the computer, slip a CD into the computer, load it, and then drag and drop the songs you want into your ipod.  I am rocking to the songs I downloaded as I type this review!  It was that simple, fast and easy.  A couple of things of note; the sound is very good, and if you are not an audiophile, you will more than likely be quite happy.  The ear buds (while not my favorite, I prefer headphones) fit fairly comfortably although please note they include a package of two sets of covers but are not marked as such.  That being said, the covers are pretty delicate and you'll have to be careful putting them on the buds.  I am sure there is still a lot to learn about my shuffle, but so far the learning curve has been very fast and easy.  I love being in the 21st century!

<Title>My first ipod
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have always wanted an ipod. I just either didn't have the money or know which model to get. I was thrilled when I finally got an ipod, specifically the ipod shuffle, as a gift for Christmas. I had the option to trade the ipod shuffle in for a nano but I decided on the shuffle. 240-250 songs was plenty for me. Secondly I liked the compact features especially when it comes to listening to music at work. For me personally having over 200 songs on my iPod is more than enough. Secondly when I am at work, I don't really have the time to mess with the thing depending on my musical mood.  The two somewhat minor gripes I had about the iPod shuffle was downloading iTunes on to the computer and the ear buds. If you have dial up and on AOL, you want to DL'd itunes via Internet Explorer or some sort of separate browser (especially if your OS is Windows). Don't do it through AOL. You will get a Win32 error message. There is a technical support message board on Apple's website that you can refer to if all else fails but downloading iTunes via IE or another browser (that isn't AOL) should do the trick.  The other gripe is the earbuds. They can become very uncomfortable after awhile. I don't know why Apple can't improve on the earbuds. If they can improve the ipod, then they can improve the earbuds. I have to switch to my earphones that I used on my computer at work when I listened to cds. Would it be asking too much for Apple to create a more comfortable pair of ear buds for  the iPod?   Overall I love my ipod shuffle. I was quite pleased that the ipod attaches to my clothing nice and snug. It does not fall off very easily. I don't have to worry about having to lock up my ipod when I walk away from my desk for awhile. I can simply throw it into my pocket. I am very happy with my ipod.

<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first iPod, and i love it, really. The old shuffle costed twice - these days other DAPs are cheaper anyway, including sony's, so that is maybe the reason - but this one is a really a beauty. The clip is really practical. This is a thing to wear, not only to listen to. I love how podcasts are automatically placed on the beginning of the playlist for easy finding. And how it turns off when i remove the headphones.  So if you really don't care for a screen - believe, i'm not missing it that much - and want the smallest and lightest, and also cheap, go for the shuffle.

<Content>Nice player, nice size. For $80, a good buy.   This player feels like quality with its satin aluminum finish and very solid clip. Tiny and light, the only danger is that you might lose it.  Sound quality is excellent but there is a small amount of hiss at high volumes during quite passages.   The only drawback is that there is no display. You can use this player two ways. The most likely way is in Shuffle mode -- load it with music you like and let it go. It's like listening to a radio station that only plays what you like.  The other way is to load it with an ordered play list and listen in order. Good for audiobooks, for instance.   Interface via iTunes is smoothly done, easy to manage.

<Title>Great Little MP3 Player!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After spending several hours doing a comparison of mp3 players in regards to brand, model, features, and price....as well as a thorough review of the feedback left by other customers in regards to this item and the others offered by Amazon, I decided to go with the !Pod Shuffle. I am certainly glad that I did. It's about the size of a money clip (although  a little thicker) and doesn't have a ton of "bells and whistles", which didn't interest me anyway. When I got it all set up and used it for the first time, I realized that I had made the right choice. The !Tunes software is incredibly easy to use, making it very easy to transfer songs from your favorite CDs and to buy mp3s from !Tunes store (they are 99 cents a song....which I think that is pretty reasonable). You can find just about any song you are looking for,from religious to hard rock to rap. Within a few minutes, the software uploads all of your selected music onto the !pod, and you are ready to go. I commute to college every day on the subway, and was used to bringing along my CD player and a few CDs which took up a lot of room in my bag. It was a waste of space, considering the fact that there are some CDS where I may only like half the songs on it, or even less. Now, I have only the songs that I REALLY like listening to on it. As of now, I have 170 songs stored on it, and still have enough room for a lot more. I would strongly suggest doing a lot of comparison shopping before you decide on one, but I would certainly recommend this little gem. Also, it would be worth spending the extra 10 bucks for the extended service plan. It gave me some extra peace of mind. So anyways....considering the price and the features, the user friendliness of the software and the device as well as the !pod reputation, this is one certainly worth considering for purchase. I certainly love mine.

<Title>Do not buy an Ipod, especially the Shuffle
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Did you know that when you use Itunes to download or import CDs, the shuffle can only be used with one computer?  That's right, if you do your work on one, you will have to erase and start over if you plan to use the shuffle with a different computer.  No one told me this...Do not be fooled by the cute size....it is a trap and a way for apple to bank from each .99 download you have to keep purchasing to replace all of your erased music.  Which by the way, everytime you attempt to troubleshoot, they tell you to "restore" the Ipod which means "erase"...cha-ching for them.  Do not buy an Ipod.

<Content>As far as I'm concerned, it's a perfect product... it's not expensive, it's beautiful, it's easy to use, it's incredibly (but not too) small, and it does everything you want it to do.  If you can use a cassette player, you can definitely use the shuffle.  And if you can keep track of a piece of jewelry, you can keep track of one without loosing it.  I just got one for Christmas, and I've had no problems with it.  It's a joy to use.  The attention to detail is incredible, and I haven't been able to scratch it or dirty it so far with normal, unprotected use.  And I definitely use it more than my full sized iPod.  Highly recommended... and to other reviewers, please try one out before bashing it.

<Title>Cute and functional
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yesterday, I finally treated myself to an iPod shuffle (gen 2) for the gym.  I have a gen 4 that I use in my SUV, but wanted something smaller.  So far, I am enjoying it.  Setup was easy (downloading iTunes on cable modem is a must!), charging, and loading the songs was pretty quick also.  I bought the gen 1 for my husband, which he still loves!  However it does not have the hand clip.  He has to put it into a cumbersome armband case thingy that does not work well at all.  Apparently, this design issue is still an issue, see below:  My only complaint is regarding the available DLO armband for the gym.  First, it consists of 2 separate pieces: a "sleeve" and a velcro band.  You have to hold the shuffle open (press the clip) and shimmy this silly sleeve in place.  Once that is done, you clip it to the band.  The problem is that the sleeve does not have cut outs for the on/off switch!  So, to turn the shuffle on and off, you would need to take it in and out of this sleeve.  I wish that I hadn't wasted my money on the band.  A smarter solution would probably be to put on those old fleece workout bands and clip the shuffle to that.  So, poor design on the sleeve, and the cost was $19.99!

<Title>Look no further...
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm the kind of person that doesn't care much about flash and gadgets and hype.  I have a fifteen year old car, my favorite clothes are my old jeans and flannel shirts and I like a good peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  I hate cellphones and absolutely hate the tumors growing out of people's ears today called Bluetooth.  Hell, I still listen to vinyl.     That being said...  Forget the original iPod, forget the Nano.  If you are in it for the music, look no further.  I don't care about a screen, I don't care about song listings, I don't need to watch videos and I am certainly not in it to show off that I have an iPod.  Music, period.  This, then, is a great device if any of of the above resonates.  It's plain, functional, simple and works great.  It's unbelievably small and is able to be hidden or tucked away so as not to be seen.  It's even smaller than I first imagined.  It's made of a tougher alloy than the plastic of the original and is thus able to withstand a bit more being bumped around.  It's got very few buttons which makes it very easy and they make sense.  As someone else here noted it is quite intuitive to use.  Just pay attention to how the songs are loaded and remember it.  That's all there is to it.  The interface on iTunes is a piece of cake to use.  Easy to organize and very fast synching.  Just click, drag and drop.    For those who have noted an issue with having no bass, iTunes has an EQ option that resolves this issue.  If you go to 'View' on the menu bar and click 'Show Equalizer' you can personally adjust the equalier.  Or, if you right click on the toolbar above the song listing in the music library you can select 'Equalizer' and it will show on the toolbar where you can choose from a whole bunch of presets.  Or you can select the songs you wish, right click, go to GetInfo and look for the Equalizer preset setting.  Get familiar with the EQ and the problem is pretty much solved.  You can't really blame the player for lacking bass.  The Shuffle itself is a playback device, that's it.  And for that it is great.  No clutter, no muss, no fuss.    The other factor thing to consider in terms of the sound quality is the bitrate of the songs that are downloaded.  A 56 kbps download is going to sound pretty lame when compared to a 128 kbps bitrate, and really lame when compared to a bitrate of 320 kbps.  At the MP3 player level it won't be as noticeable but put it in a booming audio system and you'll hear the difference.  Manufacturer CDs are of a high quality.  Burned CDs are where the variation lies.    One drawback is the headphones that come with it.  Invest in a different pair.  I have a set of over-the-ear headphones and they sound great with this little bugger.    If I have one legitimate gripe it would be with the gapless playback of iTunes.  For some reason (that I have yet to figure out) even though there is no "gap" during songs during a continuous DJ mix, there is still a very brief silence between tracks that you don't hear on the CD that throws off listening to the mix on the iPod.  I'm not sure if this is an iTunes flaw or an iPod flaw but it is really, really annoying though not quite enough to knock this down a notch.  I have to go to an outside CD ripper in order to compress an entire mix into one single MP3 in order to get the smooth flow.  Kind of a hassle.  Hopefully, it's longevity will be proven over time.  If it craps out over the next few months or something I might be singing a different tune.  But so far so good.

<Title>I love the new clip feature.
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned a 4th generation iPod and thought it was great. One thing about the iPod is I was always worried about it falling or where I could store it while I walked around and it was a bit heavy in my hoodie pocket. I got the new Shuffle in November and love it! I don't need more that 250 of my favorite songs and I just clip it and go. Another great thing is I can exercise with this a lot easier than my old iPod. This is perfect for younger kids and I like the option where you can choose the maximum volume your iPod can be played on iTunes. I think this'll be a plus for parents who don't want their kids damaging their hearing with listening to music that's too loud. I gave it 4 stars because there is no lock switch that makes it so even when the dial is pressed the volume or song doesn't change.  EDIT: I just learned the Shuffle does have a hold mode, you hold down the play button for 3 seconds. Awesome! I now give this 5 stars.

<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'll be honest.  The main reason I bought this iPod was because it was so darn cute! It plays as well as my other iPods and is perfect to use at work or when running around on the weekend doing errands- you don't have to worry about having to carry one of the larger ones in your purse or clipped on a belt and possibly dropping it or having it bump against something and scratch (or worse).  Just clip this puppy to your shirt or pocket and you're on your way. I love it!

<Title>The Perfect Workout Companion
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>About two years ago I bought a full-fledged iPod to use while I did my daily walk and jog.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the device made it impracticle and I was always afraid that I was going to drop it or that it would get damaged during my workout.  So back to the store it went a few days later.  I stuck with my trusty portable radio and decided that maybe I wasn't meant to be part of the iPod generation.  One day a co-worker recommended I look into the iPod Shuffle because of its size.  At first, I was skeptical -- something that small couldn't possibly do much -- but I purchased one to give it a shot.  After my first outing with it on my daily workout I was hooked and never looked back.  Some of us just want to listen to music -- we don't need pictures and videos.  The iPod shuffle fits this bill perfectly.  It's compact design lets you enjoy your favorite music selections on the go without having to worry about carrying around the larger versions.  The clip design makes it easy to clip it onto your pocket or even -- as I have discovered during my workouts -- the cuff of your shirt.  It weighs next to nothing and you'll never know it is even there!  I am able to get about 145 songs onto the shuffle, which is more than enough for my purposes.  By using iTunes you can automatically have it "shuffle" in and out new songs so that you can get a different variety if you have more songs in your library than the shuffle can hold.  It even comes equipped with a little "docking" station -- though truth be told it can harder to keep track of that thing than the shuffle itself!  Music-lovers rejoice; you now have the perfect companion for your inside and outside activities at a price that almost everyone can afford.  If the need for pictures and videos isn't there (and personally, if I want to watch a video that is what my television is for) then you would do right to check out the iPod shuffle.

<Content>wow! how can something so tiny sound so big? after having owned this shuffle for a few weeks now i'm really amazed at it's overall performance.   down loading music either thru itunes or your own cd collection is a snap.   my only real complaint might be that they (apple) includes a rather cheap set of ear buds that doesn't do the music any justice.do yourself a favor and get yourself a really good quality set of earphones,the shuffle already has the music in it,you just need a nice set of buds to let it out.    a nice little machine for a fair price.

<Title>Ipod is #1 for a reason
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this new gen shuffle for my father's birthday.  I have the 1st gen shuffle, and I'm so jealous of him having a clip on this one.  What a simple, yet ingenious feature.  I borrow his while I work out 'cuz it's so simple to clip onto my shirt and go.  With the old shuffle, you have to wear it like a big necklace (not good when jogging or jumping rope).  Yeah, I know you can get a armband to hold it, but, I'm cheap and don't want to fork out $ on accessories.  Therefore, the new shuffle has definately got an edge on the old one. The sound quality is excellent.  I feel that the ear buds that come with it are more than satisfactory.   I see some people are annoyed that there isn't a screen.  Hello?  That's what the rest of the ipod line is for.  The shuffle is SUPPOSED to be micro sized---do you really want a teeny tiny screen that you'd need a magnifying class to read?  Get real. The shuffle is awesome and well worth the $79 bucks.

<Title>It was 2nd ipod for my 12 yr old.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this ipod for my 12 yr old,  after his 1st one only lasted about 12 hours,  it was a cheaper MP3 player by ilo technology and it sucked.   When I received this ipod opened it immediately because I knew it had to charge so when I looked for the directions, it really did not have any just a basic picture directions and one liners so when i went to the website its say to go to it says it was no longer available.  So after fumbling thru the "itunes" website and having to download 35 pages of manual I was able to figure it out.  It takes about 4 hours to charges.  Then I had to download songs to it, which took again about 30 minutes to figure out but all in all after managing to figure it all out, my kid is very happy and it seems to be very durable.  My husband now wants one and also the 8 yr old.  So, I'm sure I will be purchasing more in the future!!

<Title>Second generation of iPod Shuffle is AWESOME!!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This new version of the iPod shuffle is really great! My wife likes to run and this iPod just clips onto her shorts or blouse and holds up to 240 songs!! The price is only $79, which is pretty low for portable tunes.   It's very easy to download songs, either from a website, or a CD. The controls are very basic and simple, so they're easy to use. You can either play the songs in order, or play them randomly ... thus the 'shuffle' in the name.  I would highly recommend this second generation iPod shuffle to anyone who needs a very small, portable music system.

<Title>Amazing but Fragile
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love it, but I'm on my third unit in two months.  The first one had button problems and then died completely.  Apple replaced for free.  The second died after two weeks in the middle of a run, and I think I know why: I was wearing it clipped on the inside of the collar of my shirt so that the headphone wire faced down, looping in my shirt. My sweat was too much for it. Apple replaced it again for free, and I'm taking great care to be sure that #3 doesn't get exposed to too much humidity.  I do think that Apple should warn about this. Other than that, I think the Shuffle2 is the most amazing gadget since the Polaroid camera.

<Content>The Shuffle is simple to use and the gadget itself rates 5 stars.  The size and design of this thing couldn't be better... it's just fun and draws a lot of comments.  You can load this thing up with two complete audiobooks and have room to spare. As a first-time user, however, I'm totally unimpressed with the iTunes software which you'll need to learn if you want to load that cool lil shuffle. The iTunes documentation (including its integrated help) is maddening. It is absolutely terrible at describing detailed options. For instance, what is a compilation, what's the advantage of checking it? How does one import an audiobook? Be prepared to do some web surfing if you want to learn the useful features. It's as though it's intended that you learn from someone else.

<Title>Wow! So much sound out of such a tiny package!
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am truely amazed with this little tiny thing. It is smaller than a matchbook and light as a feather. I can't believe how good the sound quality is, it sounds the same as my new 60 GB Video iPod. I was expecting a lesser quality sound but was willing to deal with it to have it for its size and ease of carrying around, but when I pressed play and turned up the volume I was blown away.    The setup was a breeze, just pluged in the USB cable with the iPod in its tiny cradle and iTunes new exactly what it was. I named my new little iPod "mini me", created and dragged a playlist to it and within a minute it was ready to play!!! It does need some time to charge, but there is enough charge already to test the little guy out. (You do need to download and install the latest iTunes from itunes.com if you don't have it already. I have been an iPod/iTunes fan for a while so I already had it installed.)   The click wheel is very simple the top and bottom are volume control, the left and right are to skip through the songs. The button in the middle is play/pause. One cool feature is if you click the center button three times it goes back to the begining of the list of songs.   The only downside is you can only have one list of up to 240 songs (1GB) and if you want to skip to a favorite song it may take a while to find it.    I am curious as to how long the battery will last and how it will handle my abuse. I will update this review when I have more information.   This little guy is well worth every penny, if you like to take your music with you, you will love it, you can barely tell you have it on you. No big iPod weighing your pocket down, this guy is light as a feather.

<Content>I bought mine a couple of weeks ago. Have used it daily since. The main challenge was working with iTunes, which is new to me. However, even that wasn't too difficult. If you are familiar with realplayer, winamp, etc, you'll probably get it pretty quick.  It's very light, portable, and it just does what I want. I put about 200 songs on it, carry it with me, attached to my shirt, and listen at work or wherever. You can play your stuff in order or randomly (thats the shuffle bit).  I had previously been concerned that I would only be able to play music bought from iTunes. Not so, I can get my music from my cd's, my downloads no problem. I even can download This American Life, the radio show, onto my iPod and listen to it as I cook dinner. Very nice! All in all, it's a great product, and I have to say, my coworkers have been admiring it since I brought it in. Its just too cute.

<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's no need to purchase a package deal to include a dock for 29.95. The ipod comes WITH a dock when you purchase it. It is included in the box.  I ordered a dock because Amazon suggests to complete the package with a dock..but I'm sending my extra dock back.

<Title>Big on Hype - Small on Performance
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bottom line - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money.  Don't buy this one.. keep looking.  This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player.  This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music.  Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music.  This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.  Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like "hold" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.  Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year.

<Title>Good but flawed.........
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First the good.  The Shuffle's small size and large memory make it ideal for those who use an MP3 player primarily for workouts. I've been using a RIO for about the past year and a half and was excited about downsizing to the smaller Shuffle.  Overall, the usability and functionality of the player itself I'd rate as a 5.  Now the bad.  My wife and I were planning on having 2 Shuffles and using the same computer to manage the files. Bad idea.  The Shuffle is hardwired to "sync" with the music library each time you connect to iTunes.  My wife and I have very different musical tastes and there's no way to manage 2 separate iTunes Libraries on the same computer. The Shuffle "sync"s to whatever is in the music library each time you connect.  I understand that there is a "Manual" mode in which to manage your music for the Nano's and other iPods but for the Shuffle this is not an option....your Shuffle syncs each time. This seems like it would be an easy software fix to disable the "sync" function.  If anyone has a work around, I'm all ears.  If you're the only one using your PC for this MP3 player then the Shuffle will more than likely meet your needs.  Maybe I'm in a unique demographic but the Shuffle disappointingly fell short for me.

<Content>OK, I gave in and purchased an IPOD for my six year old for Christmas. She loves it.  Not a major investment for a child, but one that will last for some time.  Use of the device is simple and loading the machine using Itunes only takes seconds.  Sound output is decent. The device is rugged and withstands the beating only a child can give it.  The clip on device is a nice touch.  If you don't want to carry your whole song catalog (5000 songs or more) -- this a good value and product.

<Title>Two strikes against the Shuffle
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the IPOD shuffle as a birthday present for my son. Within 24 hours it had ceased to work. While connected to the PC with the power adapter, it became super hot. I returned it and got a new one.  The new one worked fine for about a week. Then my son started hearing a popping noise through his earphones. Thinking the phones were just bad, we swapped it out with another set of phones we had ... but the problem persists. I'm guessing the jack is bad this time.  With all the good reviews, I guess the problems I'm having are rare, but c'mon. I'll be returning the second one tonight, and I have to tell you ... three strikes and you're out IPOD Shuffle.

You can always forward to the next song and if you put your music on your Shuffle you will be choosing songs you like anyway.  The size makes it great for the gym or working out.  I have a video ipod and nano as well, but this is the best for being on the go.

<Content>The iPOD 2nd gen is a neat little item.  It loads and plays music files effortlessly using the software provided.  One concern is that it needs to be reset to fully charge.  If not reset, it will never indicate a full charge.  Earphones are not comfortable for my ears.  Maybe others find them OK but they are too big for my ears.  Other than that I am pleased with my iPOD purchase.

<Title>Good.
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's really not much to say about the Shuffle that you don't already know. I did have trouble transferring the songs when I first connected it; it crashed and iTunes froze until I disconnected it, then it gave me a hardware error message for the Shuffle drive. When I connected it again, it would re-format it or something. The problem was that it needed to charge first, because the little charge of battery that it came with would run out halfway through the process of updating it. I had purchased another Shuffle before and had not had this problem, so I don't know if it happens most of the time.  Well I just wanted to say that in case it happens to anyone else.

<Title>Some major improvements on the previous generation, but not near perfect
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The anodized aluminum body and clipper design really enhances the functionality of this Shuffle.  No more need for a pocket or a free hand - click it to your shirt and go running.  The Shuffle weighs next to nothing and looks good enough to be a tie or scarf clip.  The Shuffle offers a lot of advantages over the iPod, particularly for people with aging computers.  I bought an 80 gig video iPod last fall but returned it because it took so long to update my iPod and my computer was constantly crashing.  With a Shuffle, I just let it do autofill or pick about a hundred songs - and the update is complete in under 10 minutes.  I was paranoid about scratching my video iPod but didn't want to pay $30 for a sleeve - not a problem with the Shuffle.  Solid state memory makes the Shuffle more impact resistant than hard drive based iPods.  Plus, this Shuffle will still be useful when the 6th generation true video iPod comes out.  A couple things prevent me from giving this Shuffle 5 stars.  The lack of a 2 gig model and the old style earbuds are real bummers.  Some of my files are ripped as Apple Lossless so they take up a lot of room.  The new earbuds that I had with my returned video iPod were much more comfortable and had much better sound quality, that I often used them rather than my Shure E4C (very nice but long heavy cords made them inconvenient for some situations).  With this Shuffle, I'm back to my E4C full time.    The battery life could be longer and more color options would be nice.  I guess these improvements will come in the next generation of Shuffle/Nano replacements.  Maybe something with similar dimension to this Shuffle but with a 1" LCD display.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just recently purchased the shuffle which replaces an older 30Gb iPod that I used while biking. The form factor is nice for riding since it is very light and easily clips on my clothing.  At 1Gb there is plenty of space to store enough music for the longest of rides and with the integration in iTunes I can quickly update my playlist.    I found that creating a smart playlist for the shuffle worked well for me.  I was able to select music my genre and date loaded.  This allows me to add new music to my library and have it appear on my shuffle at the next sync.  The two draw backs to the small form factor are the close proximity of the volume and forward and reverse buttons to the play/pause button and the lack of a switch that locks in the controls.  When I ride in winter with gloves it is hard to just press one of the vol or fast forward or reverse buttons that surround the play/pause button.  Without the gloves I have no problem.  As far as the lock button, I find that I have accidently bumped the control when moving my arms around.    Overall this is a great player.

<Content>Setup was so simple:  * Plug it in and charge. * Install the upgrades. * Sync your music.  Unfortunately, within the first hour it became permanently hosed.  No music, just a blinking light.  No luck trying to resync, clear and start over, or anything else.  A visit to my local Apple store and I could wait 6 hours to talk to somebody to accept my faulty unit or I could pay more to schedule ahead of time (preferred customer).  That makes three dead iPods.  I wish I could take my music to another platform...damn DRM.

<Content>Being a relatively new Ipod user, I bought the Ipod video first and then decided to get the shuffle to use when I'm on my treadmill.  The shuffle is completely user friendly.  It's really amazing how many songs it can hold.  The setup was very simple.  The only thing that surprised me was the amount of time that it took to charge it the first time.  Other than that, the process was a piece of cake.  For the price, it is the best Ipod on the market!  I recommend it to anyone new to Ipods for its simplicity of use alone.    I would recommend, however, getting better earphones if you are going to be exercising with it.  It comes with the factory issue kind which are not friendly to anyone moving around a lot.  Jennifer

<Title>So tiny, so great
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this as a Xmas present from work. At first, I felt guilty about opening it because I already have a 4th gen 20GB iPod. I'm so glad I decided to open it because having this smaller version is SOOOO much more convenient for on th go use. Being on the treadmill with this little thing is incredibly easy - no need for one of those armband accessories, just clip it to a pocket or waistband and you're off! 1GB is plenty of space for a day's use. When you recharge it, just change the music.  My one big complaint is the recharge process: 1) the charging stand the comes with the package is only for hooking up to a computer - not convenient for travel, and 2) this shuffle takes a darn long time to fully charge. That's why I can't give it 5 stars.

My only wish, if it were to magically become the perfect device, is if they can keep the same size/style and get an FM tuner.  I don't need the screen or any other fancy play-list gagets...but for us runners who have to resort to treadmill running in the winter, it would be nice to tune into the TVs sometimes at the gym...just a thought.

<Title>Perfect for single purpose or as a first buy
<Date>Tue Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I seriously considered an iPod Nano and an iRiver Clix before buying a Shuffle.  I use it for one single purpose: at the gym.  Because of this narrow purpose, I have never felt the need for a screen to navigate.  At first I wondered how I would find all my favorite songs, but then realized they are all my favorites.  After all, it is MY music collection.  The 1Gb size is certainly adequate and loading from iTunes is easy.  Neither have I found battery life to be a problem.  I just plug it in whenever I am at my computer, and it juices up, if not completely, then certainly to a level to get me through the next workout.  I LOVE the size.  I clip it to my sports top and it stays in place without feeling heavy.I bought Sensenheimer sport earphones, after finding the Apple ones uncomfortable.  The only negatives are that the music quality lacks some bass (addressable somewhat with iTunes functionality and choice of earphones) and the 'sort' function in iTunes does not seem to carry over to the Shuffle playlist.    Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  If you listen to music in multiple settings (or moods) or are a fan of audiobooks and podcasts, then maybe the Shuffle's simplicity is not for you.  But for as a workout aid, it is $80 well spent.

<Title>Awesome Microplayer
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The IPod Shuffle is the smallest member of the IPod family.  It is also a single-purpose device.  It is only a music player.  And just like the other IPods, a lot of thought went into its design as far as aesthetics are concerned.    The Shuffle comes with a small dock that serves multiple duties.  The dock allows the Shuffle to connect to your computer or laptop.  It is also the charging cradle.  The same jack, or port, that powers the headphones also serves as the charging port and the pc connection port.  The USB port also supplies the current to recharge the Shuffle's battery.  Basically, this is a very efficient, and a very minimalists design.  Loading songs from iTunes is very easy.  Just make sure that you have the latest version of iTunes on your computer.  The 1 GB capacity is more than adequate for my intended use of the system.  And, since the system will only hold songs (no video), that should be plenty of space for most users.  Sound quality is quite good.  Perhaps you can even improve that by upgrading and buying a more expensive set of headphones.    Perhaps the biggest attraction of this system is it's small size.  Perfect for those situations that call for you to be discrete.  What is an example of a situation that might call for having a very discrete music player?  Ok, picture this scenario.  You're a college student and you already have a 4.0 grade point average.  But you still have to attend that boring lecture on tax laws in order to fulfill the attendance requirement for your business law class.  Ok, obviously, you wouldn't want to get caught listening to your music instead of paying attention to the professor talking about how, in his opinion, graduated income taxes affect the emotional cycle of the average housewife.  This little shuffle is perfect for that, especially for those large classes that are held in auditoriums instead of traditional classrooms.  Please understand, Citan does not encourage this type of irresponsible behavior.  The pursuit of knowledge, and your desire for intellectual development, are more important uses of your time than listening to your IPod.  That is, unless you're old man promised you, in writing, that you're gonna inherit ten million dollars.    Do you like to listen to music while working out?  The Shuffle is the perfect size for that.  The built in clip can attach to just about any part of your clothing.  Well, ok, there are exceptions.  No doubt some  people enjoy working out, while wearing as little as possible.  You know, that Jessica Biel lookalike with a perfect body that hangs out at the local gym?  The Goddess that has a "bareable" physique?  Yeah, that's the one.  The one whose outfit can compete with the Shuffle's minimalists design?  Perhaps even the Shuffle won't find an attachment point in her outfit.  Ok, ok, we've gotten sidetracked.  Back to the Shuffle.  The Shuffle itself feels durable.  And there are no moving mechanical parts to wear out.  The headphones might not last the life of the system though.  Especially if you use the system while working out.  In my experience, sweat will eventually destroy the headphones.  Sweat gets inside the phones, dries up, and perhaps leaves a buildup that will prevent them from functioning after a while.  But they are easily replaced.  I believe that it will be the battery that will determine the life of the system.  As long as the battery continues to function properly and hold a charge, the system will be useful.    I recommend this system for anyone who needs to be able to listen to their music in a discreet manner.  The Shuffle also makes a good workout companion for those who like to listen to music while they sweat away the pounds.  Users who need to have a multi-function device will obviously have to look elsewhere.  Consider a Zune or a Nano if you want to show off pictures of your children, sweetheart, or pet.

<Title>Powerful sound, small casing!
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first listened to my new IPod shuffle, I was blown away by the sound.  I couldn't believe this little item could sound this incredible!  One possible downside is it can get lost easily due to it's small size.  The clip is very nice to keep it from moving around.  My previous shuffle would bounce around while I was on the recumbant bike.  The shuffling of music doesn't work the greatest, I seem to hear some songs more than others.

<Title>iPod Shuffle
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this iPod for my mom on her birthday, and she loves it.  PROs  - It is really small, and holds like 300 songs - The program, iTunes, is easy and effective. - Aluminum exterior protects iPod and looks cool - It has a clip (more cool and important than it sounds, trust me) - Simple button layout, very easy to use - 12 hours of battery life, USB powered - Great sound quality - Really inexpensive  CONs  - If you want to use another computer for downloading and uploading to the ipod, you have to delete all your songs off the ipod and start again. - Battery takes a long time to charge - Included earphones are crappy - No wall plug, Adapter not included - Only iTunes, no other formats - Moving songs on to the iPod is not as easy as it should be.  So if you like what you see, you will probably like the shuffle. But be warned about the issues, because they are annoying. It is a nice little system for quick music, but if you are looking for something a bit more meaty, look elsewhere.

<Title>A lot of music in a little package
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's amazing the amount of music you can download and the sound quality.  However, it's almost a little too small (I liked the size of my 1st Generation Shuffle better).  When I go to move it around at the gym, I'm constantly hitting the "Pause" button or the "Fast Forward/Fast Rewind" buttons.  But those are little things.  It's still great for working out.

<Title>The cradle is dumb
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The first generation shuffle had a simple USB connector. You could carry it anywhere, charge it anywhere, sync it anywhere.  It was a thumb drive as well as a music player. Brilliant.  This one is smaller. That's nice. However, Apple has introduced yet another proprietary patented connector. It's their's, they have a patent, you pay extra for adapters. You need to give up yet another USB port and add yet more clutter to your desktop. You have to take it with you when you travel.  There's no audio-out from the cradle, btw. So don't expect to listen and charge.  If they'd used a mini-USB connector I'd have given this shuffle four or five stars. Instead, I'm tempted to give it a single star, but it's not 100% worthless.  Boo-hiss Apple. You've always been greedy, but this time you've gone too far.

This little baby is perfect for exercising or when you're on the go and you don't want to worry where you'll put it like the full sized iPods. I'm PO'd I bought mine before Apple decided to come out with colored shuffles. Not cool Apple. Not cool. :) The only drawback I've noticed is it doesn't have the option where you push a button and it makes it so if the dial is pressed on accident the song or volume can't be changed.

I drape the ear cord around my neck and hook it to the ipod if I am wearing non-lapel type business clothes. It is very non-intrusive, easy to use and change songs.  The only thing that could be better would be blue tooth or wireless earphones so there would be no cord at all. I love it. Thanks IPOD

<Title>Can't imagine it getting any better than this!
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my fourth mp3 player but my first ipod.  I'm even more impressed than I thought I could be!   Pros: * It's SO SMALL and lightweight; I just can't get over it! I can hardly even feel I'm wearing it! * The clip is amazing! On all my previous mp3 players, I had some kind of belt clip or arm band or something - but this is so much better! The built-in clip, along with the light weight, allow you to clip it almost anywhere!  I can just clip it on my shirt and hardly even feel it.  * It charges on the computer - no more batteries!  One of my other mp3 players charged via USB, but had issues.  So far, no problems charging this ipod. * Sound quality is GREAT compared to my other mp3 players.  I cannot get over how something this small can put out so much sound! * The controls are so EASY to use!  I haven't even read the instructions that came with it - it's so easy to figure out!  Cons: * It is difficult to find a particular song you want to hear.  There's no screen (which is obvious before you even buy it), but you can set the songs to shuffle or play in the order in which you put them on the ipod.  Either way, you can't really navigate to a particular song you want. * The fact that it charges on the computer could be a potential problem if the charge runs out during your workout.  It hasn't happened to me yet.  But with my other mp3 players that used batteries, I kept an extra battery in my gym bag, so I could replace it when needed.  Neutral: * 1 GB of storage is PLENTY for me, but might not be for others.  Currently I have about 100 songs on mine and it's only half full.  All I need are my favorites to play while I'm exercising. * iTunes has turned out to be pretty easy to use.  Some of the reviews have complained about it, and admittedly I didn't want to have to install any more programs on my computer, but it's been fine.  The program is easy to use and you DON'T have to create playlists - I just drag the songs I want and drop into the ipod and it's worked fine.  In my opinion, there really are no drawbacks - the small size, light weight, and clip far outweigh any possible disadvantage.  I can't imagine anything better than this!

<Title>Apple does it again
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple continues to add new options to their products that allow the appeal of such a player to continue.  I picked up the orange shuffle as I was instantly attracted to the new color introduced by Apple.  So, after using it for a few days, heres what I found:  Good:  Good battery life (12 hours) Very easy to use, from uploading music to playing music 2nd generation headphones from Apple Very light, small, and appealing to people around you.  I personally have had numerous compliments from not only the size, but the color as well The option of continous or shuffle, and the autofill option on iTunes Built in clip  Cons: No screen No input for mic, radio, etc. To charge, you have to use Dock unless you buy 3rd party AC adapter Can't be used yet for Nike+iPod.  Overall, for $79, you can't go wrong.  At 1GB, I fit about 140 songs on my shuffle (192kbps MP3 stereo 44.1hz/16 bit encoding) with the songs being of average length.  If the idea of no screen bothers you, buy spending about double the amount, you can get twice the space (as the Nano), screen, radio support, etc.  However, the factoring decision for getting the shuffle was portability and size.  I can use it between classes and clip it on my shirt without having a large iPod to carry around.  On top of that, when you are riding the bus to class, its interesting to see what song comes on next.    If you are in the market for a clean, good MP3 player, you can't go wrong with the shuffle!

I got one for myself, I was so impressed that I bought another pink one for my mother, my mom is a lady who doesn't even know how to use a TV remote control correctly, yet, she was fully comfortable with her new shuffle in less than 1 minute. I've never seen my mother happier, that I was able to put her all time favorites on this little guy, and she can listen to them all day long...

No superfluous features, and extremely user friendly.  Nothing compares to the size and weight of this thing...you can clip it to your sleeve and forget it's even there.

I thought the lack of screen would bother me, but when I'm working out or listening at work, I find the forward and reverse buttons to work fine to find music.  Because the shuffle by default loads tracks randomly, I find the "shuffle" switch a bit redundant, but otherwise it is a good product and seems pretty sturdy despite its small size. The clip feature, so far, is working great.

<Content>The ipod shuffle is a great product. It has a very crisp, clear sound. It comes with its own docking station and is very easy to use. Just plug it in to a USB port, and you are quickly adding songs and charging the ipod as well. The only thing this ipod does not have is a display screen. Just memorize the order in which you add the songs. You can also coose the shuffle mode to play your songs. When you want to stop listening for a while- pause the song first, then turn off the ipod- when you turn it back on later- hit play, and it will start back at the same song. You will not have to scroll all the way through it just to get back to the same song. This is a really great product for just a little bit of money.

<Title>What's so great about iPod?
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently broke down and purchased an iPod shuffle, thinking it was finally time to cave in to the iPod craze. After all, $79 is a reasonable price for such a tiny, exercise-friendly mP3 player. However, I had no idea what a HASSLE IPODS ARE.  Cons: 1. NO DRAG & DROP- Unlike every other mp3 player on the market, the iPod shuffle does not allow drag & drop through Windows. Instead, you have to open up iTunes to load anything on there. 2. AAC FORMAT- If any of your music is in the economically-sized WMA format, iTunes will have to convert ALL of it in a relatively time consuming process. You will spend more time loading the player than you will listening to it.  3. NO SCREEN- the two other equally-sized MP3 player (Mobiblu & Samsung) both have screens where you can see what you're listening to, & select either folders or playlists. 4. PLAYLISTS- while other equally small MP3 players permit you to load different playlists (or separate your music into folders), the shuffle only allows 1 long playlist. You do get arrange the song order, though! 5. INCOMPATIBILITY- The iPod is assigned to one "music library" through itunes. If you try to connect it to another computer & put more music on, you'll have to erase the entire thing. Also, don't try using it with Windows Vista yet-- it may get irreversibly corrupted! [..] 6. SLOW- Honestly, the iTunes interface is just slow. It has to resync with the iPod every time you put a song on it. It takes mine up to 20s to sync, which adds up to a lot of a time after 20 songs.  Pros: STRONG CLIP- The clip is great for listening to music on the go. I use mine for running & travel. Sadly, this was probably the chief reason why bought this PoS. BIG BUTTONS- It's easy to turn up the volume or change songs without having to search for tiny buttons. SOUND- The sound is excellent, but I've liked the sound on my Mobi-Blu & Samsung mini-MP3 players as well. APPEARANCE- I'll admit, it's a cute-looking little gadget & when people see you wearing one, they'll ask you about it.  Bottom Line:     I own several MP3 players, and this one has been the most difficult to work with. If you are looking for an MP3 player that's cute & trendy, this might be the MP3 player for you. If you like to think of yourself as a gadget person, I would advise you to shop around for some other MP3 players that are just as small, have more functions, and are easier to load & set up. I know iPods have this reputation as being really user-friendly, but mine seemed more prone to bugs (i.e. "Error, unable to communicate with device"), less intuitive, and functionally limited.

<Title>Nifty litle device... when it works.
<Date>Mon Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the size of this new iPod and how it clips onto your clothes easily, making it very portable..... and sadly that's about it. The sound quality is definitely a step down, even from the previous shuffle. You MUST use iTunes to put music on it and iTunes is so buggy that half the time it doesn't even recognize the shuffle. You have to replug it in, close the program and reopen, or even reboot your computer a few times before it'll recognize it. I've used two different computers on this iPod and had the same problem. I finally returned it and got a new one.... no luck as it has the same issues.   Once you do get it working, it's annoying that it only allows a single playlist. The lack of display doesn't bother me, what do you really expect for $79?? I just think they should have allowed you to put playlists on there to better organize your music. 1gb is still a decent amount of music and it can be hard to find the song you want.   All in all I really wanted to like this new iPod. Based purely on looks I love it. When it comes to functionality though, it stinks.

<Content>I have a 60GB iPod 5G, but I couldn't resist picking up the cute iPod Shuffle too.  It's the perfect thing to take along on workouts as well as the prefect geek jewelry.    Because of its name many people think you can only listen to your music shuffled, but you also have the option to listen to it in order.  I was surprised at how loud the Shuffle can pump out your tunes.  The clip seems just the right tightness and seems unlikely to fall off with regular use.  The controls couldn't be simpler.  You'll be enjoying music within minutes of opening the package.    Good things really do come in small packages.

My arm would actually get sore from carrying my iPod Video on my arm for long runs.

<Title>I'd give 0 stars if I could
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just receive an Ipod shuffle as a gift. I was so excited because I love the small size of it. It would be perfect for the gym. However, there is one major problem. THEY DON'T WORK! Within 30 minutes of opening the package, it stopped working. We took it to the Apple store where they replaced the software. We said we still didn't want to keep it and were charged a 10% restocking fee. I'm sure the customer service through Amazon would be much better, but who wants to buy something from Apple if they treat you that way.  I also had downloaded the istore software onto my computer to put songs on the ipod. What a pain! The software is so complicated to use. Why can't it just be drag and drop to put the songs in? There is also no instructions that you have to download software and nothing to tell you how to use it. Since then, I talked to other people who have the shuffle and they have all had to get it replaced multiple time. Do not buy the shuffle! I know it is small and seems perfect, but they stop working very fast. I'm very disappointed. I'm going to keep looking for a different, non-ipod MP3 player.

<Title>Never be without your music ...
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cost effective: At less than 80 dollars this is a great beginner IPOD for anyone, or just as a go everywhere device that you necessarily wouldn't be devistated if it somehow got broken or lost. Even for a child or older person with no computer, you can fill this with music and give it as a gift and occasionally change the music for them. Think, No moving parts, very rugged....so the price is great for what you get.  Operation: You download the latest version of Itunes... then start loading this thing up with up 240 songs (depending on the size). Their is a light learning curve with Itunes but you'll get the hang of it very fast. The device has a rechargable battery inside it and is recharged when connected to the docking cable (included) via the PC. The package is complete with good instructions, ear buds, and docking station. Because this IPOD has no screen, there is no need for a case... its metal and very solid and has a clip attached. The sound quality is superb, and the controls work as designed. You can switch the unit on and off, and there are multiple playmodes. For those who bought this version and not the colored one, metal cases are available with many color choices so the fashion conscious can color coordinate this with thier outfit or mood.  I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend this tiny little musical wonder to anyone who needs a little background music to thier everyday world.  ~P~

<Content>I love my little hot pink Shuffle. I have loaded it up with music and there is still plenty of room to go. I prefer it to my Ipod Nano. I wear it around the house, working out in the gym, and walking in the neighborhood. It is so light and convenient with its built-in clip.

<Title>Cute, but....PC users please read
<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my first Ipod over two years ago as a gift and purchased this as an affordable second Ipod for running around. Aesthetically, you can't go wrong. It is cute and sleek and and integrating it into your Itunes library should be seamless. It wasn't. After several attempts, my computer would not recognize it. I have a computer that is nearly a year old with a 2.0 USB, but for some reason, it would not work without another fix. Because this is just an 80 dollar MP3 player, and my other electronic devices work fine, I felt it was not worth the extra investment and returned it and purchased the 30 gb Ipod instead. Installation of that was effortless as I already had Itunes 7ad on my computer. The usb problem is not an issue with the Nano or the regular Ipod, just the shuffle and this is a known issue. Be prepared to return. You might want to save your money for a Nano, or even a refurb Nano from  Apple for the same amount.

<Title>My Shuffle
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my shuffle. I recieved it for my birthday and immediately feel in love with it. I loaded 200 of my songs. I know many people say that it doesnt fit many songs but honestly no one listens to the 1000 songs on their ipod. I have around 900 on my Itunes library but was easily able to pick 250 of my favorites. Its so small and have an awesome clip function. I use it when I workout at the gym but I might need different headphones for using it at the gym. Overall though 5 STARS. Awesome gadget cant wait to see what they do for generation 3!!!

<Title>It comes with a teeny little docking station.
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you look over on the Apple site there are many people who have had the tip of the plug break off on this docking station. You might say "hey you broke it and its all your fault" The tip has broken off on my station and I wasn't  abusive with my gear. It was in my laptop case and it broke during transport to my office. Carelees? Maybe, is the product cheap junk? Definitely!  Be very careful with this part. The replacement is almost half of the cost of a new Shuffle. And like all Apple products, the price is fixed. Be very careful!

<Title>Fantastic
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I actually bought this for my daughter for her birthday, I was concerned about the size about it getting lost easily but she absolutely loves it, she just clips it on her blouse or pants and loves that she does not have to carry around bulky cd's or a portable cd player. The buttons are easily to handle, for such a small little item to be able to hold 240 songs for hours of listening pleasure is amazing. I love it so much I plan on getting one for myself - will come in handy when exercising, no more skipping, no more worrying about where to put the ipod when I am running.  For $80 I think this is a great product. I reviewed the other reviews before purchasing and it was mostly positive so I bought it and my daughter is pretty happy with it.

<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I listen to my ipod shuffle all the time. I'm actually listening to it while I'm writing this review!!  Apple advertises that you can put 240 songs on the ipod, I was able to get 380 songs on my shuffle!  What I do not like about Apple is that they do not give you software (itunes), or instruction manual...both have to be downloaded from apples website....and I recommend that if you purchase this product you DO download the instruction manual.   I liked my ipod shuffle so much that I purchased a blue one for my wife and a red one for my neice through Apples website...and had their names engraved on the ipod, they were thrilled.  It works great...sounds great....and the clip is a fantastic idea...way to go Apple engineers!!

<Title>Made by elves in oak trees.
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple seems to have taken over the universe with their products. The industrial design is so sleek and innovative, their pods are irresistible. This Shuffle is equally amazing.  I never saw the point of a shuffle before.  No screen, small in size but not "that" much smaller than a pod with many times it's capacity.  Seeing someone using this shuffle, though, just blew my mind.  It's the size of a postage stamp and just clips on your pocket or belt. It's metal and so does not have the scratching issues.  Once docked in iTunes, you can set it to automatically reload itself with random tunes or only to select your highest rated songs. There is a switch on it to hear your songs consecutively if you prefer.  The sound is amazing and the ear buds have been improved I am told. It is so small, you can buy a tiny leather case and clip it to your key chain. I imagine if Star Wars was made today they would be fighting with iSabres, flying in skyPods and Luke's name would be Steve. (The force seems to be strong with this one.) For perspective, I am not an Apple zombie, and in fact just bought the Toshiba GigaBeat instead of the 5 gen iPod, which has caught up and passed Apple in innovation on that one. For now.  CONS: As usual, you are forced to buy accessories that will be necessary.  The dock only charges from your usb port so to travel with it you really need a wall charger adapter.  There is no carrying case included at all to throw the pod into with the charger and earbuds for transport. Useful service time is 12 hours they say, which is understandable since the battery must be tiny; but still you must remember to charge it daily.

<Title>Great for winter walks
<Date>Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't underestimate the value of the clip on this thing!   I go for walks in the winter, and before, whenever I wore a jacket that didn't have an external pocket, I was forced to wear my old player in an internal pocket, underneath the jacket. I find that this arrangement is subtly uncomfortable, since the headphone wires are constantly pulled down by the motion of the jacket. The iPod shuffle is instantly much more comfortable for walks in the winter, since I can clip it anywhere I want on the surface of my jacket, and my headphone wires ride lightly on the outside of the coat. Plus, the control wheel is clickable, even with winter gloves.

<Content>The unit is cute, it is unobtrusive, and it dos not work as advertised.  First you have to use i-Tunes to download to the shuffle.  My unit would not interface with i-Tunes.  There was a pop up on loading on the computer that said there was more current software available for the unit and I should download.  Apple was unable to complete the download.  I returned it and bought the Creative Zen Nano with it's drag and drop transfer.  It is a bit larger; but it works as advertised.

<Content>The iPod Shuffle is extremely small and cute, but iTunes is not compatible with Vista, yet.  I kept getting error messages when I tried to upload my playlist.  Apple has a repair tool, but I could not get it to run.  I'm sure it will work out eventually when Apple comes out with a newer version of iTunes, but waiting kills the excitement of having a new toy.

<Title>Great for Exercising
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the 30 and 80 GB iPods that my wife and I use at work each day, but they were a little too bulky to take to the gym or while in-line skating.  So I decided to give the new shuffle a try.  I have been very impressed.  I was actually able to fit about 265 songs on to it after selecting the 128 conversion option that is included in iTunes for the shuffle and that is plenty for quite a long time of repeat free listening.  I have used bikes, steppers, ellipticals, and lifted with just about every piece of equipment in the gym and this thing never gets in the way.  I have even accidentally hit it with dumbbells a few times and it keeps on going without any problems.  Also the headphones that come with it are a great length, I have had some in the past that are too long and get in the way and snag on things, but when I clip the shuffle on to my pants pocket, the cord is just the right length.  I have both the silver, which I got before the colors were available, and the orange and I have not had any problems with either one.  Apple did it again, I can't wait to see what they come up with next!

I've gotten many compliments on it over the last few days, and I've recommended it to everyone I know!!  This 1GB has plenty of room to store all your favorite songs in a machine the size of a quarter.  I clip the shuffle to my suit collar and away I go!  I can easily run all over the office without having a heavy mp2 player lugging along.  The earphones are fine, although tend to get a little uncomfortable after a few hours.  I've had my shuffle running for four days straight and still haven't had to recharge!

<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just what I needed for exercising at the gym. Very light, clips on clothing so no velcro armband is required. Good sound. Songs are easily uploaded or changed altogether via the computer. Doesn't need recharging that often. Plenty of room for lots of songs. And the price was right (about $80). No, you can't select a specific song because there's no viewer, but if you know where it is in the order, you can easily go to it by pushing fast forward or rewind or listen to one specific song several times, just like a CD. Plus, it's very small and trendy. Perfect for what I need. The earphones are a bit uncomfortable sometimes, but I'm sure there are others available which could be purchased.

<Content>When I first saw the shuffle, I thought no way is it that small!  You know how pictures are... they say "actual size", but that is very rarely true.  Well, when my shuffle finally arrived, I was shocked.  It was so adorable!  And of course, it's bright blue!    I had spent a week before, putting all of my music onto iTunes, getting ready to use the shuffle when I got it.  It was so easy to use!  It was pretty self-explanatory as well!  I love the earbuds and the way the shuffle itself clips onto things without having to buy "accessories" to make it clip-on.    Overall, I think the shuffle is the most useful music player I have ever bought!  I use it daily.  It makes work go by so fast.  It also works with my car's tape player with CD adapter; I just unplug the CD player and plug in my shuffle.    I'm in love with my shuffle!

At this time I must apploud Amazon for great customer care and sense of urgency..  As expected the ipod is the best.

<Content>The ipod is perfect for what I purchased it for. I take it to the gym and simply clip it on my shirt. I don't need to worry about purchasing an arm strap. It can randomly choose songs from your music library or you can import a playlist. This item would also be a great purchase for a young teen or as a first time ipod. I highly recommend.

<Title>Good deal for the $$$$ but....
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not in love with the clip style.  It needs to clip on the edge of something to feel secure and if I don't have a jacket or a pocket that can be a problem as it doesn't seem to have the reach of the original.  But the sound still is great so I'm keepin' it....

<Title>Outstanding value
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I travel all over the country and wanted to listen to something other than airline music, so I bought the iPod shuffle. It gives great sound quality and the battery lasts even on the longest of trips (I do use noise cancelling headphones on the plane) and used with an adapter I play my music in the car too. If you need music on the go this is the one for you. The only bad thing is the size, I put it down and have trouble finding it again.

<Title>wish i had known before buying
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got my shuffle today and I wish I had known the following before purchasing: unlike other ipods, you cannot download music from your shuffle to a computer other than your own. Therefore, you cannot transfer songs to a friend's computer, even if you bring along your docking station. I think I might return my shuffle just because of this.

<Title>I officially am an Ipod fan!
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When, the ipod first made its appearence, I thought the idea was terrible and the product would not sell well, again I was wrong. I actually bought a refurb 2g nano through apple for 59+free shipping. Mine works awesome, had it about a month or so now and it is great! Battery life is around 12 hours, so it still has good battery life just like a new one! So if you want to save cash (who doesn't) go for the refurb. (Only silver available as a refurb though :( The product is great!

<Title>Great iPod, with some limits
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have bought 3 of these for family and friends and think the design, sound quality and portable are just amazing.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that unlike other Ipods, you can only hook it up to 1 computer, which is ridiculous.  I have a desktop and a laptop, and like to hook up my iPod to both, and they are both "authorized" computers w/ iTunes.  If you sync this shuffle with one computer, and have a song on another computer you want to add to it, you can only do so by deleting ALL of the existing songs from the shuffle.  But the compact design, clip feature and superb sound makes me willing to overlook this overreaching design flaw.

<Title>Great for kids & Mommies
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the ipod shuffle in pink for my daughter for her 7th birthday. She loves it!  It holds a charge for a really long time (it's been a month and we haven't had to recharge it yet). We loaded all of her CD's onto it and there is still room for more! It's really easy to use the controls, she does it herself. It's great!  My 5 yr old wants one for her birthday.  I plan to purchase one for myself too!  We can each have a different color so we don't get them confused!

<Title>Great Shuffle

<Content>The Shuffle is really easy to use and to wear.  Downloading songs is pretty easy.  The sound quality is excellent.  I bought one to give as a gift, then after seeing it...bought myself and my sister one.  You will not be sorry!  If you order directly from the Apple website they will put your name on it for free.

<Content>I had trouble earlier with my 5th Gen video iPod due to heavy usage and eventually that extra Apple care paid off.  This little thing is fantastic for the gym and biking. no need for extra covers or rubber stuff for a nano or whatever.  Just clip and run! if your the active type get this

<Title>Best IPOD shuffle yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yes that is right, my wife absolutly loves this IPOD.  For the money, you can't go wrong.  It holds alot of songs for such a tiny MP3 player.  For all the people that wrote bad reviews, maybe they should have realized what you were purchasing.  No it does not have a screen, no it does not have a rolling dial like the bigger IPODs.  It does come with its own docking station.  It is perfect for someone that wants a little MP3 player for the gym, etc.
