<Title>Poor design and construction
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The headphone jack started cutting out after a few months. One channel is now completely dead.  The screen is easily cracked (my fault, but nevertheless....) and the battery cover is loose and feels like it will fall off.  I would not purchase this or the larger capacity (2GB I think) built with the same design.  Junk - worthless now.

<Content>For the price the c240 is great. It does everything I wanted it to do. It is easy to load and erase music.The FM radio gets great reception. I do not like the in ear head phones. I bought a cheap set of over the ear head phones. I also think it would have been better to put the head phone jack on the  end away from the neck cord. The cables keep getting tangled up. But those are very minor things for the quality and the price.

<Title>Not satisfied whatsoever
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I did a lot of research beforehand, not only looking at different sansa's, but different mp3 players. I was especially looking for an mp3 player with a built in FM Tuner, so I could listen to a talk show at night and also listen to music when it was done (all while working out). First off, the FM Tuner is a piece of crap. Not only is its extremely inconsistent with its clarity, but majority of the time there is to much static to even bear listening to the radio at all. Second of all, countless mp3's i put on it were read as "bad tracks." (all of these mp3's work on my ipod, and aren't protected or anything either). Playlists on this thing aren't worth the hassle. Plus, the only case I could find for this thing cost $30 which is what I paid for the player itself!  Bottom line, look elsewhere for a mp3 player, especially if you are ever going to use the FM Tuner. Keep in mind, you get what you pay for, this thing WILL play music, but is cheap nonetheless. Be careful. I never thought of myself as an ipod advocate, but i would definitely pay the extra money for one of those (a thousand times more reliable, simpler, and manageable).

<Title>Great Product!
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son really wanted an I-Pod Nano, but it is expensive. So,I researched for other MP3 players and found this one to very comparable and 1/2 the price. After receiving it, it was extremely easy to download songs, and my 11 year old son can do it himself. My step-son, on the other hand, did get an I-Pod Nano, and has had problems with it from the beginning, and it took him awhile to figure out how to download. Comparing the two, for my son, there is plenty of room for all the music he wants and then some, there is an FM tuner which the I-Pod does not come with, it has a very nice look to it, and seems very durable. I highly reccomed this product.

<Title>Good deal but not handy.
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Over all it's good value for the money. The only things I don't like are the charging via USB and the fact that you have to be connected to delete tracks. Next time I'll probably look for something more user friendly.

<Title>Not as user friendly as anticipated
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because I had read several reviews stating that it was great for a person just beginning to use a mp3 player.  I have an ipod and this is harder to use than the ipod, my daughter is constantly asking me questions if you can believe that. I thought she was supposed to know more about these things than I was.  The screen sticks all the time causing us to have to pop the battery out so we can even get it to shut off.  Downloading music is a snap but if its not a cd you already own the music sights you have to use charge monthly fees on top of the songs.  Its ok but well not ok she doesn't hate it just finds it to be bothersome at times.

<Title>Affordable and effective.
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're looking for an affordable MP3 player that gets the job done, just buy this one already and end your search.  This thing does everything I want it to. It's easy to use so I don't know what anyone else is talking about. I figured every single feature out within about 10 minutes of owning it and haven't looked at the user manual at all.  The color screen is a little cheap looking, but who really cares. This thing does everything an MP3 player less than $100 should do, and more.

<Title>great buy
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Comparing the price of other mp3 players(including ipod)with the same option this is one of the best. It is super easy to put your music on it just by drag and drop or by using Window Media Player(which automatic sync to the player and it is self explanatory from there). ALl of the option work great and I haven't seen any problems with it. It is suprising quick at loading or deleting music. The button take a little of getting use to so remember to read the directions on the CD they gives you. It also have a very smooth and pretty finish so I would recommend a cover for it if you are like me who hate when your stuff get scratch.

<Content>Considering I do not like ipods, this sansa is awesome.  Only thing I do not like is that when you are charging it (uses USB), you can not listen to it.  Battery life is amazing.  I love the size and color screen and ease of syncing with pc's.

<Title>Everything is mising !!!
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered one from ANTonline through Amazon.com . The MP3 player arrived on time. When I open the hard plastic, I saw there's empty storage space. I check the item list from online user guide. I figured Earphones,  USB Cable, Lanyard and 1 lithium ion battery (a replacement battery??). I called SanDisk but they asked me to contact the online retailer. I called the online retailer and the lady asked me to send an E-mail to their tech support department and wait. Then she HANG UP MY CALL! That's very rude.  In general, I believe this is the SanDisk issue because those items were missing in the brand new, sealed hard plastic container. SanDisk is able and capable to prevent this issue. Now they just push the responsibilities to the customer and the online retailer.

<Title>Sandisk RMA support
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sandisk support is aweful. The volume button broke after 2 months. They asked me to send in pictures. Took forever to get an answer. Called the RMA support several times. I got it was closed twice 4 hours before the stated time it was suppose to close. Then when I did reach someone she didn't have the password to access the email. Then they "determined" that it had physical damage and wouldn't honor the warranty even though there is not so much as a scratch on it. I will never purchase Sandisk again.
