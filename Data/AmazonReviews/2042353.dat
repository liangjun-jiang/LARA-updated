<Title>Creative Zen V freezes up during play
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I liked the looks and colors for the Creative Zen V and the price. I bought these for 2 children ages 9 and 11. Both players have frozen up during play several times already. The "owners manual" has very little information for trouble shooting which led me to having to email tech support. There is a TINY reset button by the on/off control, so small you have to use a small safety pin needle to reset it. This unfreezes the unit but I've had to do it multiple times on both players already. Nothing was said about this in prior reviews so buyer beware. No technology is without issues I suppose. Still a good little player for the price, durable.

<Title>This product is awful
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player for my daughter for Christmas.  It worked for about 1 hour, then it went blank and never revived.  It isn't even recognized by my computer. When I tried to e-mail Creative I get a long list of what I need to do to get this working.  I don't have time for this. My son has an Ipod and never had the trouble we've had with this.  Do not purchase this item

<Title>This little mp3 player rocks
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great MP3 player at a really decent price.  The display is clear, the color graphics are great - and the unit is tiny!  This player interfaces easily with the PC.  On the downside, there are not too many accessories available, and the product purchase does not include a charger.  If you are looking for a compact MP3 player that holds about 300-500 songs - and graphics are important to you, this is the one for you.

<Title>Not Recommended

<Content>I had a similiar experience as another reviewer with this item. I purchased this player for my wife for Christmas. The player worked very briefly, then it went blank. It never worked again and I returned it for a refund.

<Title>Still a big mystery to me...
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I wish it was as reliable as my old, brick - size RCA player, but it isn't . It has some good days and bad ones. On good days it rocks. The quality of sound is great and operating this little fella is very intuitive. On bad days it just skips. It skips like every few minutes, and jeez is it anoying.... Since it is a MTP player you need Creative software to transfer songs to the player. I use it with Rhapsody and it works just fine.

<Title>"UP TO" 500 songs isn't even close---try about 250
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son has been downloading music on this since he got it Christmas Day and he's used up all of his space at about 240 songs.  The Amazon ad neglects to mention that it depends on the size of the song that you're downloading.  You'd have to download some awful small songs to reach 500 (or even close to it).  Also, he hasn't even put pictures on this thing and still all the room is taken up!!  Not happy with this one.  I would recommend the 2 GB Zen if you want to get 500 songs on it!

<Title>Good value
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We got one of these recently and have been using it for several weeks. Nice features include  - small and lightweight -- easy to carry around with you  - displays album cover art in the little LCD screen.  - compatible with Yahoo Music.  It has "frozen up" at least once. When that happened, I just took out a paperclip and pushed a little reset button inside the player.  Overall, this seems to be a good option to go with, considering the price and the features you get.
