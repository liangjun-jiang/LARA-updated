<Title>Good bang for my buck...after a little help
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Gigabeat a year ago because I needed an mp3 player and didn't want an iPod like everyone else.  I have Windows Media Center on my laptop and really liked that the Gigabeat came with Media Center Portable.  A decent battery life, large screen, video support, and TACTILE controls got me hooked.  I had absolutely no trouble transferring my music and movies to it and playback was excellent.  I used my own earbuds as the included earbuds are awkwardly spaced.  The large screen is beautiful and colors show very well on it.  This kind of screen attracts scratches like nobody's business, so I purchased some Palm screen protectors and cut them to fit.  All was well except for one thing: my battery would only last for three to four hours.  I contacted Toshiba, worked out a plan and sent my Gigabeat in to have the battery fixed.  Not three days later did I receive it back and working as advertised.  As I am patient and willing to work things through, this was a good investment on my part.  But now that the price of the Gigabeat has dropped over $100, I think that at the new price it is worth purchasing.  Every product has a few in a batch that do not turn out well, but that is part of manufacturing.  As far as iPod alternatives go, this is currently the best choice out there.  Pros: Good battery life (c. 10 hours)     Tactile controls, easy navigation     Mp3/Wma support     WMV/MPEG video support     Large, bright screen     Good tech support  Cons: Had to use tech support...     Scratch-attractive screen     No car adapter

<Title>Actually has everything a PMP should
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this product recently from Amazon, but never got it. Then it went out of stock! I dug around a lot on the internet and finally found it - I now have it, and its actually really good. I was apprehensive because its a Toshiba, not an iPod and everyone always talks only about iPods. Anyways, I've been using this for almost a month now - and it has everything! FM, Video, Images, works seamlessly with PCs. The screen is delicate, but I've heard every PMP has that problem. To me this beats the iPod because it has FM and you can create playlists, it also has a quick playlist which is kind of like your favourites section. Since it works seamlessly with Windows Media Player, it can synchronise everything automatically.   The transfer speed is great. I could have done with better headphones, and the black ones don't go well with the white player!! I think its one of the best PMPs around.

<Title>Don't buy, too many upsetting flawls....
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know where to start with this thing. When I first got it I thought it was great, well other than the rediculously short battery life. Unless you just play all your music non-stop and don't skip or choose songs (press any buttons) the Toshiba won't last more than 4 or 5 hours at best listening to music alone. But the extremely short battery life becomes more and more annoying as you use the product. Well I thought I could put up with that, and I did. But then it started placing album art from one artists to other artist's albums and even though when a song played it would list the proper artist as who the song would be by but it would be listed under another artist's album when you went to look for it. Other times I would only put one song on the mp3 player by an artist and the artist would be listed twice along with the same song. So it became extremely frustrating to find and upload music on the Toshiba gigabeat. Then to top it off, it died on me one time while listening to it and then after recharging it I turned it back on and it automatically deleted all of the music and video files I had on it and I had to put them all back on one by one. The problems kept occuring so I decided to get an Ipod and just give up on it. It's not worth the frustration and stress it causes. My advice is to stick with an Ipod or maybe a Creative.

<Title>Great idea, terrible performance
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, let me start with the things I really DO like about the GB30. The user's interface is simple, the graphics are crisp, and it is ridiculously intuitive to manage and transfer music as a Napster Ready-to-Go device.  However, the battery performance is pitiful. After 10 days (painfully aware that I am outside the window to return this for a refund from my seller), the battery would drain despite the fact that the unit was turned off.  After reluctantly returning the unit to the Toshiba repair depot, I received it within another 7 days only to find that they did not fix the problem.  So, I give up. I keep the unit fully charged by keeping it plugged in to the wall outlet between uses.  However, I will never by another Toshiba product nor would I ever recommend this seller again.

<Title>OK, good value, but a battery eater
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this on clerance at a national store, and honestly it is identical software and set-up as the microsoft Zune (window's mobile), but unfortunately harder to find accessories.   The best thing is that you  you can get these online here at amazon.   It operates Identical to the zune, my friend has one. Advantage over Ipod, don't have to convert all my old MP3 files. disadvantage, it eats the battery up.  there is no actual stop button. The off button turns the screen off, but keep the player loaded to the last song. I claims 20 hours of playtime, but I am lucky to get 4, or to keep it charged for more than a night.  I have to turn off the main battery button.   I don't know about the Ipod, and I might expect the zune to be similar.  So, look around. Overall I am happy so far, just have to bring a charger along and charge before a trip. I expect in the next couple years the prices will continue to drop on Ipods and Zunes, as well as creative's , and these will all be relics.

<Title>High Quality, Battery Problems Fixable
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before purchasing this product I did some research on it, and heard it was a high quality product but that the batteries sometimes lasted only about 4 hours. I ordered my own and am very pleased with the device. Everything works well, nice interface, and I was extremely impressed by the resolution of the screen.  The primary reason I am writing my own review however is my issue with the battery. My battery also lasted only 4 or 5 hours, dissapointed I called customer service, expecting to have to exchange it. However, this is what they told me to do: unplug the device, turn off the battery switch, plug it back in, wait for it to boot up, turn on the battery switch, and then turn the device off, letting it power for 3 to 5 hours. I did this (at least 5 hours), and then I got about 11 hours out of it (12.5 was advertised, but 11 is close enough for me). In short, at least in some cases, it seems the battery problem is largely fixable and just requires a really good initial charging.   My own largest concern when purchasing this product was the faulty battery issue. I've heard of people also exchanging them in worst case scenearios, but it seems most of the time the battery problem is fixable, and I would highly recommend this item to anyone, at least if you're content with a battery life of about 12 hours.

<Title>True Ipod Killer
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Micrsoft might have pulled the plug on Personal media center by going the Zune route, but this device is a nice implementation of PMC.  I have an ipod and I bought this for my sister as a present and spent a few weeks loading music and testing it out.   It beats the ipod classic on many fronts.  It was $50 cheaper for the same capacity (30 GB).  Dedicated controls beat the wheel any day.  I know the wheel feels cool for exactly 1 week, after that its a pain.  The ipod wont scroll up from 'A' to 'Z'. This will.  The sound quality was great with good earphones. The supplied earphones are just adequate though.

<Content>Battery life is absolutely atrocious.  I have had the battery replaced twice, and still I have less than 2 hours battery life.  And when the battery drains, all music/photos stored on the internal hard drive are gone....have to reload from a PC.  Worst product I ever bought.

<Title>Everything an MP3 player should be
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just recently burned my 30gb gigabeat out and downgraded to the 30gb zune (mainly so I could get a case that fits). Everything about the gigabeat is far superior to the zune in so many different ways. I'll just make a short list:  -Can sync files from your computer to it while using an application that you like -Windows can recognize it without being forced to install mandatory (and really lame) software -Able to convert the bitrate while you're syncing -Able to use it as an external HDD. Can drag and drop any file you want in or out -Intuitive, responsive buttons that any idiot can figure out -Decent FM radio reception -Get this, it comes with an AC adapter! -Perfectly adequate battery life -It's small, light, and very portable  I'm still beating myself up over not getting a new one. Asside from the "accessories,"  there is absolutely no reason anyone should consider a zune over the gigabeat.

<Title>Wonderful device, but not perfect
<Date>Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This device is beautiful. It sounds great. Photos and video look great. It is a breeze to navigate. Once you use the device, you realize the care taken in the design of both the physical product and the user interface. The click wheel was novel in its day, but in all honesty, Toshiba's plus-button control is more elegantly executed. It seems that many MP3 players try to wow with touch sensitve controls, but the Gigabeat S demonstrates that good old-fashioned buttons (with some intelligent software in support) get the job done best.  And why not five stars?  Well, the battery life frustrates often. There are ways to conserve battery (dimmer display, lower volume listening, lower bitrate music). Regardless, I doubt anyone can squeeze even 8 hrs of NORMAL audio use from a single charge. I recommend this device despite my less-than-wonderful opinion of the unit's battery life.  And now for the nitpicking. Some UI complaints (which diminish battery life) I hope are addressed in firmware updates:  If the screen is off, side buttons turn on the screen. I don't need the LCD to increase the volume or skip a track. Just a waste of battery to light up the LCD.  On the same note. When the unit is locked (on hold) button presses still turn on the LCD to alert that the unit is locked. Again, a waste of battery.  Nitpicking over.

<Title>Dont be like everyone with an Ipod.  Be Better!
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I didn't want and Ipod cause everyone has one.  I have been waitting for a Mp3/video player and when I saw this on CNET I bought it that very night.    I have the 60gb (black) and I'm writting this reveiw after owning it for about 2 weeks.  Pros.  IF it can play with windows media player it can play on this player!! Divx hint hint.  Connects perfict with windows media player and Media center Pc's.   The USB cable charges the unit so I leave this at the Pc all the time and the powercable I just leave at work. Navigation is so simple you can hand the unit to anyone and they will figer out how to find what they want in seconds. Small size for a unit that can hold tens of thousands of songs and pictures as well as a library of your favoret movies. Screen resaloution is very good but not excelent. Turning it on is practicly "instant on". Connects with Xbox 360.  Listen to your music while playing a game and navigate with x's controlers. Album art can be displayed full screen. Suports WMA lossless a very high quality audio codec that audiophiles love. TV out.. Play your music and watch a slide show of your vaca on your TV.  Watch movies. Radio Turner.. extra bonus for when you want something differnt or hear a beasball game. Unit comes with A/V cables. Scratch resistant case. TIVO and Media center Pc TV recordings compatable  I loaded many differnt Dvix formats AVIs on the player and they all work perfectly.   Cons.  Buttons on the right side seams to be silly placement. Sreen color Res. and well as TV out is not at full capasity its good enough but not amazing. No way to change screen format for widescreen movies. Some pictures are misplaced even though they are all loaded on from the same folder. Some files.. even though I rename them then load them on still retaine there original name. Very limited accesories available.. Waiting for a good set of powered speakers. No mass storage mode. (no dumping a file and transfering it to another pc) Unit dosnt not come with a small Lanyard.  (strap for your wrist)  Ok so theres a few things that are not perfict about this player. *The most important is Video color resoultion.  Its been stated that it's 65k for the units screen and for TV out.  For the units screen this is perfictly fine and most people wont be able to see the color abnormalities.  The TV out on the other hand you will see the graduation of color change in places like the sky and dark back grounds.  People who dont know what I am talking about it when you see each color separate in the transtion from darker to lighter.  Though you only see this 10 to 20 % of the time.  Watching video on a larger screen will make this problem more annoying.  The only thing to do about it is ignore it and pay attention to the movie.. Also an important factor is the quality of the video your watching..  If you download a movie and the party who "ripped" the movie did a crappy job well that what your going to get.. a crappy looking movie.  So look for high res. movies when downloading. I have to say when veiwing pictures through TV out isn't nearly as bad.  Its Very good.  *This isn't a fully portable HD.  Your not going to bring your library over to your freinds house and dump your files onto his PC. (theres other ways to share music anyhow)  But anyhow putting work files and spread sheets wont happen. *Video format.  Ok so the movie I am watching is in widescreen mode.  The player dosnt have the option to add black bars to the top and bottom so the video is out of perportion.  Though if I play the movie on the wide screen TV this isnt a problem.  Inprovments.  *Gray background.  For audio a gray back ground is drab.  Custumization would be best.   *Infared port.  This in conjuntion with a small remote (that and be stored in the player?!) with same face button config for easy control over the device from across the room. *SD card slot.  Mini or mico or standard SD slot would make dumping camera photos easy. And would make the unit a limited mass storge device. *Remove buttons on the sides.  This is silly.  Volume should be intergreted with the cross hair control.. I cant see why anyone could see this during the design process.. while I am listening to music and watching movies pressing right or left has a perpose but pressing up or down on the cross hairs dose nothing.. instead I have to look for the volume on the side.  *Color res.  Audiophiles will love the lossless codec but videophiles will literaly puke.   *Battery life.  I didnt place this as a Con cause its not bad at all.  But a longer life is what everyone seeks. *Accessories.  I know these wont develop without sales but I think and hope this player dose. *Reserved space.  So I can put work files and spreadsheets in a reserved folder.  Files that wonts be converted to windows format.  So the device can store other personal data. *Power point/ document veiwer.  Would take this unit ever farther down the road to success. *Games.  This device has a cross hair controler.  Why not develop some games.   I bought this player cause I wanted to have a PVP (personal video player) to bring to a freinds house and play videos, show pictures, and play music.. also some of my own movie maker files. This device is the answer to the wish for an easy way to share a video or movie with a freind with out having to burn a dvd (which isn't a quick process with divx files) Everything you load on this PMP (personal Media Player) is converted to its own personal format... And thats everything.. Photos, Music and Video are all changed before being loaded on the player..  Photos are resized.. not the huge poster quality that my camera takes but downsized enough to still have great quality when vewing on a large TV screen.  This is to save space on the HD.  All and all.   I am Very please with the Toshiba Gigabeat S.  I would recomend it to anyone who wants a video/mp3 player.  I know if this thing takes off there will be upgraded units.

<Title>Really poor quality
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Very happy for the 1st 3 weeks and then problems started to occur.  I put it in my back pocket of my pants and I guess my walking around while listening to it caused some kinda of warping (but MP3 players are built to stand some warping, right?).  First the screen died so I can only use the buttons to navigate to play the music.  Then the battery would suddenly discharge for no obvious reasons.  Now (3 months from the date I made the purchase) the whole player doesn't even work any more.    I am frusrated but I can't return it since I bought it in the US and relocated to Asia.  Don't buy it!

<Title>Excellent windows media based player
<Date>Sun Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I never have been a fan of the ipod, maybe because I thought that the screen was a tad small for my taste and also the price was a bit over my range... I spent a couple of weeks reviewing the other different players in the market until I came with the Gigabeat. You can find older versions of this player running in the low 200, those are a good deal, but their user interfase is not the best. With this new version they come with a better interfase, now related to the new windows media player 11. Great player, only complain is battery life, lasts about 12 hours playing music and about 3 hours playing videos. By the way video quality is excellent! If you are in the market for an mp3 player and a PVP I think you should put the Gigabeat high in your list!

<Title>Awesome player, works great with Rhapsody
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I got my gigabeat, and I have to admit, at first, shuffling through the screens when you want to go back to the song played got a bit confusing but when you get the hang of it, it's easy and you learn the shortcuts. After trying some other music subscriptions and not being happy with selection or software, I tried Rhapsody because I got a month free with my purchase and boy was I happy I did....it works flawlessly. Downloads are fast and it seems that the gigabeat can hold much more than a similar 30 GB product. The battery life is not great, but I've seen worse with other competitors as well. Overall, I'm very very happy with this product.

<Title>Great Non-IPod option for Windows XP Users
<Date>Thu Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently ordered this product after months of research as to the right PMP for me. Im a WindowsXP MC user, who prefers WMP to iTunes, and especially love the ability to 'drag and drop' files directly to my GigaBeat as I have an external HD I take from, and dont have time to library all 250gigs of MP3 files.  My initial impressions are extremely high. Ive found the interface to be seamless for anyone who uses a Windows OS, and the folder layouts and navigation to be perfect. It does take a little bit of getting used to (going side to side with a menu across the top etc), but I wouldnt trade it.  The video/picture quality is better than I expected after reviews. I have not had time to test a darker movie yet, but all signs point to not having to worry when I do. The picture is clear and bright -- and plenty clear enough to see in daytime or darkness.   The buttons on the side seem well placed to me, though I expect to be more comfortable after I memorize their placements.  Id prefer more background and color options than the standard windows background, and grey visual during mp3 play. But it doesn't affect the usage of the product at all.  I wouldnt have minded the scroll wheel found on ipods and recent ripoffs, but find the crosshair option found on the Gigabeat plenty sufficient. Its just not as 'fun'.  Ive had no issues with the battery life during music play.  The only downside to the player Ive found so far is the lack of made-for accessories. Cases are starting to be made in low supply, but otherwise your options are to look of Ipod capable items (cables etc), and hoping they fit.  I only wish they had the 60gig version available in white.

<Title>Gigabeat battery
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Gigabeat after reading the reviews about this unit being the "ipod killer". First, what I don't like about the unit. The battery, the battery, the battery! If apple can make a battery life on the IPOD that last 20 hours, why can't other manufacturers?  The first week I got the Gigabeat the battery lasted 5 hours, then 4, then 2. Now it doesn't turn on. I had to send back to Toshiba for repair. I am not happy. Where are the accessories? How can you beat the iPOD without accessories? Price - If you want to beat the king you have to be better than the king especially in price.  In operations. If you are not careful you can delete all the music on the player.   Now here is the good: The unit sounds great, nice size screen, works well with Media Player, easy to use.   The bottom Line: This is not an "iPod killer". I should have gotten an IPOD!!
