<Title>New Sony MS-11:  sleek but restrictive
<Date>Sat Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Purchased Sony's new MS-11 but returned it the same day (and purchased Samsung YP700).  Despite it's steep price...it is indeed great looking, functional but has one large flaw -- Sony's music management system is too restrictive (explained below).<p>Before I purchased the MS-11, its product specs read 'plays back in ATRAC and supports MP3'.  This means that if you have MP3 songs that you have converted or downloaded free from the internet onto your computer, you cannot merely 'copy' them onto the Sony MagicGate memory stick ("MS"), but rather must convert the MP3 song file into Sony's ATRAC format.  Once converted, Sony's music management system tracks how many instances of a song has been 'checked' out of your computer (that you connect the MP3 player to) and limits the number of times you can 'checkout' a song.  Also, Sony recommends that 'checked out' songs are then 'checked back in' (as opposed to merely deleting the song from MS if you no longer want it) -- what a hassle! <p>Bottom line is that Sony (as a music company) wants to (over) protect music intellectual property which means a hindrance to users.  <p>I would recommend other brands, such as Samsung YP700 (which is 128MB built-in and you can add 128MB memory chip), as opposed to Sony MS-11 which has no built-in memory but does come with 128MB MS.  The Samsung looks great, works great (blue LCD lighting with remote control) and is cheaper at [lower price] -- and importantly, you can simply copy/delete downloaded MP3 files onto the player without dealing with a 'check-in/check-out' music filing system.

<Title>All you would expect from Sony and then some
<Date>Sat Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have always bought Sony electronics because they are the best made and most reliable. Unfortunatley I bought a Rio MP3 player before I upgraded to the Sony MS11. First the sound quality is so good you would think you are listening to a CD. The jukebox software that is included makes transfering songs from the net or a CD to the walkman a breeze. It weighs nothing so it is very easy for me to go to the gym and not worry about it getting in the way. You won't be disappointed with this product ( except when you see the price ).

<Title>Top notch technology from Sony
<Date>Sun Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Slick and extremely compact, this MP3 player has everything you need and nothing you don't.<br>Song transfers are fast via USB, quite easy to perform with OpenMG. Personnally i don't really mind the copyright issue.<p>This awesome piece of technology sits in the palm of your hand and is extremely user friendly, battery life is an incredible 10 hours! and 128 MB is enough for about 35 songs at 132 kbps.<p>Bottow line; <br>Sony technology at it's best. Two thumbs up!

<Content>The Sony digital Walkman MP-3 player is terrific.  The only thing that is needed is some type of carrier so that you can run or jog with it, and not have to carry it in your hand.  It is a thousand times better than a portable CD player or cassette player.

<Title>Pretty Good
<Date>Thu Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>If your looking to buy this music player then a here are a few things you need to know.<p>1. transfer times are a little bit slow.  cause you have to convert your mp3 into atrac an then it transfers.  the transfer from your computer is fast but the converson is not.<p>2. i had problems with the software, i called sony to get it corrected but the phone rep couldnt help and told me that someone higher would call the next day, but no one did, instead i got an email asking me what the problem was ( i didnt like that cause it take more time to do it through email)  my problem was that the software open mg caused an error and terminated in win xp.  I figured that my ms outlook was messing it up and delete outlook and every since open mg has worked fine.<p>3. the whole check in/ check out system [stinks].  Im fine with the whole check out thing but the fact that i have to check the song back in to avoid not being able to check the song out next time is absurd (actually you have 4 check outs with out check in before it does that).  i know the system is to prevent ppl from sharing songs but why would it matter if you check it in or not cause you cannot put the song on another computer anyways. for one it wont let you, two its in atrac. for me after i dont want a song on it i jsut delete it, and i recently read taht you need to check it in so im a bit peaved.<p>4.small things i dont like is that the battery indicator is inconsistent. its not a big deal or anything but i jsut never know when my batter is almost dead.  what happens is that after you charge the bat. and put it in the indicator quickly drops to 3 bars (4 being full) then after and hour or 2, it drops to 1 bar then lasts for a while on one bar.  it may not even matter to you but its sorta does for me.  <p>so the decision you have to make is is the look worth the hassle?, is the price worth the hassle?, and is sony worth the hassle?<p>i know ive said alot of problems ive had with it but i still like the player it is incredibly small and looks great.  It is light and does the job that i bought it for.  overall i am happy with my nw-ms11, but then again i got it as a birthday present and didnt shell out [price] for it.

<Title>Great, but with one or two prblems
<Date>Thu Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This product is easy to use and sounds really good. It's the best on short flights or excercising, but the battery doesnt always charge when left in the charger overnight. There is no light on the charger to tell if it charging... Sometimes I will leave it in the charger all night and in the morning 50/50 chance its charged.... Also the fact I have to use Sony's software to load songs on id kind of a pain as it isnt that well thought out...

<Title>The Betamax of MP3 players has rubbish software
<Date>Mon Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>The software that accompanies this device lets it down...  <p>* The tracks you save are stored in a hidden database on your PC so you cannot treat them as you would normal files.<br>* If you ever decide to use a different brand of player you will not be able to move your songs from the database.<br>* If you try and import a second CD the software assumes the new cd has the same number of tracks as the previous one, this means you have to restart the software regularly.<br>* The software is generally slow to respond to button clicks which makes it feel clumsy.<p>The player itself is great but suffers from the following problems...<p>* Files cannot be copied directly to the player using file manager.<br>* You cannot play MP3s only ATRAC files, which you havn't heard of because nobody else uses them.<p>If you don't mind the prospect of rebuilding your 'ATRAC' collection when you decide to buy real MP3 player or you want to remain loyal to sony for the rest of your life then buy this player.

<Title>Depends on what you're looking for..
<Date>Fri Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is a fantastic product -- but it's not for everyone.  <p>If you're a big MP3 fan and have hundreds (or thousands) of MP3s, then this may not be for you.  While Sony says that you can play WMA and MP3 files on this 'Walkman', you really have to convert it to ATRAC format using their software, first.  If you don't mind converting to ATRAC from MP3 (the quality is similar, if not better), then this will work -- but chances are you probably don't want to go through that process.<p>However, if you're looking for a small, sleek, portable player that you can load several of your CDs to: this is the product for you.  Pop a CD into your computer, tell the softeare to convert it, and then just choose what songs you want on the Walkman.<p>The sound quality is great, and the physical product is top of the line.  The software could use a little work, but for the most part is solid (I wouldn't want to run it on an outdated computer, though).
