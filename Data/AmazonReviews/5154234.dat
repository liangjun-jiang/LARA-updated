<Title>NO RESUME!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The title says it all.  If you bought this player for listening to audiobooks, which is what I did, you'll be extremely disappointed that you'll have to fast forward through the book every time you start it up since there is no resume feature.  Considering audiobooks are anywhere from 3 to 8 hours long in most cases, or at least the pieces you get from audible are, it's totally inconvenient to start playing from the beginning each time you turn it on.  Get used to the fast forward button and remembering exactly what time you were at because you're going to be doing a lot of it.  Lame.

<Title>Progressively Worse
<Date>Mon Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I thought it was a pretty nice little MP3 player, although the 60 songs it holds has always been a thorn in my side. I didn't mind converting everthing over to real player since it doesn't play itunes, however, after about three months I had to change the battery...After changing the battery, the mp3 player would randomly shut off, which became a constant problem after every battery change, though eventually the problem would solve itself. Approximately a year later, the battery cover was also constantly falling off for no apparent reason. Now, about a year and a half since purchase, it has completely died, only playing about two minutes worth before shutting off on its own and refusing to reboot for several minutes. It's a great player for the price, but I would have liked something a little more dependable with a larger memory.

<Content>electrical short kills cheap-med quality head phones!  i lost four before i figure out the problem. and no, it was not just one player. i returned it and got a new one, and it did the same thing. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 because it records radio very well.DO NOT BUY!

<Content>As most who bought this one knows the battery door did indeed break on my sons. It skips and freezes really bad. He still uses it but I do not think it would hurt his feelings if it got stolen at school! lol

<Title>bad investment
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wished I had read all of the reviews for this when I bought mine two years ago. It is worse than a piece of junk because I paid too much money for it and it is useless. The buttons are not easy to use, when I think I am turning it up, I have somehow skipped to the FM radio and cannot seem to get back, other times it seems to cycle through the same 5 songs for no apparent reason. I am still very bitter about spending so much money for a worthless piece of junk - not to mention all the time I have spent trying to make it work.
