<Title>Great alternative to the iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you're like me and don't want to join the millions of sheep, try this player.  I got it about 3 weeks ago and I'm totally pleased with its features.  The display is simple but I don't need fancy graphics.  Just want it to play mp3's.  The unit is a little bigger than the old e series but it's classy in style.  Yes, the glass face does attract fingerprints but I bought a case so it's not an issue.  I don't use WMP for transferring the files.  Just plug it in and drag the files onto the music folder.  What I like most about it is the AAC file support.  If you encode your files at 96K AAC, you can squeeze quite a bit of music on 8 gigs (about 3 megs per 5 min song).  But then you always have the SD media slot if you run out of room.  Try that on an iPod.  The EQ is nice to have.  The earbuds are ok but I bought some better ones.  My only gripe is the way the player organizes the music.  It doesn't read the tag for track number so each album is listed in alphabetical order.  That's fine for most music but if you listen to progressive music, the songs all segue into each other so the songs have to play in a certain order.  I suppose I can make a playlist to fix that.  It's minor and I can live with it.  Definitely give this player a shot!

<Title>Overall problematic MP3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems, the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines.  The rewind bar doesn't work either!  you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding, but it'll resume right where it left off! I only give this player 2stars just because it's ease.

<Title>Good player, bad software
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As an MP3 player, the Sansa View works perfectly well. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the software installed on the player. It's glitchy, and even small annoyances can become big problems when there's no good solution for them.  After updating to Windows Media Player 11, I found that my Sansa no longer worked with my computer. None of the songs I added showed up on the computer, and the player refused to let me add any new songs or sync with Windows Media Player. I couldn't upgrade the firmware, either. Formatting the device solved the problem, but it also meant that I had to add all 8 GB of music back onto the player.  The manual that comes with the View contains almost no information about installation or troubleshooting, though the customer service reps are very patient and helpful if you end up having to call them. Also, the player only works with Windows XP (and possibly Vista), which limits anyone who prefers to use other operating systems.   Though this MP3 player will charge through a USB cable, those with laptops or computers with USB 1.0 ports will want to (or possibly even have to) purchase the wall charger. Though my laptop has USB 2.0, it still doesn't charge the battery very well or very quickly.    I really enjoy the Sansa View as an MP3 player. The interface is nice, and so is the design. It's easy to use - I use it to listen to music in the car, and it works wonderfully. I only wish that the software installed on the device was anywhere near as good. It's what's keeping me from recommending the View to anyone else.

<Title>Love My MP3
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this tiny MP3 player.  Very easy to use. If you do have any problems, their customer support is great.  I had to download a driver to get it going and I also called about another problem. They talked me right through everything and it all works well. I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio.  The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort.  I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music.  To add videos and pictures it is necessary to dowload free software from the Sansa site. I feel this is a great product and it was better than I expected with a very reasoable price.

<Title>Pretty good player
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player almost 2 months ago and I love it. I bought a wall charger and a protective case at the same time, so I've had no trouble with fingerprints or charging. The charge holds very well (I haven't tried charging from the PC, I prefer the wall charger) I use Windows Media Player 11 to manage my music files, and I've had absolutely no trouble syncing files, just a matter of choosing the songs and they sync in seconds. I did not use the CD that came with the player, so I can't comment on the content, instead I went to the Sandisk website and downloaded the user's manual in PDF format, which is pretty straightforward. (BTW, it also explains that some USB ports may not have enough power to charge the player, this may be why some customers are having trouble) Downloading photos was also very easy, again using WMP 11. I also downloaded video that I took with a digital camera.So far I haven't had any freezes like those described by other customers (I would suggest going to Sandisk's website and updating the firmware) I don't give the product 5 stars because if I'm listening to songs and then go to photos or the radio, when I go back to songs, they want to start again from song#1 instead of where I left it, which I find annoying. Also, I didn't like the earbud style (replaced them with Sony) and the fact that it didn't come with a wall charger, I had to buy it separately (but most players don't come with the charger these days). However the modulary style of the charger means that I got an extra sync cable, which is nice because the plug is propietary (another thing I don't like) Overall, I'm very happy with the View. Nice display, easy to use menu, great battery life, good sound, nice slim size, memory card slot,good radio reception, voice recorder, power saver features, syncs trouble-free with WMP 11. The good definitely outweigh the bad.

<Title>Better than the Ipod I had
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I previously had an ipod nano 2nd gen.  it had gotten water logged and thus, died.  my fault entirely.  i began to research more into other mp3 players.  my best friend showed me his sansa, i think it was the c240.  after a lot of messing around with it, i decided that the sansa brand was the way to go.  the fm tuner works great incase i would rather just want to listen to the radio.  i love the drag and drop option for music rather than syncing to a music player.  the screen resolution is great, the only problem is that it gets a bit sketchy.  it doesn't affect the performance so i'm not worried about it.  i got it as a christmas present from my fiance and absolutely love it.  the screen is awesome, the music quality is great coming out.  the only thing i would suggest is getting a new pair of headphones.  the plugs that come with it tend to get uncomfortable after some time.  no problems with the battery.  i had a usb-house plug adapter.  it charges it great and i get a couple days of play.  that's including use in car and listening to it during classes.  the usb plug adapter can be gotten at walmart pretty cheap.  i would recommend charging it that way rather than via the computer.  that way, you don't always have to have the computer on.

<Title>Sandisk MP3 player
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ended up buying four of these MP3 players.  I originally bought them for my children for Christmas.  Then my husband said he would be interested in one, so I bought him one also.  They were all so happy with them that my husband suggested I get one for myself and I did.  We all really like them.  I love the fact that I don't have to carry around all the cds anymore and once I got used to how it works I just love it.  My version even though they say they are the same thing are different than the other three but either way we like all the features they have.

<Title>A competitive mp3 player in an iPod-dominated world.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>There have been many mixed reviews of this product, and from what I can tell, opinions are split between people who expect an MP3 player and those who expect an iPod.  No doubt, iPods have their benefits, but the Sansa View has proven to be superior in my opinion. Being a college kid, I keep my MP3 player with me at all times as if it were some sort of life-support equipment.  I used to have a first-generation iPod Nano, but I converted from that fad religion when I saw my girlfriend's Sansa e200.  My Sansa View has more capacity than the current generation iPod's in the same price range, with just as high quality of audio playback.  The navigation with the rubberized click wheel takes about three minutes to get used to (yes, the iPod's amazing touch wheel is award winning, but you'll find, after about a day of use, that the Sansa's navigation is just as intuitive as any other).  There are other structural features that add to the View's quality: the integrated hold switch is easy to use, and the back of the Sansa View is covored by a rubberized finish that helps keep the player still when on a table top (unlike the scratch-prone chrome backing of the iPod).  When it comes to the synchronization of the View with your computer's media library, I strongly reccommend using Windows Media Player (free from Microsoft, if your PC doesn't already have it; they have a Mac version, too :-D).  That program's Sync tab and organization, ever since the introduction of WMP 10, have made it just as easy to use as iTunes or any other, once you get used to the different formatting.  It will even recognize your specific Sansa View, and the two work quite harmoniously together. As I have not yet had any technical troubles with my View, the only problem I see inherit in its design is that the Sansa's screen stays lit, with a glowing "connected" symbol, the entire time it's plugged into your computer.  Even when you're not synchronizing, and you're just charging the player, the screen is fully lit.  The problem I see this having the potential to cause, though it has yet to happen, is someone forgetting to remove their View, leaving it connected to their computer for the weekend or so, and having dead or floating pixles burnt into their screen when they return to use their player.  I don't know if that would happen, but, nonetheless, I always take my View off its charging cord the minute it's done. Despite this flaw, the View has countless other features, making it superior to the iPod and other player.  It has a built in FM tuner, which is handy when you don't want to listen to any of your own music, and you just want some casual background music.  You can even record FM radio, along with anything else you want with the built in microphone and voice recorder. One last important thing to mention:  Many people don't realize that when they buy an iPod, they're aren't really getting an MP3 player, as an iPod can only play the specific iPod file type coverted and purchased through iTunes.  Furthermore, the video capability of iPods is limited to ONLY those videos purchased through iTunes.  The Sansa, on the other hand, can play raw MP3 files without having to be converted, and play any of the most popular internet video types, such as WMA and ANYTHING converted through Sandisk's media converter (free from the website).

<Title>A very good product and great value.
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been a fan of Sansa players for some time.  Their products outshine the competition on several critical points:  --They are Audible.com compatible.  If you love audio books like I do (I drive a lot and they are a constant companion) then this is an essential feature.   --It has a built in voice recorder. --It works with a variety of software. --It has a built in FM tuner...AND it can record FM radio too...a really wonderful feature. --You can expand its memory with a miniSD card.  The screen is bright and the controls are simple to use as well.  A couple of points: --the chapter mode for audiobooks doesn't work well.  I don't recommend using it since it loses its place in books. --the radio records in .wav format which uses up a lot of memory.  (I worked around this by saving the file as .wmv and playing it as a video (one large file went from ten Gig(!) down to 500meg.  Overall, dollar for dollar, it is a better value and more functional than any other product currently available.  You will not be disappointed.

<Title>Wonderful overall
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So far my view has been almost perfect. I have had it for about a month now and have had no problems with freezing etc that others had reported. The screen flickers a bit sometimes but that is no problem for me. It is a bit unweildy to run with, and I did have a bit of trouble loading songs onto it, but it runs perfectly.

<Title>Sansa View Rocks!
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second Sansa mp3 player, the first being an e260, so I kind of knew what to expect.  As expected, it's a great mp3 player with the ability to play videos.  It's very thin and has a very nice finish to it.  I like the controls on the View vs the e200, the scroll wheel is where you press instead of having buttons outside of the scroll wheel.  I bought a silicone case and armband for it and the fitment is perfect.  The only hang up I have is the Sansa Media Converter.  You can drop in all kinds of movies and have it convert them to video your View can play, but not only is it slow, but you have to leave the View plugged in while it's converting.  I use Any Video Converter to convert to MPEG4 (the free version works great) and then drag & drop on the View.  It does hang every once in a while for about 10 seconds, but only the controls/display, the music keeps playing.  There was a firmware update that GREATLY improved this, but SanDisk rolled back to the previous version because it would kill the battery in about half the time, or less.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with it.  Oh, and it doesn't have a place for a lanyard like the e200 series does.  Sometimes I like to hang it around my neck while at work because I don't use the arm band unless I'm running or at the gym.

<Title>SanDisk tech support saves the day!
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First a word of caution for people ordering from Dell:  I ordered Sansa E280 from Dell but they shipped me Sansa View 8GB instead for reasons Dell said that "were beyond their control". They called the View an "upgrade". Although it has a bigger screen, I'm having my doubts.  I made the mistake of not opening the box for 35 days. When I did and discovered it was not what I ordered, I tried to return it to Dell, but was told they could not take it back even though it was not what I ordered. So much for "the benefit of the bargain" that I was taught in law school. Dell's customer service rep told me that I could always return the product within 90 days if it was defective so I should go ahead and try it out. An hour later, after downloading a few pictures and songs I disconnected it from my computer, but the View's screen was frozen with the words "Connected" in the screen. At this point I was very  ready to return it to Dell, but the new service rep denied any 90 day defective return policy and said my only recourse was with the manufacturer. I will never buy any Dell product again, nor will I buy any product sold by Dell. They respect neither common law principles nor their customers.  When I called SanDisk tech service, they resolved the technical problem of the screen freeze instantly by walking me through a hard reboot [by pressing the power off slider switch door about 15 seconds and resetting the firmware]. Naturally the SanDisk tech support person for the View told me that it was a much better product than the E280 (in spite of the inferior reviews by customers here at Amazon). He said "all these issues have been addressed through firmware updates".  I am hoping he is right!

<Title>Great little mp3
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there.
