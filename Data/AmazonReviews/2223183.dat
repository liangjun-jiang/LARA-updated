<Title>Best player out there right now
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Been looking around for a good mp3 player for about 6 months now, ever since I realized my iPod sucked (between the lack of real battery life and the complicated software intrface, I had had enough with Apple).  Believe me I looked into everything from Microsoft Zune to Creative Zen to the 30gb iPod, and a few lesser known players. THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST ALL AROUND MEDIA PLAYER OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, and here's why:  1) Unprecedented battery life! It's been 4 days of on-and-off play for me since I first charged it out of the box, and I STILL HAVE 2 BARS LEFT.  2) Easy software interface: uploading songs and pics through the samsung program can get tedious if you want to make playlists, but other than that, I simply use the plug-n-play option (simply dragging media files into the removable disk folder).  3) Awesome sound quality! I was truly amazed with the cd-quality sound of the FM radio feature.   4) Plays WMA along with MP3: you will find that this NECESSARY feature is lacking in many of the other big wig players out there right now (ie Creative Zen)  5) Beautiful seamless controls (no "buttons")  6)YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE!

<Title>Looks good but...
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this cute little player because it promised so much!  Granted it sounded AWESOME, if you can get it to sync to Windows Media Player (which is one of the requirements for your player).  I was unable to get it to sync.  The first time I called customer service, I talked to a less than technical person who told me that the player was not compatable with WMP 11 and to roll back to WMP 10.  Guess what!  WMP 10 is NOT compatible with Windows XP.  So obviously that did not work.  I didnt stay on the phone to talk to that guy.  The second time I called (yes, two customer service calls in less than 24 hours since I could not get my player to sync), I spoke with someone who actually had some training.  He didnt understand why guy #1 told me to roll back to WMP 10 since the player should have worked with WMP 11.  After talking with him for 45 min he had to transfer me to a secondary help section.  Sorry, I am not going to sit on the phone for another 45 minutes listening to their awful wait music so someone else can tell me they dont understand why it is not syncing.  I also tried to sync the player to another computer.  Didnt work.  So I returned it and tried a different one.  Nope.  It didnt work either.  When I took the second one back, the girl at the store said that Samsung had been having a lot of issues with their players not syncing.  That is too bad.  I am done with Samsung.  If it would have worked, it would have been exactly what i wanted.

<Title>A Great Player with a Few Quirks
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device has lots of good points and only a few bad points and bugs.  First, the good.   1. The sound quality is fantastic, much better than my first generation iPod. I am using my own headphones, the provided ones have not been opened.  2. Transfering files is fast and simple, no software is needed although a CD is provided.  3. The response is super fast. This is also bad, see below.  4. There have no glitches, no freeze-ups, no occational skipping. That last one is important as my old iPod got jittery all too often.  5. Although it is not the cheapest, it is substantially less that the iPod Nano.  6. The screen is bright, colorful, and clear, at least indoors.  7. The battery charges quickly and lasts forever.  8. I don't use pictures much on these tiny devices but the images I tested by loading them through the Samsung software were excellent, considering the tiny screen.  9. It looks nice!  Now, the bad.  1. The controls are so fast I still haven't figured out how to avoid holding them down too long. The screen sometimes goes wild jumping from menu-to-menu as I clumsily try to stop pressing buttons!  2. The provided software is mediocre at best and doesn't run very well under Vista. Everytime it starts up, it goes into convulsions before settling down. After that, is is fine. Works properly on my XP desktop.  3. I have yet to figure out how to get playlists over to the device. Every playlist, rather than being a reference, starts copying duplicates of the files already there. I don't have the space for that.  4. It is easily scratched even just sitting there. Get screen protectors for it before you even take it out of the box.  Finally, the ugly.  1. My 1 Gig iPod was never filled so I got the 2 Gig Samsung. Wow, it holds less that the smaller iPod. However, I think the sizes are larger which may be why the sound quality is so much better. Get the 4 Gig model.  2. The device is really geared for Europe. None of the free-for-30-days music stores with free downlaods are available to those of us in North America.  3. The on-line registration is crazed, I filled out the form at least 5 times and each time some silly tiny "mistake" was made. It didn't even like my address! I gave up.  Over all, this is a great compromise between the expensive iPods and the error-prone cheaper models of mp3 players.

<Title>Great MP3 Player, 
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Samsung has made a fine digital audio player with the YP-K3. Its slim and sexy in black and looks very classy. The screen is pretty big and looks just fine. Audio quality is pretty decent but the included headphones are crap. I am probably going to buy a decent pair of Shure's to replace the ones that were included with the device. Also, when I tried to play music from the K3 over my car stereo I noticed it did not have a lot of driving power i.e. the audio was not loud even at high volumes. Transferring songs from Windows Media Player is a breeze and I never had to install the Samsung Media Studio.  The only gripe I have about this player is the display interface. Now the touchscreen is great and all but the display seems to be lagging a bit when I am scrolling down the list of my albums. The animations that play when I am listening to music also seem to be a bit choppy. I hope they resolve that through a firmware update. Overall a great player, especially for people like me who want to buy anything but an iPod :)

<Title>Great Player!!!!
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an awesome player. I started with the YP-JAB model that has the slide out speaker, which I still have and am in love with. Well I decided I wanted the slim version for running purposes. The previous was a bit heavy for the type workout clothes I wear.  First of all the controls are a bit sensitive but adjusting the amount of pressure when using them will definitely do the trick. You don't have to press these controls just a little tap will do.   Secondly, I have Windows XP and I use Media Player 10 and everything performs as it should. The one time I accidently upgraded to MP 11, it still worked perfectly so I can assure you that this little device is indeed compatible with that version also.  Lastly, creating the playlist is a bit tricky and it took me longer than I wanted to figure out but once I had it, I was able to add my playlist as easily as I add my albums.  The only con as far as I am concerned is the lack of accessories for this device. I wanted to buy an arm band or a case for it and the few I found were very unattractive and all were black. I happen to love my red player so it would have been nice to buy a decent looking case that doesn't take away from the appearance of my player. ~~~~~~~ All said, I definitely recommend this product and if you take the time to actually learn to use its features - I am pretty sure that you will love it as I do!

<Title>Fantastic Product, Stupid Customer Support
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>How could I give this little guy anything other than 5 stars.   Pros: It's sleek and shiny. The sound is fantastic, even my lower quality mp3s still sound good. The volume goes higher than my ears can stand. The fm tuner works well. The photo capability is nice, though I really can't say that I use it. Syncing it through Windows Media Player couldn't possibly be easier. The battery life is simply unbelievable, at least compared to some of the old creative and apple mp3 players I have used. The touch interface works well, although every now and then it isn't quite as responsive as I would like, although that may be because I have a screen protector on it and then the belkin case over that.  Cons: Not a lot to talk about here, but here are the few minor things that come to mind. If you don't get a case or plastic screen protectors the front will become a mess. The on/off/hold button can be a little difficult to use with my large fingers. The only feature that I wish it had is video playback.  Oh yeah, and best of all it's not an apple product!   **************************** UPDATE *********************************  Still nothing but love for this player, Samsung Customer Support on the other hand can go to H*ll!!!!  I lost one of the little foam covers for the earbuds (and thus one side no longer fit snugly), which really saddened me because they were some of the few earbuds that comfortably fit my ears. I figured it was a common situation and as such it wouldn't be a problem to just order a new set of covers. WRONG!!! you can only pay another forty bucks for a whole new set of earbuds. Anyway, I emailed Samsung twice and they never responded. So finally I called and when I told their foreign representative the problem she said "So the problem is that you can't transfer music from your IPod to your K3?" WTF!!! Eventually I got the problem communicated but she simply told me that the problem isn't covered by the warranty because it is my own fault and that I should buy new earbuds, which is stupid because I just wanted to order a replacement part not for them to send me new earbuds.

<Title>A quality  MP3 player with radio to boot!
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player because my CD/MP3 walkman had died and an iPod that I liked was a bit out of my price range. What sold me on this player was the size (this thing is really small!), design (super sleek!), and the FM radio receiver (Ah, radio...). Also it seems to hold up well. I dropped mine right out of the box, and it works just fine. I bought the red one, though I think the color could more accurately be described as garnet. I love that the only real button on the player is the power/lock button located on the side. The rest of the interface is touch-sensitive. There are severeal different sound equalizer presets, an equalizer you can set manually, as well as repeat and shuffle modes. The sound quality from this player is great, but I'd recommend discarding the earbuds that come with it and getting some quality earphones to truly enjoy the sound. The music organizing software that comes with the player is a little difficult to figure out at first, not terribly intuitive to use. Once you figure it out, though, you can set up your playlists in that program and then load them onto the player. Be aware that if you do a search for music on your computer with that software, it will only recognize MP3 files. If you have any of your favorite music saved in wave format, the program won't notice it. I have yet to try to sync my YP-K3 with Windows Media Player. Also, be aware that the radio dial only goes up to 107.5. If you like any stations located above that on the dial, you're out of luck. Other than that, this is a high quality music player. Battery life is awesome. There is plenty of volume available to blow your ears off if you want to. It holds quite a bit of music and pictures, too. I would buy this player again.

<Title>The Ipod Killer (as long as you upgrade the firmware...)
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You can stop looking because you have just found the best MP3 player on the market today. Yes, this is the fabled "ipod killer" that beats the ipod Nano in almost every conceivable category. It probably won't actually outsell the ipod, because lets face it: if features were what sold ipods, Apple would be out of business. But I digress.   Unlike other players on the market, the Samsung K3 focuses itself on being an audio player first, and ignores some of the more gimmicky features found on other players such as video support. Personally, I would rather drive nails into my eyes then watch a movie on a 1-inch screen, but maybe that's just me. The other notable feature missing on the K3 is album art support, although I have my fingers crossed that a future firmware upgrade will correct this. Samsung more than makes up for the missing features by offering what is (in my opinion) the best sounding player on the market. The sound quality and number of customizable sound options such EQ settings, 3D sound, bass boost, etc are outstanding, particularly in the latest firmware versions. Personally, I listen to my K3 in normal mode with high quality Sennheiser buds (CX300) and I have zero complaints about the sound quality. This is a music player, not a media player. Some other cool features of the K3 are a great sounding FM radio, photo viewing, and text / lyrics viewing.  The K3 also wins out in the looks department, being the slimmest, most stylish player you can buy. I have the red version of this player and I actually get complements on my MP3 player! Everyone who picks it up tells me how cool it looks. The K3 also has nice a solid feel to it in your hand - it just FEELS like a quality product. This is an important consideration, because some other players on the market, such as the creative Zen-V, feel like a children's toy that just fell out of a box of Frosted Flakes (seriously, go hold one!). But where the K3 really shines is in the looks department. No other player on the market comes close in terms of style. Not only is the player razor thin, but it has a nice clean design. The great menu designs and graphics on the player all combine to offer up a sense of style that is rarely found in electronics. And then there are the ultra-cool touch buttons. They take a little bit of getting used to, but once you have them down, you will never want to go back. The touch buttons are a great rival to the ipod click wheel.  So the player itself is great, but where most MP3 players fall short is in the software / media management side of things. A short explanation of the two main types of MP3 players is necessary here: MTP vs UMS.  MTP stands for 'media transfer protocol' and refers to the scenario where software running on your computer manages the transfer of media to your portable device. This is the ipod / itunes model, where only itunes can get music onto your ipod. The alternative is UMS, which stands for 'universal mass storage' meaning that the portable device acts like a mini hard drive and can be connected to any computer. There are pros and cons to each method, with the primary advantage of the MTP model being ease of use and transparency, while the UMS devices offer simplicity and portability at the expense of placing the responsibility (and control) for managing the player onto the user.  What makes the Samsung K3 so great is that they cater to BOTH of these markets by making the K3 firmware upgradeable and offering both an MTP steam of firmware AND a UMS stream of firmware. This does not seem to be a well advertised fact, and I will warn you that it is not exactly easy to do the upgrade, but the point is that it CAN be done.  Any experienced computer user should be able to manage it.  Myself, I cannot stand MTP devices or itunes-like software, which is what makes the K3 so attractive to me. Unfortunately, the K3 comes out of the box as an MTP device, meaning that you have to install the bundled Samsung software at least once to get things running. The Samsung software is about as good as any MTP software (i.e. complete crap), but it does what it is supposed to. The nasty little surprise that Samsung bundles with their software I could live without though. Samsung has silently bundled some DRM software / spyware called "Markany" with their program. After installing the software, you will notice two new programs that will run at all times in the background on your computer. One is the Samsung software, the other is the Markany program. Some people won't care about things like this, but it drives me completely bonkers!  The good news is that by upgrading the firmware to UMS, you can successfully ditch both the Samsung software and Markany, and enjoy all the great features of the K3, without having to bother with any software at all. Just plug in the player and copy your music over like it was a flash drive. Simple, easy, clean. Once this minor headache is over, you are left with one of the most powerful, best sounding, and definitely most stylin' music players you can buy.

<Title>Good, but not great for the price
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The battery life lasts just as long as my old mp3 player, the IAudio 1GB, so that is not its selling point. It took only 2.5 hours to decrease by 1 bar out of 4, which means total life is approximately 10 hours. Sound quality is better than average. Design, however, is very stylish and easy to use. Charging battery/transferring files is also quite fast. The photo feature is a neat addition. Basically, this product offers higher memory, slightly better sound, photos, and attractive design. Battery life is not as good as I expected.

<Title>Treat yourself!!
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had been wanting a new mp3 player but was not impressed by the ipod as much as the other "sheep".  A close friend has this model and I was able to "try before you buy".  This was the most worthwhile purchase I have made in recent memory.  The operating program included with the player is very user friendly and allows for easy transfer of songs or podcasts.  It is also capable of storing photos but I have never understood who would want photos or videos on a piece of equipment that has a screen smaller than two inches.  This player has a locking feature to prevent skipping of music if you slip it into your pocket.  The touch screen reacts quickly and requires minimal pressure to select options.  The sleek design (size and appearance) beats the crap out of the ipod for the price and has all the same benefits for half the price.  It is worth you time to check it out (and purchase)!

<Title>Cute Player...great for the price
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just received the Samsung 2G YP-K3JQB Mp3 player. For me this player is perfect. It stores more than enough music for me, has a FM radio option, and is easy to use. The sound is great. I found it easier to load music on it through Windows Media Player rather than the CD they give you. I was having issues with my CDs being read as duplicate tracks but if you go through WMP it is fine. The only thing that I found to be a slight annoyance is the touch pad is really sensetive so you have to be careful when you are handleing it. I would recomend this to anyone who wants an easy to use, good price MP3 player.

<Content>I was looking for a simple, but stylish mp3 player about a year ago.  I came across the Samsung K3, which is so incredibly thin!  It works really well, has a radio which is handy when I'm looking for new songs to put on it, and a clock, pictures and is over all really awsome.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  It has a very clear screen, and has various backrounds when you're playing music, and is easy to use.  The earbuds stink, though, so you'd need to buy your own.  I would definatly recommend this to someone who wants something that's not too complicated but has lots of nice features. : )
