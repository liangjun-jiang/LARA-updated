<Title>Awsome

<Content>I've had this for more then 3 months and i love it. it holds all my music, videos, and pictures. i had some trouble with videos i made, but after a little fiddleing i got it to work. i didnt have any problems with videos purchased online, they transferd quick and work great. the built-in speaker isn't very loud but with headphones or external speakers it works great. it comes with av cables to plug it into a tv or stereo and works great. when changing song or going through the menu it will occasionally freeze for 1-2 seconds but it isnt a large issue. i havnt had any problems with data lose or anything like that. the batterie lasts me all week for the 1 hour bus ride but id suggest buying another battery(since there only about 20 dollars) if you want to watch alot of videos. it also works awsome with Amazon Unbox video downloads and can be transfered right from the amazon video player. To conclude, I love it and was very happy with the purchase, although it would be cool if it could access internet or play games, but for my purposes and the price, it is perfect.

<Content>This player works its great efficiency in the first few attempts, sinks greatly with Windows media center edition.  It gives hitches, freezes, and the key pad has become dysfunctional!!!  I would examine thoroughly before investing in this item.  It is a sleek player, bigger than your average player.  thanks
