<Title>Does not work with WMP
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player doesn't work with Windows Media Player. This player works by dragging files in Windows Explorer so any protected content WMAs will only cause a format error. If you are only playing songs you took off your own CDs then this player should work fine, but if you have any music you've downloaded from a Napster type service then you are out of luck.

<Title>great MP3 for the price

<Content>You can drag downloaded music files into WMP and "sync".  Can also search for music files.  Right click on music file and pick add to sync list. Only error messages during downloading was when the MP3 didn't have a good connection.  Rechargeable batteries will save money.

<Title>Very Nice Player For The Price
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am giving this little player five stars because of its value to cost ratio. This unit 1) Supports ALL MP formats plus WMA and WAV 2) Has multiple equalizer settings (seven band) 3) Has multiple playback modes 4) Can serve as a voice recorder 5) Has visual picture menu 6) Has ID3 tagging (which displays as the song is being played) 7) Displays song lyrics if the LRC file is downloaded. Plus other features - all for $16. The first thing that you need to do when you receive this player is throw away the "ear bud" headphones - they are worthless. With a nice pair of bass/digital headphones, this unit has a startling beautiful sound. The volume is adequate, but not exceptional loud. That's probably because if the amplification was louder, you would have to put a new battery in every thirty minutes. Plus, they probably do not want to get sued for damaging your hearing. If you want it loud, plug it into a set of powered computer speakers - yes, that works. I'm already happy with this thing. If it lasts for a year, I'll be REALLY happy. Check out the other colors that this player comes in.

<Title>Very Reliable and Good for a First Timer
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was the first mp3 I ever owned and was very satisfied with until the day I got a new player because I wanted more memory.   I used this Nextar model daily and never once had a problem with it.  Syncing/deleting songs from it was an easy process and the player itself never froze.   The player consists of very few buttons and it takes an AAA battery, which is great when the player runs out of battery on the go.  Those two features are great for a first timer.  Because it is so small, it is so easy to conceal in a pocket, for instance, while exercising.  This is ideal for a first timer of the mp3 player department because it is basic, but user friendly.
