<Title>Good, but not Great
<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The plastic clip is sort cheap in quality and the buttons are a little difficult to operate. (Turning it off is difficult) BUT.. all that said, I like the sound quality and size and looks of the MP3 player. Overall, I'm pleased with mine.

<Title>Great Small Player but should have USB Adaptor
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You can't really complain about the size of this player. It really is as small as you could hope it to be. The weight too is extremely light. With a capacity of 512MB you can fit about 250 regular songs on there if you use the .WMA @ 64kbps format. This is equivalent to MP3 @ 128kbps. Considering you'd usually be listening through earphones or light headphones, you'd be hard-pressed to notice the difference.  My biggest complaint about the player is the lack of a USB adaptor. It has a NON-STANDARD connector at the bottom of it. It's not a USB connector at all, it has 10 pins (USB has only 4). This means that if you want to use your player between numerous locations (e.g. Work, Home, Girlfriend's place, Parent's place etc) then you need to always bring the 3-feet long USB cable with you.  What is the point of making a player so small and light if you have to drag a cable with you in order to be able to charge it or download songs to it?  I had an older Samsung Yepp player and I managed to get a small adaptor for it. It was basically a normal "A" USB connector and a mini USB connector joined together by a blob of plastic. You could bring it with you in that small mini pocket of a pair of jeans. So small you'd barely notice you brought it along.  No such luck with this player. I've asked Samsung if they make such an adaptor for it at various email addresses. Half of them say "we don't know", the other half of the email addresses don't respond.  In summary, I'd say only buy this if you only intend to download songs to it, or charge it, at home. In which case you can leave the USB cable there and you'll have no problems.

<Title> Broke after two months . No customer support
<Date>Wed Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used it for about two months before it completely locked up and no amount of formatting, flashing or resetting the player would get it to work.   I called customer support and they told me to ship it to them and they would send a replacement out in 3 business days.( I have the emails to prove it)   2 weeks go by and no player, so I called customer support and they give me the run around.   They make you call three different numbers and then the last one just hangs up on you.    I called them back and they gave me a fourth number to call, where you guessed it, I was told to call the first number.8O   I called the first number again and after 20 minutes on hold they told me to call back tomorrow.   This a true story and no I wasn't rude to them.

<Title>Good idea, but poor execution . . .
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little gem was the poor product of a great idea - something small that will hang around the neck - perfect for the gym.  It doesn't require some constrictive band on the arm, and it does not require a long wire from the waist that can catch on things.  But it was designed and constructed poorly.  It locks up often and, as with mine now, it is just impossible to access.  I say it's a pity, because when it worked it was great.  Battery life was poor, but I prefer that to having to put in new AA batteries all the time.  I wish that Samsung had improved this product instead of abandoning it for iPod knock-offs.
