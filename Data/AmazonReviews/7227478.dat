<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It was a gift for my nephew, 17yrs. old. So far he seems to love the whole thing. He says it holds more than enough music, its controls were very easy to learn and use. I would recommend this product/item to everyone who has a teenager as well as everyone who loves music at their fingertips in an MP3 player.

<Title>Toshiba Gigabeat 10 GB
<Date>Sat Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I think this player works very well.  The sound is great!  It holds songs and photos! You can back up a digital camera to it if you want to get your files off the memory card, but don't have a computer!    I have few minor problems with this.  The first is that there does not seem to be a way to delete pictures from the player; you have to install the Gigabeat Room software and open the photo viewer to delete pictures.  Very cumbersome, and this is not explained in the manual.  The second problem is that when you play in random mode, you cannot "reverse the track" to get any previous track played.  These are the only problems I have, otherwise I think this is a fine player.  You can bookmark, which I assume is for audio books, although I have not done this.  The graphics are wonderful.  I do not regret the decision to buy this player, and I am glad I have it!

<Title>Great MP3 Player, but be careful where you buy online!
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this unit for my son at Christmas. It is really a nice player, not too large and of sturdy construction.  I would give it five stars, but it does have a few quirks with regard to the software.  The problems are minor though.  It also does not immediately dock and power on when you plug into the dock, another minor annoyance.  Also, the headphones can be rated no more than 3 stars by themselves. Still, for the money offered currently here on Amazon the Gigabeat 10gb represents real value.  I would just caution to make sure you are purchasing from a reputable online dealer. Tiger Direct and their rebate partner BDI Laguna Corporation (ESend) have been sitting on my $50 rebate now (it shows as legitimate on the status site) for close to 4 months. ESend does not respond at all and Tiger Direct while prompt in their responses are truely incapable of helping their customers resolve the problem quickly.  When it comes to rebates, stick with reputable outfits or play it completely safe and just go with the low prices at Amazon.  I know I will not be purchasing from Tiger Direct again.  Fool me once...

<Title>nice for a time.
<Date>Wed Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have has this player for about two months. its a great player but, the software that it comes with is horrible! and even with windows media player its very hard to load music on. when you are going through the songs  on it you could feel the hardrive move in your hand. its not really a down side but i found it to be surprize. after about a month of music playing. the music on it started to skip horribly! Just like a scratched cd. but on the other hand its very durable. i dropped it about 10 feet.it still works great. (the skipping started way before i dropped it) the only visable damage was a little chip in the corner. there is no accessories. you could try to piggyback some of the ipod accessories. and it always feels like it could just snap in half if you look at it wrong. the picture viewer is nice, but you dont really need it. could use a fm tunner bad! the earbuds that come with  are huge and stick out of of your ears. the 10 gigabites are quite nice to load your whole music collection on. i wouldn't mind the draw backs if it was a little cheaper. i sold my ipod mini for this, thinking that i was getting a great player. i was very dissapointed.   so if your in the market for a mp3 player i would go for a ipod. right now the online apple store has a refrbished mini for $150.

<Title>Alright Value
<Date>Tue Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm the kind of guy who listens to his MP3 Player constantly.  More than 6 hours a day.  This product is alright and is not really worth the money.   Pros: Pictures and music.  Plays both WMA and MP3.  Nice screen and easy to use. Sound quality is alright  Cons: The Gigaroom(software) sucks and is not as good as Musicmatch and iTunes.  The casing is easily broken.  Can't make playlists on the player.  Can't look at playlist with out going to the main menu.  It's annoying and an iPod or even a Dell Jukebox will be worth more of your money.  Just do your research and be careful what you buy.

<Title>Costly mistake
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was unable to get the software for transferring music to this device to work properly.  After several frustrating episodes, I ordered Windows XP so that I could use Microsoft Windows Media Player 10 which, according to the documentation, could also be used.  It made no difference.  Thankfully, Amazon allowed me to return the product.  Overall, the experience was very frustrating and costly.  I paid a 20% re-stocking fee because I did not return it within 30 days and I paid $188 for XP.  As a final note, I find XP to be considerably more cumbersome than the Windows 2000 I replaced.  Not an experience I care to repeat.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great, simple mp3 player.  I don't mean simple as in it's features because it has some that an IPOD doesn't have, but simple as in easy to use.  It took me 5 minutes to download the software, get it hooked up and started ripping cds. I am a busy parent and to me, I-tunes is just way too much work.  With this, you put in a cd, push a button on the docking cradle and that's it, it does the rest.

<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not someplace I would buy from again.  The product does not work as described.  We have attempted to contact the seller.  The phone only has answering machine for a message and they NEVER return the calls.  We contacted Toshiba and they sent new discs and everything to try and fix the machine and then told us to return it to the seller.  We are STILL trying to do that with NO SUCCESS.  "Beware"

<Content>This MP3 player is very nice. But there are a few things that could be changed.the contorls could be easier to use. the touch control does not work as good as an ipod. It seems like you have to hold the power button forever to turn it on or off. and once a song is playing i can't figure out how to get back to the playlist without going through the whole menu. On a better note the screen looks very nice and is the reason i bought it. The battery lasts a very long time. and the software is easy to use once you get the hang of it. the dock is also very functional.

<Title>Very easy to use!
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I like this mp3 player very much. I hate having to learn new complicated technology and this is very easy to learn to use. From downloading the songs, to using it in the car, it is easy!  I also love the color screen and the battery lasts quite a long time. Yes, you do have to hold down the power button a bit to power on and off but I think this is to avoid powering it on/off by accident in your purse or bag. It's hardly bothersome.

<Title>easy to use!
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Compared to my ipod 60G this toshiba is easy to use when it cimes to downloading tracks espesially with Windows Media Player 10. Also you get a free month of Napster to go at this time and I think with one month you can load up your 10 gig model with about 2500 songs in this time period. It is very easy, just drag and drop while the mp3 player is in the cradle. You will need Windows XP though as Windows ME only supports Media player 9, and I don't think it works with this version.  The controls take some getting used to, you must slide your finger up and down the control strip similar to going around with the ipod, and in some cases tap the ends to make selections.   I find the sound quality very good with the headphones supplied, even though they don't stay in your ears very well. Also if you purchase a cable to plug the Gigabeat into your stereo the sound quality is amazing.  FYI - Do not go to the web site that is mentioned in another review for a "free" ipod unless you want your email account swamped with spam. It is not free as mentioned, that is a total fabrication.

<Title>Love it....and it is adorable to boot!
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had it for about a month now and I have not had any problems.   The software is simple (i.e. I figured it out right away on my own without the help of my computer nerd brother) and the sound is great.  I can't think of anything to complain about.  I think it works better than an ipod (not to mention the much better price) and it is not the same thing everyone else has.  Great for fellow nonconformists that love music.  Hope this helped.  Have a great day!

<Title>Looks cool, but frustrating.
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player, kept it 3 days and returned it. I played it a lot to try to believe the frustration was because of my fault since it was my first MP3 player. The 3 day's highly densed experience told me the machine was bad. I didn't do anything wrong to it.   I have to say this machine looks good, and this was actually an important reason why I bought it. I found I can't build a play list soon after I got this machine. I followed the user manual. But the machine didn't show what it was supposed to show. I had no idea about why. I accepted it, I hoped I would figure it out later. The next day a more serious problem appeared. The machine showed "unsupported data" for some playbacks and skiped them. When this was first shown, I thought it might be because I didn't copied the playbacks from my CD correctly and didn't care about it. The third day this problem became worse. When it played some the playbacks which it had played many time in the last two days it still showed unsupported data. Finally it skiped the whole album. I mean it stoped playing the album that it already played many times. I thought to delete all files and reload them may help, although it was troublesome. I didn't want to make a judgment to a new thing so quickly. That doomed. As soon as I pluged the USB line to the machine, the machine showed "system error" and stoped doing anything. No matter what and how I pushed buttons and clicked computer kayboard, the machind had absolutely no reaction. It died, for ever. I returned it then.  I didn't say anythig about the  minor shortcomings of which the machine has a lot. Other people may not think those are unacceptable. I'm sure nobody likes a music player whinch doesn;t play music. Look back my experience to this machine. I found only one postive thing about it, it looks cool. I give it two stars rather than zero because I might be unlucky, received a problematic machine, the normal machines can be better.

<Title>Surprising and cheap device
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have just bought this mp3 player and I think that is more than expected. The quality of sound is great, spite of the fact that I have to buy other headphones. The resolution of the display amazed me!!!. The interaction with it is very intuitive, but could be greatly improved, especially the menu's access. I think that the price worth. Everyone compares any mp3 player with iPOD, due to the fact that iPOD was the first mp3 player on its category (not the best one), but this toshiba is far away from what I have seen on iPOD. I broadly reccommend to pruchase it.

<Content>This gigabeat is simple to use.  It is nice looking, easy to find accessories, fast charging, and NOT AN IPOD.  This is excellent because that means no iTUNES. I know many people who have had problems with iTUNES.   I will highly recommend the Gigabeat to anyone who asks.

<Title>Definatly What I've Been Looking For
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>About a month or so ago I decided to get an MP3 player. Although I like Ipods, I didn't really care for the software that came with it, as well as not being rich enough to buy one. After a week or so of searching, I found the Toshiba Gigabeat. It looked appealing, so I decided to buy it. At 180 bucks and 10 GB, it's cheaper than an Ipod and my friends 6GB i-river.           When I recieved it it only took 2 or so hours to charge it fully, and trust me, the time is worth it. I used it for an entire 3 weeks without it coming down from a full bar. As for music, I think the Gigabeat software is better than Windows Media Player. The CD RipRec is quick and easy, and it only took me a couple hours to get my entire CD collection onto my MP3 player (at least 25 albums).       I think the album art is an unneccessary waste of space, since I don't really care for what the album looks like, and would rather use the space for pictures. Another cool part about the photos and the 2.2 inch screen is that you can use ur photos as a wallpaper. I took a picture on Gran Turismo 4 vertically and put it as my wallpaper.      Sound quality is excellent. I usually use the SRS WOW effects unless the song has too strong bass. It does get pretty dang loud when u crank up the volume, although I can't compare to the Ipod since I've never tested that out before.       Sadly, even though there is 10 GB of space there is no video with this player, but I'm pretty sure Toshiba will eventually make a firmware update that will hopefully add this capability.       As of style, I really like the Black Player. It can smudge on the front since it is covered with glass. I like the fact that the screen is big, but it could be a little bit smaller. The amount of space makes up for the size of the Player.      Mow to sum it up, I really like this player. Its easy to use, has a nice amount of space, and looks awesome. It could be a little smaller (Toshiba came out with small 1 GB Models if you want one), but the space makes up for it. I would recommend this player over an Ipod anyday. Hope that helps.  -Chrispin
