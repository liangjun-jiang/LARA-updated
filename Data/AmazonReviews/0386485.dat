<Content>I bougth this product thinking "maybe i'm wasting my money" but it amaizing the quality of this MP3player, have to say it looks cheap, but the sound is excelent, the remote control really does its job, NEVER OVERHEAT, dont have to plug/unplug it everytime you get in the car because you can turn it off, have 7 fm radio frecuencies, you can conect also your mp3 player, mp4 player and even an Ipod with a cable also incluided in the box.  Sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal languaje.

<Title>decent product
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is a 2 star product but the extra star is for value. It's cheap. It works. It sounds good, but all the features don't work like the description says. I would rather spend more money on something better, but f you don't want to spend too much, then I recomend this product.

<Title>very cool product
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using this device for about a month now and can't imagine my 2 hour daily commute without it. It is very easy to setup and use, takes minimal space, and is very durable (i have dropped it a few times by accident). The quality of the music is surprisingly clear. Since I have a few flash drives, I can carry several GB of music wherever I go for a fraction of the cost of a full fledged MP3 player. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and it is the best $25 I have spent in a while.

<Title>Extremely good product. I love it.

<Content>The player that i received first did not remember the last played track and did not play in alphabetical order, though it was playing well. I wrote a mail to the seller. He said "I dont like my customers to be unhappy" and offered to send a free replacement. He sent the replacement in 3 days time as promised. The replaced one plays extremely well in alphabetical order and remembers last track it played. Above all, the quality of the FM transmitter is excellent. It is very worth for the amount i paid.

<Title>Very promising
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This car mp3 transmitter is better than a lot of BRAND NAME product.   Pro: Sound quality is FM like. No interference. Easy to set up. Resumes after power off. Runs cool. No line hassle.  No additional batteries needed. Great and handy remote control (never see in other product).   Cons: 7 channels may not be enough for some people.(I am perfectly fine with it)   It is hard to see the channel setting in darkness. (Not a big problem to me since it remembers the channel setting.  I set up once and never touch it again)   It accepts MP3 only.  I never try WMA.  If it does, it should states in the manual.   It doesn't browse folders.  It only forwards/backwards song by song.   Vendor Service: Delivery time is reasonable. I live in CA and get mine in one week.   Confirmation email is sent within one day.  Tracking number is included. Bottom Line: If you want to try a better model, he is selling a upper model for $35 with LCD screen.  It has all features that this one doesn't have.  It also has good review.  But for $25 + $5 shipping, this product is solid and promising.

<Title>Awesome product, Quick responses.

<Content>It's a very cool MP3 player cum FM transmitter with handy remote. Initially I had some problems getting it to work, that's when i found the seller to be very proactive and quick in responding and helping with troubleshooting. When nothing worked the seller did offer for replacement or refund. The replacement MP3 player works absolutely fine.. The sound clarity is remarkable. Good product at a very reasonable price. I would not hesitate to buy anything from this seller.

<Title>caveat emptor! no wma funtion
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Simple and inexpensive it does do the job rather well. I set it at 87.9 and it worked well in SE Florida metro areas from Ft. Lauderdale to the Keys; no interference. Also, I use it in-house with a power to lighter adapter and play music thru my stereo. It took me a bit to figure out why it would skip over songs, though; the reason: it does not play WMA encoded music...and that's why the 4 stars. The remote is a must for all these gadgets; trying to perform any function by pressing the buttons on the device, moves it and static starts. Just insert it in the lighter socket and use the remote to do anything else.
