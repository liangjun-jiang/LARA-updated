<Title>My first iPod...
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my iPod straight from Apple a couple days ago and all I can say is WOW!  The capacity is great and fit my needs perfectly.  The sound is absolutely amazing - it's as good as any portable CD player, if not better.  The look of the 2nd generation is very sleek and I'm digging the scratch-resistant metallic feel of it.  While some feel it's too small, I think it's perfect.  It fits in the hand perfectly and is very intuitive.  The menu design is easy to navigate.  I also like the fact you can "lock" the volume bar so it can't go past a certain point and that you can also lock the screen, turn of the backlight, and all the other functions this little gadget has.  All in all, this is one of the smartest buys I've made in recent years and will last me (hopefully) a few years.

<Title>One thing to 'whine' about
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Love the new nano, fantastic improvement over first-generation counterpart.  Only caveat: When I purchased it, every time I turned it on it emitted a high-pitched whine (the iPod itself, not the music or anything) that was REALLY grating on the ears, even when listening with the headphones on. I brought it to Apple and they replaced it, no questions asked... the new unit works just fine. I've heard this is not a common problem, but just so you know, listen for that whine.

<Title>Wonderul Design and Function
<Date>Wed Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a mini that I loved and replaced it with the first Nano. I sold that one to buy the new one and I'm pleased with my trade up. The unit's new case gives me the security I didn't have with the first gen. And the sound does appear to be improved - posibly due to the better design of the new earbuds.  I don't bemoan the lack of Fm radio, voice recording etc. since I bought this to listen to music, books and podcasts. I try to avoid the radio and if I want those other features, I'd buy something specifically for that.  All told - elegant design, simple function control and durability. Oh and the battery life is greatly improved.

<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new iPod nano rocks. I just got one, green, and it is so cool.  Pros: Light, fits anywhere, and it is COLORFUL. It holds a thousand songs and the battery lasts all day. Pictures look nice too. And the sound quality is great.  Cons: Doesn't play video but that doesn't really matter. Might be too small for some.

<Title>maybe if I could use it, my rating would be higher
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a beautiful product. But, if you're like me and have next to no computer savvy, be wary: iTunes 7 can be excruciatingly slow. I put in a CD more than a day ago to import to iTunes, and it is still not done. I have no idea what to do.  The iPod, which I named Lulu, was plugged into my computer for the first time yesterday, and ever since has been sporting the "do not disconnect" screen.  I have found no support phone numbers to call. If/when I figure out how to use this very pretty piece of technology, I may update my review. But as of now, I am hundreds of dollars poorer and have nothing to show for but red-faced frustration.

<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again. How many versions do you need???  First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again. Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!

<Title>The Mini Mini
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been reeling over when to buy a new ipod for a long time now. I have a 3rd generation 10gb ipod that I got for Xmas in '03 and it was immediately filled to the brim with music. I have probably used the thing every day since I've had it but the battery isn't what it used to be and I have to charge the thing for a good hour and a half during my work day just so I can listen to it for the last few hours. This has become an inconvenience for me considering that my job is extremely boring and the workplace is fairly loud and I find myself getting easily frustrated without music. The new nano commercial certainly is flashy and very persuasive. I want to point out that the click wheel does not glow up at all-I think that Apple falsely advertises that it does and that they should look into changing this misrepresentation. I am sure that they did this in the commercial for a greater effect but I can bet that people who haven't seen it in person and purchase this item online will be a little disappointed when receiving it.   Considering how fast I filled up my 10gb ipod I was torn between getting the new 30gb model with 3 times the amount of space I had before, or, the nano with considerable less space but a much longer battery life. It was a very tough decision but I went with the 4gb nano because of its long battery life. I know that Apple is going to continuously have new and improved models so I decided that the nano could hold me over until a 30gb model with a better battery life (for music and videos) and other improved features comes out.   The nano itself... I would say that I wasn't all that impressed at first sight of the nano, it looked different than the previous nano and very similar to the mini which I thought looked silly. My impression has totally changed considering the fact that I haven't been able to put the thing down since I got it last week. I can't stop holding it and marveling at how compact, light and sturdy it is (compared to the previous model). The screen is colorful and bright and I am happy with the resolution of the photos (albeit on a really small screen). The new headphones are an improvement since the previous ones didn't fit in my ears too well. I haven't noticed much of an improvement regarding the sound quality but I am extremely satisfied since these are more comfortable in the ears than the previous model, the cord is longer, and they also will not wind up together since they are separated by a handy little piece of rubber that you can adjust to your preference.  Some small gripes...I have noticed that the games tend to slow down at times, not really a big deal since these games get boring within the first 2 minutes of playing them. Transitioning from one screen to another isn't as smooth as on the other models--probably due to the fact that the nano is flash drive based. The click wheel isn't the most stable and certainly takes some getting used to. I have noticed that turning the backlight on and off isn't as easy as it used to be. On my older Ipod all I needed to do was to hold down the Menu button for a few seconds for the backlight to turn on. It isn't possible to do that anymore so you have to make sure that the backlight settings are turned on. I also would like to say that my previous model came with a white plug that you can put into the data outlet to protect the outlet from dust and other hazardous circumstances. I think that the little piece of plastic is essential to the life cycle of the ipod and it should be included with every Ipod model.   All in all I couldn't be more pleased with this item. I would definitely advise you to purchase a case that would shield the nano from everyday hazards. The new anodized aluminum casing should protect this item better than the previous models which were easily scratched. I will probably purchase a case from Otterbox when it becomes available because it appears that it will be the best protection available for this fragile investment. Hopefully I won't regret not getting the larger storage model but as of right now I am 100 percent satisfied with my new ipod 4gb nano. It has all that you really need in an mp3 player.

<Content>The product itelf seems to be fine. Shipping time was minimal. However the packing of the product was substandard. The box it arrived in was crushed on one corner due to no packing material around the product inside the box. The plastic case was therefore scratched on the outside. A little more care in packing the item might prevent damage in future orders.

<Title>Close to perfection
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>To hold this iPod is to be amazed. It is almost lighter than air - any thinner and it would slip through your hands. It is truly remarkable that something so lightweight, so small can do so much. My less than perfect rating is for the screen size and lack of firewire support. As I creep into my late 30s, I simply cannot read text that small anymore, and playing solitaire on that screen really hurts my eyes. The definition & brightness in the screen are truly remarkable, however. I truly miss the firewire iPods. On a Mac, synching was just faster w/ the firewire models - and if I'm on an older Mac that has USB 1.0 and FireWire, I would prefer firewire, but am stuck using USB. *sigh*  The small size means you can forget you have it in your pocket - so you should really have a case to protect it. I've talked to some folks who have accidentally left this in a pocket and then put it in the laundry. Adios ipod. Electronic components & water rarely make good dance partners.  I have more than enough audio (especially podcasts) to fill up one of the new 80GB video iPods, but I bought the new Nano for the Nike+ support - seems like a smart match - running/walking w/ an iPod that is so lightweight it doesn't bounce around and it has no moving parts to get rattled. I do like the huge numbers in the display when using the Nike+ adapter.  The sound is excellent. A definite upgrade from the Mini - even the center select button has matched color. This is a piece of futuretech - available to you now - and it works!

<Title>Nano is fantastic
<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had an ipod for 4 years. I have an original 5 gig Ipod and fell in love with it back in 2002. It still works great and battery life is still good. I was thinking of getting a new 30 gig ipod with video but received the 4 gig nano as a gift.  So far I love my nano. The size is just right, the screen is very bright and clear, and battery life is very good. The only thing I don't like is the headphones. I have never liked Ipod headphones but thought the new Nano headphones might change that, they didn't. For me they just don't fit well so sound fades away very easily. They also fall out easily when on a run or walk. I have a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones and when you match them up with the nano the sound quality is fantastic. For walks or runs I use a cheap pair of nike headphones that wrap around your ear.   I picked up the Nike + integration device and a pair of Nike + shoes to track runs and walks. For the price this is the best addition to your Nano if you like to walk/run with your nano. The shoes are a little expensive but not much higher than most shoes today. The adaptor integrates so easily anyone can use it. It provides a great way to track your workouts.   Overall, I love my Nano. For the features, Itunes integration, and many offered accessories for the Ipod, I'm not sure why anyone would buy anything but an Ipod. Good luck to the Zune, you'll need it.

<Title>Improved? Nano Won't fit my Dock/Speakers now!
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After exhausting research and sound testing, I purchased speakers, only recently, for the Nano (perhaps the best available portable speakers now, Altec-Lansing InMotion IM7) and the new improved, second generation Nano will not securely fit into the dock of these beautiful speakers! Why did Apple feel the need to move the docking and headphone jacks? Whatever happened to backwards compatability in electronics? The Nano will fit but  only if you don't use the supplied Nano adapter which holds it snug in it's dock. It will now have to sit loosely while docked and so there goes my portability with this system and lose one of it's many/best features that made the IM7 a solid choice over the Bose and the Apple Hi-Fi. I hope  Altec dsigns a new adapter for this generation Nano. I suppose I have to buy new Apple speakers/Dock made just for this unit. That is until the 3rd generation of Nano comes along that won't fit in the second generation designed speaker/dock accessories. What a joke! I am in the process of trying to cancel my order for the Nano before they engrave it. Originally I wanted the Sandisk Sansa e270 because it had more memory, bigger screen, will play video and pictures, not to mention FM radio and additional 2GB storage via SD memory disk and easy user battery change. It was also considerably cheaper. But... It would only play on my InMotion speakers by using the aux in cable... so I balked on the Sansa  opting for the Nano's docking ability instead. So much for that. Goodbye Nano, Hello Sansa.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sansa. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them.  I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected!  I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. (update 12/2006- found a case just like my other one, but this one is actually made for the 2nd generation nano! Fits perfectly!! Got it at Radio Shack. They allowed me to trade it in for the other one that actually fits.) I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs.  People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips! I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sansa. This new nano is a must have!

Sadly, it just didn't have the audio punch and unique size/shape of the 2nd gen Nano. So I, "Traded" my wife my super-shiny brand new iPod Video for her scratched-up 4GB Pink Nano 2nd gen, and I absolutely LOVE it. It's the perfect size, amazing battery life, crystal clear audio quality, and fits anywhere in my car. I am a guy and even my friends think the pink one looks cool haha! This thing is a classic.

<Title>Worst Purchase Ever!! 
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the Ipod Nano for Christmas last year. It has been nothing but trouble from the start. To begin with, I had to exchange it the first week I got it. The original Ipod I was given was not recognized by the computer so I could not charge it and I could not download any music. So then I exchanged it for a new one which is recognized by my computer. This one worked much better except that it would randomly choose not to play some of my songs. They will begin, but then suddenly stop and skip on to the next song. The songs play just fine on the computer and on cd. They simply do not want to play on my Ipod. The latest thing is that, in the last few months, my Ipod has started to freeze. I will go to select a song or just advance to the next song, and it will just freeze up. It won't play music and the screen won't advance. Since there is on/off switch and the battery is not removable, I simply have to wait for the battery to die and then recharge the Ipod before I can get it to work again. This is an awful product. My first advice is do not buy an Ipod. My second advice is do not buy anything that does not allow you to replace the battery and make sure  it has an on/off switch.

<Title>IPOD did not work
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My IPOD did not work, and I spent over 6 hours on the phone with Apple tech support, calling 6 different times at 45 min-1.5 hours each call, and the product still did not work properly.  It would randomly stop playing songs and would skip to other songs, when they would work fine on the computer or as a single file.   I am never buying a refurbished product from here again.

<Title>Very good mp3 player...for a while
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I recieved the 2nd Generation iPod Nano blue about 1 year ago. I loved the bright, beautiful color and aluminum coat. But, Apple claims that the coat is scratch resistant, but it's not. It's gotten scratches all over, and the aluminum is sort of easy to chip and dent, and I have barely even dropped it! The screen is very nice though with barely any scratches but after a few months, a black line appeared from one side of the screen to the other. I don't know why. I called the Apple company and said I needed to get a new one.  The sound quality is great, but Apple earbuds are really disappointing. My family had a total of 3 pairs of the "new" earbuds and one had barely ANY sound out of them, and the other 2 were staticy after a few days. No destruction was done to cause this. Apple needs to produce better earbuds.  From what I've seen, the iPod Nano isn't nearly as slow as iPod Videos. Unfortunately, the Nano still freezes sometimes.  Being the only second mp3 player I've had, it's pretty nice. But I recommend buying a case and ejecting it EVERY single time you disconnet it from your computer because I think not ejecting mine made the random black line on the screen.  4/5 stars

<Title>Horrible Experience and Bad Customer Service
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 4GB 2nd Generation Green Ipod Nano through Amazon from Ace Photo Digital. While the transaction went smoothly when I received my package it was damaged. In fact the box was completely battered. And not only that, THERE WAS NO IPOD INSIDE! So all I got was a battered box. I have called customer service at Ace Photo Digital many times and they have not responded. It has been well over a month and I have NOT received any money back, or an Ipod. I do not recommend buying from Ace Photo Digital. Their customer service is crappy and I have yet to hear back from them regarding how they are going to fix this matter.

<Title>Can be annoyingly glitchy, but still the best game in town
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 2ndGen 4Gb Nano has been glitchy from the day I bought it.  I have a list of things that were odd, frustrating or annoying but for times sake, I will say that it frequently freezes up forcing me to reset it; it sometimes locks itself [the lock icon is on the screen but the hold button is not in the hold position] forcing me to reset it; if it gets cold, the battery dies very quickly; the spin dial for volume and selection is so sensitive that I often have to make several attempts to adjust anything without over- or under-shooting the menu (or volume) I want.  All this said, it still sets the standard for MP3 listening, beats any known cellphone option for listening to music, and is quickly becoming a part of the fabric of our culture, as the cellphone did 10 years ago.  PROs: Sleek, lightweight, innovative design and technology CONs: Can be glitchy but once you accept that, very easy/simple to use.

<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this Ipod! It's a beautiful hot pink/Magenta color and has a ton of room on it. I am able to fit all of my favorite songs as well as a number of podcasts from my favorite radio show that I can listen to while I am at work. It's small, light, pretty and just a wonderful little device to have and so simple to use. I never leave the home without my pink Ipod and I can use it for 8 hours straight without it even losing half its battery power and I leave it plugged into my computer overnight so it is fully charged the next day. This is the PERFECT present for anyone. I highly recommend it!

<Content>when i first got my ipod...i loved it! it's pink...engraved...i saved up for a lonnnngggg time to buy it. my warrenty expired 2 weeks ago, and just the other night it shut itself off.  off as in, the buttons no longer work, my computer doesn't even recognize it's plugged-in-ness, and i'll i'm staring at is a dark, blank screen. i now have to drive 45 min away to cthe closist apple store only to hear them tell me that it's gonna be cheaper for me just to buy a new one. i searched the apple website extensively for an answer as to what could be wrong with my ipod.  it was never dropped or went anywhere near water.  after finding nothing in the pre-written help articles, i went to the message boards, hoping someone could give me an answer as to how to make it work again.  have i gotten an answer?  no.  but i have gotten a ton of other people saying that they have the same problem!

<Title>Big improvement.  Battery still a problem.
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall, this is a great improvement from the original nano.  Appearance-wise it is fantastic looking and performs on a "cleaner" level than its predecessor.  I have no problems with the performance of the actual product.  My complaint is that my battery is having the same type of problems that most other versions of the ipod have experience.  Short life (less than advertised anyway), fluctuations of power level, etc.  You would think that after this many variations on the model, Apple could fix this problem.  Still, it's not entirely noticeable except on long plane rides when my power runs out.  This is my only complaint, but a considerable one to take into mind.  Still, this is my favorite version of the ipod yet produced.

<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(This is my mom and dad's account, I'm really only 14, and named Kaylee) I have wanted an iPod for sooooo long. I saved my money and bought one myself, my parents did NOT pay for it. They color is even better than in the picture, which was a pleasant suprise. The earphones are really nice, not like the crapy ones all my friends have on their video and first generation nanos. The outside non-scratch is awesome. I got my iPod on Sept. 29 of 2006, (a friday) and left to go camping less than 4 hours later. Ofcourse I took my iPod with. We camped on DNR land in the middle of no where in our trailor. So I ran around, rode my dirtbike, climbed trees, and a whole lotta other stuff while carrying it in my pocket. I dropped it a few times, and it doesn't have a scratch!!!! The only bad thing is it's so small, and easy to loose. I recomend getting a screen cover though. But you really don't need a case to keep it safe, cuz that would just hide the color of your iPod. It has 4 great games on it, and stores a ton of photos. It loads super fast, and is easy to update. The color screen rocks to the fullest. It's definatly worth the money. Besides, it's a 4g which in my town niether Wal-Mart or Cosco carry, only 2g. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.

<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me.   I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.  The case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL.

<Title>Excellent iPod, my favorite so far.
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the new nanos. I don't think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I'd rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 stars

<Title>Ipod Mini ordeal
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought 2 ipods mini (one for me -blue- and one for my wife -green-)At 6 months the blue one completely died (apple sent me a new one without charge -great!)Six months later the battery died so I use the blue one as a hard disk or connected to a JBL device to play it.  My gentle wife gave me hers and a few weeks later I began having trouble with the battery again (nightmare). It says "out of power" even though I fully chraged it for hours. I found out that if i hit the device it would start again. As i do not care if i destroy this thing I will use it this way. I did not charge it 1000 times as Apple stated. I am getting a 4gb nano hoping that I will not live this again. If this happens again I will buy a radio and forget obout Apples ipod for good (cost to learn this lesson: US$700)

<Title>Absolutely the best mp3 player there is
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I tried many players, but this 2nd generation Apple iPod Nano is my favorit. The player is very small, the battery lasts very long, the screen is bright and there are practical functions for storing calendar, alarms, addresses. There are Games (I never need them), and I very like the clock that can be set to show different times of different locations. There is even a search function where you can search for music titles with a specific letter or even word. And there are so many third party products out there that are compatible with the iPods. Have you heard about that Zune from Mircrosoft? Probably not, well, forget it anyway, the iPod's are much better in any aspect.

<Title>Get a Creative, much easier to use
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the ipod nano this weekend at Best Buy. My reasons for buying it were mainly cosmetic: I liked the color and there are a lot of different accessories you can purchase for it. I got the nano home and installed itunes, THEN found out that you have to keep your entire music collection on your computer, so that the next time you plug the ipod into the computer, you don't lose your music on the player. First bad thing. I had transferred music from my old player onto my computer in order to transfer it onto the nano, but was up until 1 30 in the morning figuring this out, because the instruction that come with the nano are very limited. Second bad thing. The next morning I wanted to copy some cds onto my computer so I could put them onto the nano, but when I plugged the nano in, nothing would register as being plugged in. That was the last straw. I took the nano back and got a Creative Zen V Plus instead. The nano just isn't worth it. The Creative Zen V Plus has the same amount of storage, yet holds 2000 songs, as opposed to the nano which only holds 1000, and even then it doesn't really hold that amount. The Creative plays video clips, whereas the nano does not. And the Creative was $20 less than the nano. Bypass the ipod and go straight for the creative...you won't regret it.

It has a few glitches, like every once in a while it will have trouble fastforwarding or it will act funny for a second, then return to normal once I turn it on then off again, but overall, I couldn't really ask for a better product. All electronics pretty much have their glitches, but I feel good about my buying it. It is quality over quantity.

<Date>Fri Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>And his complaints have been kept to a strict, strict minimum.  I love the color (though I would prefer the blue one any day). It holds up to 1,000 songs (WMA-style, AAC-style and MP3-style. Possibly WMV-style, but I highly doubt the latter), has some games to play (I believe), and charges pretty fast.  I really like the wheel you use to turn the volume up or down, and to toggle through all the menus and such. It also has the time and date, and I believe that you can listen to the radio also. I-Tunes is what you would normally use to get music files and pictures onto this thing, and at first I was wary about using it, but it's awesome. You can burn a CD in 2.5 minutes, flat!  I would fully recommend this device.  There's little that you wouldn't like about it.   4.5 stars.

You can play games on it,have a calender, it holds up to 1,000 songs, you can 'lock' the volume so that it can't go past a certain point, you can rate each song, my friend has the pink (magenta)one and it's color is so vivid, it is very very light and thin, it has a scratch resetaint outer coating (unlike the first generation), apple has made some new earphones that are more comfortable, but if your picky(like me), you should probably get some new ones, there is only one con:ther is still no fm radio and the screen is kinda' tiny, but oter wise i think this is the best player out there!

<Title>Great value for the money.....
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>iPods certainly pay for themselves, especially with all the accessories available to listen to them in your car, home, etc.  At this price point, you can get a lot of music into a very small package that is easily affordable.  I use the Transpod system with mine in the car and the sound quality is better than a direct connection via a cassette system.  I also use it with a Denon stereo and docking station and have been happy with the sound quality.  While the sound of an iPod isn't quite that of a high quality recording, it is still very good.  I'm a musician and I'm happy with how it handles most types of music including classical music.  If you don't have a lot of money to buy albums, this is a good investment because you can use your family members or other people's music.  While I don't condone breaking copyright law, you certainly can "share" music if you want to with friends, relatives, etc.  If you are a young person, perhaps you can load some of dads albums for him and borrow his iPod!  This is a less expensive option than buying a lot of albums yourself.  All iPods are easy to use, but they do have a proprietary format.  If you go this route, you can record CDs no problem.  However, you can't use this as an mp3 player.  You are basically married to getting your music from iTunes or directly from CDs.  Some people find this a disadvantage.  It depends upon your needs.

This was a great decision, but the disadvantage to nano iPods is you can't download games or movies! I was really disappointed...well I knew anyways. You have to buy the A.C. adapter, which I was very PISSED because of this. iTunes is expensive the lady at best buy said you can only buy the songs and not burn them off a c.d. which...is a lie! I wish I would have gotten Zen Vision. I love my iPod though...haha im funny.No, don't  get me wrong I love my iPod.

<Title>WOW WOW WOW
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>WOW That's just about all I can say about the new Nano. I just got this nifty little thing this Christmas Morning, and I can already call myself an expert with it. Now, if that doen't tell you how easy to use this thing is, I don't know what will. There are so many things tha just WOW me, but mostly its the sound quality. This is my first Mp3 player ever, and i'm glad that I didn't just settle for the first generation. The sound on this thing is amazing. Talk about turning your whole life into a movie, complete with music. I just put the earbuds in my ears, turn up the volume, and tune out the world.  But, I have to say that the earbuds are a little bit uncomfertable. But, how can something be compleatly comfertable with things stuck into your ears? Also, iTunes was extreamly easy to use. It downloaded in about 5 or 10 minutes, and was ready to use right away. The result? Having music on my iPod only two hours after taking it our of the package. The only thing: there is really no instruction manual, not that you need one. I was able to just go and mess around in iTunes for about ten minutes and find out how to sync stuff into my iPod, but still. But, I didn't even read the ITUNES HELP thingy that they had, so that's probably why it took me so long to find out how to sync! :) I love that apple finally got a nano that comes in color. When I started shopping for an iPod, I consitered getting an iPod Mini because then I could get one in that light green, my favorite color. But, iPod minis die after about a year and a half of use, so I wanted something that would last me a while. Long story short: I went to the apple website and cames across their new 2nd gereration iPod Nanos, and put one of those on my Christmas Wishlists instantly.  To a kid like me, being able to chose your own color is the best thing next to slice bread. With all that peer preasure, it's fun to be able to show off your inner self with the color of your iPod. Overall, apple listened to everything that their customers said, and put everything that we wanted into a compleatly cool iPod. Oh, and one last thing: the 24 hour battery life is really cool, and the battery would probably last 10 or so hours if you were doing something other than listening to music (as most of us do). I LOVE MY NEW IPOD!!!!!

<Title>Best iPod Yet~Unmatched Mp3 Player
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received the Pink 2nd Gen 4GB Apple iPod Nano as a surprise gift. I'd long wished for this baby, and I couldn't be happier with it. It is beautiful and tough--seriously, when I'd played with my friends' first-gen Nanos I was terrified I was going to snap it in half. This iPod doesn't feel like a toy; its heavy enough to feel good and strong. Still, I keep it in a wallet because I'm paranoid like that.    PROS: ~4 GB is plenty of space for most people. I have 806 MB left over after putting most of my music library and 35 pictures on it. It is honestly PLENTY of space. ~Love the color choices. The choice of black or white in the first nano was a big dealbreaker for me. ~Pictures look great, you can have tons on there, you don't have to format them to put them on, just choose an iPhoto album or the whole dang library. ~Music plays beautifully, all the time. Expect nothing less of Apple. ~Album art showing up is a fun touch. ~Its in Color, which makes a huge difference. The screen is more lovely than any iPod i've ever seen, and better than any PDA too, for that matter. ~Lots of good options, like search, settings, extras, photos, music, etc.  ~Plenty of icons to let you know which settings you have on. ~Sleep timer! For an insomniac like me, I have to have music to go to sleep. Its great that I can set it to 30 minutes, put it on my Sleepy playlist, and I'm out, plus it'll automatically turn off after 30 minutes so that you don't have to worry about battery or get woken up by a sudden screamo song. ~Comes with good earphones. ~Tons of other pros. It is way cooler than I ever imagined.  CONS: ~You can't use the nano to delete songs. You have to upload it on to the computer and then delete the songs. ~It doesn't come with any exterior speakers, a dock, a user's manual, or an outlet charger. The only things in the box are the nano, headphones, a cord to connect it to the computer (which charges it and lets you put all the music on it) and a quickstart guide. You can only charge it using the computer and can only listen to it using the computer's speakers when it is plugged into the computer.   Overall, it is a beautiful and amazing machine. I would buy them for everyone I know. The perfect adorable little music device. Apple's done it again. I would recommend it to anyone who loves music.  UPDATE (01/07) Its been almost a month now, and the thing is WAYY cooler than you could possibly imagine. Yeah, there's no manual, but it is easy to figure out if you play with it a little. It just is made with a technology you can't match anywhere else. Lots of these reviews don't understand the technology that goes into every iPod...really, its incredible. I'm like....wow.

<Title>Works great, and it SURVIVED THE WASHING MACHINE!!!!
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Nano since January, and love everything about it.  I use it almost exclusively to listen to audio books, and have purchased small speakers (JBL Creature) and a car kit so I can listen just about anywhere.  Last night I accidentally put my Nano through the washing machine, and was horrified when I pulled it out of a jumbo load of sheets and towels.  It wouldn't turn on at all, and I had resigned myself to ordering  a new one.    After about half an hour, I got the idea to use my blow drier on it.  Voila -- the hearty little Nano perked up after about 5 minutes of drying, follewed by 30 minutes of rest.  All it then needed was a fresh charge to get it going again!!!  I love it all the more now!

I've dropped it alot of times, once face-down into a 2-inch puddle of dirty water, and gotten it scratched up, yet it still works fine. It's very good. 4 GB is enough. Why would anyone need 40,000 songs??? Unless their downloading illegally... awww...

<Content>I got the iPod nano (2nd generation) as a Christmas Present.   PROS: *It's super sleek, and stylish *It's pretty easy to learn how to work it *It comes in pretty assorted colors (green, blue, pink, white, black, red) *iTunes is pretty easy to operate *new aluminum casing is not as breakable as plastic *bright screen  CONS: *Sound quality (in some songs) could be better *The accessories could be cheaper *It can get frozen (easy fix), but still... *a wee bit pricey *it could come with a manual (even though it's pretty easy to opperate...) *you can only charge is on the computer (unless you buy a charger...)  IN A NUT SHELL I'd suggest the nano to anyone. I think it is a good mp3 player for those of us who are less technical (ahem). *****FIVE STARS*****

<Title>Cute little iPod, but....
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't believe it doesn't come with a charger like the older ones did.  We all got Nanos for Christmas and I planned on selling our older 1st and 2nd generation iPods we got years ago, but....I have to keep the chargers so we can charge the Nanos without having to do so through the computer.  When I plugged my Nano into the computer, it didn't charge it.  Not sure what's up with that.  For the price of the thing, you'd think it would come with a charger.  Great if you're replacing an older iPod and have the necessary accessories.  Not great if it's your first one.

The Price The battery life I have really long titles on mine like "Chap stick, chapped lips and things like chemisrty," so i wish the screen was bigger, as on the iPod Video Overall this is a great little gadget. i would recommend it to anybody who wants a high quality MP3 player.

<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I always said that I wouldnt fall into the big ipod trend, but after getting a sandisc sansa for Christmas and having it freeze up right away for 10 hours (which i was warned about in adavance from people) I returned it and got the 4 gig pink nano. And I think Im starting to see why the world is falling in love with the ipod. Ive only had it for 2 days but so far I love it! The nano only comes with some quick start instructions but honesly, I figured out how to use it on my own in 15 or so mintes. And putting music on it has ben easy. All you do is transfer all your existing music on your computer into itunes and drag and drop what you want to your ipod.     Only one complaint so far....it did freeze up once yesterday. All I did though was press the reset button and it was back to normal in a minute. I guess thats just normal for these things to do? A worker at best buy said some players freeze up because of the music you put on it. But hopefully it wont do it again.  THE GOOD: - sleek design, very thin and light - Easy to use - Easy to load music onto - Great sound quality - Has games on it - can hold photos  THE BAD: -froze up once -??? there's not really anything bad about it, yet - I feel like it needs a protective case but I dont want to cover it up  All in all.....its worth the money

<Content>I received this for Christmas and I use it far more than I ever used my 120-song iPod Shuffle, which I bought for the gym/going on walks. 1000 songs is a great size for me and I use it in the car with iTrip and at home plugged into my Creature speakers (much easier than firing up the iBook, opening iTunes, etc). Sleek and cute and all that stuff, but actually a useful little gadget for me too.

<Content>The sound quality is excellent. Charging and synchronizing with my iTunes library is automatic and easy. Two issues where Apple could do a bit more work are the controls and the earbuds. Because so many functions are combined in the touch wheel, it's easy to do something you didn't intend to do (e.g. switch to the menu when you're trying to adjust the volume) This is not a serious problem, and it gets easier to control the unit as you get accustomed to it. The earbuds don't stay in my ears very well when working out. I replaced them with a set of Sony noise canceling headphones.

Small enough to have it in my pocket and still be able to navigate and change the vollume. The best part is that it's a flash drive as oppossed to a hard drive like the larger ones, so I don't cringe so much when I drop it - I tend to be a bit clumsy!
