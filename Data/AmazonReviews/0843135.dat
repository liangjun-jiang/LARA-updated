<Title>I recommend iRiver Clix
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am using several mp3 player and PDA, because I like to listen music at any place such as gym and library. But these day, I want to watch movie and vedio related to my study without my computer, and so I choose iRiver Clix 4GB model. It was delivered to me 2 months ago. When I saw the player, I was surprised. It is really awesome! The player is so tiny and cute, and I heard that the design won several awards for good design in contest. You will be satisfied their design, sound, and the quality of display. The menu is so simplified, and they provide many functions: radio, voice recording, watching pictures & movie, and firmware upgrading. The vocie recording, especially, has very good quality. I compared with my previous recorder, and I found the sound is clear and loud enough. I think the player has one disadvantage: I am using a silicon skin cover, and sometimes I feel uncompatable to click 'hold' button because of the skin cover. And if you try to click hold button, you can choose the advanced click function that is the big button using machine itself to change menu. In spite of advanced technology, users can choose this button by mistake. I think they should develop this uncomportable function. Except for these, I am satisfied with my new toy, and strongly recommending you.

<Title>Beats IPod - hands down!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This iRiver is the best mp3 player I've owned yet and I've had several: Ipods (including the newest Nano), Microsoft Zune, etc.  The digital FM tuner can auto preset every possible station (it even finds small college stations) and then the signal is flawless! Window Media Player makes transferring the songs/videos/etc. with a drag & drop feature that is so easy (no converting files to a special format). The screen is very crisp and I've watched movies on it with no problem.  Also you can change the wallpaper to customize the screens. This player is well worth the $200+ you may pay for it..

<Title>Not a Happy Camper
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>All the nice things folks hae said about this player are true.  However, after about a week of use, the device FROZE!  Used the reset button to restart the unit but that essentially wiped the memory.  Nothing but empty folders left.  All pictures and music gone!  Used the "Rebuild" function and that seems to have gotten the music back, but all album art and all pictures are gone.  It takes hours of work to sync 8GB of music and I'm not looking forward to having to reload all my music files in order to have album art.    One other gripe:  There are "Themes" you can use to liven up the background, but each time the unit powers off, you are back to standard wallpaper.  Kind of a pain to reset each time the unit times out.  Oh yeah, and you can't delete songs using the player's interface.  Bummer.  Other than the above, when it's working, it's pretty nice.

<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was my boyfriend's Christmas present this year and when he got it his face lit up. This device is very light and pretty durable and the sound is incredible. The display was terrific quality as well. I would suggest this product before an Ipod any day, because I love it almost as much as he does!

<Title>Solid player
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I read great things about this player on CNet and it largely lives up to expectations.  Sound is great, and it has a lot of fun features and a beautiful screen for video (even if small).  My only complaint is that battery life is not what I had hoped - expected less than the 20+ hours advertised but I am actually getting less than 10 hours per charge.  Not much warning when it goes - started a gym workout with one bar on the battery indicator and it was completely dead within 20 minutes.   The click interface takes some getting used to and you may have to use the hold button to avoid accidental clicks when in use, but I like it better than a scroll wheel.   Other than the battery and some minor irks, this is a very high quality player and I am happy with my purchase.

<Title>This thing is awesome!
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this thing.  I couldn't get the iRiver software to recognize the device, can you believe that?  When I tried windows media player 11, it kept freezing up will sync-ing so I got pretty frustrated.  Windows media player would put incomplete files on the Clix and they cause the unit to freeze.    I deleted everything, and just dragged and dropped my albums into the music folder on the clix and that worked great.  In order to have album art however, you must use one of those two aforementioned programs, but I don't care about that.  I was also able to get the iRiver movie converter to work and put the entire movie "The Life of Brain" on my Clix (it only takes up about 1 gig of space).   That's all I need from this device.  IRiver's software used to not allow the downloading of copyrighted material from their MP3 players to computers in an effort to appease the RIA, but they have abandoned that idea on the clix.  You can freely move files onto the clix and off again to any computer, making this unit far superior to the IPOD, even if I can't get the album art thing to work!    Since the Clix doesn't have a hard drive in it like the IPOD, it will never skip so it is better than an IPOD for the car and the gym.  I got mine for about [...]...what a steal!  Look out IPOD, iRiver is turning up the heat.

<Title>Buy This Player
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've bought a lot of music players in the past but Iriver with their 8GB Clix has finally gotten it right. Whether your running, working out or sitting on a plane or bus, this is a tough, compact little player packed with a bunch of great features. Without question the most unique is the D Click operating system. Functional, intuitive, and simple to use, navigation through the menus (once you learn it) can be accomplished without really having to look at the screen....speaking of which is vibrant and can even be viewed in direct sunlight. A couple of quick notes. Know up front that the included ear buds are junk and DO NOT do the sound quality of this player justice. Buy some decent quality (less than a 100 bucks) sound isolating earbuds. I'm using a pair of Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3's and the sound is phenomenal especially on the SRS WOW setting...and I listen to everything from Allison Krause to Jimi Hendrix. Also spend a few bucks and buy a decent silicone skin/arm band as you'll need it when your moving and the high gloss finish attracts fingerprints. Overall this is an excellant player for the person on the move, who wants to carry a decent amount of music and video, and who requires great sound quality and reliable performance.

<Title>Great sound, and small
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you are looking for small, very nice looking, mp3 player, which can display pictures, has a great sound quality and a large capacity then this mp3 player is made for you. I absolutely love it. There are two drawbacks I should mention: - like every other mp3 player you will buy the free headphones are of horrible quality, which is an even bigger problem for this mp3 player as it has such good sound quality - it is quite sometime to fill 8GB, at the same time 8GB might not be quite large enough to contain your entire collection. Thus you might want to consider a larger capacity (one that can fit your entire collection) if switching file quickly is important to you

<Title>Definitely the one to get.
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Gen2 8GB Clix is only a few days old, but I like it quite a lot.  First impressions: It's tiny. The pictures you see of it online don't do it justice. Once you get it in your hands... the thing is small. If you want a light, compact MP3 player, the Clix is perfect. And since it is flash based (solid-state memory) in addition to being small, it's a great player for people who are working out or are constantly on the go.  The player face is very sleek. The screen is crisp. It's not very big, of course, but the player as a whole is smaller than a credit card. Navigating the player is very intuitive. A couple of the lesser-used options might take some figuring out, but they're very easy to access once you figure out how in a minute or two.  There's a programmable smart button which you can program to do a variety of different tasks when you push it. Currently, I have it return to the home menu. Definitely a nice feature to help navigate an already easy menu system.  The D-Click system they use is great. The face plate serves as four directional buttons (up/down/left/right) and there's no labels cluttering the face. As you move through the menu system, different icons will appear on the four sides of the screen which relate to the four buttons around the face. Just press the side of the face plate in that corresponds with the icon you want. After a few minutes, you begin to memorize the menus and can then rapidly click through the menus to get to where you want to be. Also, several different screens have additional menus if you hold down one of the sides. For example... holding "left" down while on the song-playback screen will bring up a variety of music playback options.  There's five buttons around the spine of the player. Two for volume, one for power, a smart button (the programmable one), and a hold slider. There's labels for these buttons on the back of device which is somewhat annoying at first. However, you'll remember the location of these buttons in a few hours and will be thankful that the labels are on the back of the device and not on the front.  I'm a fan of the rating system on the Clix. Since getting my music on the device, I've been assigning ratings to most every song (0 - 5 stars). This allows you to instantly generate a playlist based on rating. You can have the Clix play songs that are rated X stars or higher. So, if you want to listen to your favorite songs, you can have it create a playlist of 4 stars or higher, and it will play all 4 and 5 star rated songs. This allows you to create a variety of playback options. For example, if you only want to listen to some really good songs, set the playlist to 4 or 5 stars. If you want access to a larger variety of songs, then set it to 3 or 2. It also has your typical by artist, by album, and by genere playback abilities.  There's so much more I could say about it, but those are the biggest points in my experience thus far. I've been getting a decent battery life on a full charge (about two days of near-constant useage when not sleeping or driving).  One word of warning, however: if you are thinking about picking up the cradle... don't. The cradle only offers one very weak external speaker in addition to what the Clix can already do. Charging through the cradle is still done through your computer. The only thing that seems neat about the cradle is that it makes for a nice stand while the Clix charges (whoopdidoo?) The cradle only set me back twenty Washington's.  So... definitely get a Clix Gen2 8GB player... and definitely skip getting the cradle.

<Title>Quality control in iRiver land ... ?
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When my five-star iRiver H340 gave up the ghost (non-replaceable battery life down to 3 hours), extensive web research led me to this promising replacement.  The good news: small, light, cute, superb sound and FM reception, a user interface easier to learn than the H340. Alas, the battery life was not the claimed 24 hours or the reviewed 20 or so, but 5-7, even after conditioning the battery with five full charge-discharge cycles. Amazon was most hospitable in exchanging it, but the replacement earbud cable fit its socket loosely, so sound was off and on. I have just returned from the UPS store where I sent it off for refund, and will give it a rest for a while. Not sure what I'll do next, as I do listen to the radio, and I do value the voice recorder: the H340 mp3s yielded excellent results in Dragon Naturally Speaking, which I use a lot. Don't rule this device out, but test it thoroughly as soon as it arrives.

<Title>Wonderful  MP3 player!  
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Really enjoy all aspects of the iRiver, especially the FM Radio recording feature.  All music sounds super!  As a songwriter, I use the iRiver as a demo recorder using the built in mic and can play them back to review and revamp. I'm thinking about recording a CD of just voice and guitar using the iRiver as the sound is that good(not studio good but good for live recording).  I highly recommend this player!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGR3VG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-8194669-0810038">iRiver 1CLIx8B Clix 8 GB Multimedia Player</a>

<Title>Terrible music transfer. I may be force to get an Ipod
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have been playing mp3s since the first nomad was out. I have never had the problems transferring music to a player that the Clix has given me. I initially dragged and dropped (worked for the Iriver h10, creative zen 8 gb, creative zen m30) not for this player. Plays for shure my a**. These files are not recognized as music but go in a separate music folder under extras and browse (not easy to find). Read the manual. I need to use WMP 11. Easy enough. Installed it from the provided cd. synced music using that. Same location on the clix. Still not able to play it from the normal music playing functions. To the website. No answers and no way to contact technical support. I have not decided if I want to try the Iriver software. Will most likely just send it back. I like FM but this player Su***! I never thought I would consider the monopolistic policies of the Ipod but this may push me over the edge.

<Title>Don't follow the I-Pood herd
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love the clix series.  I bought the previous version for my wife and finally got myself one (Clix II).  The only complaints are trying to find screen protectors for it and I wish that it came with the small padded protection pouch like the previous version.    Other than that, this thing is perfect.  Say no to the I-Pood

<Title>Pretty Happy After Long Product reviews
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well, after spending considerable time reviewing quite a few different players I decided to go with the clix2 8GB.  The unit arrived quickly and I started by flashing the firmware.  This turned out to be a bit of a pain, but thanks to the online community I got it figured out.  Liked all the features and gave it a spin while running a marathon in the rain.  I kept it in a silicone sleeve inside my pocket and had no problems at all. The navigation buttons tend to be depressed too easily when it is a stand alone unit, but work much better when a silicone sleeve is placed on it.  All in all I am very happy with this unit.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UTQ5ZA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-8194669-0810038">iriver clix 2 8GB (U20) Red Line Multimedia MP3 Player</a>
