<Title>REVISED: If you're not an iTunes kinda person...
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>... then this might intrigue you greatly.  The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.  Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.  The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.  At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.  Then what?  What compels you to choose one over the other?  It has to be the UI and user experience.  The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.  The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.  So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.  It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.  The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.  Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.  Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.  This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.  I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.  However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.  What device would I recommend?  Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.  Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  **** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.  I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).  Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.  Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred

<Title>upcoming market killer
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this new product from creative i feel will be sure to take over the market. First lets name thr competitors. The rio carbon 5 gb. and the ipod mini 4 gb. Lets go on to compare them. the  ipod mini is a so called legend but i dont think so cause first of all it only has 4 gig compared to the carbon and the mini which have 5 thats 25% more. then the carbon and the creative mini have a voice recorder and the creative mini has a fm radio and a recorder. The ipod mini has a touch pad which the creative mini also has. The carbon does not have this but has an auto dj that chooses your favorite songs and your least favorites. the ipod mini does not have this but the creative one does. Like the adress book and such in the ipod mini not to fear the creative one has those too.the carbon does't. Both minis also feature backlit buttons. But the creative mini also has a cool light on the edge of player. carbon doesn't. Plus the ipod mini cant play wma the others can. Plus on the creative mini the touch pad is not  circle and has no buttons on it. Now lets name what all have. Creative has fm radio and recorder,voicerecorder, adress book and such, backlit buttons, touch pad, auto dj, 10 colors. the rio carbon has 5 gb , voice recorder, auto dj, extremely small.The ipod mini has 4 gb, no fm, no voice rrecorder, adressbook and such, .

<Title>Come on Zip
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Zip it seems that you critisize the previous guy of being a creative employee because he likes it. On that basis it would seem that you are an Apple employee, next time do not open your mouth. As for me i think that this product is far better than the apple ipod mini although for it to take down the mini it must have a crack team of marketers to get the word out, other wise it will likely go unnoticed. For all those un biased about products you should find this a much better product than the ipod mini on many fronts.  NEW: It seems that amazon in an attempt to make a few more bucks has jacked the price up from the 250$ that it used to be to 280$. Dont buy here go to creatives web site and buy from them its cheaper and you wont get screwed by amazon. I still love this product and intend to buy it after a few reviews come out from respectable magazines like PCmag or someone like that but until then screw you amazon i hate you and you need to drop the price back down so this thing can compete with the ipod mini.   Even more NEW: Good job amazon you droped the price back down. Who's a good boy, thats right. goood boy.

<Title>Zip it!
<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my first Creative player, the Zen Xtra 60GB for 5 months now and I must say that I am incredibly happy with it.  I don't think that "Zip" is actually an Apple employee but worse yet a Mac geek (see book, "Cult of Mac").  The most ridiculous argument made by these types is with regard to the sound quality.  The ipod and ipod mini do most certainly have worse sound quality than just about any of their competitors.  Not only have I tested this myself, but anyone can read professional reviews and ratings for these players, where the apple inferiority in sound quality is always noted).  I just read a consumer reports roundup (either nov or oct 2004) of HD digital audio players and the ipod and ipod mini were each the WORST of their respective categories in sound quality.    I don't own it myself, but have a friend who does and can tell you that the Iriver ihp series absolutely blows away the ipod in many aspects, including sound quality.     As for this "imitator" label, lets all remember that apple was not even the second company to come out with this type of device (hard drive based digital audio player).  Creative was indeed the first with the Nomad. I owned an Archos jukebox well before the ipod was released (that model even has better sound quality than the ipod).  The ipod certainly was the smallest when it came out and continues to have a great interface but others have caught up.  Apple is actually the imitator in this regard although this is not well known becuase apple has the greater geek fanbase and marketing muscle to help obscure things.  Most people are not even aware that competing products exist.  What is apalling though, is that the advertising and the apple fanboy base have gone so far as to claim that the ipod has better sound quality.  I'm not just expressing my opinion, standards for measurement of sound quality exist and Apple's ipod's and ipod mini's do not compare favorably against the competition in this regard (do some research on Google, even on your mac).  Creative is the standard in computer audio hardware (the core elements of a digital audio player) and this helps them produce players with great sound.    No, I do not own a Zen micro and have never written a review for anything before owning the very item.  I was forced to do so here after noticing the utter insanity of Zip's comments.  If you want to just load up your player with Justin Timberlake, Creed or Brittney songs off of ITunes, perhaps the ipod is your best bet, just quit lecturing others.  Also, the backlit screen will reduce the battery life for any player, and the zen touch's battery life still kills that of the ipod (if you actually did own one).    Please, zip it good!

<Title>Good functions, but way too ugly
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.  But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  Creative should hire some real industrial designers.

<Title>Looks solid
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Zen Micro looks great to me, better than the iPod mini and equal to the Rio Carbon.  Pros: +5 GB Seagate drive +Great sound quality (all of Creative's players) +Synchs with Outlook +Looks cool +Removable battery  Cons: -Requires software to transfer music -No tactile buttons, all touch sensitive.   And to the fool zip, iRiver was out before the iPod, so your point is moot.

<Title>Interesting design
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I really like this "curved" design, and the electric blue glow is cool (can't wait to play with it under the sheets with my girlfriend). Have to remark to Gadgester about "Creative should hire some real industrial designers." that  J.Ive's worked on toilets and wash basins before iPod, which probably explains the white of the original iPod and the metallic colors of the mini, they all remind me of public toilets. The beltclip on Mini is really useless (unless you have small private parts and need to show your Mini off to impress the girls - "look see girls, I spent wads of money girls, do you like me now?) The curved shape of Micro plus its smaller size will make it easy to slip anywhere, Mini was uncomfortable in my pocket, all those sharp edges sticking in me. Good to see Microsoft and Creative team up with this product so that it will work on any PC running Windows. Think I'll leave iPods for the people who spend money to look cool, and get myself a Zen Micro as I value my music quality above what my friends think of me.

<Title>Missing OGG sopport
<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm writing this review because I'm been loocking forward to the iPod competition... but it is constantly letting me down. Why does creative incorporated FM radio and not ogg sopport first?, being this a digital music player... I think the are just trying to battle  the iPod with the same features, not really trying to make a better player. There are far too few ogg players out there, and most of them are not good or too expensive...

<Title>Lotta Bang for the Buck
<Date>Sat Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I could type all day about the knitpicky waa waa of iPods and Zen players, but what it boils down to is simple, really.  The new series of Zen players are well worth the coin; they're functional; they look good; they sound fantastic, and they cost less than an iPod.  Bottom line.  But hey - buy an iPod if you want - Steve Jobs is the laughing all the way to the bank.   For the record, it was Creative that invented the portable music player, but it was Apple that created something unique with the concept and put marketing muscle behind it.  If you want to be specific, you could say that the iPod is actually an expensive knockoff of the of the older circa 1999 players - yes 1999!  Was there an iPod back then?  Nope.
