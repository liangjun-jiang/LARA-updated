<Title>Horrible...
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>don't even bother!    It keeps freezing up, turning off, and won't sync with any of my mp3s.  Samsung was very unhelpful and said that it was "a Windows/Microsoft problem" when I reported when the device was starting to sync, then caused Windows Media Player to shut down (on 2 seperate systems!) entirely and then the USB cord is faulty, saying that it is unplugged when it is not.    Instructions were incomplete and shoddy.    Try a Zen player or a Rio.  Those at least work right out of the box, plug in the USB, and you're off.

<Content>I am very pleased with this item. I've purchased it for my step son who turned 13 and I happy to be able to share the music I grew up with him along side. It's very user friendly and shipping was right on time.

<Content>Even though this MP3 isnt perfect, its good for the price. what other 5gb mp3 player can you get for $80? had some problems when syncing because its unclear how to do it, but the mp3 player portion of it is good.

<Title>samsung refurb
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second purchase of this model, the first one was new. I lost my cord and had no way to recharge and this was actually the cheaper way to go. I was a little worried about buying refurb, but it worked out fine. Mine did freeze up as well, but that is because Wind media player wanted to download everything at once. I might suggest that if you have problems with it freezing there is a reset button on the back that you can push in. You will lose all of your music but it does save the hassle of fighting with samsung to return it. Once it is working it works great, my only complaint is not long enough battery life (apx 8 hrs). That said there are numerous mp3 players that you can buy new with longer battery life and apx the same price as refurb.

<Title>Bad Choice
<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased one and received it, it never worked right.  I received a replacement and have had the same problem.  I think this model is a waste of money unless they fix the bugs.  It just keeps saying you have to repair the disk with software that does not come with it.

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Sat May 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this mp3 player and it worked great out of the box.  I didn't have any problems synching music.  The sound was fine I replaced the ear-buds as son as I got it and I was quite happy with it.  About 2 months after I got it things started to go wrong. It would have a system error for no apparent reason and I couldn't get it to work unless I reset the device.  I upgraded the firmware, re-formatted, called samsung and tried every possible solution to get the thing to work again.  In the end I wound up getting another mp3 player from a different manufacturer.  I really liked this player when it worked.  I would strongly recommend not buying this mp3 player it is a waste of money and time.

<Title>Not reliable
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player and two days later it froze. I contacted Amazon for another as a replacment, again this one froze. I bought this for a gift an wasnt happy at all. Amazon did refund my money in a timley fashion. I just won't buy a remanufatured Samsung audio player due to the poor quality.
