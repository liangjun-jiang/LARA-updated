<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>great player. 50$ bucks cheaper than nano is what made me buy this. but then its features keep amazing me. fm player, recorder, fm recorder, photo viewer, video player, cool looking. i have run it for two weeks now and have faced no major problems. downsides: 1) doesnt come with armband. 2) Slideshow feature doesnt work 3) slightly heavier and probably thicker than nano

<Title>A quality product
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to replace my SanDisk SDMX1 mp3 player. The only reason I did not give it a 5 rating is that the manual is rudimentary at the best. It tells how to use a function but does not explain what the funtion is for. The navigation is somewhat odd. Although my music are organized in folders, once they are copied to the e260, the folders are no more visible. The player lets you play all songs, by artist, albums, genre, playlists, etc. This is completely different from the SDMX1 in which you navigate by folders. The photo display is sharp with good contrast. The video playing is also very good. I still recommend it.

<Title>Disappointment 
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went to BestBuy to purchase a 1GB shuffler (for running) and a regular ipod 30GB for my long commute everyday 2.5hr. The sales person recommended the Sansa 260e, for $190 4GB and all the options it made sense for me to purchase it.....however file transfer was confusing (MCP mode all the songs displays unknown) while connected to USB can not use the sansa, also the unit comes with sample songs which it freezed the unit,  but it dose not have a reset button so you have to wait till battery drains. One good thing was video transfer was simple and worked. Unfortunately I have to get the ipod but I'm glad I decided to purchase it locally vs. shipping

<Title>love it!
<Date>Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i've been looking for an mp3 player like this for a long time.  the ipod is nice, but i always had little gripes that stopped me from getting one (such as the inability to use anything but itunes to load music).    this player is a great alternative to ipod.  it's about the same size as a nano, but a tiny bit thicker, and a little heavier.  the scroll wheel has a nice tactile feel to it, and contrary to other reviewers i like the way it feels (although i concede the buttons are a little hard to press without adjusting my hand).  the screen is impressive-- bigger, brighter, and clearer than nano.  the menus are well thought out, though this is my first tag-based player (vs. folder-based) so there is a slight learning curve for me.  mine came already loaded with the most current firmware.  the first time i connected it to my computer i nearly panicked-- the unit would turn on, then show an error and turn off.  then i realized i had the "hold" button on.  switching it off fixed the problem.  i didn't install any of the sandisk software and windows xp found the device and gave me the option to sync it with my music in windows media player.  you can also open the player as a folder in my computer and just copy music that way if you prefer.  to copy photos or videos you do have to install the sandisk software.  i copied over all the music i could think of (maybe 30 albums?), and i still have 1.5gb left.  i was considering ordering an extra mini-sd card to expand the memory, but now i think i will hold off since i'm having a hard time filling it as it is!  all in all, great mp3 player!  i will update my review if my impressions change.

<Title>Some notes about the e200 series
<Date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The other reviews have already commented on the features and performance, so I'll try to comment on those aspects that haven't gotten much attention.  This is a great player, but I will concentrate on some annoying aspects:  1. When you charge via USB, the display on the device is always on. It doesn't fall asleep or go dim. The device is also nonresponsive in this mode, ie the buttons won't work and you won't be able to play or do anything.  2. If you have a USB wall charger, the display will dim and the buttons will work while charging. But the device must be on, it won't charge via AC if the device is turned off.  3. Playlists can be made on the fly, but you have to play each song you want to add to the playlist in order to bring up the option.   4. Video conversion software only installs on windows XP. It also breaks up larger files into smaller ones, and it's not very intuitive to copy whole DVD's. The quicktime format it uses is proprietary. Also, video files are only recognized in the root folder, so the device won't see files located in subfolders. Videos run at 15 fps.   5. Has the option of choosing MSC or MTP mode. MSC loads the player like a flash drive so you manually drag and drop files. MTP works with wmp 10, and some other third party software to manage your syncing. I prefer MSC, but I switched to MTP because when you unplug the USB cable in MSC mode, the device reboots itself. It does not do this is MSC mode.   This is a great player, but you'll need to spend some time configuring everything to your preferences. The Sandisk firmware has good basic functionality, but if you're used to lots of features for customization, be prepared to work for it with this device. I miss features like "play most recently synchronized" that my old player had. The good news is that these firmware drawbacks may soon be addressed when Rockbox firmware is released. The hardware and build quality of this device is truly excellent, and it will be the best flash player on the market once Rockbox firmware is released for the e200 series.

<Title>AWESOME MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is sweet.   PROS:   1. Has more space and more features than the IPOD nano.  2. Video. I have encoded a bunch of Family Guy episodes and they play great.   3. Nice design.  CONS:   1. USB only charger. This is crap. Most MP3 players do this however. You simply need to buy a 5 dollar USB to AC adapter via ebay to be able to charge on the go. MP3 player companies are retarded thinking that a person is always going to have computer access.   2. Breaks up video into small chunks. If you want to watch a 1 hour movie, it will break it up into 10 minute movies. Not a big deal but it just means you'll have like 6 files for an hour long movie.   3. Not many accessories at this time. I want to buy accessories for this puppy but since it's brand new, there's not much out there yet. Hopefully that will change.

<Title>Ipod Terminator
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Strengths: Affordable, Plays Video, Flash-based storage  Weaknesses: Low(er) Capacity (compared to hard drive players), case shows marks/fingerprints easily, cheap headphones included  Excellent player for the price - like a smaller version of a Video Ipod, but better in some ways! It is flash based - so no moving parts to break or wear out. The battery is user replaceable so you're not up a creek when it does go out in a year or two.  The software it comes with is just basic, but simple and easy to use - just choose some files (including DVD .VOB files), and it converts them and puts them on the player for you - pretty quickly, too. (Much faster than 600mb per hour that another reviewer said, though I haven't clocked it.)  There's good community support, and talk of their being RockBox support coming up for this player, which will make it even better! It's arguably the best thing out there for the price!   Highly recommended - you can't go wrong with this one.

<Title>A GrEaT bUy!!!!
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great multimedia device.  After hearing that the ipod gets scratched and cracked too easily I decided to look elsewhere for my traveling entertainment.  I did my research and so far I am glad that I chose this device.  I was reading some of the other reviews and I saw that someone had mentioned no stop button, there IS a stop button!  Also, someone had written that the picture slide show does not work, it definitely does!  Plus, I called Sandisk with some questions and they were very patient and helpful.  The ONLY negative (so far) is that there are no accessories for this item but Sandisk has informed me that they are on the way.  We will have to wait and see...  I would say that this is a great buy!!!

<Title>Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought a SanDisk Sansa e270, and deeply regret the purchase.  I need a travel charger and a spare battery, but you don't sell either, and will not tell me what other chargers, if any are compatible with the e270.  Your technical support representative's answers are absolutely useless - I have cut and pasted my questions and his responses below.  Given the non-existent customer support, I will not buy another SanDisk product again.    ===============     Your Question/Problem: I want to use the Sansa e270 when I travel, but won't be carrying a laptop. How do I charge the battery since you don't sell a travel charger? Can I use the IPod Nano/mini charger brick and plug the Sansa USB into it? If not, what can I use.  Also, I want to buy a spare battery since it is user replaceable, but you don't sell it either. Where do I buy one?  ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/20/2006 08:09)  Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. As of now there is no available wallcharger and spare battery for the Sansa e200 series. Also we do not recommend that you use the charger of the ipod player, considering that is not a product of SanDisk. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!  Sincerely, Michael Louie I. SanDisk Technical Support ________________________________________ Your Response: (06/21/2006 08:03) My trips typically last 2-4 weeks, so I really do need to charge. Since you do not sell chargers and batteries, and recommend not using non-SanDisk chargers, that makes my SanDisk unusable after the charge runs out. The only alternative is to use the IPod charger - please tell me what the correct voltage, amperage, and polarity is to charge the Sansa e270. I am willing to use a non-SanDisk product even if it means voiding the warranty. Otherwise I have wasted almost $300. And when will you start selling spare batteries, since one of the reasons I bought the Sansa was because SanDisk advertised it had a replaceable battery - although this may be true in theory, it is not true if you don't sell one! ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/21/2006 08:03)   Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. The ampherage, polarity and voltage are all proprietary information that we are unable to release at this time. You may try to do a search on a compatible charger for the Sansa e200 series player. However we do not guarantee that anything will work with it until we put a charger on the market. But we have no information when it will be out. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!

<Title>e260 vs Nano - an easy decision, heres why
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased a new nano for my fiancee, and one of the e260 for myself.  My thought was that I wanted to buy her a nice expensive unit, and I would settle for the less expensive unit.  However, it turns out that the e260 is way better than the Nano.  I'll break down why, and to be fair there is a couple of things also listed that the Nano does better.  THINGS THAT e260 DOES BETTER THAN NANO: 1.) e260 can do more     - You can play video on the e260 - great for little vacation clips from your camera. 2.) e260 screen is bigger, more colorful and brighter 3.) e260 battery is replaceble, no need to throw your unit away when the battery dies (since apple ipod would charge too much to send it in and get battery etc). 4.) Price per Storage ratio.  Nano cost $175 for 2GB, e260 was $140 for 4GB (prices at my purchase time) Thats TWICE AS MUCH for LESS MONEY. 5.) e260 is more scratch and break resistant.  Built better. 6.) e260 has an FM TUNER, you can listen to radio! 7.) You cannot use a coupon or coupon code on any Apple products at any store anywhere, you can with e260. 8.) e260 has memory card slot, yes you can add even more storage and/or move stuff off/on with a little micro-sd card. 9.) Battery charge - you get at least a couple of hours more from full charge out of the e260. 10.) Drag and drop your music onto the unit, no need for management software.  This means the unit can also be used as a file storage device like a USB drive.  THINGS THAT NANO DOES BETTER THAN e260: 1.) Nano is slightly thinner. 2.) Nano has more accessories on the market, its hard to find them for e260. 3.) The scroll wheel of e260 is mechanical, the nano scroll is sort of touch based.  Some prefer the mechanical, but the touch based is prefered by me.  Its no contest for me, I will never buy IPOD again, you just do not get what you pay for.  Really, if there was an IPOD Nano out there with the same features as the e260 and same storage space, apple would charge over $500 for it.

<Title>Would not purchase this product again
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought a Sandisk Sansa e260 and our son had problems getting it to synchronize from the time that he took it out of the box. Then today his Sandisk Sansa e260 fell 2 feet to the floor while he was sitting down and now the screen is destroyed with lines running through it internally. One would think that a 24" fall would not be enough to destroy a flash drive player, but even a rubber skin on the player was not enough to protect this poorly designed player from internal damage. I called the Sandisk company and spoke with a manager who stated that the Sandisk players are not designed to resist ANY TYPE of falls "even if it only falls 12" or less." I did not tell this manager that our kids previously owned the Sandisk Sansa m240 which not only stood up to the abuse of MANY impacts and falls, but one of them went through the wash and still worked! The new Sandisk Sansas do not hold up to the quality that their players once were. These e260 players are less expensive than some and they have decent sound quality, but don't waste your money on these players if you want a player that will last more than a few months.

<Title>An Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is far and away better than an iPod Nano. Like anything else, it has it's pros and cons, listed here:  Pros * Excellent size and feel. It's small, yet fits in the hand perfectly. It's only slightly thicker than a Nano. * The screen is bright, crisp, and displays video. The video is a double-edged sword, however. More on that in the cons. * 4GB is a lot of space, and you can add even more with the MicroSD slot for a good price.  Cons There are two different categories in the Cons. Cons that can be fixed (via a firmware update), and those that can't. First, the Cons that can be fixed: * You can only delete songs from the computer, not through the interface. This can be easily fixed in a firmware update. * Sometimes a weird glitch occurs where you see songs on the MP3 player that don't really exist. You select it and nothing happens. I find simply taking everything off the MP3 player to the computer, then back to the MP3 player will fix this. The downside to this method is that you lose the ratings you give your songs. * The movies are gigantic. The software included streamlines the process, but it manages to take a 54MB .mp4 file and convert it into a 300MB+ Motion JPEG file. I'm not sure if this is normal for the Motion JPEG codec, but it boggles the mind. Also, it breaks up videos into segments of ten minutes. I'm assuming this is because you can only fast-forward at one speed, so it helps make it easier to find where you left off. This can be fixed by simply using the same feature it uses for it's songs, the "Scan through song" feature. Hopefully this can be addressed in a future firmware update.  Unfixable Con: * The buttons are hard to push. If the scroll wheel (which lights up with a cool blue whenever you use it) was set into the MP3 player just a liiittle bit deeper, it would be easier to hit the buttons. But it's not. So it isn't. You end up putting your thumb on the wheel, and tilting your thumb toward the button, or you use your fingernails. Sort of annoying. The menu button doesn't have a responsive "click" or anything of the sort, so you have to push it and hope it registers. Also sort of annoying.  I know there are way more cons then pros, but it's human nature to point out the flaws. But if/when the fixable cons get fixed, it becomes obvious the pros outweigh the cons. I can still wholeheartedly recommend this MP3 player right now.

<Title>Best MP3 for Yahoo Music
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have tried many MP3s over the years and this by far is the most iPod like.  It works extremely well with the Yahoo Music subscription whereas others in the past have had many software issues. the memory expansion slot is a plus but with 4 gigs, you can get a load of songs on it anyway. the only thing i can find wrong is that it does not work well with Yahoo Music playlists. Extra steps are required to copy them over which isn't worth the time. But the extremely long battery life is worth the lack of playlist functionality.

<Title>Sanse e260 player
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There were a few qualities that I looked for in an mp3 player, portability, ease of use, and price.   Portability - it travels well and is surprisingly durable, a necessity for me Ease of use - At first, I got confused by a couple of the menus but, after a couple of minutes, I was able to navigate through with no problems.  I can port my files onto the player without having to use special software - another big point for me.  My only gripe is with the ear buds as they never fit right in my ears, but that's hardly Sandisk's fault.  I'll simply purchase something a little more flexible and smaller. Price - after doing a comparison, I found this to be the best value for my money.   All in all, enjoyable so far.

<Title>Hmm, nice, but...
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was really looking forward to this and when I got it I started having mixed feelings. It has a good size, feels sturdy but a bit on the heavy side. The interface is nice, easy to use, but as someone pointed out you cannot delete a file from the player, you must use the computer. The beautiful wheel gets on the way of the buttons, also pointed out by others, and though it is not very smooth it turns reasonably well unless you are trying to go through a lot of songs at once. Then there is the whole issue of only being able to charge it through an usb connection, together with the fact that it uses a proprietary cable and you can't just use one of the standard usb cables available on the market (ok, many players have the same issue...). One other concern are the openings for the microsd card slot and the cable connections that have no protection. Being able to add extra memory is a nice feature. It sounds good but the earphones that come with it are of low quality what brings me to the issue that you can't adjust the equalizer to your own   settings; you have to use one of the preset options. The Sansa e260 is ok for adding some family videos to carry around, but seriously, who is going to watch a whole video in such a small screen? It is not the main purpose of the player; if you want to watch videos get a larger screen/larger storage video player. 4GB is a great amount of memory for music, that is why I bought it. Curious that the movies are .mov, a quicktime/apple standard, and yet it doesn't support mac, you can't even access it as a hard drive if you plug it into a mac.

<Title>Above average mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have this product for about a month now. It's a nice product for the price. I dont have any major problems yet. Before buying it I have read several reviews on Internet, most of them say that it has nice featurs and a good sound quality. So, I bought it and found that its sound quality is not as good as I expected. By the way I am comparing sansa with iPod nano. At some instances I hear hissing sound in some songs which sounds great in my car audio system. I may have to see if there any setting which can improve the sound quality. I like some of the features like loading mp3s from computer. You dont have to go through format change, you can simply drag and drop as in Windows Explorer, FM radio is fairly good and ability to store and display color pictures. It is not better than iPod for sure. iPod has a nice sound and touch pad navigation, in sensa navigation is done by wheel. The height of this wheel is little more than it should be, which makes harder to press the buttons around it. Overall I found it little better than average mp3 player.

<Title>Klutsy, bit it sounds great
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I've had it about a month and yes, the Sansa e260 and Yahoo Music have replaced my ipod.  Never thought it would happen.  Pro's - The sound is wonderful.  The earbuds that came with the Sansa are quite good but I am tiring of plastic in my ear so  I bought a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 earphones.  Great combination.  All the music I want from Yahoo for a flat fee and a player that produces wonderful sound and only slightly larger than a nano.  Good FM reception and sound.  Cons - A klutsy mechanical interface. Mechanical buttons you have to press very deliberately or nothing happens.  The volume control/scroll wheel is mechanical, not touch-pad like like the ipods.  All in all, it's a better way to listen to all the music you can imagine on a great sounding portable device.  You get used to the ideosyncraisies - and the price is right.

<Title>Better than an iPod, but still a few kinks
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is a great buy.  Let's go through the good and the bad on this little guy.  Pros: A great machine.  This MP3 player sounds very nice out of a fine pair of quality headphones, and even from those pack-in earbuds (that are surprisingly good themselves).  The screen is beautifully clear and colorful, which is great because the system allows for video playback and image viewing.  The unit feels nice in your hand or pocket and looks very stylish as well.  UI is easy to navigate, even though the buttons themselves hamper use a bit.  This player does not require itself to be synced to a computer player like the iTunes/iPod partnership, and therefore music can easily be added and removed with no DRM slowing (or stopping) the process.  Other features like FM radio and voice-recorder are nice bonus features.  Cons: But it's not without quirks.  There are a few minor issues that must be dealt with.  When you drag music in via My Computer, the Sansa ignores track numbers and plays in any order; only adding music via Windows Media Player keeps tracks in order.  Player occassionally locks up during normal use, but not enough to be a bother.  Face buttons are cramped by scrollwheel and a little hard to press, and the scrollwheel itself isn't as nice as, oh, a touchwheel.  Also, the fast-forwarding is quite slow, and it can be a pain to find your place in an audiobook or podcast if stopped.  Minus the quirks- most of which could be fixed by a firmware update- this is one fine machine.  If you want something like a iPod Nano, but would like to get more bang for your buck, then buy this player.

<Title>Great little unit, love sansa products
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought a refurb for $50 on ebay after my wife got one.  My last player was a creative zen which wouldn't last more than a couple hours of battery life, and if you left it sit for a couple weeks the battery would die by itself.  I can leave this sitting around for months and it will still retain it's charge.  Battery lasts a long time during use too.  Seems like some allow you to connect as a MSD (mass storage device) so that you dont' have to sync with rhapsody, the one I got wasn't (which is one of my complaints).  I also don't like that there's no adapter to use this with an ipod connector (for the car).  I would think it wouldn't be hard since the connector is the same, and this unit is capable of remote control, but the pin layout is different.  I've contacted Sansa about a possible future adapter and I've gotten no response.

<Title>Sansa E260
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great product, intuitive and easy-to-use format, FM radio has excellent reception, sound is balanced and has a reasonable frequency response.  Overall, an excellent value.  You should be aware that the unit does not have a volume control.  The two selectable volumes (which both sound the same to me) are adequate for most situations but I would like to boost it a bit at times.  I would buy this unit again.

<Title>Good MP3 player, could've used more interface
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player for my son, and after playing with it for a few hours, I wanted one.  I purchased an Insignia 4GB Sport from BestBuy, but returned it to buy this one.  I regret that decision now.  This player is a good one, and it sounds great.  My only dislike is the user interface.  I use the rating system alot.  I don't have time to listen to every song I have loaded on my computer, so I copy them to my MP3 player, and as I am running (exercise), or sitting in a waiting room, I rate the songs, best to worse, then I delete the bad ones later.  The Insignia model had dedicated buttons on the side, so you can rate on the fly, the Sansa model you have to run through the Music menu to rate.  Also, the Insignia model would show you the rating on the screen while you were listening, the Sansa model, you have to go throught the menu again to see if you have already rated it.  Also, I didn't realize I was buying a (version 1) MP3 player.  I guess there is a (version 2) with more features in the software, but I did not know that when I purchased.  I guess you can delete songs from the player with a ver2, but mine you have to connect to a PC to delete songs.  The other thing I did not like is the inability to add songs to playlists on the MP3 player.  You can have different playlists, but the only way to change the playlists is to copy them from a PC.  The Sansa came with one playlist already loaded, called the GoList, and it is the only playlist you can change on the player.  I guess I assumed that the best feature of an MP3 player would be that you can create multiple playlists for any occasion.  With this Sansa, you can have multiple playlists, but they did not make it easy for you, in my opinion.  I do not use the movie or picture options.  To view a movie would take alot of the memory space needed for songs, and why would you want to watch a movie on such a little screen.  On the good side, it has a good looking clear interface, has good sound, built in FM tuner, and decent EQ.  My recommendation goes to the Insignia Sport models.

<Title>Rubbish  customer support
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this for six months now and for a time I was pleased but it always bugged me that it wouldn't sync album art over from Windows Media Player 11. Microsoft says it requires a firmware update from Sandisk, but all I get from them are 'canned' responses and the like, or instructions on how to format the player, very complex instructions on MANUALLY adding album art to the player from JPEG files, etc etc, none of which has helped one little bit. I keep telling them NO, I just want it to sync as easily as music does, but all I get back is another idiobot response. I suppose the firmware will not be forthcoming because they have a whole new roster of players now and are probably not concerned with the e200 series anymore. Sound quality is good and everything but if you want a player that will properly function with WMP11 I would get a Zune or Creative.

<Title>Let the music play
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this SanDisk Sansa for my husband's birthday almost a year ago and its still going strong. For the money... its hard to beat. He absolutely loves the thing and has had no complaints. He tells me its one of the best gifts he's ever gotten from me. Hmmmmm.... well its obvious he's tickled pink with my selection and I'm sure anyone who buys the Sansa 260 will be as well. I also bought him a toughskin case to protect and preserve the unit and it certainly does the job quite nicely. There is only ONE thing that would make SanDisk Sansa better and that is if the accessories were more readily available like those for the IPOD.

<Title>Thoroughly enjoyable
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this unit as a Refurb, since it cost $20 less than new and carried the same warranty. I wanted a flash drive player rather than a mini hard drive because there's less chance of mechanical failure. I use it primarily as a music player while traveling, rather than for pictures or video. The e200 was up and running in just a few minutes, with barely a need for the manual. (Actually, there is no manual; it comes on the CD.) The sound is great, even with inexpensive headphones. The screen display quality is good. It feels solid and secure. I've had trouble filling up 4GB of storage, but it's nice to know the unit is expandable via an add-on chip. The four buttons surrounding the Select button are pretty small and require real concentration to operate. These allow you to pause/go forward/go backward/change menus. But all players have some minor failing. I use USB to recharge the battery, though will probably buy one of the many inexpensive AC chargers now available. I would rate the e200 at 5 stars except that it might have some fault so far undiscovered. My first player was a Creative 256k model. The sound and features of the SanDisk are far superior.

<Title>not bad
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am familiar with sandisk memory cards that I use for my audio recorders and video games for my kids. They have been around a long time so I was interested in how they would do with an mp3 player and I think it's very good. I like the fact that you can essentially upgrade the unit by simply getting another memory card so that you could have an unlimited number of songs. Nice!

<Title>Great player. But you'll need to get the some extras.
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The sansa it's all about the features. Fm radio, Mp3/WMA player, video player, voice/sound/fm recorder, and more.   The quality is great, so far, i've been using it for about 2 months now. The sound quality is quite good. Battery lasts about 20 hours with regular constant use. Firmware is good, but could be better. But to get the most out of your player, i recommend you get the following:  * A wall outlet charger, since the sansa comes with an usb charger only (1st reason for the 4 stars instead of 5). Unless you carry around a laptop everyware, or dont mind spending 2 hours in a cybercafe just to charge the player.  * A protective case, unless you're very carefull with the player, it could get scratched easily (2nd reason for the 4 stars instead of 5).   * Rockbox firmware. This really helps you "get the juice" out of the sansa player, adding great extra features such as text reader, voice operation, game boy color emulator, video/photo viewing without the need to ccompress the files, customizable skins/fonts/colors, file and folder management, text file creation, louder volume, full equalizer, bass/trebble control, and more. Besides, you can install it without uninstalling the original firmware.

<Title>Save on gas read library books on line
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Handley library in Winchester VA just added a free audio books on line feature for library card holders. Download an audio book to your desktop and then to your mp3 player. After 2 weeks the book disappears. The problem, it doesn't work with ipod. So I bought the e260. It works flawlessly with the free software downloaded from the library. No more trips to the library to borrow tapes or cds and no more "OOOWW, I forgot to return that book last month." Although the capacity of the e260 mhas not been a problem, I wish that it came in 8 0r 16 gig flavors.

Since I've had the replacement, I've dealt with continual frustration trying to get the software and the system to function as it should.  An internal sound issue has occured where neither the headphones or DLO FM transmitter work.  Tech Support only says there is nothing they can do. DO NOT BUY SANDISK.

<Title>Great mp3 player, I'd buy it again
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had mine for almost 3 weeks now and use it daily, both around the house while reading and while out and about or on the train to and from work.  If I had the choice agian I'd buy it again.  CONS: The little round thing to use to select different things.  PROS: Everything but that little round button, the brightness of the screen, the sound, the size, the SD expansion slot is a huge plus, since I can turn my 4gb player into a 10gb player for a hell of a lot cheaper then buying a 10gb player.  Going to buy another one for my wife.

<Title>A great product
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this thing. I love the small size, the FM radio feature (though AM would've been nice), and the voice recording. The picture feature is nice, but the video featureisn't very usefull, as the software converts the video into a format that hogs up much of the player's 4 GB. Without videos, 4 GB is perfect for me and fits around 1000 songs. I love that you can drag and drop music into the folders of the player without having to go through clunky software (though pictures and video require the Sansa software). I wish the blue light around the center button wasn't so powerful, as it is quite noticeable in a dark room. It'd be nice if you could dim it or shut it off. Aside from these minor issues, its a fantastic product at a good price. Today, however, this model is a little dated, and you might find that you can get more for your money in newer MP3 players. Not saying that you shouldn't pick this one up, but be sure to do your research.

<Title>I was skeptical but now I am sold
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the Sansa E260 for Christmas.  I thought about the IPOD but want to have the freedom to put anything on it not just Apple stuff.  I have yet to fill it up.  I have music, audio books, video and pictures on it.    It has never frozen on me and the software works great.  I was careful to back up my computer before loading the software in case there was a problem but I have had nothing but smooth sailing.  The software converts all my video into the correct format.  I have updated the sansa software with no problems.    I really like how it feels in my hand and how it operates.  I wanted something simple to use and easy to load.  I don't have hours to spend on  a computer working on the software when I want to change videos or songs.  I want to spend 2 minutes and unplug and go.  The battery life is amazing it never seems to run down.  I watch videos for hours.  I spent 3 bucks and bought an power adapter for the wall so I wouldn't have to have my computer on.  I bought a nice case at Walmart by Case Logic that fits it perfectly.  I have a 2 gig memory card but haven't needed it yet.  I listen to a range of music plus audio books and videos so I am never bored with this.  It's small enough to fit in my tiny purse and I can use it when I am waiting on my kids or doing some chore I would rather not be doing.   Great for the treadmill and I love the "lock" function so I don't have to worry about pressing buttons by accident when I use it.  It's nice to be able to show of pics of family and places I've been.    I really like mine. Best purchase I have made in a while.  Found on sale the week of Thanksgiving through Amazon for 79.00!

<Title>Great item
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It's locked up a few times in the year I've had it, but it's a matter of a simple reset, no data lost. great controls, great sound. I never use the movie or pictures functions, it's a waste on a tiny screen. I use the AM/FM sometimes, and the main advantage is the file formats it supports as opposed to the limited iPod.   In addition, you can pull all your music back off the player, if you have recently wiped/reinstalled your computer and lost your collection. It's a handy backup.

<Title>mark my words: THIS THING IS [...]
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently bought this sansa at Best Buy, and I very much regret the purchase. I was just goint to Best Buy because I was looking into buying some sort of MP3 player (not necessarily an ipod because they are a lot more expensive than other brands) to hold about 4 GB of music. When telling this to one of the employees, she pretty much talked me into buying a Sansa e260. She definitely had very good reasons for getting a sansa over an ipod nanos: sansa's are a lot cheaper for the same amount of storage capacity, sansa's are more durable than nanos, sansa's have an FM tuner included and nanos don't...the list goes on and on. A big deal for getting an mp3 player was being able to charge it on the go because I'm going on a lot of trips this year and I'm not always gonna have access to a computer. Even though Sandisk does not make a charger specifically made for the Sansa, the employee at Best buy assured me that I could buy a Griffin brand wall charger made for an ipod and it would charge it. I guess I made a mistake on my part howeve because I bought the sansa with the wall charger in the beginning of July, right before leaving on vacation. After charging the sansa right when I got it, it stayed charged all week (to avoid having to charge it all the time, I set the backlight on dim and had it turn off after 5 seconds) into my vacation. After a couple days of long car rides, my sansa needed to be charged so I plugged it in correctly to my wall charger and left it to charge overnight. Unfortunately, nothing happened and my mp3 died. I coulnd't get it to turn on or do anything the rest of the trip. I even went to walmart during my vacation to try a new charger to see if it was just the charger but it failed to charge with it. This is when I knew that this thing was a piece of crap and I was disappointed because I had no music for the rest of my vacation.   Pros - *long battery charge if you don't always leave the backlight on *FM tuner *good sound when using good ear phones (more about that in the cons) *easy to load music onto using my already organized music library on window's media player *very durable and fit well in my hand *easy to get around (I liked how all of the menus were organized)  Cons -  *wouldn't charge with a wall charger!!! (although, when reading some of the reviews on here, I guess a wall charger worked for them) *adding songs to the "Go List" is annoying because you have to play each song you want to add individually *the ear phones that come with them have horrible sound and don't fit in my ears. Also, the little foam things that cover the ear phones fall off so easily.   It's too bad though because I really liked my sansa and how it worked overall. I'm getting an ipod nano soon though because I'm done dealing with crap. Now I know why ipods are more expensive. It's also nice how you actually can find all of the accessories you need for ipod anywhere.

<Title>Only buy this if you have no preferences whatsoever
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's start with the good stuff: this product is nice looking, it's light, compact, and easy to navigate.  Customer service is exceptional considering the state of customer service in this country.  The sound is very decent for such a small flash player, although I had a hard time finding a comfortable spot for the earbuds. Now for the bad: this player froze up after only two weeks of use, and although I was able to fix it within only minutes on the phone with customer service, it didn't fix the problem completely.  I had to re-format the player, erasing everything I had put on it in two weeks, but the drive space was still showing as filled, which took another call to customer service to figure out.  It is absolutely impossible to put anything in any kind of order on this player.  With music that's not really a big deal, but when you're trying to download an audio book with 150 different tracks, it's a little important to be able to download track 1, 2, 3, 4 etc...Because, well, the book progresses that way.  I can't really follow the story if I listen to track 23 then track 14 then track 142...It's a little confusing. And, it's also a little bit of a pain to have to scroll through 150 songs looking for track 2, then 3 etc.  The software they provide, rhapsody, is garbage.  I must have reorganized about 1,000 tracks on my computer, redoing the ID3 tags for music and audio books, so that when I downloaded them it would all be under the same title, genre, whatever.  Well, after spending hours and hours redoing all my audio files so I could download them in a relatively organized manner I thought it would be nice to put them on my mp3 player, but as soon as I dropped them into the player through rhapsody, it reverted all my files back to the original id3 tag (which customer service was baffled by).    Playlists are also quite a problem on this.  You can't simply create a playlist while on the computer, you have to go to every individual song you want on the playlist to select it, then find the next song, select it, and so on.  It was too much of a hassle.   In short, do your research, and make sure that you are getting the right type of player for your needs.  If you plan on listening to anything in order, don't buy this player.  What I have found is that it pays to do your research, and it is often worth it to pay the extra money for "nicer" products.

<Title>Tested Sandisk e260 mp3
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did tons of research before I bought this player. Some of my friends had Ipods-and were disappointed. I looked for battery life, scratch resistant case, ability to replace battery, ease of copying. I tried 5 different players before I settled on the Sandisk. I can assure you, you will not be disappointed. Battery life is incredible. LCD display is crisp. Get the gray silicone case for a few bucks and cut a piece of clear transparency film to cover display. This player now becomes just about indestructable. With a Y cable, you can plug in to your home stereo. You will not be unhappy with this purchase. Incidentially, if you ever have a battery problem, instead of shipping it back to company, replacement batteries are now available and easy to install. You will be very satisfied.

<Title>Think carefully before you buy it
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bottom line:  when you're paying this much for an mp3 player, don't let $50 make you choose this over the nano if it's not what you really want.  I chose this over an iPod nano, but I think it's basically a toss-up between the two.  Pros of the sansa: - it's just a tad bigger than the nano - you can download songs from pretty much anywhere - you get voice recording, radio, and video with the sansa - it's a little cheaper - replacable battery- I assume they'll start selling these at some point?  Cons: - the syncing is not exactly intuitive; it really only works well with Windows Explorer, and it's inexplicably hard to get playlists on the sansa - if you don't press the menu button just right when you turn it on, it freezes and you have to reset it.  It's a weird and annoying problem. - no accessories!  I had one choice for an armband to use for running. - do you really need video on your mp3 player?  Especially little crappy videos? - the voice recording only recored 3-min increments, and you can't upload it to your computer- so forget about bootlegging concerts, or even sharing a lecture with your friends.  I used my friend's nano and had no problem getting songs on it, so it is the player, not me.  I wouldn't say this is bad, and I'm glad there's an alternative to ipods, but when you're paying $200 there shouldn't be so many annoyances.

<Content>Don't believe the nay-sayers.    If you are looking for an alternative to the iPod THIS IS IT!!    The Sansa e260 series is easy to use, has a great set of features and functions and is (very) considerably lower in price then the equivalent iPod.  I've been using my Sansa e260 for a couple of months now and I just love it!  Unlike some of the other reviewers I have found no problems with the buttons and I find the user interface easy to understand and to navigate.  Keeping it charged is no problem ... just buy an inexpensive AC/DC to USB converter - works fine and you can keep using the e260 while it charges.  As to needing to use proprietary software to download movies; so what?  You're going to need to use some type of software to convert the files anyway, and the software supplied with the e260 does the job just fine.

<Title>It's a great little player
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll admit the main reason I did buy the Sandisk Sansa e260 was because of it's price (I bought it for $180) compared to the iPod Nano (currently the 4 GB Nano is around $250) but I also bought it because of all the added features. You can put on videos and images; you can listen to FM radio as well as record it; and more reaons that I will get to later in the review for what made me buy it.  Pros: - Great battery life.. I can basically go a week without having to ever charge it. - Storage capacity has never been a problem for me and I have almost 1,000 songs and at least 20 videos. - I'm surprised no one has really mentioned this yet but you can actually expand on the total memory capacity with the microSD slot which has cards that currently go up to 2GB. (That's a total of 6GB for the e260 and 8GB for the e270.) - The sound quality is great and heck I just use the default settings that it is set at, I don't really mess around with it too much other then turning the volume up in some situations. - The video quality is great but it depends on the kind of videos you upload like I have short 5 to 7 minute videos that I download off sites and I think the quality on the player is actually better then it was on the computer in most cases. - The overall vibrancy of the screen is a sight itself. When you first turn it on you think wow the color looks great and then you get into messing around with the settings and say wow it can get even brighter.  You're probably thinking about now I bet this guy has no cons at all right? Well despite my love for it there are things I don't love about it or wish would be added.  Cons: - Despite the overall durability the screen does get scratched. Also finger prints show up all over but those are no problem whipping off. - Playlisting on the player is bad. I just gave up with it all together and either just have it play all the songs on shuffle or I listen to a whole albums separate. - I can't really say it's a con now since I solved the problem now but I hated the headphones, they were very uncomfortable and they just didn't fit. Funny thing is though after I took off the ear piece coverings they felt much better. I have never changed out the original headphones. - The voice recording really isn't worth it in my opinion. The sound quality isn't really that clear and you can't make very long recordings although you can make multiple recording but you're still lacking the continuation. - There aren't really any good add-on accessories for the player itself. There is a speaker dock but I really wouldn't buy it and there is also FM Car Transmitter which is great because I don't want to carry around a bunch of CDs. Other then that there is nothing. - Protective casing wise for these players the ones that are out now just look bland to put it nicely. That's one thing I liked a little about the iPod is all the different designs and stuff they have for their protective casing but there's nothing fancy about the casing for the e200 players. - I'm a guy that loves his sports talk shows and there are no stations for that on FM radio. I don't really like any of the music that they play on the radio these days other then some of the songs on good classic rock stations. Anyways my main point is I wish there was AM as well because I would definitely trade FM for AM radio.  A couple tips I have learned so far: - When first turning on the player make sure you unlock it by switching the button at the top of the player left of the headphone jack. I too had been confused about this at first. - If the ear piece coverings bother you take them off. It won't be any less comfortable. - Always use the battery saving settings because they really do save you a lot of batter and you don't need to be staring the screen for every song unless you are paranoid it's going to blow up or something. - There are many easy options for uploading songs to the player so don't be afraid of not using iTunes. (Some options are Windows Media Player, Rhapsody, Napster, and more.)  I hope my review has helped you some in making your decision to purchase the Sandisk Sansa e260. If I were you though I would definitely buy it because it's worth it.

<Title>One of the best for the money
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product was kind of difficult getting started, I had to call the help desk to have drivers downloaded to my computer once that was done it works absolutely great. The product was purchased for my 15yr old son who loves it dearly, he's constantly downloading music and there seems to be plenty of space left. He hasn't done any  videos as of yet but I'm sure he will soon, overall we are satisfied with the product and I recommend it highly.

<Title>Mostly Good
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought two of these, one for each of our children. One has worked faultlessly, the other we returned and had replaced. The screen went bad after 2 weeks of use, the player said it was full after only 150 songs, and we could not get the video download to work at all. As for the replacement, we have not yet had it 2 weeks, but have already got more than 200 songs on it without any trouble. We haven't managed to get a video on to it yet, but haven't really had time to try hard. So, hopefully our problems came just through one random faulty unit. Apart from those issues, both children are loving it.

<Title>Great item with a few issues
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I think it's a great MP3 player. The only problems i've had is it freezing a few times, but i can usually reboot it and it works fine. It has never frozen once it's been playing, only when booting up. Also, a few times it would not let me delete files from it in Windows Media Player. Usually I could just unplug it and start over and it has worked fine. Now it has frozen and I cannot get into it at all. I contacted Sansa and they are replacing it without any hassle, so good customer service also! All in all, a good unit and I am glad I bought it.

<Content>This bit of technology is so frustrating to operate.. The instruction manual was of little or no  help...and finally after hours of trial and error and the help of a neighbor can almost use the eaudiobook portion.

<Title>Good player but is a disappointment
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product because the 8 GB wouldn't work on my computer. My computer wouldn't recognize it at all. I have the same problem with the 4 GB. I can now only use it on my work computer. My home computer is fairly old and only has USB 1.1. I am not sure if that was the problem but that's what I blamed it on. My work computer is USB 2.0. The mp3 player works good but I don't like the ear phones. They do a horrible job of blocking out outside noise because they don't go inside your ear. I use some free no-name ear phones with it instead and they actually go into my ears and block out a lot more noise. The player also doesn't come with a CD like the 2 GB does. It also doesn't have USB modes. If you plan on buying this player I recommend that you either get a new computer or get a MAC. Apparently these things aren't compatible with older computers.

<Title>Best player out there, a few small quirks
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player has more storage for less price of a nano.  Its just a little thicker, but otherwise as small.  With included media converter it can play just about any type of video.  I ripped a DVD to my hard drive, compressed it to 1gb, then used the convertor software to get it on.  Now I can watch DVDs anywhere, its great.  The battery life is rediculous, sound quality is good as well.  I don't think the buttons are hard to press at all, and the scroll wheel, while mechanical, is still smooth.   As stated in the title, it does have a few small quirks.  The interface does take a little practice, but after a day or 2 it was second nature.  You can add songs to the "go list" while its on, but to create other playlists you need to make them in windows medial player and sync the 2 devices... Its really easy, just download the pdf manual and it will make sense.  The eq has presets, but itn't otherwise adjustable.  Otherwise, the only downfall is that its not as popular as iPods, so there aren't as many accessories.  I think that if more people buy them and they become more popular accessories should start to appear, but I'll just have to wait for them.

<Title>Tried it, love it!!!
<Date>Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Some of the reviews I read left me wondering if this was the right player for me.  I found a consumer review on-line where they ran through the features and actually demonstrated how the thing works.  That did it for me.  After that, I knew that I had to have it.  I haven't had to be concerned with the technical issues, as it has done everything except convert video clips that I have taken with my camera.  I found some other software that will convert it and allow me to load it onto the player.  Here's why I gave it a five:  1.	Voice recording - I use the voice recording to record meetings at work.  The sound is crystal clear, better than any tape recorder I have used in the past.  Also, using the lanyard and dropping it down the front of my shirt, nobody else realizes that the meetings are being recorded.  It's a great opportunity for black mail!  2.	I was looking for something that would allow me to record radio broadcasts - I've tried it with music and it sounds every bit as good as the station did the first time.  I mostly use it for talk radio and it works great.  Radio reception is awesome.  I record the radio at work in an office setting.  Reception is even passable in the elevator!  3.	MP3s - I am very pleased here.  I was worried that play-lists would be a problem and that having the player randomly select music would also be a problem.  That was based on other reviews that I saw here.  I am sorry, but those people must be idiots.  You can upload the music using Windows Media Player, dragging and dropping play-lists.  The player keeps the play-list and automatically groups your music.  You can select the play-list and it will shuffle just that play-list (if you activate the shuffle function).  You can also play music by song, album, artist, and genre.  Or you can play them all.  It's all very simple and works well.  4.	Pictures - I am a photo-nut.  I love to take pictures of my kids, landscapes, and sunsets.  The photos are pretty small, but the detail that the screen allows makes the images very sharp.  You can definitely fit more pictures in here than you ever could in your wallet.  The photos are all converted to *.bmp files using the software that came with the player, but it is very easy to add photos.  You have to rotate all of your photos so they are taller rather than wider to maximize the size of the image on the screen, but it is not difficult at all.  5.	Memory - I have uploaded 100s of songs, a handful of short video clips and commercials I found online, 147 photos, and a handful of recordings.   I have used just over half of the memory on this thing.    Here are things that I wish you could do with it:  1.	Switch out the battery - sure you can, but you need to buy another special battery and I have not seen an external charger.  This is a relatively minor thing.  It will last a full day (from sunrise past sunset) and recharges in about an hour.  It has not been a big drawback for me.    2.	Delete songs directly off the player without hooking up to your computer - I ended up with a number of albums of my daughter's intermingled with my music and had to keep fast-forwarding over those songs.  They were mixed in with my work music, so I had to tolerate it for a full day.  Again, not a huge issue.  3.	Despite the fact that I have been very careful with the player, it does have some small scratches on its front, one of them on the display.  I can't imagine that this isn't a problem with other players too.  Again, it's not the end of the world.  Things that I was surprised by:  1.	There's a record button on the side.  That makes it easy to record radio programs when you are taken away from listening unexpectedly.  2.	Play-lists are easy to create.  3.	It is easy to set the player to shuffle and/or repeat  4.	The size is really much smaller than it appears in photos  5.	The sound quality when recording (voice and radio)  6.	You can reset the player by merely holding down the power button for about a minute.  I did have it lock up on me when I was getting ready to record a meeting, but figured that out just in time.  All and all, I would say this is a wonderful player and would (and have) highly recommended it to my friends.  I hope this helps sway you to make the purchase.  I was having second thoughts when I read some of these reviews, but those must have been posted by idiots.  Sorry, but it's true.

<Title>Great Little Player But Take Note...
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I bought a Creative Zen MicroPhoto 4gb because it was supposed to be compatible with Yahoo's music service. Plugged it into my laptop and could get it to register maybe 1 out of 10 times. I called their customer support and the guy wouldn't even give me the time of day, instead he emailed me useless information. I returned the product that day.  Then I buy the Sansa e260 and guess what??? Same problem. After two frustrating days I realized their customer support WAS open on weekends so I called. The fellow was helpful and said my USB ports might not be generating enough power to run the device properly because I was using a laptop. Well, I unplugged my other USB devices and what do you know??? It works fine!  OK, so I can't use my optical mouse and a couple other things while I'm synching music, but whatever. The player works, it looks cool and my problem was solved. If only the Creative support people had suggested something similar I bet that device would have worked just fine, also!!!

<Title>Great player especially with a subscription service
<Date>Sun Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the 4G device, and was so pleased that a week later I purchased a second 6G player for my wife. I read of lot of the reviews here on Amazon, which helped me make the decision to go with the Sansa. I think most features have been covered, I just thought I would add a few tips for people considering this mp3 player.  When I got the player it came with a flyer offering a 1 month free trial for Rhapsody To Go. I had been thinking I would go with Yahoo subscription service, because for years I have not been a fan of Real whose marketing tactics I have deplored. In any event the offer got me to do some reasearch about the various subscription services, and the consensus seemed to be that Rhapsody offered the most features, although it was a bit higher priced.  So I did sign up with Rhapsody for the To Go service, using the one month free trial offer. I can report that I could not be more pleased with the service. The subscription model puts another nail in the iPod coffin as far as I'm concerned, and given Sandisk's aggressive pricing for this player I agree with the Engadget guys that there isn't any reason to go with the Nano.  Now the caveats, and tips. I've not used an iPod and iTunes, but from what I read it is pretty bulletproof. The subscription model and combination of the Sansa e200 series with Rhapsody works great for me...I've got 3 computers authorized and two Sansa players. I've had zero problems with DRM...but if you read the forums there are folks who have definitely had DRM renewal issues.   It's my feeling that the latest versions of Rhapsody and Sansa firmware have got most issues under control. So when you get your Sansa player, immediately go to the Sandisk website and download the firmware updater program and update the firmware on the player...I received my player a week ago, and at that time it did do a firmware update.  Remember to set the USB connection (under settings on the player) to MSC instead of MTP for the update. There are two ways to connect to the player and normally you will use MTP mode, but not for the firmware update. Another point, when I tried to move a playlist created in Rhapsody to the Sansa in MTP mode it wouldn't transfer over as advertised...although the songs in the playlist were moved over. When I connected later in MSC mode the playlist automatically moved to the player. I will assume a further firmware or program update will take care of this issue down the road.  Also Rhapsody recently updated their software, so if you are not just now installing the Rhapsody software I would update their software before plugging in the Sansa. Another important point is that if you uninstall and then reinstall the Rhapsody software, make sure to 'deauthorize' the computer before you uninstall the software. The reason is that you are only allowed to authorize 3 computers (you can only be logged on to the service on one at a time though) and you will use up one of those if you don't deauthorize it before the uninstall. (You can get Real to re-set your list if you make this mistake, but it sounds like a bit of a hassle.)   And if you are going to uninstall the software go to their site and search the forums for instructions on how to do a complete uninstall.  Of the three installations of Rhapsody I performed, one didn't go right and I had to re-do it, but after the second install it worked fine.  Sorry if you think I spent too much time talking about Rhapsody, but my point is that when I purchased the player I assumed I would only use it to play music I already owned that was on my computer. After experiencing the subscription music model (whatever service you go with), I am blown away by how much it adds to the entire experience of the Sansa. I've been waiting for a long time to find an mp3 player that would give Apple some competition and finally, this is the one!

<Title>Regarding video & conversion
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall I like the player, especially what I paid for it.  Albeit it has a small screen, I'm interested in how it does with converting movies.  I couldn't find any good reviews that covered this, though I didn't read them all.  So here's a little info regarding video and video conversion...  Converting your personal DVD's...  It's fairly easy, however you'll need to use DVD Decrypter or DVD shrink or some kind of ripping software first.  The reason for this is because most DVD's have various audio tracks and for some strange reason the "Default" audio track seems to vary within the VOB file of a movie.  So your converted content may switch from English to French in the middle of the movie.  So you need a ripping tool like the ones mentioned above to remove all but the one desired audio track.  DVD Decrypter is nice in that it will let you rip a DVD into a single gigantic VOB file, and there's a reason you may want to do this, I'll explain later.  The other reason is that there is a plug in for DVD Decrypter which will take care of a cylinder redundancy (Copy protection) issue that exists on some DVD's.  The rub with DVD Decrypter is that you can not really edit the movie other than removing cells, which is very limited...  DVD shrink has an advantage in that you can edit / crop a movie however you like.  However when you go to rip it, it will do it in the standard DVD format, which isn't a problem for the Sansa media converter, it just has to deal with multiple files instead of a single file.  Converting using the Sansa media converter...  Basically the converter converts most any source content (including raw DVD VOB files) to a QuickTime format that is not well compressed.  The lack of compression suggests a weak processor or cheap codec, not sure which.  This is also evident in that pictures are converted into uncompressed bmp files, and recorded audio is uncompressed wav files.  So even know it has the power to play MP3 and WMA files, movies, pictures and regular recorded audio are uncompressed and hence large.  As an example I converted an MPEG file originally 8 megs and it came out at 47 megs after the conversion.  I'm not that familiar with the registered QuickTime Pro which can do all the high tech conversion as it's not freeware.  So it may be for the enthusiasts out there you may find a better way to convert things to QuickTime format and just drag & drop to the player...  Overall it's truly a shareware like piece of software.  It certainly does what it claims; however there is no options whatsoever, unlike the Quicktime Pro editor.  This is truly sad as it could be much more powerful than it is.  So it can convert almost any type of content on a file by file basis, but being limited, there's no way to merge content from separate input files into one output file.  However this can surely be done via other software out there.  Also if you're converting longer content like a TV show or movie, the converter will break up the output files into 10 minute segments.  According to a Sandisk CSR, this is because the player will lock up if the files are longer than 10 minutes.  Luckily the Sansa player will move from one video file to the next, however there is a few second delay, so it's not a nice seamless transition.  As far as converting normal mpeg & avi files, I haven't done too much of this other than to say it worked somewhat.  Some content I converted came out just fine, while other content didn't convert completely or only half of the content converted, so there were some funny things discovered, but again haven't played with this enough.  Hope this helps.

<Title>A Supeurb All Solid State Skip Free MP3 Player 
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the second one I've bought. The first was a e250 2gb model, and I ran out of room as I wanted to have a LOT of music to choose from as well as several audio books. I tried the memory expansion card but couldn't use it the same way as the built in memory, which is typical for mp3 players, so I gave the first one to my wife and got the e260 4gb model. This is a sleek little player, not as thin as some but on the other hand it seems very solid with a rigid metal back, and not very likely to break very easily. I acually like the thumbwheel, and find it easy to use. It would be helpful to be able to delete files directly from the Sansa but perhaps this feature will be added in a future firmware update. Mine came with a 30 day free subscription to Rhaspody, which allows you unlimited downloads to the Sansa, and there's a ton of music of all types available on their site. I also got the FM transmitter so it can be played on FM stereos without mp3 capability, and the sound is suprisingly good, even on stock FM automobile radios. It also provide excellent sound when plugged directly into my Tivoli PAL table radio. It's just a great little unit and I'm very pleased with it.

<Title>great MP3 player
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought this little mp3 player yesterday and I love it.  It's very small so if you lose things easily, this may not be the right player for you.  However, it has so many capabilities.  I love that it has the FM tuner on it along with videos.  It took me a while to figure out how to download the music onto it, but once I figured it out I was impressed.  The sound quality is fantastic.  I bought a car adapter with it and listen to it in the car.  This player is great and I'm glad I got it over the ipod.

<Title>Solid  Mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I first bought this product it was pretty glitchy but I have had it for a month and it is working great. The videos look real good and the audio quaility is good. I was able to watch a full length movie on my trip home on the airplane. My favorite feature is the voice recorder. I have been able to record a large percentage of my professors lectures. One thing to be aware of you can only upload musice onto the sd expansion video and pictures have to be on the device itself. They dont make that clear but it really isn't all that bad.

<Content>This is my 1st MP3 and I really like it. It has plenty of storage for me and I can always buy a card for it. I did a lot of research and found this to be the best deal. It was a little difficult at first to navigate the controls, but I'm getting better at it. I would highly recommend this to anyone. The price is fantastic. I did upgrade the earbuds.

<Title>Happy and Dissappointed at the Same Time
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Regarding music, pictures, the voice and FM recorder, and the FM tuner, it works well.  My only complaints with any of these aspects are that I can't customize the Genre that is applied to each artist or song, and I can't create multiple playlists.  As for the video feature, this player requires Sandisk's Media Conversion software (which was not included) to load video (and pictures) into the player memory. Even when I use the SanDisk Media Conversion software that came with my son's SanDisk SDMX7-1024 Sansa c240 1 GB MP3 Player, I was not able to get the video to play.  It works fine for displaying pictures, but when I go to the VIDEO folder on the player, it displays the word "Empty" even though the video is listed in the video folder of the player on my computer when I plug the player into my computer USB port.   I have sent a question regarding this to SanDisk via their customer support website. We'll see how that goes.

<Title>Very good competition for the IPod Nano
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Over all ease of operation was good. The quality of the pictures on the screen was great. Transfering music, pictures, and recording is very easy. The expansion slot allows you to have endless memory as long as you have SD disks to put it on, making this item a good rival for the IPod Nano. The only down side I see is that to watch videos you have to convert them first. I would suggest this to anyone who wants a MP3 player but doesn't want to pay the prices they want for the IPods and Zunes.

<Title>New Sansa fan
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Nice features, good price. I bought it as a gift for my 9 year old.  He's somewhat rough on electronics and I wanted to get him something that had full features but wasn't terribly expensive.  When we started using it, I found that it has a load of features and the controls are very intuitive.  It also syncs directly with Windows Media Player, so you don't have to load a special software package for it.  We haven't needed the extra space yet, but you can also put a memory card in it to expand the memory.  If I didn't already have a Zune, I would be getting a Sansa for myself.

<Title>Sansa Rhapsody
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the Rhapsody version of the Sansa with the RhapsodyToGo service and I love it.  I use it for listening to music when I run and occasionally travel.  It's very easy to upload either mp3s from my local drive or subscription content from the Rhapsody interface.  Making playlists for running is very easy since you can create them in the desktop interface and copy them to the player.  The sounds is very good even with the earbuds that came with the player.  The things I don't like about the Sansa have to do with the player's interface and hence my 4 star rating instead of 5.  I haven't ever found a way to stop a track from playing.  I can pause and go back to other menus but there is no stop.  It's very hard to do anything while running even something as simple as skipping a song takes two button presses -- one to wake it up and the other to skip.  I find myself having a hard time figuring out what buttons do what in various modes, for instance, controlling the music vs. controlling the menus.  Overall I am very happy with my Sansa Rhapsody.  Having Rhapsody I don't really have a choice in a player, or at least didn't when I got it in 2006, so I have nothing really to compare it to.  It plays music for me when I am running and I get to pick any subscription content I want so what else do I need?  I pay $15/mo, get to listen to millions of tracks without having to pay for each one so I can choose whatever floats my boat that day for that run.  It's a runner's dream come true until there's WiMAX and I can connect directly to Rhapsody wirelessly while running!

<Title>The best MP3 player I've seen...
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>But then again, the only other MP3 players I've used are the iPod Nano and the Creative Zen V. But this is better than those for a number of reasons. I'm just going to break it down into pros and cons:  Pros -Very similar to the iPod Nano but a lot cheaper. -The battery is easily removable. So if the battery ever dies you can easily replace it yourself. -Very durable. I never liked Nanos because I feel like if I have it in my pocket and I bang into something it could break. Also, the screen seems to resist scratches pretty well. I've used this regularly for about 6 months and the screen is still crystal clear. -Accepts Micro SD cards. -No connectivity problems/errors. I got tons of errors with the Creative Zen V. The Sansa is very user friendly.  Cons -Album art has to be less than 30KB or it won't display at all. I never saw album art not show up on a Nano. -Comes with a program that will allow you to convert many different video formats to play on here. The video looks good, but the screen is so small that I feel like my eyes are bleeding when I try to watch something on here. I didn't buy this to watch video on so that doesn't really bother me. -The FM tuner is cool, but I get a lot of static when I'm listening to it while I'm jogging, which makes it kind of useless for that. -The menus are easy to navigate, but don't display some information the way I want it to (like it doesn't show the time while I'm playing a song). You can easily install a firmware replacement called Rockbox if you want to have menus that are a little more suited to your needs.

<Content>The Apple IPod interface is unsurpassed but I do not want to use ITunes.  However, this unit's menu interface is acceptable.  The menus are fairly intuitive but needing some definition.  Finding the user manual on the manufacturer's web site was a challenge.  The unit excels at battery life and sound reproduction.  Its small size is great for the mobile person and the display is decent.  I like the ability to replace the battery when it dies.  Would I buy it again?  Yes, but I would probably look at some other units since this is my first experience with and MP3 player.

<Title>An amazing alternative.
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the e260 on sale, primarily because I needed something with a voice recorder. I didn't realize just how great of a deal I was getting.  I've owned three iPods, with my current model being the 5.5g iPod Video. The Sansa blows it out of the water when it comes to sound quality. In a side-by-side comparison, the e260 delivered a much fuller sound.  As far as software, the interface leaves something to be desired. The menu system is a bit touchy when using the scroll wheel, and the file format compatibility is too lacking for my tastes. I ended up heading over to [...] and replacing the firmware. It was painless, and the instructions were very easy to follow. I now have an extremely capable and feature rich mp3 player that can now play AAC files.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a decent mp3 player on the cheap. I'd also highly recommend they, or their more tech-savvy friend, install Rockbox. It's definitely worth it.

<Title>A Very Nice Player
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned several Sandisk players. If you want a low cost player with reasonable capacity and an easy AAA battery choice, Sandisk has been the way to go. Now they have moved way up in class, with the E200 series. These players have a great color screen, more advanced navigation, and lithium batteries that can be user replaced by removing 4 screws. Sandisk sells them for [...].   If you have a 4GB player, you have to be able to find things. When I first got the player, it didn't 'find' the 'genres' of my music files, which is one easy way to categorize. Fortunately, when I did a firmware update, the genres showed up. If you want to create (genre or other) categories for your music, you can use something like Jetaudio to label many 'selected' files, all at once, by the way. This player also sorts by album, and the tracks on the album are in the correct order. Again, this is information in the tag, so the tags have to be done correctly. Most 'ripping' programs do this, at least for mp3's.   Aside from genre, the E200 sorts by artist, and title. The scroll wheel is quite fast, and the bright screen makes seeing where you are much easier than previous Sandisk players. The sound is solid and it seems quite clean with a good pair of headphones. It will drive good phones, which are often less efficient.  This is a good player, especially with the rebates. I use drag and drop, and I loaded this player completely in less than half an hour. The size is just about perfect. If it were thinner, it wouldn't really fit anywhere that it doesn't already fit. The screen size is very good, but maybe not for video. It looks like a solid piece of equipment. I never had problems with other Sandisk players, but they looked flimsy. Also, this one looks much more elegant.  If you upgrade the firmware once, future updates should be automatic. When I drag and drop files with good tag info, I can navigate to the artists and the songs without any hitch. Tags are what makes iTunes work, and this player seems to do a good job, as long as you have good tags. If not, try a program like Godfather.  It's great to see a player that looks good, sounds good, and holds a bunch of music. All for a price that is more than reasonable. I like this player so much I wish I had the 8GB version, but maybe I will get a miniSD card.  I don't like handing out 5 starts, but I think this is 4 and a half. The USB charging is a little limited. I did find that a cheap 4AA USB adapter works fine and charges it. But you still have a special cable you must have with you. But that is a small drawback.

<Title>lasting quality? not so great.
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are lots of great reviews already on here at Amazon, and on the web, so I'll just add what I think is important to reiterate.  -The buttons they are *small*, not raised, and very close to the wheel. I have no idea why they did this. It makes it 10x harder than it should be to simply press a forward/backard button. *can* you eventually get used to it? yes. you can. but why should you have to?  -LCD  It was not meant to be viewed the way it's displayed! Why Sandisk? Why? If you hold the device on it's side, the lcd looks great. but if you hold it straight up, it gets washed out and kinda hurts my eyes to look at. The LCD was *obviously* meant to be put in 90' on its side, as a wide-screen lcd. why didn't they just adjust the controls to suit that?  -sound quality  w/the included headphones, average. If you get better headphones, very good. (for my tastes anyway, this one is so subjective, just try them out at the store for yourself)  -voice recording  did they actually test this? when you play back your recording, it's hissy and pops. perhaps it's the mic sensitivity? You have to speak loudly to get a "clear" recording of your voice, but that just seems silly to do in public..  -Crashing The latest firmware (Sept 06) fixed this mostly, but I'm not 100% sure. My sansa used to freeze/crash about once a day before, forcing me to reboot it. (hold down the power button for 15 seconds) It hasn't crashed since, but I still feel wary of it..

<Title>Voice recording = suxx0r!
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'd definitely give this music player 5 stars if it wasn't for the crappy voice recording. Since I'm in college, I use it not only to play music but to record lectures and the sorts. For some odd reason, the player 'creates' 4 folders and these extremely large setup files ( the biggest one on my player is 8 GB? ). On top of that, I can't record anymore. I'm not sure whats going on, but SanDisk needs to sift through these kinks and fix 'em. Other than that, its a great music player...

<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The user guide for this device is pathetic. They don't even give you basic instructions on how to use Windows Media Player to synch with the device. Unless you use Windows Media Player, the device only has one play list. Anyway, I got it figured out now, no thanks to SanDisk.   The device is ok. It's no iPod, but at least it's not proprietary--you can copy MP3s to it like a flash drive, but only after you set it to MSC mode (Settings > USB Mode > MSC). You only get one play list in the MSC mode. Someone got this for me as a gift; if I had researched it myself, I most likely would NOT have gotten it.

<Title>Made me appreciate my earbuds all the more
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My new Sansa has made me appreciate my Koss "The Plug" all the more, for finally demonstrating the fidelity I gain by listening with them.  Sounds I could never hear on cheap earbuds, I can hear with them.  For example, the high pitched, squelchy system noises that my new Sansa generates at random but frequent intervals.  Tried it with some crappy earbuds--couldn't hear those awful sounds (couldn't hear much else, either...).  Ah, but with my Plugs, there they are.  Harping along with Kate Rusby and her delicate melodies, standing out even between the beats in loud, thumping electronica.  I have tried and failed to ignore these noises, but if you're content with the bundled earbuds, this player might be fine for you.    But I have other issues too.  None so bad as the system noises with my earbuds of choice, but collectively I think they will probably lead to my returning this product.    There are two different settings for max volume, and top one is only barely adequate.  This is with my Plugs--poor man's in ear isolators, and much more efficient at converting a watt into a thump than regular earbuds--and with regular earbuds the max max volume is totally inadequate.  Not that I want to blow my ears out, but there are just a few songs that I must listen to at full bore.  The user interface has some annoying niggles.  If I am in the main menu, I have to press the power button to go back to the now playing screen, but if I am in the context menu, it is the back button that takes me back to now playing.  This is obnoxious.  It takes far more button presses than it should to rate a song, which requires too much attention that should be diverted to say, my job, or riding my bicycle.  And if it is in random play, I cannot go back later at a better time to rate the song (which is how I remember songs I've never heard but like), because the random play is random both forwards _and backwards_.  Annoying.  I'm no fan of iPods' but I believe with them, you just press in on the center button a couple of times, roll the wheel to your desired rating, and then one more press on the center to lock it in.  Mucho mas grande.  Also, after the screen dims, any button pressed only restores the backlight, and so it is generally necessary to press a button twice to do anything.  This fact exacerbates the buttons' poor tactile feedback into a worse isue than it should be.  And sometimes playing an album's songs results in one song playing twice and one not being played at all.    The player has crashed on me.  Upon unplugging from the computer in MTP mode, it refused to switch back to the player.  It actually flickered between the menu screen and the usb connection screen, and I was able to navigate to the settings, change the usb mode to MSC, and restart the player by plugging it into my computer and unplugging (as normally happens in MSC mode).  It also crashes if I get punchy and push any buttons during the three seconds in which it is hung up right after rating a song.    Pluses:  I'm not recommending this product, unless you believe my issues won't bother you.  But if they don't, the screen is very nice, large and well backlit, and I enjoy the tactile feel and speed and accuracy of the scroll wheel, much like the first generation iPods, before they went to electrostatic wheels.  The case is very attractive and feels durable, battery life is good, and the price is certainly right.  But the musical contributions it makes are most unwelcome!!

<Title>iPod killer!
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Absolutely fan-dam-tastic mp3 player! If you get this player, and you really should, definetely make sure you upgrade to the latest firmware as it adds so much more functionality: custom equalizer, multiple ways to play the music (play all, play all artist, play all album, etc). I'm not really concerned about the video capabilities, but I did convert a few Divx files with the included converter software. I'm not too impressed by that though - the original files were 98Mb Divx5 and when they converted, they were 258Mb. That's a waste to me. There also doesn't seem any way to change the settings for a lower bit-rate, but I could be wrong, I didn't dive into the software much.  Works GREAT with MediaMonkey, sounds great, TONS of storage and very crisp screen. Don't be put off by what people are saying about the scroll wheel, I don't have any problems with it and frankly think that if it wasn't very stiff, whenever you put it in your pocket, it would move.

<Title>Very Good but could be better....
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player a month ago to listen to ebooks downloaded from Netlibrary.  It is very easy to get the file on to the player and listen to it.  It has a resume feature where you pause the player and turn it off and when you turn it back on it remembers where you are in the book.  Very nice!!  However, because of my fat fingers I sometimes hit the wrong buttons and lose my place.  Then it is a royal pain to fast forward to the spot in my book.  It can take 15-20 minutes to fast forward 10 hours in a file and then it can be tricky to get it to stop in the right place.  I contacted sandisk about getting the fast forward to have the abilitiy to go really fast forward if you hold the button down for a certain amount of time.  Something like jumping ahead an hour instead of 20 second increments like it does now.  They said they would think about it.  I am looking for something else.  In the meantime if I lose my space over 10 hours in or longer I listen from my laptop so I don't have to get frustrated sitting with a slow fast forward.  Just thought I would share this with other audio book lovers looking for something to use.  I am considering a pocket pc instead which has a mobile version of windows medio player and I can use the seek bar and slide to my spot in the file in 10 seconds.  No resume though in those pocket pc from what I hear.

I quickly fell in love with the Sansa brand and as soon as I saw this go on sale I snatched one up. It's got a great interface and it's designed for use with Rhapsody - a major plus.  Pros: - Simple, easy-to-use interface - Great look - FM Tuner - Voice recorder - Rhapsody - Video capability (minimal as it is) - Expandability (via MicroSD) - Pricetag (when on sale and on Amazon)  Cons: - Small amount of storage (though ample for the average person) - No way to charge without connecting to a computer And that's about it for the cons.   Next I'm getting a Sansa View...eventually.

<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This a great looking alternative to the IPOD. Easy to transfer files and the sound is so rich. The only negative thing is the volume only has a high or normal setting. The volume needs a variable adjustment. This is a good alternative to the expensive MP3 players.

<Content>I love it. Looks and feels great. Works as advertised. Bought my daughter one for Christmas and liked it so much that I got me one too. The controls are really cool! This is way better than the I-pod and the price is right, not like the Apple. Downloading is a no brainer not like some others that are limited. So glad I gave it a try.............

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS!!
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this item through Amazon and after my second time using it, a white screen came on and it just stopped working. After trying everything possible to get it to work, I returned and received a new one from Amazon. After I used this new one for the first time, the SAME THING HAPPENED! I'm not sure what is wrong with this product, but it looks like Amazon recieved a bad batch of product. I would suggest waiting for it to come on sale at Best Buy or Circuit City instead of buying it from here. At least there you don't have to wait a long time to return something and get your money back.

<Title>Absolutely LOVE it!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I couldn't be happier with this offering from SanDisk.  As an alternative to the iPod, it hits all the marks.  When I purchase any item, I weigh the features that are most important to me vs the "cache" or following the crowd with the popular item.  Most times the crowd is right...But there are exceptions.  The Sansa e260 balanced cost, capacity and features to make it difficult to resist.  I needed an expandable MP3 player with sufficient capacity to store data files for transport,display pictures, do voice recording for notes, and most importantly, have a built in FM receiver for the gym.  The only item I could find that met all the requirements listed was the SanDisk Sansa.  The only thing I would like to see changed are the buttons outside of the navigation wheel.  They are a little small.  I am used to them now but it took some getting used to...  I hope this review helps.

<Title>Many things to like over the Nano but still needs a few things
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I do love the Sansa; the big screen, ablity to upgrade memory, FM radio, and that you can change the battery.  That said I have had some issues.    The main issue is the playlist function.  It has been mentioned before but needs to reiterated again.  There is one playlist with a less then user friendly way of building it.  Seems to me this is something they could improve with a firmware update and if they do I would give it 5 stars instead of 4.    SanDisk you are really missing the boat with this feature.  One of the things that makes MP3 players so fun is the ability to create multiple playlist that you can just select, depending on mood, situation, etc, and then just let it run.  With just one basic playlist you can create a a list of something like your present day favorites but even then you don't want to listen to these songs over and over.  Variety is the key.  The mechanical thumbwheel is IMHO easier to use then the Ipod style but at the same time I do worry about the ruggedness of this feature.  The select buttons are trickier to use then the Ipod but it's not that bad.  Fix the playlist issue and SanDisk has the best player on the market.

<Title>Solid performer
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to replace my H10.  This is a solid flash-based DAP with good support for online subscriptions (less finiky than my H10).  Quality is good, shuffle is reasonably random, battery life has been far beyond my expectations.  Only real quirk is when a license expires, sometimes it skips the song with a message (which its suppose to do) or sometimes it plays it scrambled for about 10 seconds and then skips.  Bit of an ear buster.

<Content>I really enjoy this product very much it has a lot of cool features. If your comparing it to the ipod it can beat the competitoin. SAnsa is prettier can play radio music Duh! photos video u can buy more memory for it  its cheaper then the ipod. When you have one peoeple are amazed and you dont feel like a total sheep. I recomend not using the rhapsody subscription service though it lies!!  You have to update you sansa every month u cant make cds unless you purchas the songs individually and that is not that bad but you are paying a monthly fee why pay twice????????? thats all i have the battery life is pretty good and you can buy a charger with usb hookup for the car or wall unit . P.s if there are defects like most new products get a warranty it works wonders.

<Title>Good job Sandisk
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, I have to admit that I was never a fan the Ipod.  Too proprietary for my taste and the Ipod crowd tends to be a pack of pretentious followers.  I have seldom been as happy with an electronics purchase as I have been with this little MP3 Player.  I have not needed to utilize product support for this item, so I have no valid comments to share in that department.  Functionality of this device is great, the menus are fairly intuitive and the overall capabilities are outstanding.  There are many more devices marketed to compete with this one which fall way short.  I use mine for everything from working out (outside in the elements) to reading and ebooks and have stored some of my college lectures on it(video).  It has not failed me yet and the battery life fantastic.  The software that comes with this device is somewhat useful; although, I have found that my favorite feature is how easy it is to drag and drop my mp3's and WMA files into the device window while paired with my computers.  That's right, I said computers.  2,3, a dozen, it doesnt matter with the Sansa; unlike MANY other MP3 players that don't like to share themselves(this should be especially important for you student and office types).  It has paired with every XP machine I have plugged it into.  What I do not like about the product is that accessories (and I didn't buy the thing for a bunch of accessories) have been slow to catch on; however, they are finally cropping up.  This is my experience with the Sansa e260, which I have owned for over 6 months and counting.  I was somewhat reluctant to purchase this due to apprehension of its smaller memory capacity but I have more than adequate memory for practical use.  I rip fairly high bitrate files (at least 192) and have a ton of files onboard.  I have yet to utilize the Micro SD slot.  The volume control, IMO, is easy to confidently use blind.  It does not require you to focus strictly on the controls when adjusting volume or thumbing through songs (ie. while driving or working out).  I hope this helps you decide on your purchase.

<Title>Very good, but...
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For what this is, it's really a wonderful little machine.  I have two problems with it, though.  First, it comes with some songs preloaded, and some of those files are actually empty and the player still displays them after I've deleted them from its hard drive. (??)  Second, because I use iTunes, and it doesn't support m4a files, I have to convert a lot of my music to mp3 for it, which is time-consuming and doesn't work for protected songs (like anything you bought from Apple).  Other than that, though, the controls are fairly intuitive and I like the moving thumb wheel much better than the iPod's touch wheel.

You can buy music from lots of websites for this MP3 player, unlike the I-pod. The video quality is impressive. There's lots of memory on it and she has several FULL LENGTH movies as well as tons of songs downloaded already. Get a case for it, if possible, to protect it from clumsy kids. Everyone will want to try it out! You'll have to beg them to give it back!!!

<Title>Reliable, Affordable, Solid Features
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Sansa e260 for about four months, now. I'm very pleased with this product. The Sansa is very easy to use, its features work perfectly, and it looks and feels really nice.  You can sync the Sansa either with a software service  (I've been successful with Rhapsody, Windows Media Player, and Napster), or using a simple windows folder interface. Each works perfectly, and all the music files will be usable inside the Sansa interface. The transfers are quite fast, and judging by the amount of space I've used, this model has room for several hundreds songs. I've also downloaded podcasts and loaded them up using the folder interface. They play fine, and simply show up on the master music list under their file name. There's also a media converter for photos and video, but I have not used those features.  The screen is very sharp and aids usability with a well-designed interface. The wheel and buttons on the front did take some getting used to, but now that I've been using it for a while, it seems second nature. The Sansa comes with some simple ear buds, which I can't stand. The third party earphones I purchased sound fantastic. The unit also has an FM radio integrated into it; you can switch to this by rotating the command dial to find the FM Radio menu item. I don't use it much, but it picks up a variety of radio stations near my home and work very clearly. There's a voice recorder (a "memo thingy") in the unit, but I can't imagine when I'd use that...  The overall unit is light, and small, but not too small to handle if you have fat fingers like me. Best of all, this unit has worked 100% perfectly for me. I haven't had a single hitch, burp or failure with my Sansa.   The unit comes with a USB cord that serves double duty as a charger and file transfer medium. The first charge took a long time, but subsequent use hasn't run down the battery very fast, so charge time isn't a big deal for me. However, if you intend to use an mp3 player a LOT, then the USB charge cord might become bothersome for you. It doesn't come with a very useful case, but I bought a very nice case for about ten bucks. Be careful not to buy a case that interferes with the use of the command dial or buttons. I also picked up an aftermarket retractable USB travel cord, which works fine.  I looked at several different players, including Apple, before deciding on the Sansa. I'm convinced I made the right call, and I couldn't be happier with the performance of this unit. I'd recommend it unconditionally to anyone who wants a reliable unit with good features and a reasonable price.

<Title>Nice features if I could only figure out how to use them

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7550798-1892912">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a>  I received this player from my son for Christmas.  The listed features looked great and I looked forward to putting it to immediate use.  I wanted one so I could play WAV or MP3 files that I generate myself of different training materials.  The concept of having a portable device that I could use to load any of my files onto and take with me sounded like a great idea and the added features were a bonus.  I've now spent over 8 hours trying to figure out how to make MP3 files, generated from my WAV files, that I've and dragged and dropped as described in the sparce paperwork that comes with the player play, pretty much to no avail.  I have managed to get Windows Media Player to sync up with the MP3 player to move MP3 files that will actually play to the player but when I try to arrange them in a logical order so I can find them they won't play anymore.  I've emailed customer support and so far the responses have been of no help.  This is my first MP3 player so these devices are new to me.  Perhaps if I'd previously owned an iPod or some other player it would all make sense.  I hate having to figure out how something works by trial and error which is how I feel about this device.  Why can't better instructions be provided?  I'm about a day from returning the player and having them refund the money to my son.  It's not worth the hassle trying to figure it out!

<Title>Great Ipod alternative
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my daughter for xmas and she loves it. The player has excellent sound and has many features. The interface is very easy to use and the graphics are pleasing to the eye. Transferring songs, video, and pictures is a breeze. I have not added a memory card as of yet. I use windows media player to copy songs, but you can drag them directly to the device also. I did seem to have trouble getting windows to recognize the player properly, but after I ran the updater I found on the Sandisk website all was well. There was a trick I found on the support forums that made windows see the player, had to do with holding down the rewind button when plugging it up, here is a link to the forum to copy and paste in your browser.

It is so easy to add music to.  Within minutes we added music and were ready to go.  She also added pictures, not all of them turned out well, but found that she needed to convert them first.  She will be working on that today.  The ones that were added look very nice.    I have an IPOD and it is not as user friendly or as easy to add music too.  It is defineatly more work to get what you want on it.  I would recommend this to anyone getting an MP3 player!  Very good product for the money!!!

<Content>This item worked great for about 5 min.  Unfortunately, it died after that and only worked when plugged into a/c or USB port.  Battery did not charge. Since I was really wanting to use this player for running, it was quite a disappointment.  I gave it 2 stars for how I think it probably would work with a battery and for the semi-helpful customer service.  However, I still haven't received my reimbursement after almost 2 weeks... that's a generous 2 stars.

<Title>I Like It
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>In my house we have several music players including an iPod Nano 3G.  I've used RealPlayer/Rhapsody and iTunes so I know what I'm talking about.  The Sansa is a nice piece of equipment.  Size-wise it's about like a Nano 2G but thicker and a little heavier.  The scroll wheel is mechanical but does work pretty well. The interface is well laid out similar to the iPod.  The screen is is beautiful.  The included software comes with a small application to convert video and send to the player.  This makes it easy to drop in TV shows, etc.  Now here's the rub, integration with services like Rhapsody aren't very polished and can cause some frustration.  Sometimes it just doesn't synchronize properly but I think the real problem lies in Rhapsody.  I've had similarly frustrating things happen in iTunes so I call this a draw.  You can access the device in two ways from your PC: mass storage mode or via an app like Real Player/Rhapsody.  mass storage makes it easy to just drag and drop in your MP3s.  Considering the prices you can get this thing for, I highly recommend it even over the iPod.  Apple is way too "closed" in terms of interoperability anyway.

<Title>4 out of 5, more like 7 out of 10
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this MP3 player about a year ago and I still like it. I've never had any other kind of MP3 player, so I don't have any experience to compare it to.   Positives + It's not an iPod (will we ever escape iLife!) + Holds a TON of songs. I have 450 on there and they only take up half the space available. + Easy to navigate menu + FM stereo is great. Sometimes I just can't get away from NPR + Great video playback  Negatives/ Notes - There are only two volume settings, "normal" and "high." With earbuds, normal is fine, but if you plug it in to your car or home stereo you have to turn the volume up really high on the stereo even on "high". - When you are playing a song or listening to the radio it doesn't show the time - You need to buy a separate AC charger, which is worth it.  - The buttons are WAY easier to use with a skin on - Using Rhapsody as your primary device manager isn't the best. It often doesn't show all the songs on your device. I actually find it so annoying that I haven't taken the time to make playlists, which would really be beneficial to those with a wide range of musical interests.  One thing the Samsung TY9 offers is that you can delete items from the device without a computer, which is a great feature.  Some of the rarely-used extra features that I really value and if they're important to you, they're great: + FM recorder + Voice recorder + Great equalizer

<Title>Good but Glitchy
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If it worked perfectly, my Sansa e260 would be great. The music and video features on it are very nice, and it looks good aesthetically while also seeming to be fairly durable. Some people complain about the buttons, but I don't find them too troublesome. Basically, if everything worked as it should, I would really have no complaints about the e260. Unfortunately, my particular player has been glitchy since the day I bought it. The first day I had it it froze up. This was a minor thing that didn't really repeat itself too often (maybe once or twice more). Later on, however, I noticed something was wrong after a file transfer (basically, it wasn't playing half of the songs that were on the player). I plugged the player in and looked into its files - lots of corrupted folders and files. I contacted Sansa's customer service department (very quick and helpful), and I got the information I needed to fix the problem. That was about two weeks ago, but my player has developed a new problem since then. I can turn it on and get to the menu, but, if I try to play music, the screen freezes and then restarts. I can't say that all or even many of e260s have problems like this - maybe it's just my particular unit. However, in my case, the glitches and errors have really been a problem. I think this player would be excellent if everything worked properly though.

<Title>Great buy but still could use a little work.
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the sansa because of the many options as well as the price for the amount of memory. This little guy has alot of good things but a few that could be improved. Pros 1. Size, Great size and great screen size 2. Cost, Best price for a 4GB player. 3. Options, Radio, voice recorder, adjustable EQ, Video, Photo, etc.. 4. Expandability, microSD slot for future expansion. 5. Drag and drop files from your computer. 6. Excellent battery life, up to 20 hours of music play.  Cons 1. Buttons are a little hard to get to at times. 2. Software sometimes is buggy.  3. You cannot create playlists, they have to be done on the computer and then synced to the sansa.  Other than that, its a great little guy and i've gotten plenty of use out of it so far. If i could i would design my own mp3 player with everything that i want, but i cant, so this is the closest that i can get.

<Title>Sansa E260 Great Bargain-Good Quality
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item for my son's 11th birthday. This player has a lot of memory and is a sleek looking unit. It is substantially less expensive than the IPods which seemed to be overpriced. This MP3 player is also very easy to use. The only problem I'm encountering with this series is finding accessories. The docking station for this MP3 series hasn't hit the market yet and will not be available until January 2007.

<Title>half of an mp3 player : at this price you'd want the whole thing
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While an ok piece of hardware (3 stars) as a product it's a disappointment (1 star), the software is not yet ready for prime-time & sandisk appears to have no intention of fixing it.  Sandisk dropped the ball on this one.  There are many good things to say about this product, but at its price, you would expect a product to compete with the others on the market.  virtually without documentation, assumes that you are an expert in the arcane uses of Microsoft Windows Media Player e.g., the documentation implies no way to build playlists, but you can through WMP, not to obviously though, plan to spend a few hours learning how to use it.  then use it regularly, as otherwise you'll forget how to use a non-intuitive pgm.  No bookmarks.  forget using it to play podcasts or audiobooks (also no support for audiobook format) - this is a major flaw for me.  Customer service says that it is not intended for playing podcasts or audiobooks.  period...  Communication is poor.  Suggestions to customer service go nowhere.  They say they have no way to supply feedback.  The sandisk website has no option for customer feedback.  direct email comes back saying you don't have permission to mail to us.  Automatic update: installs a program on your computer that runs full time (and is a service so it's tough to kill) but doesn't really update until you switch modes on the mp3 player manually, then the screen fills with misleading information to add confusion. i.e., not automatic, but deliberate, but bogs down you pc full time anyway.  Overall it could come very close to being an ipod killer, but they didn't go the extra step, and threw it onto the market prematurely without plans to bring it up to code. So let's face it, sandisk is a hardware company, nothing else.  The radio is none too good.  instead of using the earphone cord as antenna, it uses the usb connect to the laptop cord as a pigtail  i.e., useless.  there's much more to say, and I'll add to this as I get time.  You can buy mine cheaply on ebay, as I am going to buy a different mp3 player (any suggestions?)

<Title>Couln't ask for a better little gadget
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is really a nice MP3 for the money.  I like the fact that it was easy to use right out of the box.  I am not a computer savvy person, so I consider the ease of use for this thing a plus.  It has plenty of space and the screen is pretty good for a tiny screen.  I like the fact that it has plenty of options like equalizer, recording from radio or voice.  The shuffle within genre is very nice as well.  Sound quality is pretty good, but I did notice a little hissing.  I don't think it's due to this player though because the same hissing happened with me Creative Vision M (also a very nice MP3 but costs twice as much).  The size fits very nicely into the hand.  People have complained that the wheel on the player feels cheap.  Doesn't bother me in the least.  I have very small hands so maybe that is what they are feeling.  I can't really think of anything that really irks nme about this player.  I like it even more than my Vision M.  Too bad I didn't know about this first or I wouldn't have bought the Vision M.  You won't be sorry.

<Content>I have to say I was very pleased with the ease of interfacing and manuevering. Have to say I did have a DOA, but Amazon was very fast and courteous about advance replacement and making me happy so I really have no complaints there. I have found that the output level isn't all that great when you connect up to an FM transmitter for your car, but as for headphone volume it kicks butt.   I can't believe that I am half way full on storage, I didn't think the external drive would be of concern but now finding that it might be a Godsend now. Sandisk did a good job in the navigation so if you get lost you shouldn't be using anything more technical than a calculator. :).....j/k

<Title>First MP3 player I ever owned and not disappointed
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.  Like many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.  I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it).   It came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.  As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.    I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.  It came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.    I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.  Overall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod.

It has 4gb of storage so an entire 3day convention fits if your careful. I stopped it after each part so it would make a seperate file for each. A couple of things I noticed that are not as positive, one the controls are kinda tricky to use, two you have to be careful not to leave it turned on. I kept finding its battery dead. Since I realized I was leaving it on now the battery life is fine. This is a very good alt to an Ipod. (I have both)

<Title>Not very user friendly
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted an MP3 player that was easy to use as I am lacking some of the sophicated skills required for some of the newer electronic gadgets.  This Sandisk MP3 player did not want to help me connect and navigate my Vista system.  I called the company and they were useless and the suggestions offered did not answer my questions.  A subsequent e-mail only sent me to a discussion group that didn't even address my concern about compatability between the MP3 player and Vista.  Nowhere in the instructions were there any references to Vista.  I ended up sending the player to my grandson for Christmas and with his Windows XP he was able  to use it.  I can't be the only user out there with a Vista system and this player.  Hopefully the company will address this problem and be able to offer valid responses and or "fixes" to the questions of their customer's that recieved this product for Christmas.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player....welcome to the 21st century, right?  I was very happy with the ease of loading and using this device.  I did some research and asking around about MP3 players before purchasing this one and everything led me to the Sansa.  Big points that were pointed out to me were the rotating thumb wheel, the ability to add memory (although I haven't filled it yet, I do wish I would have started with the 8GB so I would have more total capacity in the future), the ability to use WMA files wich can be compressed smaller with less loss of quality than MP3, the large screen for scrolling through files, and mainly the flash memory.  It was pointed out to me by some very computer savy reletives and friends that even though you can get higher storage capacity with the hard drive based players such as I-pod, they are a mechanical form of processor with a higher probability of failure than the flash based.  All and all, I really like this little player and if the people I've talked to are right, it should last a long time.  Only fault is the lack of accesories available compared to the I-pod.  Hopefully will be coming in time.

<Title>Just what I'm looking for!
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Oh wow! I love my Sandisk Sansa! I've had my mp3 for more than a year now. I've been very impressed with it. It has had a few freezing problems but when I turned it back off and on it was fine. This device holds over a 1000 songs and gives me plenty of space for songs. I'll explain below:  1) Features on this device include music, voice recording, FM radio, and pictures. Rhapsody, Urge, or Windows Media Player can be used. Just drag and drop the songs. Holds over 1000 mp3 songs and 2000 WMA songs. You also have the option to take the CD covers and to put them on the device. I've read that movies, music videos, and TV shows can be put onto the player.  2) Sound. I can't even describe how wonderful the sound is! The sound is very crystal clear! Easy to hear! The two optional settings are Normal and High.   3) Charging. The device comes with a charger that connects to the bottom of the mp3 player to a computer hook-up. It usually takes a common 2-3 hours to charge. Depends how much time has been used on the battery.   4) Buttons. The wheel on the mp3 player can be difficult at times. Sometimes it turns in the wrong direction sometimes. There is a fast-forward and rewind button....easy to use. There is also a menu/on/off button. Just press the menu button to return back to the main  menu. Hold the menu button to turn off the device.   5) Accessories. Unfortunately, the Sansa does not come with a travel case or screen protectors. I had to get those myself with my own money. I got a travel case from [...] that cost $[...]. Which included a 2 screen protectors, the case, a cloth to clean my screen, a leather case to put over my mp3 player.....and I can't think of what else. I didn't take the leather case, instead, I got a silicon gray case. Very happy with it...it protects better then the leather one.   Pros:  Small, very sleek, pocket sized. Pure-quality sound Excellent color Easy-to-click buttons Rhapsody A good amount of accessories   Cons:  Screen freezes  The wheel No wall/car charger  Overall, very happy  with the device!! 5 out of 5 stars! A definite must get!!!!!!

<Title>Good MP3 player, but needs some tweaking to be great
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased the E260 on Amazon, and I am relatively happy with the purchase.  The E260 is a nice music and FM radio player, has good sound, and has a decent user interface.  I find it easier to use than the Creative Micro that I used to have.  I do not have problems with the buttons (and I have large fingers), and I find the movable wheel very useful.  The touch sensitive bar on the Creative was too sensitive and difficult to operate.  My major use of a MP3 player is during commuting to work.  I listen to the radio above ground and to podcasts and music below ground in the subway.  The E260 is great for both functions -- the FM radio reception is actually quite good, better than my Creative Micro and an older RCA Lyra.  The reason that I gave it 4 stars is because the software on the player is missing some functionalities that SanDisk should fix in future Firmware upgrades.  First, it would be nice to return back to the song that you had been listening to before you switch to FM.  The player requires you to go back through the menu steps to find the song again.  It does save what you had chosen before, so all you have to do is press select over and over again.  If it remembers these choices, it would seem a logical step to put you back at the actual song again without the menu steps?  Second, the player is missing a bookmark capability.  This is a big issue if you want to use the player to listen to audio books.  Third, the fast forward only steps forward by 5 seconds or so each push of the fast forward or if you hold it down longer.  The Creative Micro accelerates the speed of the fast forward the longer you hold down the button.  A similar functionality would be nice.  Otherwise, it takes too much effort to advance to where you are in a long podcast or long audio book.

<Title>This players meets all my needs
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using my Sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures. I have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently. -use MTP music files because they use less file space. -adjust the file size on pictures to use less memory. -use the Speck toughskin case to protect display window (extra). -use the AC Sandisk USB charger instead of the computer USB port(extra). I do not use the raio or the video settings because of no interest, and the large amount of memory the video consummes. This player does fine using the earphones or hooked up to a audio center.  I think that the 2MG card will be on my list of upgrades.  The only upgrade I am made was to buy a better set of earphones. I did not like the pair supplied with the unit. My earphones have a volume control on the output cord which makes it much easier to control.  I am not sorry about buying this item from Amazon.

<Title>Sansa vs. ipod nano
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This review will compare the Sansa to my Ipod Nano.   1. The Sansa is a plug-n-play USB drive. Simply plug up and drag files onto your player.  The ipod can only be loaded through I-tunes (Apples specific software for IBM compatible machines). I really dislike the I-tunes software. It is clumsy and not very user friendly. It does not have the look, feel, functionality of your typical windows or MS Office type applications.  2. The Sansa cost was much less than my ipod Nano while offering greater functionality (movies, pictures, and 4 GB's not including the expansion card option). 3. The ipod Nano has superior sound quality. No question.  4. The Ipod standard headphones are a higher quality. Not only the sound, but the construction. The headphone wire is much thicker and they generally feel more rugged.  5. The Sansa holds more than music. Pictures, FM radio, movie clips. The Ipod Nano is only a music player.  I realize that Ipod has other models that do more, but the price tag also increases. 6. Ipod converts files to a .AAC format. No, you can not share music files without the conversion done with itunes.  7. Lastly, Ipod has superior accessories. They have hundreds of options for cases, mounting fixtures, color skins, etc.  Sansa has limited accessories.   Based on this review, I hope you can choose the best one for you. Personally, all things considered, the Sansa was the best choice for me. I am use to the windows style file system and really like features for the cost. People really into accessories would probably prefer Ipod.

<Title>Cheaper (and better) option to the Nano
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned a 3rd generation iPod for quite a few years now and decided it was time to upgrade to something newer. The iPod Nano was one of my top choices, but then I found this item and decided to give it a try. It offered much more features (FM radio, voice recording, video, photos) for a lower price. The negative reviews and stories of it breaking soon after purchase made me wary, but I hoped they were just rare occurrences and got one anyways.  1)Music One of the great features of the Sansa is that it allows you to drag and drop music files right into the drive in MSC mode and it'll find and play it after a restart. No need for iTunes or any other complicated jukebox program. If you would rather use a music program, it can be set to sync with a Windows Media Player library in MTP mode. I did notice that the only way to put user made playlists on the Sansa is to use Media Player and select a pre-made playlist in the sync options.  When browsing through music, the typical options of searching through albums, artists, genre, or songs are available. One problem I found was that browsing through songs in a playlist slightly lags compared to browsing through other options. I like organizing my music in playlists so this bothered me.  While listening, the repeat, shuffle, and equalizer options are only a few clicks away. One problem, however, is that you can't scroll to any place in the song. The available options are pause, skip, fast forward, and rewind. Similarly to the iPod, the scroll wheel becomes the volume control. The difference is that the Sansa resets the volume to 50 every time you turn off the player. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that, but hopefully it'll be fixed in a future firmware update.  As for music quality, I was quite impressed with the sound. My music sounded as good if not better than my 3G iPod. For the record, all of my music is in mp3 format of 192 to 320kbps. The included earbuds are okay, I'm not a big fan of earbuds.  2)Radio The FM radio is a nice feature to have when you're tired with your music and want to hear something fresh. Reception from the Sansa isn't the best, but some stations still sound good if they have a strong signal. The player allows you to create your own presets or it can browse and make some for you. The ability to record radio is a nice addition for those times you want to remember a song you don't know the name to.  3)Video Watching video on a 1.8" screen might seem pointless, but I very surprised by the quality of video the Sansa produced. I first tried converting a seven minute, DivX encoded music video using the Sansa Media Converter, but the program crashed when loading the file. To remedy this, I first converted the file to MOV using a free encoder then used the Sansa program on the MOV file. The result was a 416x304 DivX file (131mb) to a 160x208 QuickTime movie (118mb). The final file is quite large considering it's about half in resolution and frames per second (29.97 to 15fps) as the original. Nonetheless, the video looked and sounded perfect compared to the original (just quite small). Being able to carry videos with you to watch whenever you want is certainly a cool factor. As with music, one grievance is the inability to scroll to any point in the video. The only controls available during playback are fast forward, rewind, pause, skip, and volume control.  4)Photos The Media Converter can handle most picture formats and convert them to something friendly with the Sansa. I haven't tried adding photos of my own, but the sample photos look nice.  5)Voice Recording I tested the voice recording feature during lecture in one of my classes. I sat in the 9th row and the professor was using a mic. However, her voice still sounded muffled in the recording. The recorder does seem to be able to record voices at a close distance fairly well. Another drawback is that the output file is in 16bit wave format. Voice recording is a nice feature, but you shouldn't expect too much from it.  6)Style The Sansa looks great, even better than the black iPod Nano in my opinion. The mechanical scroll wheel does feel a bit cheap, but I guess I'm just used to using the electrostatic touchpad of an iPod. The buttons are small if you have large hands and they are somewhat hard to press. I have to sometimes use the tip of my nails to press down. It would have been nice if the buttons were raised slightly higher, but it might ruin the Sansa's sleek look. The included pouch looks nice with the player and is certainly better than getting nothing. There is also an included lanyard that can be attached to the player. Finally, the screen is very bright and its colors vivid, even on the lowest brightness settings. Videos and photos look quite good on it despite the screen size.  7)Other Notes I was able to get about 15 hours of use from my initial charge. It's less than the advertised amount, but came fairly close. Charging the battery does seem to be a bit of a hassle since it must be connected to a computer via USB. It would have been nice if they just included an adapter to let you charge with a wall outlet. Finally, more memory can be added with microSD cards, which is a cheaper alternative to upgrading to a model with more capacity.  Overall, the Sansa is a great audio player with some nice features. There may be some bugs, but hopefully some of them can be fixed in future firmware updates. It may not have the fame of an iPod, but sells itself through its looks and functionality.  PRO: Price (cheaper than iPod Nano for same amount of storage) Extras (FM radio, video, photo, voice recording) Drag and drop to add files Looks great More memory can be added  CONS: Hard to press buttons Lag when browsing playlist No included wall charger Volume resets to 50 every time it's turned off

<Title>A terrific value for a very high tech device
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this the day after Thanksgiving for only $129. A terrific value for a 4 gig player. Even though I have an ipod nano and a video ipod, I wanted to get this as it has something I've been wanting for a long time - an FM player. This player is about twice as thick, a little wider and a little shorter than the nano 2G. Here's my breakdown of the sansa:  PROS: Durable Shiny, hard to scratch plastic front larger screen than the ipod photo capable album art capable FM radio FM radio recorder voice recorder MP3 player Rhapsody channels (from best buy) Great battery life looks great produced by a reputable company - SANDISK  CONS: tiny buttons  thicker than an ipod nano screen isn't all that sharp scroll wheel can get tiring no contacts or other info can be stored FM radio doesn't have the digital info displayed such as song and name like the ZUNE does software not nearly as good or easy to use as itunes  All in all a terrific value for a capable player.

<Title>DO NOT buy an Ipod, this is much better!!
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First let me get my Ipod bashing out of the way.  The 4GB Ipod Nano that The Sansa e260 competes with costs $230.  That should be enough of a reason to buy this amazing player for nearly half that amount (I paid $130).    My second biggest gripe with the Ipod is the batteries.  They are not user-servicable, and in a couple of years when they die (as they all do) you will have to ship your Nano to Apple and pay them to replace it.  The Sansa has a user replaceable battery kit for around $13.  Also, the Nano doesn't play video.  The Sansa e200 series will convert and play many different kinds of video files.  I just loaded 2 full length features and a full season of my favorite TV show and still had enough room fo about 15 CDs.  That should be enough to keep me distracted on a long road trip i have planned.  Lastly, if you have an Ipod, you have to use iTunes to load your music.  Personally, i hate to be forced into using proprietary software in order to use a device.  The Sansa lets you drag and drop files directly onto the device in Windows explorer.  You have the option to use Windows Media Player if you want to set up Playlists, etc.  Other features that the Sansa has that the Ipod doesn't even offer are the radio tuner with 25 presets and autoscan (which works perfectly), a voice and radio recorder (great for important meetings or just a grocery list).  There are a couple of small cons with the Sansa e200 players.  The wheel is mechanical and isn't sealed well, and I can see it eventually getting lint, dust, etc. in it if you don't buy a separate case.  I have not had this problem, I just see this as a possible future problem.    Also, you can't use the device while it is plugged in to your computer.  You can, however, use the device while it is plugged into an AC or car adaptor, so you can simply buy a cheap multi-adapter (with both a car and AC plug) and problem solved.    Even if you purchase the most expensive case and plug adapter on the market, you will still end up spending much less than you would have spent on a Nano.  In conclusion, if you like to throw money away on expensive players with virtually no features, by all means, get the Nano.  If you are a conscientious shopper who would rather have a player loaded with features and $100 in your pocket, go with the Sansa.

<Title>storage capability is misleading
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got this and am very excited about using it for video and photos as well as music. However, the print on the box saying "4G = 1000 songs" is quite misleading. I was able to put only about 300 songs on it in MP3 format, after deleting the couple hundred songs that came preloaded. There is a folder named "System" containing 1.4 Gigs of stuff, which I'm not sure is essential or not. I haven't found anything on SanDisk's support website about this folder. Anyway, 4G actually = 300 songs, so buy the Sansa with the most space you can afford. Especially since the price increase for a model with 2G more space is less than the price of a 2G SD drive.

<Title>Good Choice for Price
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this because I needed something to hold enough music to keep me occupied on a long flight.  I managed to actually see a few different players before I bought this one, and it is probably the best choice for both the price range and capacity.  Whats Good: - Can play music & video and store photo images - Has FM radio but then who cares? - Good battery life - Expansion card slot - Nice price  Whats Not So Good: - Need to convert photo and video using Sansa S/W (bundled) - The USB dock connector seems to be propritary - They don't include an AC adapter in the package - Can't find any customizable EQ features  As always there will be some improvements that can be made, but then the same thing can be said for more expensive players too.  Is the sound quality the best on the market?  I doubt it, but I think for the price you really can't go wrong with it.  Spend the time sorting out your music play lists first before you start moving music over.  I didn't and discovered that everything just went into one large folder so I had to start over.  Play lists make sense, so it's worth spending the time to figure out what works for you beforehand.  I have probably 500 songs and I have used half of the stated storage capacity which is about where I should be based on the product specifications.    This would also be a great choice for general use (to and from the office) or maybe working out at the gym.    If you had planned to spend around $130.00 (at the time of this review) then it's a great choice.    Maybe you won't look as cool as the guy with the iPod, but then look at what he paid for a 4GB player.  Get it.

<Title>Love it!  Easy to use!
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My e260 is so easy to use.  I still have problems using my son's RCA Lycra after a year of using it, and with the Sansa e260 I was up and running right away.  It is very intuitive.  It holds huge amts of music.  I have put pictures on it.  I have put a personal video on it, but it did not have sound.  The MPG format is not supported, so I can't complain.  I put a full length DVD movie on it without any problem.  I really wanted a built-in radio, which this unit has.  The battery lasts a long time before needing to recharge.  I highly recommend this mp3 player.

<Title>A excellent mp3 player!!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my second purchase of an mp3 player by Sandisk. Initially, the sound quality is mediocre, however, all this changes dramatically for the better once the firmware update is downloaded into the mp3 player. The firmware update transforms this little lamb of an mp3 into a mega sound monster! In order to get an adjustable custom EQ, you must use the firmware update on sandisk's website.This update allows you to personalize your sound preference through the player. The sound is excellent (with firmware update).If you're an audiophile, this is the choice. The only drawbacks are the awkward positioning of the control buttons, the lack of an ac charger and case as well as the functionality of the buttons. In order to use the photo and video features, you must use the proprietary software that's provided in the box. Otherwise, this is an excellent player!  PROS:  -Excellent sound (with firmaware update) -Decent picture and video display -Excellent battery life -Expandable memory  CONS: -Awkward control positions--hard to reach buttons -Mediocre sounding FM radio -No ac charger -No case -Cheap "tinny" sounding earbuds (Sound improves dramatically with better headphones) -Has a tendency to freeze up once in a while (Hold down power button for 15 seconds  when this occurs)  Overall, the Sansa E200 series is an audiophile's dream!!!

<Title>review from a teenager
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i had been lookin for a long while for an ipod. but after doin research i realized how much more expensive they r. i decided to find an mp3. and i came across this one and was blown away.   its a pretty good price for all it offers. i hav around 200 songs now on it and i still hav plenty more room for music. i also hav from 5-10 music videos on it. the radio isnt the best but still its pretty good. and i noticed on my old mp3 it only allowed up to 1 minute of recordin but on this one the recordin time goes on forever. i duno when it stops but i havent recorded long enough yet for it to tell me that its full time. oh and the hearin is pretty good.  now the bad things bout this. i hav a huge purse and i put it in there and i took it outa there one day and the screen had a huge crack down the middle. the screen is very sensitive so b careful if u purchase. also in the sunlight u cant c the screen at all. its pretty much a mirror. also the big button in the middle is pretty sensitive too. sumtimes when i press it, it doesnt function. but that rarely happens and honestly its live-able. the earphones it came with sucked. i never liked ear buds kuz they hurt my ears but for ppl who do i guess they're alright.  overall it was one of the best purchases i hav made. music is my biggest passion and this device has deff let me live it.

<Title>Amazing MP3 player
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I absolutely love this mp3 player. I bring it with me everywhere! It is not only cheaper than an iPod, but it has better features. I'm mostly just interested in playing music all day, but having some videos to watch on this player is a lovely bonus. The Sansa Media Converter (which comes with the product) will convert supported video files to a specific file type for the mp3 player. The only thing is, once the files are converted, the file size is still the same or slightly bigger (which I find odd, since I thought they are supposed to be smaller in dimension). The time it takes to convert isn't long either--a few minutes for a video file nearly 200 MB on the computer. The videos on the mp3 player are crispy clear too.  Physically, the Sansa is a small, attractive-looking device. It's lightweight and has an anti-scratch back. The wheel does feel "cheap," but does that really affect anything? The buttons are feel fine and work too; I don't understand the complaints about them. I accidentally dropped this the day I received it (whoops), but nothing happened. I haven't dropped it since, so I'm not sure how durable it is (feels as if it is, though).  The package also comes with a velvet case, earphones, and software. I do wish it is possible to use the mp3 player with the case on, but maybe there will be better accessories in the future. In the mean time, avoid using the earphones the package comes with--you will hear better audio quality with different ones.   Like the package says, simply drag and drop files from your computer into the mp3 player's folder (plug the player into your computer via USB to open the folder). No iTunes or extra software needed to transfer these files.   This handy dandy Sansa is not only a music and video player, but it also stores pictures for slideshows, has an FM radio, and is also a voice recorder. I don't think there are any other products out in the market with the same features...

<Title>Warning: Don't buy this
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So, I got the sansa for Christmas and was soo excited about it. My choices were between an ipod or this and i picked the sansa because you seemed to get more for your money. I did research and read fellow costumer reviews that told about their player freezing up. But I just brushed that off and figured it wouldnt happen to me. Well, I was WRONG. 3 days 9today) after I got it I was listening to it and it suddenly just froze up. It's still frozen, 4 hours later. I cant get it to do anything, even shut off.  Even if it starts working again Im returning it. The buttons are hard to manage too. Im getting a refund and getting an Ipod.  Final conclusion....DONT GET IT!

<Title>First mp3 player....
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Only had my e260r since 12/25. I'm fairly new to the whole MP3 generation, but I am quite handy w/electronic devices, and pretty computer saavy. My wife got this for me for X-MAS. I simply indicated I wanted an MP3 and this is what she got. Its primary use is for the GYM, shopping,and awkward "waiting" moments. I also am a recording artist(in my spare time) and wanted to carry around all my music minus all the "cd's" (I'd have to have my friends come out to the car to hear my new songs!!, or bring the CD's where ever I go.) Anyway, wifey did quite a bit of research and did alot of comparing different products, and ended up w/this.  Frankly, she doesnt know a thing about iPODs, or MP3 players, but after getting some bestbuy tech help, and advice , she did pretty well.  Overall, I am somewhat impressed. I've toyed w/friend iPODs, etc...before and wasnt overly enthused about theirs.   I've only got to use it a couple of times. I was eager to downlaod "my" songs to it. I initially had to trial and error. I wasnt happy that I had to utilize "their" programs to transfer files. I think all iPODS,MP3's should work universally w/any audio/video/pic file on your pc. USB & GO! Not quite that easy. SO, Once downloading their musicstore/media programs ie. firmware(that comes with it)... the FILE transferring was very quick. It took a little while to figure out initially, but once you've got it, its a breeze.  (Just Click file from any program(iTUNES,WindowsMedia) and drag it to the playlist group you desire.(using their program)Songs Xfr's in about 1.5 secs! I havent done any videos, or pics yet, so no input there.   PROS: Comes w/Tons of music already in it. Plays music, videos, pics/slideshows, FM radio, Recording feature. Screen is crystal clear/vibrant color. Very small/compact!(for me, the smaller the better)Sound is decent.   CONS: DIAL/wheel IS SURPRISINGLY plastic!? & seems flimsy.  It gives it a "cheap" feel.(I was impressed w/the touch sensativity of the "iPOD" wheel and just spinning your finger round the dial(thats was cool),cool isnt always better. Sometimes I'D PRESS TOO HARD OR NOT HARD ENOUGH ON THE the iPOD it would go to far...etc Anyway, It's alot better when its dim and the wheel is lighted up blue. But the wheel seems at first glance a "turn off". It will grow on you in no time. It serves it purpose and no complaints about its effectiveness. So that will go away. ( I like leather not cloth, Air Jordans not reg b-ball sneaks.- point is: I have pricey "taste", so dont let that deter you) Next, Buttons are too small for my liking. I have to press a button sometimes 2-3 times for it to take, Or use the tip of my finger/fingernail! I'm 6'1 w/pretty big hands. The buttons are (as others have said) too low compared to the height of the wheel. Hasnt really FROZEN up on me, but its had minimal use. NEXT, I've read that you cannot "create" your own "playlist" but I've yet to really research it. I just add songs to a pre-determined playlist on it and delete any songs I dont desire. Not sure if any MP3's can do this, but you cannot delete songs manually using the player. It has to be done using the computer program. (At least I think so) womp-womp. NEXT, Doesnt come w/AC adapter!?!?!? What if i have no access to a computer(traveling) etc?? earphones are OK, but seem to be a bit wide to fit inside my ear?  OVERALL: I've still gotta invest some more hours into it before giving it my best opinion.(havent tried video OR pics yet) For now.. It's GERAT! Not too complicated to use. Many great features. Great SCREEN QUALITY.  Good memory, and able to install more!. I like it and am satisfied w/it. Just that darn wheel seems so "cheap"(NOT A BIGGY) Hope this helps.. --- I've READ MANY REVIEWS and ALOT OF THEM HELPED ME!!  PEACE!

<Title>So far I am much impressed
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off I got this for my daughter(13) who really wanted a Nano. I being one of the geeky parents knew the Sansa was a much better deal with the fm radio and the video. I got 4 gb for the price of a 2 gb Nano as well. I love the ability to drag and drop music onto the Sansa. I'm not a big fan of syncing since I have way too much music on my pc to sync. The video conversion worked great as well with the included software. The picture is small(I prefer my psp for movies and videos) but looks very sharp. Let us not forget the ability to change the battery yourself. A big factor in my book. I'm sure she will pwn all the nano kids. Be a leader not a follower. Go with the better product not the hype and trendy.

<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Lots of features for around $[...]. 4gb of storage plus all the features, makes this a great player! Did I mention the price?  Pros: Drag and drop MP3 file support. NO PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE conversion. This was an important feature. Music sounds great!  FM Radio  Video. The video is surprisingly very clear. Looks great!!  User replaceable battery. Also important.  Audio Books do work!  Cons: Video and Picture file support....PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. Thought I'd dodged a bullet. With the supported features, this is really a multi-media player. IE a jpg is a jpg. It shouldn't need 'conversion'.  Buttons small, and too close to raised wheel. I have large hands/fingers.  Proprietary Charger. Should be standard mini-usb.  We purchased this on 12/26/06 for my wife. It's been a fantastic player, and she really enjoys listening to audio books with it. Works great with MP11 which is faster and easier than my previous ver. of Music Match.

<Title>Not too bad
<Date>Sat Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this since August. It works pretty well. The sound is clean, it's easy to manage the directory, and so on. But right off I had a problem using various media players to manage its content and playlists, and fell back on using its "I'm a USB drive" mode to transfer content (which also involved finding the hidden Music folder). Then, about a month ago, it began to crash on me. It was rare at first, but now it crashes mid-song several times a day. The only way to fix it is to yank the back panel and pull the battery. Its physical durability is pretty decent. I have a very rough lifestyle, and everything I carry gets dropped, scratched, or battered at some point, not to mention exposure to dust and extreme temperatures. Aside from a crack in the screen and some paint on the back panel, and the aforementioned crashing problem, it still functions.

<Title>Better for the price.
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item is better for the price that the comparible ipod. For me the slightly larger physical size is an advantage. plus some accessories that are available for this player aren't available with ipods or zunes. I like the fact that you can upgrade the player online and it has an easily replaceable battery. The cost of the battery is very reasonable. The playing time on the battery is phenomenal- mine has been averaging about 22 to 24 hours on a single charge. We have 5 e series players in our household now. We all agree that for the money, it is the best player on the market. There are lots of places to improve- a better EQ, louder standard sound, and for the size- a speaker phone, a couple more menus, just to name a few. But overall we're very, very satisfied with our purchases. Oh yeah, I almost forgot the sd expansion slot so you can improve the size of storage capacity. All software needed is provided too.

<Title>expandibility is a plus
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the 2 MB version of this unit for a year and recently bought my son this one. The reason that I love it so much is the expandibility factor. You can easily add a Micro SD disk in it and immediately have another batch of songs added. This is great when I put my holiday music on the extra chip and only play that during the holiday season. I also love the shuffle feature and that you can create lists from the WMP and move the lists over to it. Put your faves in a list and only play them if you so desire. You can also buy a car adapter that works through the car adapter and radio. When it is plugged in, it charges the Sansa as it is playing. I believe the adapter is by Griffin. (It does have a numeric display of the radio stations and you have to put the car on the same station.)

<Title>It started off good...
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first got my Rhapsody account I thought it would be great to have an mp3 player that would be compatible with the software.  When I learned of the Sansa Rhapsody, I was elated.  I bought the player and it was pretty impressive.  It's thicker than the ipods of course, but it still had a very small shape.  The screen was amazingly crisp and clear (still too small to watch a movie on for long periods of time, though).  It also comes pre-loaded with about 4 hours of decent music.  The navigation was fairly straight forward and analogous to that of ipods, so it didn't take long to adapt.  Battery life was pretty good too if you cut down how long the backlight stayed on (probably 10-12 of audio hours on a charge).  I started to become disappointed with the player though, about 6 months after I owned it.  The player would randomly freeze and I would have to hold the power button for 15 seconds to get it to shut down.  The player would also randomly turn itself off for no reason at all which was really annoying when I was working out.  I also didn't like the factory programmed EQs, or the custom EQ: They just didn't make the music sound quite the way I wanted it to.  Oh, and the sansa took about 15-20 seconds to boot up, which seemed like forever when you just wanted some quick tunes.  All in all it is a decent player.  I will never buy one again due to the fact that mine will no longer power up or connect to my computer after about 10 months of use.  It is, however, a low cost alternative to the iriver clix Rhapsody.  So if you want a less expensive mp3 player that works (for the most part) with Rhapsody, go with the Sansa.

<Title>Excellent. Very Satisfied
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa is a great mp3 player.  I've got over a thousand songs and 1 GB still left.  I just plugged it into my computer and it Windows Media Player helped my sync my music to it like I was burning a CD.  I can't figure out how to delete music from the player though.   That's really frustrating.  Just be careful what you put on it because you may not be able to get it off.

<Title>Sansa e260 4GB
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The price was very good comparatively and delivery was exceptional. The player itself seems to do what it's described to do based on limited play time this Christmas morning. The default "auto-sync" feature can cause you to waste much time if you are not very careful when first hooking it up to your computer. In short, DON'T allow it to sync with your computer or it will upload everything in your Windows Media Player library.

<Title>Impressed with Sandisk, Impressed with Amazon
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On Amazon: I've been a proud owner of a Sansa e260 for two days.  I'd like to commend Amazon on their punctuality - I ordered this on December 22, 2006 with the free super savers shipping and received it on December 27, 2006.  I was quite amazed at how quickly it came - perhaps this was a one time thing - but it was still impressive.  On the Sansa Design: Now on to the Sansa.  It's a very pretty little gadget, I do like the rounded shape and glossy black surface, along with the glowing blue tactile scroll wheel - for some reason that's listed as a con on CNet, but I'm quite fond of it, in comparison to Apple's clickwheel.  I like the way you can feel it moving and you don't have to do some maneuvering like Apple's to try and get the highlighter on the right song.  Nice, bright screen, though like most said the buttons are a little difficult to press.   While it's nice and scratch resistant, the back collects fingerprints like crazy.    Song Syncing: I'm not what you would call tech-savvy, so I did have some trouble figuring it out in the beginning.  The actual song-moving was quite simple, as long as your tags are in place and correct, but for the life of me I could not understand the whole album art thing.  Thanks to a forum called Anything But iPod, I was soon up and running again.  For anyone who's having trouble who happens to read this - use MSC mode, and look up help on the forum mentioned.  It'll save you some frustration.  Once you know how to do it though, it's a cinch.  If you're too busy to spend a little time, though, you might want to go with something a little simpler - it won't be as pretty, but hey, functionality over looks, right?  Oh, and you should probably make sure all your information's right before syncing to the player; for some reason when I try to edit stuff it doesn't show - no big deal, maybe there'll be a firmware update for that later.  Either that, or I'm not doing something right.  Videos: They're pretty simple, all you have to do is convert your video in the media converter.  If it's a DVD, it has to be decrypted before you can convert it, as usual.  The only problem I found with this is that the Media converter takes FOREVER.  It took me an hour to convert about 300MB of video.  I don't know if that's the usual time, but I was getting bored.    The quality looks good to me, again, I'm not a techy person or an audiophile so you might not want to take my word for it.  Also, I couldn't figure out a way to fast forward through parts of the video efficiently, but it's not really much of a problem for me, as my videos aren't that long.  My Biggest Problem: When I changed the USB mode to MSC and opened up Explore to try and find the music files to edit/delete, I found that that they were mysteriously absent.  Turns out the files were hidden.  If you change the settings so that you can see hidden files, you'll be fine. :)  The Bottom Line: Now, the Sansa's not as bad as I've probably made it out to be, I'm in love with it, but I've been concentrating on my problems with it so hopefully others won't have the same.  One gets used to the controls after awhile and it hasn't frozen up on me yet.  From reading most of the bad reviews on this Sansa, most of the problems describe sound like the reviewer didn't update their firmware, was rather clumsy, and/or didn't bother spending the time to work it out.  Read the instruction manual!  It HELPS.  Have fun!

IPod quick.My wife and daughter have the 2 gb player,great deal.I will be buying this 4gb soon for myself.Just one thing if like me you want to carry pictures i think a 4gb is better,but with a expansion slot you will have more flexablity the slot will only take 2gb micro sd cards but nice to have.

<Title>Beats iPOD hands down...
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 4gb Sansa for my wife as a Christmas gift. It's a really neat video player. I think its a lot better deal than the iPod, plus its cost makes it a "no brainer"... My friend has the Apple product (iPOD) and honestly, this player displays better picture quality than his. He paid almost $100 more too!  The video picture quality is amazing, and the sound quality is no different. It charges via the PC's USB port, or you can buy a ac adapter (like I did) so any wall outlet will charge it. New videos and music can be added using drag & drop thru Windows Explorer.   Great Job SanDisk!!!

<Title>Very nice & easy to use item
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a slick little item that will store around 500, high quality MP3/WMA files.  It is straight forward to use - just sync it up with Windows Media player and you are all set to go.  the battery last a really long time.  I can play for 12+ hours on a single charge.  We do a lot of road trips and use this as our on board player.  It is a well made, rugged player and the screen has great resolution.  The wheel is a bit small as are the buttons, but I can certainly live with it.  The only down side is that Windows Media player can be a bit clunky with copy-protected songs.  I have stopped using downloaded files altogether as half the time they will not sync up with this unit.  This is not a design flaw of SanDisk's but rather a Windows issue in my opinion. I would give this 5 stars if it had its own software management system that was better than Windows Media player, but it does not.

<Title>Got this for my technophobic fiance, and she's loved it
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are some very minor downsides to this device, for most users: Not good for Mac users (the video-conversion utility is Windows only), it has a proprietary connector, and doesn't have the extra hard-coded Rhapsody support (I suggest getting the "Rhapsody" version of the same player). But overall, this has been a really pleasant surprise: Great battery life, very intuitive controls, great size, just a really pleasant experience all around. And fantastic price point compared to a Nano. Go for it.

<Title>Decent Product / Horrible Customer Support
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently decided to purchase this player over those offered by Apple for the added features and freedom of file transfers...  However, in three weeks time the player broke and customer support did nothing for me...no offer to repair or replace the product.  A friend of mine has had an I-pod Nano for some time, and the Nano broke on two separate occasions in a similar fashion as mine, and Apple replaced the player, no questions asked.    I never thought to consider the company and their customer support when buying something like this, but hind sight is 20/20.  I urge you to consider this if you plan on purchasing this product.

<Title>finally a formidable opponent to IPOD
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>sandisk is off to a great start with the sansa e260.  i actually have the e260r with built-in rhapsody support.    i have had a lot of experience with sandisk/rhapsody customer support and have explored a lot of the technical aspects of this device.    there are so many methods to transfer music to this mp3 player.  you can do it right from windows explorer or use any of the several file sync applications like realtime, rhapsody, windows media player, etc.  i have only used rhapsody and windows explorer.  i've actually been looking for an mp3 player that allows me to explore my songs in a directory-like structure.  this is not one of them.  in fact i've given up.  so in light of this, i had to find a different method to organize my songs (besides the id3 tags, not a fan at all of that system).  so i made playlists by artists, and that seems to be working ok.    CONS:   i had some trouble figuring out how transfer video... supporting documentation for this device is absolutely terrible.  even the configuration dialogs are sub-par.    although customer support agents attempted to be helpful, the 3 i spoke to had very thick asian accents and their working knowledge of the product was very limited.  so not only was there a slight language barrier, they couldn't help me with either of my two problems.  somewhere along the line two of my playlists were duplicated (title only).  i think it had something to do with switching from "Plays for sure" and "Rhapsody" modes.  i had to ultimately edit a .toc file and delete some files from a hidden system file on the player.  the buttons surrounding the scroll wheel are too far under the scroll wheel to be pressed with the blunt of my fingers so i have to use my finger nails.  this would be alleviated with either a lowered scroll wheel , enlarged buttons, or buttons that required less pressure to press.  as expected with such an immature product, there isn't a very large array of accessories to choose from.  this is probably just a matter of time.  can't delete playlists from player. (as might only be a problem in the case where playlists were duplicated and the duplicated playlists showed up on the player only; rhapsody showed only one copy)  *****PROS*****  a beautiful graphical interface.  the icons and navigation are very well designed.    F.M. tuner!! i have a speaker set plugged into my laptop and now i can just move the audio plug into my sansa and listen to F.M. while browsing the internet.  and sometimes you just don't want to listen to mp3's.  the reception is as clear as could be and you can set presets and change them with a click of the center button.  another benefit is the recording feature. you can record clips of F.M. broadcasts.  expansion slot!! where is apple with this?! this was a huge selling point with me.  if i ever run out of space, i can purchase one of the several different size microsd flash cards.    FAT file system (USB flash drive-type).  another huge selling point for me.  i like that i can add files through windows explorer.   photo and video support. on a scale of 1-10, i would give the video and photo playback and support a 7.  the video looked great and i personally didn't need a full-featured video player.  but the reproduction is great.  external appearance.  i like the smooth black surface and solid metal scratch-resistant backside.    user changeable rechargeable battery.    it's not an apple. when comparing an IPOD and Sansa there is just no question.  almost every aspect of the Sansa is better.

<Title>Good specs, mediocre implementation
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> I have owned a couple of ipods and this is my first Sandisk mp3 player.  I bought it because:  - FM Tuner - Recording capabilities (records from mic and FM tuner). - Expansion slot - Its priced less than 4GB ipod nano.  Now for weaknesses:  - Controls.  The buttons are small and hard to press.  And I dont even have thick fingers.  The wheel that is the primary interface to the device is made of cheap plastic and does not move smoothly and occasionally gets stuck. - Included headset has a very short cable. - The interface can sometimes be confusing.  But maybe I am too new to the device. - Overall the device has a cheap feel to it and if you have if you have owned any of the recent ipod videos or nanos you'll know that this device is not in the same league.

<Content>I've had the Sansa for almost a year. It's small enough to keep in my purse and tough enough to survive morning runs. If you're looking for an MP3 player that does the job without spending a small fortune, this is a great choice. It's easy to use, easy to charge, has a long battery life, and is tough enough to survive the occasional crash to the floor. I love the understated look and appreciate being able to add MP3s of various fomats. It's just what you need out of an MP3 player; nothing more, nothing less.

<Title>Great bang for any buck
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's small and light, which makes it great for an active user.   The included software works like a charm and drag and drop loading is a snap.  The sound is quite good. I am no audiophile, but I will say that with a decent pair of headphones or ear buds it will come alive with clear highs, solid bass and everything in between. If you are not really happy with the sound there are plenty of EQ presets to satisfy your sound desires.   The screen is pretty good as well. I did not have any intentions to watch videos on it, but now that I have it, I can definitely see myself loading up a few vids to watch on a trip or something. It's more than adequate for podcasts.  The e200 series has some neat features and alot of them are even useful. There are some that are not really needed though. Who wants to record FM radio? But it's there...  On the other hand, the scroll wheel is not the best in the world. Nothing drastic, and you'll get used to it, but it could have been a little better.  Also the screen gets hairline scratches quite easily. They are not all that bad and can't be seen when the screen is on, but Sandisk could have coated it a bit better.  All in all I can whole heartedly recommend the Sansa e200 players. Awesome value for a feature rich, great sounding little player.  Edit: I also wanted to point out that Rockbox works perfectly on this player and even expands on the features and enhances the sound a bit. Though the battery life suffers from using this firmware.

<Title>A Solid alternative to Ipod Nano
<Date>Sat Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is really well thought out. I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking about an Ipod nano. The included software is complete and works flawlessly. Best of all, it will play WMA music files, has an included FM radio, has an expansion slot, and plays home videos. Here's what I've learned so far:     1. MUSIC- You can drag and drop from windows explorer or you can use Windows Media Player 10. Your choice. Either way works great. Note: The installation CD does not include WMP 10 but no big deal.     2. PHOTOS- The included media app on the install CD is a wonder to behold. It couldn't be easier to use and is rock solid stable. Photos shot horizontally are cropped (like widescreen) but photos that are vertical are shown full screen. I am going to experiment on this but haven't had time just yet since I just bought the Sansa.     3. VIDEO- Probably the best feature. The same media app that you use for photos also doubles for videos. Again, unlike some other players that have problems with converting video, this is heaven sent. Just pick out a video and press convert. It converts and then transfers in one step. It works perfectly.     Unlike past Sansa's you have to spend extra for a decent carrying case. Still, if you like felt pouches and lanyards (I Don't), they come included. One minor drawback is that you can only charge using the USB attached to the computer. An AC adapter would have been nice.     One final note. I tried to convert 2 DVD movies that were already on my hard drive. They were in the 550-700mb range. Each time, the video utility started to convert them no problem. However, in each case the utility timed out after 13 minutes 39 seconds. It cancelled the whole thing so not to worry about having 1/2 a movie on your sansa. I am going to fool around with this and see if I can shrink the file size of those 2 movies to around 200-300mb and try again. If I can work around this and am sucessful I'll let you know. Even though trying to watch a feature length movie on a 1.8 inch screen might be a bit much, the screen itself is really crystal clear (better than nano) and TFT not STN. I would highly recommend this player to anyone. Finally, a company that got everything right and it all comes right out of the box.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like my Sansa e260. I purchased it to test it out while the e270 was on backorder and I have been pretty impressed what it can do.   What I like about my Sansa e260: -Audio/photo/video playback is excellent -Small in size but thicker than the iPod Nano (the Nano in my opinion is a tad too thin) -Large screen and good photo/video quality for something its size. It's not top of the line, but my coworkers and I have been impressed with the screen quality. I've watched videos on it with no problem -Nifty blue glowing dial  -Ease of use. Most of it was self explanatory though a "quick guide" was included in the box -Battery life. Even playing videos, I was able to get 10+ hours before the battery was too low.  -Expandable memory (micro SD card, which I will soon purchase) -Comes with conversion software for photos and video  Things I don't like about my Sansa e260: -Lack of accessories. I did have to hunt down my player but if you walk into any store you can see that it is an iPod dominated market. I was only able to find a silicon case for it but hopefully this will change over the next few weeks -Lack of AC charger. Only a USB changer was available as is in the iPod, however I have been unable to locate a OEM or aftermarket AC charger. Hopefully this will change but until then I use a USB/AC adapter -Expandable memory slot will play mp3s only, not photos or video -Attracts finger prints like crazy. Somehow the oils on your finger tips show up on both the black and metal parts of the player. I expected it on the front but not on the liquid metal. -Radio works but doesn't get the best reception on all stations -Conversion software will split large video files into smaller shorter clips (~10 min clips) which results in short pauses as it goes to the next file  Is it the iPod Nano killer? Yes and no. I think it's a wonderful flash player with many features the Nano lacks (but some can be added on) for a comparable price. If you are an avid iPod fan you may not like the tactile wheel. I love the photo and video playback and am impressed with the screen, which is larger than the Nano's. I would suggest finding a vender and testing it out before you purchase it. Although it is thicker than the Nano, it has an impressive battery life even with video playback and the battery is user replacable. I am satified with my Sansa e260 and think it's worth checking out if you're looking for a flash player with many features.

<Content>I've started out with a Sandisk mp3 player and moved through several others, but when I heard about this one it certainly caught my eye.  Not only is it really cool looking, with the blue click-button, but the color screen is also a plus.  The photo and video is fantastic!  There is absolutely no comparison to the iPod nano, this is way better!  The radio gets great frequency strength and the handy dandy record-from-radio option is very convenient.  When putting music on the player, just click and drag or you can use Windows Media Player (like I do) and it automatically puts your songs in alphabetical order, by artists/album/song.  I really can't think of any cons to this excellent player, so I would reccommend getting it here at Amazon or at any Circuit City store when they have a sale. ($200)

<Content>This devise was my 3rd upgrade for a sandisk player.  This was by far my best investment.  I enjoyed my first 2 & pass them to my kids.  The video download is what put this over the top.  It may take a while to download the DVD but when it was done, the picture was outstanding.  The sound is perfect and the size to good.  I like the playlist better than the m200 2g.  Much easier to work.  The dial works great.  Downloading picture was nice to have my family picture in the player and show them off.  The only things I regret is that it does pick up finger prints & dust very very easily.  They don't have a good arm strap or case for it yet (I know one will come), and that I didn't wait and get the 6 gig.  UPDATE:Ok, I have had my Sansa e260 for about 3 months now and I still like it. It was worth it $$. I am reading these cons about this device and please tell me what MP3 player is perfect. I read pros and cons about every MP3 on the market and none of them has gotten a perfect score. Yes it has frozen up when I held the power button too long. But I learned not to hold it for 10-15 seconds. It dont' take much to power on. Is the screen small, yes but when I was waiting in the doctor's office, the Usher video was great to watch and listen to. I also downloaded a Martial Art movie and just to kill some time, it serves it purpose. I purchased a arm band for this device from Best Buy and it was design specifically for this device. So accessories are available from Best Buy, Circuit City, and on Amazon.   So if you are looking for the perfect MP3 Player, give it up, you will never find it. However, if you are looking for something that sounds great, perfect size, and has lots of cool extra's, this Sansa e260 is the one for you. You will not go wrong with this one.   By the way, Sandisk tech support and customer service is great. They replaced my daughter's m200 with no problems and it is now playing great.

<Title>Excellent MP3 player
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK I will admit I am not a huge Apple fan. I was looking for anything but an IPOD. I searched and read reviews for 3 months about all the different players available. A friend bought a Nano for Christmas and I was impressed but like I said I am not an Apple fan.  So finally I had just decided to give in and buy a Nano. I had given up trying to find a better alternative or even one that was close.  But to my surprise I read a last minute review of the SanDisk Sansa e260. It sounded great but would it really compare?  Believe me, it does!!! It offers more than I ever would have guessed. It comes with a built in FM tuner so you don't have extra attachments and costs associated with it. I don't know how much I will use it but it is a nice "free" feature.   The audio player is excellent and has 8 preset EQ's.  The video is great and also the Pics but I bought it primarily as an MP3 player. The screen is amazingly clear and bright. Much better than the Nano. That brings me to the real selling point for me. You can use the included software to manage your music or you can use Windows Media Player but the beautiful this about this player is you can connect to your PC\Laptop as a usb drive. Since I already have about 20 GB of music on my Laptop converted and normalized. All I have to do is drag and drop the music I want to Sansa drive and media folder. The transfer for a standard CD is about 10 seconds. So far I haven't found anything that didn't play on the Sansa.   The other two big selling points for me are a removable\replacable battery and an memory expansion slot. Both are long overdue by other manufacturers.  The Sansa takes a about 4 seconds to load but it isn't an issue for me especially when it help preserve battery life.  This is a great alternative to the IPOD. In someways, it is superior. Battery life (compared with my pals Nano), screen clarity, Expansion slot, USB drive mode, Built in Voice recorder and FM tuner. All this and $50 less than the comparable IPOD Nano.

<Title>ipods can crash, too
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>To those who think this shouldn't crash: ipods crash, too, just like apple's computers.  But i agree, an mp3 should never crash.  it's just slopping programming.  This is what happens when American companies offshore intellectual development and stop using American engineers.

<Title>The best thing since Apple
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did about a months worth of research before actually getting the e260.  It plays video, records, and has a radio.  All qualities that the Nano does not have.  The first time I synched it up with Napster, I had some trouble.  Since then, everything has been working excellent.  Easy music exchanges and downloads.  The screen is bright and easy to read.  Some features such as the preset equilizer is useless.  I think the sound is best at the normal setting.  The video is actually good.  I was able to get an episode of Family Guy on it.  I haven't tried anything else yet.  All in all, very nice product.  I can change the battery on my when (when it fails) and I can increase my memory without buying a new MP3 player (awesome).  My only negative is that I wish I waited a little longer so that I could have bought it cheaper! ;)

<Title>Magnificient mini-music maker machine
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After the initial craze of Ipods had begun to die down a bit, more manufacturers started testing the waters with their own versions. All of my friends owned Ipods, but I decided to do some research before I committed myself to a particular product.  After reading hundreds upon hundreds of reviews (I'm rather picky~), I settled on the Sansa e260.   It was a great decision on my part.    I have had my Sansa for four months now. It is small and light though solid in design.  The light up wheel is wonderful and rather easy to utilize.  The colored screen is very clear and I have no problems reading or navigating through it.  And who can't help but enjoy the amount of memory for the price?  Sansa's also go on sell throughout the year so it's good to keep an eye out for the deals. The music that is produced by this wee music machine is beautiful and truly sounds great.  How such remarkable clarity of sound can emerge from such a tiny contraption is beyond me, but I'm thankful for it! This is, hands down, the best on the market.  There are only a couple gripes from me. I still have yet to find a way to make adequate play lists other than using the "To Go" list for my music.  Also, the Sansa came with those cheapy ear buds (as all the mp3 players unfortunately do).  Since I have sensitive ears, I was getting earaches from using the ear buds and they also kept slipping out of my ears so I went to Circuit City and got a pair of head phones that clipped over my ears.  They were only ten dollars and even have adjustable volume control on them.  No more ear aches and no slipping = wonderful!  On another positive product note, I bought one of those Action Jackets by DLO and it is perfect when I go running.  I always keep my Sansa in the jacket and it is great protection for my little music maker.  The Sansa e260 is wonderful.  After checking the manufacturer's website, I saw that there will be more accessories coming out (hopefully soon).  I can't wait to get a car transmitter for it :-)  5 stars all the way from me and two happy thumbs up.

<Title>Good Sound/Quality
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall, this device is exactly what I wanted in a music player.  The display is superb and the sound is excellent.  The one problem is the provided earbuds.  They do not have very good sound and are a bit uncomfortable. But I think most devices come with inferior earbuds anyway.  The other problem is the controls.  The buttons are often hard to use in that the wheel in the middle used to adjust volume and select items is raised.  This then makes the buttons around it harder to press.  In other words, the wheel is in the way.  If I could, I would actually give this device a 4.5, but because of the limitations in the rankings, I could not do that.  But I cannot give a 5 for this device because of the controls.  But I would tell you to not make this an issue to not buy this device. i feel that it is a very good device with excellent sound, screen, and portability.

I had no problems and get very good FM reception on the player. I had small video clips, photos and MP3s all loaded to the player within an hour of receipt. I am very pleased with the purchase.

<Title>It's just BETTER THAN AN IPOD
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK, I could spend a half an hour reiterating what others have wrote about the Sansa E260, but here's what it boils down to:  It's CHEAPER than the iPod - on average about $50.  It's EASIER TO USE than the iPod - no iTunes, yea!  It has WAY MORE FEATURES than the iPod - big screen, FM radio, voice and radio recorder, expandable memory.  So far I have had no problems with it freezing up, as some of the reviews say it does. Hopefully I'm not speaking too soon. But so far I LOVE IT!

<Title>The perfect portable media player for some, me included.
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa is a nice alternative to the Nano, cheaper, offering video playback and FM Radio. The video converting software is included but don't expect Zune beating quality. The screen is bigger than the Nano's and doesn't look that small if compared to the IPod Video's. A huge drawback is that when you sync using Windows Media Player 11, the album art is not transferred unless you paste the album art manually. A shame since WMP 11 is the only version so far that allows for playlist transfer.   Also, beware of the "Zuney Curse". Right after my brother installed the Zune software in our family PC my Sansa started crashing, and the only way to fix it was to open it, remove the battery and give it a chkdisk to fix the file system errors it had. As long as I plug it only in my room's PC, which has never been connected to the Zune, it won't crash; but recently I decided to try it in the family PC again just to see the same results. Also, right after plugin my brother's Zune to my XBOX 360, the 360 stopped detecting the songs in each of my Sansa's playlists.

<Title>Lots of memory, but not as good as the older model SanDisk SDMX1-1024
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very happy with my SanDisk SDMX1-1024 (1 GB Silver) and hence I bought this new model from Sandisk. I like the 4GB memory and Lithium battery in this player, but there are several aspects that are not so good compared to the older model. Pros: 1. No need to buy batteries or recharge AAA batteries 2. 4GB memory size is very useful 3. Volume control is easier as you can rotate it clock/anticlock wise while holding the player at any angle. 4. The video play capability is nice (I tried to watch a video while working out), although it is not convenient to watch on such a small screen.  Cons: 1. Buttons are hard and not so convenient (SDMX1 had the best controls I have ever seen in audio players). 2. The charger/sync cable is propriatory 3. Cannot select a song based on the folder organization (you could do this in SDMX)

<Title>Great Value
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For such a low price, this is a great alternative to an Ipod.  It plays back music (in MP3 or WMA format) very well, but im not sure about the video or photo features because I only use it for music.  It is very fast and easy to sync the music, and it plays back perfectly.  The big problem with the Sansa is that a lot of the features are unstable/don't work.  Every time I try to rate a song, it crashes and I have to turn it off.  When I try to play songs from a playlist, the list loads very slowly and takes a long time for the song to start.  Sometimes when I go to change the volume, the song will still keep playing, but the screen goes black and stays blank until I turn it off and back on again.  These things can be kind of annoying sometimes, but i think these small problems are worth it for the low price.

<Title>Good alternative to Apple
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple products are too expensive (and price controlled), $100 is plenty to spend on one of these.  The Sansa does a great job for that price.  The FM radio is terrific, and I can hit the record button if I am going to miss something on NPR.  With WMP I have no trouble downloading podcasts I got from ITunes. The sound from the mp3 player is impressive as well.  I don't use the video or picture function as the screen is too small for me.  I would only ask that Sansa include a wall charger, as I am not always with my computer.  I use my Koss porta-pro headphones, they are a good match. To sum it up, a well made useful product at a reasonable price.

<Title>Why I'm glad I didn't get a Nano.....
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I decided to put a few songs he likes along with a video or two on it before I wrapped it up for him. I was expecting it to be an alright MP3 player because of the reviews I had read, but I never expected it to hold a light to any of the Apple's creations.   I took it out of the box expecting to plug it in and need the program on the cd to add music to it... because that is how the other top mp3 players work. Well, it didn't need any program installations. I plugged it into my computer and it was simply drag and drop music from my music folder to the Sansa music folder. I was very impressed with this feature. I did, however, have to install the video converter program (which comes with it) to my computer in order to put videos or pictures on my comp.... BUT this was also a very simple program to use.   The look of the Sansa also impressed me. Though it's a little thicker than a nano, it's still very small... and I love the blue light around the turn wheel. The video has vivid color and looks GREAT~!   I'm very impressed with the FM radio and the voice recorder that it came with as well because I know my boyfriend ALWAYS likes to listen to the Kentucky basketball games and he's not always around a radio (I didn't try either out-- I'm just impressed it has them)... the iPod doesn't have a radio or voice recorder.   I've owned three different music players: the 30gb Ipod Video, the 4gb first gen Ipod Nano, and *currently* the Pioneer Inno which is also an XM player. I never thought I'd say I like an MP3 player better than either of my Ipods. I never thought I'd experience one that could hold a light to either of my ipods but this one does. &for the price... I believe it may actually surpass the new Nanos (though I've not tried out a 3rd gen one).   I hate for this to be a compare/contrast review... but I know what sort of reviews I was looking for whenever I was in the market to buy an MP3 player. In my opinion I think the Sansa is easier to use than the Ipod, has just as good color with the video as the iPod, runs/loads things a little faster than my iPod did, and has more features than the Ipod. I'd love to be able to compare it to the Zune (because that's another one I was considering), but I've never experienced one of those. In comparison with the Ipod... I believe this one should win-- hands down.   The only negative I can see-- so far-- is it's lack of accessories on the market. We all know the Ipod has tons of items we can buy to use with it. Though I did buy an FM modulator for the Sansa... which is really the only accessory I ever use with any MP3 player (and I figure the only one my b/f will ever use). I don't know. I love this little thing and now I kinda wish I would have asked for one of these instead of a new Nano for Christmas...

<Content>I recently purchased this item and once received, I went to work on putting it to the test.  The item is nice and small (and easy to use as well - just make sure you take the time to read the instructions; they're a real help).  Once I got everything under way, it was a snap to load what I wanted into it.  The features are great, and I especially like the built-in FM tuner with recording device...double bonus!  As for the charging, I have noticed some folks complain about it...actually, you don't need a lap top computer...you can just get a plug in charger for it (it's made by Macally and works great - it comes with the UBS cable that connects the mp3 player to the plug).

<Content>It took me years to finally purchase an MP3 player.  Bought my first one at Target (Memorex) which was totally generic.  I took it back and decided to do some research.  Found that the Sansa products work with virtually with all music venues for download, rather than being locked into the Itunes venue as is true with Ipod.  This product is easy to use, ultimate sound, great FM reception, and just looks snazzy (I know an old school term).  I'm extremely satisfied with this product. My 83 year old mother could even turn it on and off, while in the hospital) with little effort.  The relaxing music she listened too, enabled her to get some sleep while recuperating.  I can't say enough about this product - so I'll close for now.

<Content>The player sounds better than my girlfriend's Ipod, (she says it isn't as easy to use as the Ipod but I disagree and actually has many better features) and the SanDisk works with more online services (but it won't work with most of the made for Ipod speaker systems).  The reason I'm writing this is because SanDisk phone support was kind and helpful.  Be careful how you delete tracks, I would recommend deleting tracks manually.. Don't re-format the Player as a way to clear all the music.  SanDisk + Rhapsody is a great combo!

<Content>Technology is advancing everyday, and soon there will be more than just 8gig micro sd chips that will be able to fit in this bad boy. buy a 2 gig or so just to be sure u like it, then wait til prices drop and buy a micro sd chip from 2- 8 gig to increase ur memory! its great! ipod used to have nothing on this pimp, but the ipod video nano came out...touche' ipod...but still, this things got radio too. and in my opinion the scroll wheel is easier to use than ipods cuz u actually turn it one click to go down one space so ur not guessing like on the ipod. this thing rocks, is so much more durable than the nano, and can amount to more memory without buying a whole nother mp3 player. just pop in a 8 gig micro sd card in the micro sd slot in a 6 gig sandisk sansa and BAM!!!...uve made a 14 gig mp3 player!! take that 8 gig nano!

<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sandisk is a decent product, it works well. The only downside is sometimes I turn it on and it wont go on and you must hold the power for fifteen seconds to restart, then start it. (it always works after that)  just a few days ago, my headphone jack went mono(R). I am an audio engineer so i opened it to see maybee it had a solder joint... After I opened it i realised it used a kind of stupid construction on the inside, and fixing the jack was vertualy imposible... it needed replacement perhaps. I also found that the chip and perhaps the whole thing is made in china (says inside) nothing against china, lol, everything is made there, but it describes the quality...

<Title>e260 Mp3 Review
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned my sansa since Christmas, so I guess I can right a fair review on it. First of all, this not going to be a Ipod VS. Sansa review. They are two totally different products. Anyway, I'd like to say this product is a bit buggy. I've had 2 freezes with the thing already. But, that happens with all mp3 players, I seem to hear anymore. Well, the picture is quite good, and it's not hard to use. The computer reconizes it in a short period of time. And, then WMP10 will be able to sync music on to it. I do enjoy the fact it has the expansion slot, since if you become a music freak, it's okay. This is good for it's money, and will hold up a while. A thing about it is, that is scratches extremely easily, so I'd suggest getting a case with a screen cover. It's probably a good investment, and I am yet to buy a case. But, the sound quality is good, and I am pleased. I would recommend this product.

<Title>Great MP3 Player - Memory Card Somewhat Disappointing
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Sandisk for a couple of months and in general am very pleased with it.  I felt it was a viable, less expensive alternative to the iPod and don't regret that decision.  I added better earphones and a Boxwave charger, which is a nice alternative to using the computer to recharge it.  I've also added the 2GB SD memory card which unfortunately significantly slows down the startup of the Sansa.  Without the SD card, it takes 10-15 seconds for the Sansa to start playing.  With the card, each time you turn the Sansa on it "refreshes the database."  It now takes about a minute 15 seconds for the Sansa to start playing on mine with about 1.5GB of music files on the SD card.  For the price of the 2GB SD card, I could have bought the 8GB Sansa and had more memory and avoided this hassle.  I wish I had done that.

<Title>Soo much better than the Ipod Nano!
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this 4GB Sansa two days ago and I'm very pleased with it.  I only paid 129.00 here at Amazon, compared to 169.00 at Walmart.  Anyway, I loaded over 2 hours worth of video (2 episodes of Family Guy and 2 episodes of Friends),and 300+ songs, and I still have 980Mb left!  It also has a Micro Disk slot so you can keep adding more files.  I was ready to shell out 250 bucks for the Ipod Video, I'm glad I bought this Sansa.  The only issue I have is with the buttons, it's kinda hard to press the buttons around the spin wheel, other than that, I'm quite satisfied.  I guess it just takes a little getting used to.

<Title>Love this little guy!
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got one for Christmas.  I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical, since I had wanted a Nano, but decided to keep it.    I love it... It is ridiculously small and holds a ton of music.  I have been using it for running on rocky, hilly off-street running, and the music does not bounce like it did on my last MP3 player.  Even the earbuds work better for running.  Can't wait for some more accessories to come out - I think this might be the only drawback over an iPod, but I would almost recommend it over the Apple version due to the controls.

<Title>So nice, I ordered it twice
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the e260 as a Christmas present to myself (Have to spend the Christmas money somehow).  I can truly say, this product is fantastic.  I liked it so much I ordered another one as a present for my wife's 30th birthday.  It is easy to use, and sync's up perfectly with Windows Media Player 11.  I have zero complaints with this player.  It has even survived one concrete drop with 0 ill effects.  For the money, I'd say this player is unbeatable.  As far as accesories, I would (and have) bought the McNally FM transmitter made for the Sanas FMCUP is the product name, and also a Silicone carrying case off of ebay.

<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>overall, i like this mp3 player.  the negatives are that it is a bit heavier that the ipod and the sandisk tech support for this is really bad. the first one of these i bought through amazon had a bad display, it would not always go on when i pressed the power on.  it then would freeze up and i had to turn it off then back on.  sandisk tech support, 3 calls told me it was a corrupt song file and the last idiot told me to re-format then reload all my songs.  he then proceeded to tell me i would have to do this once a month!  i told him i owned and ipod and never had to do that with it and did he know they are competing with ipod.  anyway, amazon saved the day.  i shipped back the bad unit and it was replaced in 2 days by amazon, even before they received the old one!  the replacement is great, no problems so far with it.  i like the recorder and fm radio too!  overall, it's a very nice mp3 player, just stay away from sandisk tech support!

<Title>Despite its glaring flaws, I love it
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use it primarily for FM radio, secondarily for music player. Radio: On irregular intervals at every few hours of listening, reception will gradually get very fuzzy. Ive found it can be fixed by switching radio stations away and then back to station I'm listening to.  The manual recommends attaching the USB cable for better reception, but that seems to make no difference, and who wants to walk around with a usb cable. Music:  Navigation is ok, except if I am listening to a song and want to chose another song.  To do this, I have to press the power button and go all the way back to the main menu, select music player, then chose album/artist, then I can chose another song.  Dumb. During both music and radio, player will freeze, mine seems to do this about twice a week.  So far, pressing the power button for 15 seconds has resolved the issue.  The scroll wheel is cool but it lets dust in under the screen cover, and sometimes it feels "sticky" though ive kept it reasonably clean. Ive lived with the Sansa for 4 months, and these are the worst I can say.  Everything else about the player ive found very pleasing, im willing to work with it to avoid that i-monopoly.

<Title>Great player, full featured. 
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought two of these (one for my wife and one for me). This was prior to the Zune release.  The player is everything it was claimed to be. FM tuner gets ok reception, not great reception though.  The portability is great and it can take a beating.  No problems with the battery life. I would like to be able to still use the device while plugged into the computer. (When docked, it goes into a transfer mode, making the buttons of the sansa inoperational).   The only issues Ive had with the player, is "Rhapsody to go". This service has a great selection of music...but functionally sucks. Has issues updating license subscriptions.   Between the Sansa and the Zune...anyone buying an iPod is an idiot. If you want something ultra-portable get the sansa. If you want the same features with larger storage and a larger screen...get a Zune.  One thing the Sansa doesn't do (that the Zune does) is allow for pluging in an AV out cable, so you can run your zune to a larger screen (in car LCD's, home TV).  Neither of these products have limitations of that of the iPODs.

<Title>Definitely need a bigger one
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to replace my cd player after scratching numerous cds on my way to work or over difficult terrain. while anyone with any technological know how will be instantly able to operate this device, it can be a little difficult to understand...for example I've tried uploading several of the same type of videos and it only uploaded one. The failed files have no reason other than files failed....okay wierd. If you put all of your files onto the usb drive side and not the mp3 player side the device refreshes everytime it's either unplugged from your computer or everytime it's turned on it will refresh the device also if said music is uploaded to the usb drive side the device will freeze and you have to go through the whole unscrew all 4 screws and remove the battery. Plus you have the option of setting yer own equalizer option but if it's putting out too much volume one speaker of your headphones will shut off...as time goes on it will become quicker and more frequent. I'm hoping they offer some support when i talk to one of the technical support people but they do offere free firmware updates...when they're available. The software inside the device automatically makes your music compatabile with the device as it's burning takes about 30 minutes for filling up the full drive just don't try to upload it to the usb drive side because half of your music won't be compatabile. It'd be nice as well to be able to gt back to the last song you were playing if the song wasn't playing but that's not possible the only way to resume the song that's actually playing is to keep it playing as you wander through the rest of the device. In all truth there could have been more buttons but if you shut off the device while a song is playing it does actually resume it. all in all it's not bad but i expected better./

<Content>What a great little MP3 player.  I got it for my wife and she loves it.  It more than suits her music needs.  Note: Before buying pay attention to the price.  In the past four weeks I have seen it change 3-4 times.  I originally saw it for $89 and decided to buy it the next day, but the next day it was $107.  A few days later it was $89 again.  Yesterday, it was $104 and now today it is $99.  Part of it depends on the seller. Just pay attention.  Watch for $89.   I would have paid more, but when you can get it for less it is worth it.

<Title>I love this mp3 player! 
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was everything that I was looking for in a portable music device and more. Within minutes of removing it from the box, it was synced up to my laptop and I was loading music onto it.  Very user friendly and intuitive. I didn't want an iPod because I didn't want to convert all my WMA music files to iTunes and I didn't want to feel so limited with a proprietary device as the iPod (although friends who own iPods love theirs).  I wanted something that was affordable, held a reasonable amount of music and would accept mp3s and WMAs with no muss or fuss.  This was it.  The design, size and shape is hot and fits comfortably in my hand. The sound quality is really good (although diehard audiophiles may feel differently).  The screen is bright, the colors vibrant and the size just right (I only use this for music so I can't speak for the video or photo options).  I like the bonuses of an FM tuner, voice recording and the ability to record FM broadcasts too. The price was right and dirt cheap at the time of purchase from amazon which made this a sweet deal.  Unlike others, I have only had two slight problems with my player.  Sometimes I would lose sound in the left ear.  I would either restart the system or wait a few seconds and it would do a sizzly staticy fade in. I soon discovered this only happened when I used the custom EQ option.  Switching back to a factory EQ setting immediately restored the sound.  Since the custom EQ doesn't do much anyway and the tabs aren't labeled, I don't feel I am missing out on much.  And I am having a heck of a time getting it to display my album art. However, that's an extra but not necessary feature for me. I will suss out the solution later, or not at all.  My only beef is not being able to connect this to an exterior sound system via the USB port but using a headphone audio cable connector thingy allowed me to connect it to my stereo system.  Other quickly solvable beefs I had at first were having to charge the battery through the USB port.  Quickly solved by purchasing a Sandisk AC charger through amazon for an unbelievably low price.   Also, the control buttons are tiny and hard to press and the surface of the player scratches easily. I also occasionally pressed the voice record button by accident but not as often as other reviewers seemed to.  All of the above were quickly solved by purchasing a Speck Products toughskin case also available through amazon.  It's a thick stylish casing that adds great grip to the unit, comes with a durable removable belt clip, a screen protector, recesses the control wheel, makes the control buttons easily accessible and prevents the record button from accidentally being pressed (you have to push hard and firmly to activate the record button).    Also, the headphones that come with the unit are not the best.  I use my Sony Fontopia headphones.  Overall, for this being my first mp3 player I am highly satisfied and would recommend this to anyone who wants a simple, easy to use player.  However if you're a diehard technophile you will probably hate and gripe about little things that won't bother the average user. But for the average joe, you can't go wrong.

<Title>Great WMA/MP3/FM/video player
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This our fourth Sansa 4GB player.  We typically have three, but we bought this one to replace one with a broken face.  The price of $89 was unbeatable.  (Note, I do not recommend the Best Buy-Rhapsody model having an "R" designation unless you plan to use Rhapsody.)  The manual is cryptic, so you may have some trial and error at first.  It works well with Media Player 10 and 11 (with a firmware update-for some).  I set Media player to manual syncronization so I can sync with more than one computer.  We bought the leather case this time to protect the face and it works well.  It's good to have an FM tuner (missing on most players).

<Title>Sansa is great

<Content>I love this tool.  I say tool because it's not just a toy for playing music.  When I go on trips I am able to store photos and movie clips of my family.  This keeps me smiling.  I love the voice recorder that the sansa has.  I have used it in many church service times to record and listen later to the pastors words.  However, I have noticed that when recording in a large arena or church santuary venue the sound recording level is not the greatest, having a slight hissing or whistling sound.  In smaller areas, it's good.  The radio feature is cool as well.  Small screen is a turn down when viewing the movies and pics, but we have to remember that we're going for the same size and portablity of a nano.  For price and features the sansa KILLS the nano.  Granted it may not be as easy to spin the dial as a nano and the buttons are acutal buttons, where as the nano and ipod are skin sinsitive.  I never owned an ipod or nano, so if I am missing something, I don't know it.  Once again, for features, price, and storeage ablity and expandablity, go with the Sansa.

<Title>Way better than the ollllllld walkmans!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for each of my kids for a present while looking at ipods.  Glad I noticed it.  With the expansion slot, Sandisk's reputation, video capabilities, and PHOTO slideshows, WOW!  I think the expansion slot is what really sold me, gee who knows how many gigs you need until you've used all yours up and you need to buy a bigger one!  I figured that 4 GB would be plenty, but to be able to expand the memory is a neat feature.  But altogether this thing is neat and what a great deal.  If you had all these features in an ipod it would cost twice that much, at least. The only drawback is I wish that these companies would sell them WITH a protective case (not the cheapy sleeves they come with).  Honestly it is HARD to find a case that says it fits Sansa, and many probably do, but you would have to open a lot of packages to find out.  I did find one or two, but with all the dern ipod cases out there, it was frustrating to find one that said Sansa on it.  Maybe Sansa will start putting a 'real' protective case in the package and just up the price 10 bucks.  We did have a problem with one of them getting 'stuck' and couldn't figure out what to do.  We called the 800 number and the customer service was great.  Told us how to turn it off (just press the button and hold for 20 seconds to get unstuck), power it back up and it has been fine ever since.  That's another great feature to have nice customer service!  Don't pass these up - at this price anyone can have one - even the older generations will be able to figure these out!

<Title>Superior product
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is likely the best mp3 player on the market. I owned a previous SanDisk player, but didn't like the fact that it was AAA battery powered. Wasn't in too big a hurry though, so I took my time looking around.   The most obvious first choice was iPod. I took a look at several offerings, and found them to be pretty varied. The cheaper models looked good, but they seemed a bit expensive for the functionality available. Additionally, I was put off by the fact that you can't use the player as a USB storage device. This is actually one of the major things I use these for, having it double as a media player and a flash drive. Next on the lineup were offerings by Samsung, Creative, and even Microsoft. Zune looked and felt too big and clumsy in general, as did most of the hard disk-based Creative players. I wanted the thing to fit in my pocket, not fill it. The Samsungs were small and cheap, but didn't have much storage space and all but the top-end ones had very small screens.   Then there was SanDisk again. I must say, despite the fact that my old player didn't have what I wanted in terms of battery life/type, it still did work. Checking out the selection, I saw this player and settled on a mid-range 4 GB size. I'm pleased with the choice.  Pros: Very nice screen. Good software that's pretty straightforward to use (just be sure to run the updater). One-touch voice recording. FM tuner with pretty good reception. Very long battery life, fast charging. Lots of storage space, and additional available via Micro-SD. Holds all my files, and then some. Very easy to sync with Windows Media Player. Battery is removable/replaceable. Just plain looks cool- on par with iPod Nano in my opinion.    Cons: The included earbuds are lousy. Bought myself some new ones. Some buttons are a bit small. USB charging only with proprietary cable; requires a PC that's turned on (not a big deal in most cases). Can't seem to play directly from player while plugged in, though of course you can play from the PC. Relies on Windows Media Player for sync, file ID, playlists, etc., so if you don't like WMP you can still organize stuff, but it's a bit of a pain.  Essentially this is an iPod Nano with much better software/compatibility options, slightly inferior hardware key layout, and much lower price. I think it's no contest which is the better deal.

<Title>Good Player
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall the E260 I got a few days ago performance well,  the display is clear and the menus are easy read and use.   I use MP3 players mostly for Text To Speech books while I walk.  These text to speech books playtimes can be 15 hours and longer.  THe problem with the E200 series players is a poor implementation of the scan and fast forward features.  Fast forward functions at one speed and takes approximately 5 minutes to advance 1 hour into the file.  The scan feature using the thumb wheel to  essentially to queue the file to a specific spot, but for large files it takes 3 to 4 minutes to advance an hour.  Also there is no bookmarking where you are in a file, so if you are listening to a large file and decide to catch to latest news on the radio, you then will start at the beginning of the file.  Back to the fast forward or scanning the file to get where you left off.   Also related to this same issue is that if you are playing file and inadvertently enter ther main menu then again start the file fromj the beginning.  With this drawback I still feel the player overall is a strong completer in its class.

<Title>Best player on the market for the best price
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 (and more) player is more than I expected. I don't use the video and picture stuff because I don't need them but they are just fine along with the MP3 and FM functions. It is absolutely gorgeous, slim and elegant. It has some problems with the firmware after you insert the memory card in it... keeps refreshing the database everytime you turn it on. But I really don't care for a couple more minutes as long as it's doing everything else as it's supposed to be. Will absolutely recommend it especially for 90 bucks... it's a real bargain for a top brand 4gb mp3 player!

<Content>Works great! Easy to use! lots of storage space!  Before you download anything go to sandisk and download firmware (improvements). Then when you plug device in it will automatically update and download of music or video will be easy.  Only complaint is screen scratches easy.  Buy a screen protector before use.  My screen had scatches after 48 hours! Still, I love it.

<Title>Great Value, Great Product
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased the Sansa e260 from Amazon. The price was, and still is, a bargain compared to the other comparable players on the market. The player has performed flawlessly. I used MS Media Player to rip CDs and load them on the e260, I have also "dragged and dropped" existing MP3 music files to the player. Creating playlists and syncing to the player works well, but be sure to follow the directions in the user guide. The whole process could not be simpler. I have not tried to download any files from Rhapsody...this might be more difficult.  Operation of the player is simple and intuitive. Also, the battery life is really great - took it on a twelve hour flight and did not have to worry about the battery dying during the trip.   Fit and finish of the unit is good. Coupled with the ease of operation and great pricing on Amazon, it is really a great buy!

<Title>sandisk 4 GB mp3
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The shipping of the item was late. The item was schduled to arrive on the 25th of october but it didn't show up till the 30 of october. The item is ok. The battery power is fine it isn't really low . If you are adding any pictures or videos you have to put it through a converter which takes forever and a day. I added a family guy clip that was only 2 minutes it took 10 minutes to convert to the sandisk mp3. I didn't like the flash disk slot on the side because I bought a 4 GB flash disk and I recieved the Sandisk MP3 then I discovered that I needed a Micro disk rather than a normal flash disk. The Mp3 is still very good for  $90 dollors but I am still very angry on the shipping time that the seller took to to send it to me.

<Content>Gotta say that I am really happy with this player. I am anti-apple and have been looking for a good non-apple player for a while. I have a couple of friends who have this player and they spoke very highly of it, so I decided to take the plunge. I'm so glad that I did! This player has all the features needed, great battery life and very good sound quality. 4GB is just perfect and the fact that I can add upto 2GB in the SD slot is great. Fantastic product, I would advise anyone to get it!

<Content>Although it has its downsides (what consumer electronic devise doesnt?), it far outweighs the Ipod Nano in fetures and cost.  Check out some reviews on the web to see what your going to get in this player.  As always, try to go into a store like Best Buy or Circuit City and try it out before buying.

<Title>Great Escape
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've used my player mostly for kayaking.  I can set it up and forget it--just go down the lake and enjoy the selected tunes.  I've put a few pictures to share that would be enjoyed by most; two mountain lions on Big River are a big hit, so with the MP3 player with me most of the time, I can share.  My wife and I use the player for our indoor bike workouts--just pop the earbuds in and one dosen't bother anyone else in the house.  Just having the player has allowed us to listen and make use of our music (over a 100 dics ripped) far more than we thought possible--It has changed the way we live.

<Title>Excellent purchase...
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this for a couple months now...time enough to put it through some regular use. I'm very happy with it overall. I did a lot of research before committing to an MP3 player, and this one had the right blend of features. I love the screen, it's got plenty of memory, and it's very easy to sync with Rhapsody and Media Player.   I bought the travel kit, too, which I also like, except that with the leather cover on, it's a bit harder to operate the buttons. I also wasn't crazy about the ear buds. They are not comfortbale to wear for long periods, and I found them too loud for my liking (when I have something inside my ears, as opposed to an over the ear headphone, I like it very low). I just use a different set of headphones.  One last note: one reason I bought this was to store digital pictures while on vacation. That does not work. You can store pictures on this device, and you can even use it like a flash drive, but you can't import pictures directly from your camera and view them on the screen. That's a rather unusual use for an MP3 player anyway, but I thought I'd mention it just in case. Overall, it's a great product and I think SanDisk did a phenomenal job with it.

<Title>Value for Money!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is no top of the line mp3 player but scores for low cost.The controls are pretty easy and intuitive. The UI design is strictly OK and so is the flimsy cover which ships with it.  It takes a major hit in sound quality. Its got just two options Normal and High, and even on the High setting, the sound is not great! The FM quality is also kinda OK. There are few fixed equaliser options. Another area of worry is the Charging. It can only be charged through a USB port, it ships with a cable to connect to your machine. This can get irritating especially if you're on a journey and you're not carrying your laptop around. The battery life is pretty sturdy. I ususally use Windows Media player for syncing my music to it. Its pretty easy and simple. The earplugs shipped with it are a nice fit. I guess at its cost, its a good bet!

<Title>MicroSD slot unusable
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What other reviewers said is true. I would like to point out that the MicroSD slot is unusable. For a fully-loaded 1GB MicroSD card, it takes one and half minutes EXTRA to start up the device. It reads the contents in the card and rebuild the database. Can you imagine that you have to wait for almost two minutes to listen to a song in your mp3 player? Forget about cards larger than 1GB. It takes even much longer to boot.  If you need more momery in the future, buy the 8GB model. It is only $50 more than the 4GB model. It costs you $60 for a 2GB MicroSD card now. With the firmware problem, don't count on using the MicroSD card for future expansion.  Also the device does not support Asian languages. You will see garbage characters for songs in Chinese, Japanese. iPod does a better job than this. You will then need to load the Asian firmware from other sources. Sandisk does not gaurantee this usage.  Overall, the hardware is great. The price is right. But the firmware sucks. Buy it if you don't need Asian language support and understand that MicroSD card is unusable.

<Content>This player is really practical. It can be used for various operations(portable drive is my favourite).  It has a few downsides; but if you can live with them....then don't think about other players. what I found to be ok....:  - price/Gb is the best - all features...8+ - portability - resistance (dropped it a few times) - battery time is ok (but only when used as a mp3 player)  what was annoying: - my hand is not that large...but the buttons do not fit at all anywhere(and one of them was hard to press...) - charge every time I plug it ?!?!?!?! that's a good battery killer :D - the screen scratches quite fast (after 2 months it has a reasonable amounts of scratching, but visible only in certain angles) - it hangs/is slow from time to time, if at full capacity... - some mp3 are totally crashing it....don't know why....:( - playing only songs in a directory is IMPOSSIBLE....why???? - the application is too simple...little features  What I would like: instead of the voice recorder, a simple text viewer... :D

<Title>Sansa e260 4G MP3 used for downloading audiobooks
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this PD a month ago, for the express purpose of downloading audiobooks from the state library's website.  This is a free service in my state and there are many books to choose from, organized into categories for easy browsing.  I am not a hi-tech person but have been able to download the books and transfer them to my PD pretty efficiently.  The player is very easy to use and the quality is excellent.  The lock switch enables me to put it in my pocket while listening and not risk hitting another function accidentally.  The 4G size enables me to put several audiobooks on the player at once.  The only downside I've found is that once I start listening to a book, I have to finish it or will lose my place and must tediously fastforward through hours of listening to get back to it.  I have e-mailed tech support to see if there's a quicker way to return to a listening spot, but haven't gotten a clear response from them.  I have also purchased a small case for strapping the player to my arm while walking, a cable for playing through the speakers on my computer, and a car converter for playing through the cassette in my car.  The total spent was $25, and has provided a lot of convenient listening options.

<Title>Sandisk has the right idea but misses on some important details
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an okay device in a crowded product market, but there are a few details that should be improved upon before I would buy another. Perhaps my irks are addressable via firmware, but until then.....here's my take:  Pros:  Good battery life Expandable with mircoSD slot Pocket-friendly form factor   Cons:  Slooow boot time in MSC mode  Bug in custom EQ setting causes intermittent signal loss in one or both channels  Interface navigation is not immediately intuitive to a former ipod or creative user  Audio signal is low from headphone jack - too low for practical use on line inputs to my home and car audio systems. Ipod and Creative devices didn't require amplification on the same inputs.  Proprietary software required to transfer video and photos.  Proprietary cable required for data transfer.

<Title>Great substitute for iPod
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Product has worked well thus far.  I have encountered only one problem, though.  When I first opened the box and started playing around with the player, it froze-up on me.  I unscrewed the back plate (4 very small screws) and took the battery out and put it back in after a couple seconds.  It has worked great since then. I really like the light-up scrolling wheel and the numerous ways to find songs. The FM radio feature is awesome as well. Overall, a really good product for a fraction of the price of an iPod.  I really could not see spending the extra money for anything else. I also purchased the silicone cover and highly recommend this added protection.

<Content>After alot of research, I decided to go with the Sansa 4GB player over the IPOD.  The IPOD can only play mp3 files, but the sansa can play several different formats which gives me more flexibility and choices on where I buy my music.  And for about $100 cheaper than the IPOD!  The sound quality is perfect.  And this device is very user friendly.  The battery life has not disappointed me, I'm always surprised by how many times I can use it before needing to charge it up agian.  I LOVE mine and may have to buy another because my husband is always taking it!

<Title>I have never done this before...
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like i said i have never written a review for a product ever in my life. Im 20 years old and was looking for a smaller mp3 player for the gym because my 30g i pod is just a bit to bulky. So i did some research and it seemed everyone liked the Sansa, so i flew over to BestBuy and picked one up.      Well, i got it home and loved the design it was pocket friendly, lightweight, and seemed durable. But this is where all the fun stopped. I opened the package and it said "Install CD Before Connecting." Haha, funny thing is Vista would not read the cd, and i have a brand new computer about 3 weeks old. So i said meh, and plugged it in anyway. To my suprise this thing came jack loaded with about 15 songs and 30 photos! So i was like ok...ill just delete them. Than i noticed something else.      Out of the supposed 4 gb availbe it was really only 3.71, granted room for software etc, i understand. But here's the kicker...After deleting all of the pre-set music and photos i had 1.71gb out fo 3.71gb. Thats with this thing completly empty!!! Not even 2gb's of room?! Ok Ok so its got and upgradeable sd slot. A 4gb card is another 40$ So there is 160$ spent.     I hate ipod for the itune only software, but this Sansa just made me angry. Im returning it today and getting something else. Just a warning to everyone out there. But since i havent read anyone else have the same problem as me, maybe mine was just defective. Oh Well all well that end well. If you have any questions, please get in contact with me. I hope this review helped!

<Title>very good product
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought my sansa (4GB) two months ago,  The product is really excellent, at the beginning (with the original firmware included) there was no customizable EQ, but after downloading the latest firmware version there it is!, Sound quality  is outstanding, but I advise you to use another earphones instead of the included with the sansa(cheap and really bad sound).  I had some issue with a kind of ghost file once, but found an easy solution in one of the sansa forums on the www. I have contacted sandisk customer service twice via email after registering my product over the sandisk website, every time they were very fine and fast, no problems with that aspect. Also, I know a lot of people complain about the main buttons size, and  I can tell you that the size is not the real issue, its the position of the buttons! they are really close to the volume wheel so people with large fingers may have a little problem pressing the buttons. Overall I am very satisfied with my sansa, I recommend it highly. Pros beats the little cons any day!

You can also expand the memory capacity with optional microSD cards.  The ONLY complaint I can come up with is that it doesn't come with an AC charger.

<Title>Not So Cool Now
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had bought this when it first came out. I hate the whole iPod idea and besides this had better features for way less. Video, Voice, Photos, Music, Radio, and Rhapsody Channels(which is irritating). But within a few weeks after I had bought the Sansa Player, small problems would show up. The screen would go black and would not light back up while still playing. Would freeze, Skip, and sometimes wouldn't even shut off!! I went to return it, but the store policy was only 16 days. wtf. I totally got ripped there.    **Things I like about the Sansa player** Screen size and shape. Buttons. I like the little spin-dial. Recorder! Very nice and useful for school lectures. Great for showing photos. You can also stick in memory on the side. (Say you have a 4GB and you add 2GB now it's = 6GB).   **Things I don't like about the Sansa player** Kind of heavy, not good for runners like me. Rhapsody Channels. First off it's taking away from the storage you have for your songs. Some music you just don't like. The channels take a long time to update. It's hard to spell Rhapsody without looking at it. You have to download their Rhapsody player. Now I have like three major players. iTunes, Windows Media Player, and now this! I have to rate all my songs here too! What a hassle. You have to sign up for it too, unfair.    I eventually got a new one as a gift and I still have some of the same problems showing up here and there. Overall I recomend that you buy the pricey travel kit Sansa sells it has a screen protector and a leather holder, if you decided to buy this anyways. Just to make it last longer.

<Content>The player has loads of features, has nice software included to convert and synch mp3's and videos and installed nicely.  BUT, only worked for 2 hours before the light stayed on but wouldn't display menu or turn off.  Amazon took it back and I ordered the 6gb (as its price had dropped) and its worked so far, except a few blips where it freezes and have to turn off and back on. Again, the features are supurb for the price - has anything ipod has and more (like adding more memory and removable battery) but quality seems somewhat suspect.

<Content>1) Its small,sleek and does what is expected - plays mp3 music 2) The only limitation is the size of the screen is too-too small to view images or videos. 3) I like the FM radio feature and the ability to capture and save radio snippets

<Title>Capable Player
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having balked at the price of the Nano, and facing a holiday season involving the purchase of MP3 devices for the family, made a leap of faith for Sansa products, including this, as a present to me.  All Sansa lines (the e250 and m240 512 and 1G versions) worked out well.  Only concerns have to do with few easily available accessories, a little getting used to the small buttons, and the learning curve that comes with using a new product.  The headphones and case with the m240 series need improvement.  Very pleased with e260, which has turned some heads.  Recommended.

<Title>DOA, but easily fixed
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought the e260 to replace an aging iPod shuffle. It arrived yesterday and appeared to be DOA. Pressing the menu key simply caused the blue switch to light up and stay lit, no screen display, no sound, and the menu key wouldn't turn off the blue light.   I googled around a bit looking for hints/tips on fixing the problem and saw a suggestion to remove the battery to completely reset the device. Being daring, I unscrewed the four tiny phillips head screws on the back of the unit, removed the battery for around 30 seconds, put it all back together, and voila. The e260 came alive and seems to be functioning normally.  Hope the above helps some other poor soul suffering from what seems to be a DOA unit.  As for the e260, I love it. The sound is much much better than what I was experiencing on the old shuffle. I had no problem syncing my music over to the device and am quite happy with the purchase.

<Title>Sweet piece of gear
<Date>Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using the E260 for about five months now, and it has been one of the better purchases I've made on Amazon. Sounds good, easy to use, fairly durable, reasonably priced, and it even looks good.  One of my teenage son's friends checked it and said he liked it better than the Nano. I agree with him that the Sansa wheel is better. It's more "sure-fingered" and I rarely pick the wrong thing with it.   The menus are natural, and quick to use. I often change music while moving on an elliptical exercise machine, with no problems.  It coordinates reasonably well with Windows Media Player, so it's unnecessary to install any other software to use it. I can't say the integration is natural or perfect - it took some dinking around to get Media Player to copy over just the music I wanted. But I found a way I like even better, which is to access the device directly and just drag over the songs I want using Windows Explorer. The Sansa apparently just indexes them on the fly when I do that, because they appear in the menus right away. (The integration with Media Player was one of the main reasons I picked the Sansa, because I think iTunes is pretty sad, and the Zune doesn't work with Media Player either.)  I can't claim the included ear buds are anything special, but that's true of most MP3 players. Maximo makes a nice set of ear phones (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NX0W5W/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7550798-1892912">Maximo iM-390 In-ear Earphones 2.5MM 2FT Alloy Metal + Case</a>) specially tuned to the Sansa E-200 series, so I recommend you take a look at them if you want some high quality audio off the Sansa. Or just wear some decent, lightweight headphones.   This unit is now a pretty good bargain, and you can bump it to 6GB by getting a 2GM car for about $30. But if you have a lot of music, you might want to spring for the 8GB model, the E280. I've filled up my E260 already, but I carry about fifty albums on it.

<Title>Fun!
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Plays music great. Easy to transfer music. Videos are a little harder. You won't get most videos onto this Sansa. Most videos must be converted to a Sansa format and that can take a while. Another complaint is that although you can enter the date and time, you cannot display it. Otherwise, great product!

<Title>Go bigger.
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just get the 8gb version. Or whatever the biggest one is at the time your reading this.  I've put video on it w/o any problem. It does take a long time to cook as all video is in .MOV (Quicktime) format.  The entire E200 family is so far better than all of the C100/C200 players it's amazing. Don't even bother looking at the C series, especially if you think you might get the Sansa Base Station or about any other Dock for them.  The docks work best with the E series.  The MicroSD slot is nice but it's probably cheaper to max out the built in memory now by getting the 8GB unit, which has all the same features.

<Title>sansa's quality is shaky at best
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After about six months it just up and stoped working.  Prior to that the audio would go in and out, left ear bud only then right.  Other than the fact it never really worked right it's great.  I have friends with one and they have never had any problems, but I got a lemon.  Their quality assurance is pretty sloppy.

<Content>I bought the Sansa e260 4 GB and I love it. It had all the features I was looking for. MP3 player, photos, video and FM Tuner. Also I like the fact that it had a SD expansion slot. This was my first Mp3 player. It was easy to use. Not complicated at all. I did alot of shopping around before I bought it and I know I got the best deal for my money.   If you are looking for a good MP3 player with alot of features for the money then this player is for you.

We felt we got a comparable product to the ipod at a fraction of the price.  Then my husband's stopped working.  He jumped through all sorts of hoops trying to trouble shoot with the customer service team.  One of them even sent us an email trying to sell us a product that would fix our still under warranty MP3 player for a third of what we paid for the whole MP3 player!  They were useless in helping us try to fix the problem, and then wanted us to take down our fire wall to see if that was the problem!  The MP3 player is not working, it just cycles over and over again like you are turning it off and on, our computer has NOTHING to do with it!  If we could go back, I would spend the extra money and purchase the ipod.  You definately get what you pay for, and this was not an exception!  Now we are stuck with a MP3 player that is still under factory warranty, however they are not willing to fix or replace their product!  BUYER BEWARE!

<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sound puts iPod to shame. Much better than Nano and video is adequate.  I replaced stock head phones with Sony and everyone says it sounds better than any Apple.  It has a custom equalizer you can set and I believe that is what kills the Apple.  Easy to use interface.  Best bang for the buck.

<Title>WOW -- I don't understand the 'thumbwheel' issues :)
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this in the mail last week. I have loaded 565 songs on it using Microsoft Media Player V10. I have 1688 MB free out of the 3700 available. I also ordered Shure E2C ear buds with it and don't use the provided units at all. I have boosted the BASS in the equalizer settings and have found everything to my liking. While I am educated about electronics / HDTV / Stereo, Home theater etc. this was my first foray into the MP3 world. I took the unit out of the box, saw that it played with the provided charge, opened my Media Player to see about Ripping a CD and the unit sync'd with the computer and I had my CD's on the player in less than 30 minutes. It doesn't get any easier than that. I believe REALLY good software / hardware doesn't need a manual - this unit rates a '5' of '5' with me. I put it in my jeans pocket, popped the Shure e2c ear buds in and spent two days rebuilding my fence - no problems with anything - I couldn't be happier. I thought the PRICE was excellent for the memory provided. Part of me says I should have gotten the 8MB unit, but the other part of me says "with 1000 songs (potentially), you'll be fine". I do not use it for video or photo's. I read the CD-manual and figured out to use WIndows Explorer and went in and deleted the factory loaded songs, pictures and all video files. I HAVE preset 6 FM-stations that come in very well considering I live in pretty much a jerk water town of limited FM resources. I am looking forward to receiving the FM-transmitter from iRiver so I can listen to this in my truck --- my car has the XM-radio :( I found the controls to be sensible and easy to use. I wear a Men's size 12 glove and my ring size is 12 as well --- I have large hands and find the controls easy to use and I simply do not understand the comparisons with the iPod -- other than the cost differential. All in all - I'd do it again in a heartbeat knowing what I know now.

<Title>Great MP3 Player!
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 16 year old son for a Christmas present. His previous MP3 (an iriver 5 gb H10) died  more times than I could count. He wanted an ipod, but I refuse to give into the whole craze over a player that's over-priced and over-hyped. The Sandisk looks cool, it's small, has great sound, had a ton of features (many of which he's still learning to use), and is a great deal! It offers so much more than an ipod at a much better price point. Hey, if a 16 year old is impressed with it, that say it all for me. I might even buy one for myself because he gifted his H10 to me. Gee...thanks.

I happy with this product, the battery can give you hours of music with no recharge. I use it on my car, actually, I don't charge it frequently.  CONS: Doesn't come with wall charger, only usb option.       Sansa works only with Rhapsody software (No itunes)

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 is by far the best hands down for price and functionality. I reviewed a lot of players and this one seemed to have the most functions for the price.  When I received it it was very easy to drag and drop music into the player. I tried using windows media, but it was very confusing to make a playlist and then send it to the player. But I also didn't take the time to actually sit down and find out what I was doing wrong.   But overall this is a powerful little piece of equipment. If you use the playlist, be careful when scrolling to it. If you go to fast, it will lock up. Once it locks up, you have to take it apart and remove the battery to reset it. But that only happened to me one time. Now I take my time when going to the my preset playlist. If your listening to all music, you don't have to worry about that. The system must be accessing another part of the memory chip to retrieve the music. This baby is also powerful. I once took it to a party and I had the connections to hook it up to the their stereo system and we partied all nite long. No more need to lug around CD's. I loaded this baby up with my preset list and just let it go. You can control the volume through the player. Its great. People we're amazed at what this little baby can do. Also if you have ipod music on itunes, you can do a backdoor by downloading to a CD and then burning onto windows and loading it that way. This is time consuming, so I just go through yahoo to get my music. But if you we're dying to get an ipod, you can transfer your music this way. I would highly recommend this player to everyone.

<Title>Love It!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I absolutely love this player. I purchased it about 4 months ago, and it has been working quite fine since then. During my search for an mp3 player, I was hesitant at first because I did not know so much about the Sansa player and thought it might be safe to just go with an Ipod. However, i really do not regret my choice at all, because it is a great deal for its price. It looks nice, offers video, pictures, radio, and is easy when it comes to placing music on the player. Probably the only negative thing about it might be that it did freeze once, but that is easily fixed by holding the power button for 10 seconds to reset it. Great player for the price! shouldn't be turned down

<Title>Great MP3 player.
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The sansa is truly a great mp3/movie/photo player/viewer. The picture is quite nice for it's size and the menus work really well (just make sure you keep your ID3v2 tags updated). The sound is very nice and my wife can actually use it. Because you can plug it in as a flash drive it works really well with my linux box. Now for the bad news which is why I rated it a four.  Sandisk decided that you could only use it's proprietary software for pictures and movies which is not compatible at all with linux hence I run into some trouble there. I don't mind so much that the usb port is the only way to charge it but I guess it would be nice to be able to plug it into my car. Oh well.  Enjoy!

<Title>It's a Solid Choice
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With over 840 reviews, what is left to say? The product works well enough, although I have experienced blue lines running across the screen during the music transfer process. This has happened a few times, but I was able to reset the Sansa with no loss of data. I've owned this item for about 7 months and use it 2x a week maximum. If I had to do it again, I would not buy the item - it has proven to be too big for jogging/walking, and once you add a protector case (which is a must), it gets quite bulky. I have not used the video, picture, or voice features at all, I barely need 2GB, and in the sun the screen is useless. My advice: just be very careful to not buy more than what you really need in an MP3 - save as much as you can so you can upgrade more often. The product is easy to operate though and has held up, so I'd recommend it to people who are considering it.

<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my cousin, and he has not reported any problems as yet, so I think this is a very good mp-3 player. He accidentally pressed the off button for more than 7 seconds, so it turned off, and he thought the device got hanged. But when he called and asked SanDisk, he was told that it went into standby when he did that.  Other than that, the product is great and also, you can add a micro sd card to increase the number of songs you can play, and has an inbuilt fm tuner....and I guess these are the advantages when you are comparing this and an ipod nano 4gb. The audio is as good as ipod, and I dont know about the video quality because I have not used that yet. But if you are not going to play any video, and are going for something other than an ipod (may be because of the price) this is the best alternative.

<Content>The price of this product dropped $10 in the three days it took for it to get here, and that's a little disappointing for me, but it's a great product and absolutely worth the price.  The FM Radio isn't exactly what you'd call "high quality," and the recorder's not much better, but they work and you can easily crank the volume up if they sound faint.  The audio quality is top notch, and you can upload pics and movies to boot!  Definitely a great product IMO.

<Content>After researching so many mp3 players, and reading reviews, I finally decided on this one. I made a great choice. I love that it is light weight, I can put it in my purse comfortably and that it is easy to manuever. The bad part is that I still do not know how to turn off a song. I have to power off Sandisk to stop the music. Also, when I am loading the music from my computer to the player, it keeps loading all the music, not only the certian ones I want to hear. I am still going to play with it and hopefully will be able to figure it out soon. I do highly reccommend this player to anyone who is buying their first mp3 player. It is worth the price.

<Content>I bought this because I wanted more functionality than the current iPods had at the time (FM, voice recorder, video, microSD expansion slot). I've used it in my car, at the gym (where I listen to the TVs broadcasted over an FM xmitter), and in class where I record lectures. It works well in all situations. I synched it up to Windows Media Player 11 and built playlists there.   I've also briefly experimented with the video, but I don't have a big need for that now. Files converted over easily enough with the software that came on the CD.   The battery lasts a long time. I'm able to listen to it on a 1.5 hr commute and then record 8 hrs of class and I still have plenty of juice to spare.   Sound quality seems fine for me. I'm no audiophile. The screen is crisp & clear too.

<Content>I'm really impressed with the Sansa.  It's tiny, solidly built, and has some great features that competing products don't.  It plays videos, has great sound quality, has expandable memory, has an FM Tuner, and has a built in mic for recording audio.  The interface is easy to use and the controls are simple.  The scroll wheel works well but the movement could be just a little bit smoother.  Overall I would definitely recommend this player to anyone looking for a small, easily portable flash-based audio player.

<Content>This sandisk media player is amazing. It has features such as fm radio, voice recording, as well as the video and music. I had tried the ipod nano before, and it doesn't come close. This player is less expensive than a 4GB apple mp3 player, and has better features, plus it has solid construction. My only irk to the product were the head phones, because they wouldn't stay in place, and would always fall out. But that isn't much of a problem considering there are many after market headphones you can get- (I recommend sony in ear style earbuds). Overall excellent product, the Sansa is great! A Ferrari for the price of a Ford!

<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this mp3 for my daughter and she loves it.  It is easy to use.  You don't have to go through iTunes to download, so you have versatility.  It has a bigger screen than the Nano (which I have).  Great item.  Great alternative to the more pricey ipod.

<Title>GREAT mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's no need for me to type a lot about it because so many others have stated the finer points of this player.  I got it for $130 from Amazon, and got a second for my g/f for Christmas.  It holds plenty of music for me... I don't need to carry my entire library in my pocket, but with the expansion slot I could definitely increase the space if I wanted to.  And with the ease of transferring the data to it (with WMP11 or Winamp) I can easily remix the catalog on it to suite my taste.  You'll definitely want to get a decent pair of earphones (Shure or the like) because it comes with the standard crappy uncomfortable plastic pellets that are supposed to hang just inside your ears but never stay in.  I'm not dinging the Sansa for this because I never expected it to have good earphones and I already have a set of Shure E3s.  A silicone skin for it is also a good way to protect its pretty glossy black exterior.

I went for a little more memory on his.  We use ours at work at our desks and at home when were tired of toddler music. We are not techies or anything but I love this MP3 player.

<Title>Watch out Nano, here come the Sansa
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The e260 is a great media player with good sound and exceptional storage for the relatively low price.  It comes with features as FM tuner, video playback, voice recording, digital photo albums, and of course music playback.  It plays WMA, MP3, and protected WMA easily and with pretty good quality.  As for video, the small screen is plenty crisp enough for those bus/subway trips across town.  The software is nice and intuitive for easily syncing media.  The only drawback is the mechanical scroll wheel, which feels a little flimsy and is in the way of the function keys.  It's easy enough to get used to, and the flimsiness seems to work it's way out with time, weird. With its price per GB or feature ratio, the Sansa will give the Nano a run for it's market share.  For anyone looking to get into the portable MP3 market, it's defiantly a device worth looking into.

With an ipod you have to buy FM channels, but the sansa mp3 player has everything! Everyday I am finding new things on my mp3 player. This mp3 player holds up to one thousand songs. I think this should be the number 1 seller instead of an ipod.

<Title>The Best MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After some serious research on MP3 players, I decided to go with the Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 player.  This was the best decision I ever made.  At first, the player kept skipping out or doing some weird stuff.  But, then I called SanDisk Tech. Support and found out that the firmware on the player was outdated and needed to be updated.  After the firmware was updated, the player worked fine.  The buttons are a bit tiny, but I would have tiny buttons rather than dropping the player and the player not working.  It is a bit of a pain to get the songs deleted from the player.

<Title>I really want to like this player
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a lot of research before settling on this player, and I want to like it. It's small and sleek, and the sound is good. I have no problem with the dial and the buttons (my hands are small). But I find it extremely picky about displaying music I transfer to it. I've given it three stars because it's not working for me. But based on the other rave reviews (which contributed to my decision to purchase the player), I can see it has the potential to be a five-star device.  I don't download individual tunes from the Internet. I want it to hold my ripped classical music CDs. Some of them show up in the Album and Artist views, others don't. When I'm in MSC mode and I connect the player to my computer, I see the albums in the folder, but I can't see them on the player. The tracks show up when I look at Songs, but that's no good because they're listed in alphabetical order and guess what, I don't want to listen to the first movement of a symphony followed by the first movement of another symphony, and so on. Call me a traditionalist, but I want to listen to movements 1 - 4 of one whole symphony.  I don't think I'm stupid, but I am having a hell of a time figuring this thing out. I've tried syncing with Media Player in MTP mode and dragging and dropping in MSC mode. I've deleted the data folder so the device has to rebuild the database (per instructions for this problem on a forum).   If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear them.

<Title>Great player...but the earphones....
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this Sansa e260 4GB player. It looks great, works great, and is easy to negociate even for a not-so-young and not-so-techno-savvy person like me.  Overall, a wonderful player at a better-than-ipod value. I also really like the way it downloads music so easily from my Windows Media Player.  It's a piece of cake. One thing: I don't know if I have funny-shaped ears, but the earphones are really hard to fit and keep in, and they hurt after awhile.  I don't know why they can't make better fitting, more comfortable earphones.  So I bought the JBuds ear buds, which sound great (maybe better) and are so comfortable!  I also bought the Sansa travel kit, which supplies nice protection and includes a decent leather skin for the player.

<Title>The Best!
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned an iPod mini that had poor battery life, lock-ups and died after 1.5 years.  I was determined not to spend the big $$'s on a player that would not stand the test of time.  I purchased a previous generation of Sansa 1GB player, and loved it.  But it lacked the bells and whistles that I enjoy.  Due to my previous experience with the Sansa line, I decided on the 4 GB e260.  I have owned it for about two months, and haven't been happier!  GOOD: -Most importantly - great sound!  A huge improvement over my last Sansa, and the iPod mini. -Small!  I carry it around in my purse all of the time. -Radio option is nice to have, with great reception. -Very solid and sleek.  Seems durable. -Easy to use - just drag and drop.  I don't even bother with Media Player. -My main complaint with the old Sansa is that it would loose its place in a track when powered off.  So long podcasts would start over when powered back on.  Now my new e260 player holds its place - I'm so glad I upgraded!  GOOD and BAD: -Expandable memory slot is nice.  But it is micro-SD.  I have a ton of SD cards, but no micro-SD -Battery lasts forever - more than 10 hours.  But when it dies, you have to hook it up to a computer to charge.  I miss the old Sansa where I could remove a re-chargable battery, put a fresh one in and keep going. -Tiny!  Which means tiny buttons and a tiny screen.  I would not recommend buying this player for video purposes.  It looks great for such a tiny screen, but it is tiny! -I am not a technical person, so I had a heck of a time figuring out how to convert a video.  I thought I could just use the Sansa converter and go.  But no, I have to de-crypt it, then use the Sansa converter.  It was hard for a person like myself to figure it out.  But I do have to say, the Sansa converter does shrink the files down nicely!  I have put both pictures and video on my player without problems.  BAD: -The fast-forward and rewind button proceeds slowly!  I listen to long podcasts, and it can take a while to move to where I want in the track.  If you want to move forward 2 hours, you can pretty much forget about it since the buttons are so small and hard to hold down for that long. -That's it!  I'm so happy with my purchase.  It is "cheap" in price, yet has everything I could ask for.  Thanks Sansa!

<Title>Sansa e260 + Rhapsody = unbeatable value
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think the Sansa Rhapsody e200 series provides the perfect mix of service and product. Of course you need better headphones, but the great features of this device are well-catalogued on other reviews. This is our family's 3rd MP3 player (I do love the Cowon for sound, but haven't used it since I got my e260, and just caved in to my son for a 2 GB 2nd gen. Nano; he likes to "own" music). But add in the Rhapsody service (virtually unlimited selection of music of all genres) usable on up to 3 computers and 3 portable music devices to the great feature bundle means everybody in the family gets everything they want for a total of $15 a month. As usual get as much memory as you can afford. Cons? I've had to reformat the device due to freezes twice in 1 month, the first time because I think it just needed a firmware upgrade, 2nd time because I tried to do too much with it (can't go into detail here, but watch adding too many "channels" at once to your device), but help (either on-line or via telephone) has been excelent. You do have to make the mental leap to "renting" music instead of owning it, but that is NOT a problem to me. For now, this is heaven.

<Title>Great Mp3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everything that I read about this product has been correct. Great price, great look.  The application wheel for the product is fairly cheap feeling but honestly how often do you use something like that to worry about?  I read that the sound quality wasn't the best.  It sounds just fine to me.  The only pet peeves I have about the product is Sandisc's website is really lacking.  I went to their FAQs section hoping to find indepth directions on creating or uploading my playlists and the directions that were there were incorrect.  I wanted to be able to create a playlist in Windows Media player, sync up to my Sansa and upload the playlist, album and songs.  It doesn't quite work that way.  The website stated in order to 'create' a playlist you have to either select the song you want to add to the 'Go list' within the player or within your device folder in Windows.  All in all a great product!

<Title>I wanted the best iPod Nano alternative.
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I arrived upon the Sansa after a fairly exhaustive search for the best iPod Nano alternative.  The iPod products do seem extremely well manufactured and obviously the after-market support is unparalleled, but I was leery of several iPod issues.  The first being no WMA support, which I have a 1000CD library ripped into, and the second primary issue was being locked into iTunes.  Of lessor importance was dealing with the battery issue of iPods (not user-changeable) and a lack of an FM radio.  The Sansa appeared to be the best alternative, and so far I have been very pleased with it.  It is very simple to use, has plenty of volume, and the audio quality is good.  It requires no software installation outside of a small program for firmware upgrades.  It has a plethora of options on it, including the FM tuner, voice recorder, and some expandability with the MicroSD slot.  It's video capabilities will probably only appeal to very limited market (certainly not me).  It appears very well made and there is some gathering aftermarket support for accessories.  The battery life is exceptional, and replacement will be easy.  The negatives that I have encountered is that it is certainly thicker than a Nano, although it is still a relatively small device.  The FM reception is rather weak.  It also has a minor sync issue with Windows Media Player in that the album art does not transfer to the player, but that is a minor quibble.  Amazon's price at the time that I purchased my 4GB Sansa beat everyone else's by about $50, and I am very pleased with the value that the Sansa represents.  I have no qualms recommending it to anyone.  It is not perfect (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), but certainly fits the bill of a very serious iPod Nano alternative.

It came with the sansa e260, headphones, usb cable, installation cd, user guide, strap, etc.  After 5 days that i started using it it started to malfunction. I tried many different ways to get it workin properly, but i did not succeed. It is a big competitor with the nano. Even thought the sansa e200 series comes with more features i would still reccomend the nano.

<Title>Good Buy
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did alot of research before buying an MP3 player, and came down to either an iPod, or the Sansa.  After comparing features, I decided to buy the Sansa.    The price of the Sansas (especially on Amazon) was cheaper than the iPods, and it included some nice features, like a built in FM radio.  I especially like the expansion slot.  This MP3 player can even record from FM, or just voice.  And it plays videos too.  Also nice, is the fact that you can use several different subscription services, unlike iPods that tie you to iTunes exclusively.  It's pretty easy to use, although the instruction manual leaves a little to be desired.  I can have Windows Media Player take care of syncronizing the player to my media, or I can simply drag and drop the MP3 files myself.  For pictures and video, you have to use the Sansa Converter software to download to the player, even if the file is in the correct format, which is a bit of a drag.  But I won't be using the player for videos: personally, the screen is just way too small for me.  I have not had problems with the player locking up, as other reviewers had.  I did get errors when I would connect the player, but connecting the player directly to the computer, instead of through a USB hub fixed that problem.  My computer is a frankenstein, so that may be the cause, since Sansa says you can use the player on a hub.  The only other downside, was that I did not find the earbuds comfortable.  They seemed to be too big for my ears.  But, I have quite a few earbuds around, so that wasn't a very big downside for me.  All in all, I would recommend the Sansa.

<Title>good but it breaks
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The item is really good and cheap, a lot better then ipod and after a short time you find out how to load music. The features are really god to but the display is to small for hole movies (I had a headach after one). The only problem is the thing breaks so fast. I had it 2 weeks and it froze, the display became a quater white. I had a lot of good music on there which I can't get back so it is really bad for me. I had to send it in and just good a new one. I try it one more time then I give up. So if you have some time and your music at homeit is better than ipod. if you have not a lot of time and you are not pacient search for somethin  else or buy an ipod. I am still sticking with it because I see the advantages but it is a lot of work.

<Title>Really wanted to like this
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this because I didn't want to get sucked into the world of ipod.  Within the first 2 weeks of receiving this it started breaking down.  It would freeze up, screen would turn black, wheel would stay lit until the thing lost power.  Then I would have to charge back up to get it working again.  It got to the point that it was no longer working.  Sandisk sent me another one.  It was good until the same thing started happening again.  what happens now is the thing freezes up after 5 minutes and I again have to wait until it loses power to charge it again.  Sandisk sent me another one, only to have the Sansa break down the same way again.  Since october 2006 i have had 3 sansa players of which both have failed.  I have now turned to ipod and feel that the product is so much superior.  The only good thing I have to say about the Sansa is that their customer service is great.

The instructions with the Sansa, and those online, are pretty meager.  I have not been able to create playlists as I had hoped to, but perhaps I expect too much. It works beautifully, is small and does exactlly what I was hoping for, with the exception of personalized playlists.

<Title>Convenient mp3 player
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> I would recommend this mp3 player to those who like to listen to music while jogging or exercising. It's small, very light, and comes with a handy lanyard (for some reason I hate the armband straps). Since the machine doesn't use a hard drive, it doesn't skip like hard drive players do when shaken around.   The downside to using a memory card of course is access speed - it takes a bit of time after downloading new music for it to hash through all the new files, and accessing humongous playlists can take some time (a list with around 100 songs takes 5 - 10 seconds to load). Usually I just open up a large playlist and let the player shuffle through the songs. Choosing a song through a large playlist is a pain, since the machine is slow when scrolling.  For a "serious" mp3 player I would rather recommend something like the iRiver, but if you're just using it for exercise etc. this one's great. It's a great replacement for the iPod Shuffle in my opinion.

<Title>Love it.
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this thing.  It takes a little longer to start up than an ipod, but if you can't wait ten seconds to listen to some music, you've got bigger problems than any mp3 player can fix.  Also, from what I understand, this is because it's got flash memory instead of a hard drive.  I consider this a bonus, seeing as everyone I know with an ipod has had the hard drive fail.    I also really like that the wheel is an actual wheel.  The ipod wheel is way to sensitive for my tastes, and the zune clicky thing is kinda clunky and weird. This is nice little plastic wheel that actually turns and gives me some tactile sense of how far I'm turning the dial.  The drag and drop functionality doesn't work all that well for me, but it takes so little time to synchronize using WMP that I really don't mind. The built-in microphone is surprisingly decent, too.  Yes, you can ONLY charge it via USB, but the battery lasts for quite a while, so I haven't run into any problems with that yet.  All in all, this is a really nice player and is considerably cheaper than the competition.  I recommend it.

<Title>Sansa e260 4gb MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We had a lot of problems getting the first arrival to stay turned on.  Tried all settings, but when it would shut off (sometimes after only a few minutes, other times after 15 or so), we'd need to reconnect it to the PC to get it to even turn back on.  Went through phone-assistance (someone with limited english speaking abilities) and they finally decided it was a faulty unit.    The 2nd MP3 player has worked great and is easy for my 12 year old to manipulate, load, use, etc.  He's very pleased (bought new headphones for it tho...the ear buds fall out and are pretty flimsy).

<Title>Best small storage MP3 player out there!
<Date>Mon Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is definitely one of the best MP3 players out there. I researched for about four weeks before deciding on the sansa e260. I think it's better than the iPod nano. The 4 gb sansa costs about the same as the 2 gb nano.  Writing music and videos is extremely easy if you have Windows Media Player, I didn't even read the instructions.  The buttons are a bit hard to press but that's not anything major.  I have about 200 songs, 4 episodes of Family Guy, and an entire movie on it and still have room left over.  The video quality also is pretty good.

<Title>Pretty Good!
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got my e260 a few days ago, I'm just going to list the Cons I find since the Pros have already been discusseed greatly.  1) Buttons (especially the tactile wheel) suck and are placed awkwardly. I often find that I skip a menu item or a song because the scrollwheel doesn't always end up where I want it to. Buttons sometimes need pressing 2-3 times before registering. The Buttons are also placed too close to the scrollwheel, so that I hit the scrollwheel accidently. Not recommended for people with Fat Fingers.  2) Recharging slot and MicroSD slot are left open and exposed. After a while I'm sure they will fill up with dust.  3) My Sansa has crashed on a few occasions. This can be a bit of a pain as it takes 25 seconds to reset(15 sec reset+ 10 sec startup) and I lose the place where I was listening/watching.  4) Quicktime sucks, my 700 meg divx movie turned into 1 gb. Takes about 2 hours to fill up the 4 gb player with converted video  5) Bass is lacking. My 5 year old PNY vibe pumps bass way better than the sansa. But I'm a bass junkie and others might not have this peeve.  6) Controls are sometimes weird. For example, to power down I have to press the menu button once to get back to the main menu and then hold it down to shut down. Takes some getting use to.  However, the quality, many options, battery life and good feel of the player has won me over.

<Title>More versatile than IPod
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 13 year-old daughter had a Dell Ditty for two years.  It served her well but she wanted an mp3 in which she could choose songs and create playlists.  She wanted an IPod because that's what her friends were using.  I have a Creative Zen Vision: M 30 with Napster subscription.  (Great mp3)  I guided her away from Apple and towards this because of the flash drive and Plays for Sure compatability.  Using her own money to buy this, I nervously awaited her verdict on the Sansa.  She loves it and so do I.  She has her music, photos and a movie on the player.  It works great with Napster To Go.  Her basketball coach saw her using it on the bus and has decided to get a Sansa also.  My 15 year-old son is now thinking he wants to get one, too.  Great product.

<Content>A great mp3 player, precisely for my needs. If you need just a music player that will allow you to listen to podcasts, have some pics, or even clips - this is it. It is cheaper than an Ipod, with color, converting software. The wheel, some say feels cheap, but what do you expect? Everyone is out there trying to create their own version of the Ipod dial, so... the main thing is that it works, is inexpensive, small, and nice to hold.

<Content>This is the best mp3 player have had. My last one was an m240 which i found great. but needed a change. This Mp3 was equipped with what i wanted. Its so much better than the ipod.  Heres some reasons why.  1. It is compact and sturdy. ( ive dropped it 4 times on the floor without busting. 2.It has a big screen for viewing photos, videos, album art and other info  3. the video is amazing. it has very good contrast and has good sound and easy to upload  4. the photo's look much clearer than other photo mp3's( Ipods)  5. The player has so much memory that i can't get it full. 6. it has expandable memory which is a plus. 7. its not an ipod. what person would want an mp3 like that junk. 8. great control and well placed buttons  I suggest going out and getting one yourself. because this is one great mp3

<Title>DO NOT BUY A SANDISK MP3 PLAYER!
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased a Sandisk Mp3 player for my son because the music he wanted wasnt available on Itunes and the Sandisk player was compatible with other music download sites. This player is horrible!! It began duplicating songs in the playlist and cutting songs off in the middle of play within 2 months. I called customer support for Sandisk and it was a challenge just to understand them..they sounded like they were in a tunnel in BF Egypt and could barely speak English. They told me the Mp3 player must be "corrupted" and sent me a link for a patch via e mail. This happened 2 or 3 times before they finally agreed to replace it.  I had to mail it back in and they would send me a replacement "within 7 to 10 business days".  Well, as of today, it has been over a month and I am still waiting. After 2 phone calls, I am told each time that it is in the warehouse and should ship any time...call back and check later. My husband and I both have Apple Ipods and havent had any problems in 2 yrs. You get what you pay for.

<Title>Great Alternative to iPod
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player to replace my 256MB Creative MuVo TX-FM, which just didn't have enough room for me.  I wanted a large capacity MP3 player because I didn't want to deal with the fragility of a hard disk player.  This is a great player, easy to use.  I've had it for about 4 months with no problems and I love it.  Volume is good, with a good range to it.  If it's not loud enough, there's a "loud" setting which really cranks it up.  Battery life is very good.  Fantastic value for the price.  Pros: Battery life Good quality screen, looks good enough for video clips Micro SD card - unlimited capabilities if you swap these out! Ease of use FM radio, which comes in well if you are in or near a city Volume range Durable - metal back cover Customizable as well as preset equalizer User replaceable battery - don't have to throw out the player or pay for expensive replacement when the battery goes.  Currently a replacement battery is only about $20 from SanDisk.  Cons: Start up time - about 1.5 minutes if the player is fully loaded.  Takes some patience. Storage of video - you can only store video clips on the built in memory, not on the Micro SD card.  Video must be in Quickplace format.  If you use the converter that comes with the player the files can get quite large. Button size - It's possible the buttons may be too small for someone with large fingers as they are somewhat recessed into the player.  I have small fingers so it doesn't bother me.

<Title>Sleek Look, Easy to Use, Works Great!
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have only had this player for 3 days, but so far I am VERY pleased with it!  The look is sleek and stylish and the buttons are easy to use and it works great!  I am not technically savy, but this player is pretty much self-explainatory.  The instructions that come with the player are sparse, but all you have to do is sit down and "play" with it for about 15 min and you've pretty much gotten it figured out.  The hardest part is figuring out which USB mode does what.  I've been using Windows Media Player to sync my songs to the player.  It is easy, easy, easy and works without a hitch.  Even downloads and saves your playlists.  When you want to delete something, just switch the USB mode and go under My Computer and delete them out like you would any other file or folder.  Probably the only thing I didn't like about this player were the speakers that came with it.  They sound fine, but they hurt my ears, just not comfortable at all.  But that's an easy fix, just buy a pair of the gel earbuds.  I also bought a $6.00 audio cable by Belkin and was pleased to find that the Sansa player plugs right into my stereo.    I would highly recommend this player for anyone, even if (like me) you're not technically inclined.  Also, just FYI, Amazon had the best price I could find on the 4G player - even beating out stores like Walmart.  Hints: 1. print out the PDF instruction booklet contained on the setup CD.  It will help to explain about the different USB modes. 2. don't forget to go to sandisk website and download the firmware updater.

<Content>This player is fine but the specification is misleading. In the web site of Sansa.com it shows this MP4 player has multiple languages, it actually has a few. It even shows us the picture of the MP4 with those foreign languages in side the menu. Unfortunately, some of the languages I want do not have them installed in the player we buy here in this country, only those from the foreign countries will have the foreign languages (e.g. Japanese, Chinese). I ended up calling them many times and Sansa passed my ticket around the whole world to find another one to swap it with me....It is very troublesome...

<Content>Being a retired and an older person I do not like down sizing of any kind. I believe there is a market for things big enough to see without straining the eyes or so small you need teeny fingers to use the product , I have one of the earlier -small- SanDisk players and I enjoyed it - but cursed every-time I loaded it or tried to get a station without glasses. Like all the features - but what sells me is the size and ease of seeing and pushing the controls I want to without wondering what I will get. When will these manufacturers realize there is a market for some of this oversized stuff and stop making everything so small they cut themselves off from a market that would but if they could use their product with ease.

<Content>Very good MP3 player with a reasonable price. So far I have no problems with it. The display is really bright and crisp. Watching a video on the small screen is OK, what does one expect from a 1.8" screen? Well, it's really possible to watch a movie on it and enjoy it if you are in a doctor's waiting room filled with old newspapers and magazines, for instance. I hope SanDisk will increase video support playback, Quicktime MOV takes a lot of space compared to other video formats. The user interface is pretty straightforward. Transfering music to the player is like transfering files to an external harddisk, no fuss. It's small, easy to carry, sound quality is great and much cheaper than an iPod.

<Title>I like my Sansa
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently bought a Sansa e260.  Overall I think it is pretty good.  I love the size, the feel, rhe battery life, the sound, and the FM tuner. Most of its drawbacks have to do with managing your music and navigating through the device.  The buttons need more tactile feedback -- it can be hard to tell when you engaged them. I often hit the record button by accident (it is on the side). There is no back button, so often you have to go back to the main menu to select a different album.  It seems like you can only create one playlist.  I've also found editing the music somewhat irritating.  The best way to do it is to drag and drop from your music folder with the device in Flash Mode - this way it is easy to go back and delete folders or songs.  When you load music with WMP there is no way to delete unless you delete it from your music library and then re-sync the device - if there is another way I haven't figured it out.  One time it shut itself off and wouldn't turn back on.  Apparently it froze - when that happens you have to hold the power button down for two minutes to re-set.  I had to call Sandisk to figure that out.  Overall it was a good value, and the drawbacks are mostly just a just a little irritating rather than serious problems.

It didn't come with an instruction manual at all, just a fold out brochure with nothing but the bare bones.  This was my first mp3 player, so figuring out how to get the songs I wanted from my computer onto the Sansa took some time without decent instructions, and there are still some things I'd like to do that I still haven't figured out how to do.  I love the hold button, so I can turn the player on, slip it in my pocket and go running or something with worrying about hitting a button and without worrying about it turning on and wasting the battery if I throw it in a bag.

<Title>Great product for the price
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have waited almost a year to rate the Sansa. Wont repeat all the positives and negatives (very few) that are mentioned below. Overall I want to state that I am quite satisfied with this product and make a few points about the negatives specified in other reviews.  *The unit has locked up on me 2 or 3 times in the year. Instead of removing the battery, one should hold the power button for ten seconds. This has always rebooted mine (and associates) sandisk.  *I have found the necessary accessories on amazon or ebay, and find that they provide the adequate fit and protection. A rubber case has protected it the few times I have dropped it.  *Purchased a FM Transmitter that works great and charges the unit while driving.  *After a short period of time one finds the navigation relatively easy. *I have Used Windows Media Player 11 and Urge with the product and have had no problems with transferring files.  Very satisfied with this product. Good value for the money.

<Title>Fantastic MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player on the suggestion of a friend of mine, as an alternative to the iPod. I simply love this thing. This is probably one of the most well thought out MP3 players I have ever seen. It has an expansion slot for more memory if the 4 gigs isn't enough, the battery can be replaced, and the screen is a nice size with excellent resolution. The only complaint that I really have with it, the ring in the middle protrudes a little too far and makes the smaller buttons on the outer edges a little difficult to press. Of all of the MP3 players that I've seen and played around with, this one ranks as tops, even over the Apple Nano, which has serious format limitations. Get yourself a Rhapsody account and you're ready to roll. You'll never need to buy another cd. Just transfer the songs you want, right to this little gem, and get ready to hear fantastic audio quality in your car, office or home.

<Title>didn't deliver
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was really looking forward to an MP3 player that didn't use proprietary hardware.  The Sansa e260 promised that it would show up as a disk drive or enable synching to MediaPlayer. The instructions were sparse and I tried both methods.  This ended up in the device being so scrambled that there was no way to gain control.  It showed up as both full and empty depending on what I was trying to do (get back in control!)  I couldn't delete and I couldn't add and it hung on most operations.  Contacted support and they were quick to help.  We tried upgrading firmware, downgrading firmware, and other esoteric tricks requiring some interesing mulptiple buttons at startup.  Nothing worked and Sandisk offered to send another along.  If it only took me one day to confuse it, I declined their offer and will purchase the product I was trying to avoid.

<Title>Just bought my Sansa a month ago..so far quite pleased
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just bought my Sansa middle of June, so far I am very pleased with it. It plays well, and while the instructions that came with it were essentially useless, after playing around a bit I figured out how to get my music sync'd on it by just using my windows media player. The ear pieces that came with it are fine, but hard to keep in my ears when I am moving around alot. I use it primarily at the gym so I am looking for something that stays put better. I like the controls on it, and I like having the lock switch on it. So far I haven't had any trouble with it playing and the battery seems to last a pretty decent time. That, of course, may all change later, but so far so good. I am glad that I went with something other than the ipod.

<Content>I have owned this product for about 8 months now, and I absolutely love it. I had a lot of trouble with the ipod (it was replaced 3 times because of hardware and software failures) and found their support poor. I decided to look for a music player from someone else, and came across this little gem.   It is light and easy to carry with you, but it is extremely sturdy. I have no worries about breaking it (unlike the nano), but I don't feel burdened carrying it around (sometimes I forget it is in my pocket). Holds plenty of music and it is easy to sync with my computer. I love the radio option and the ability to record. The screen is very good given the size of the unit, and the navigation system is easy to use.  Overall, it is a fantastic product. I would recommend it over similar competitors.

<Content>I can't imagine not having this player.  I use it everyday and everynight(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002BK7KU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7550798-1892912">PillowSonic Stereo Pillow Speaker with Free Relaxation CD</a>).  There are few problems with the device itself (tracks not appearing or erasing occasionally).  Most of the problems come from a conflict with Windows OS and my subscription service (Rhapsody).  To solve problems make sure to update your Windows media player and windows security components.  Also remember to turn your player to MSC usb mode occasionally.  The update program from Sandisk only work on MSC.  Just thought I'd share for those who seem to have problems with this product.

<Title>good player while it worked
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had this player for about a week and loaded it with music and photos using the included software (by the way, it did not come with one software interface for all media formats; instead, you have to use different programs to add different media). It worked fine for awhile. My only other complaint was that the circular dial, for scrolling thru menus, songs, etc., gets in the way of pushing any of the 4 small buttons just outside the dial (see pics).  Recently, however, the player began acting funny. I had not made any additions or changes, that I know of. When certain menu selections were made, the screen would freeze and then the device would reset itself. This happened over and over again for almost any final menu selection. I deleted all the media content, but the problem persisted. I also tried to upgrade the firmware, but I could not switch to the correct USB mode due to the device resetting itself each time I made the selection.   TJM

<Title>Great alternative to IPODs.....High Quality Product!!!
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered my Sansa in Nov. I am so pleased with the product that I had to post a review. Its a great quality product.. I dont like ipods for two reasons.. 1) accesories are so expensive 2) you cannot remove the battery. Several friends have ipods and the battery has stopped charging after a year or so (sometimes even months!) By the way.. I bought on ebay a kit including a silicon case,arm band, car charger adapter and AC adapter.. for about 10 - 12 dlls plus shipping.. they have worked just fine.  A few tips for having a better experience with the sansa. First, install the latest firmware, my version had a issue with playlists, upgraded the firmware and the problem was solved. 2nd:  dont use windows media player for managing your music, in my opinion..it is horrible. I use Winamp, the free version and it works flawless...very easy and fast to transfer music. I have conected the Sansa to several PCs and download music perfectly.  By the way, the FM reception is pretty good and sound quality is great. If you are looking for portable speakers.. get the JBL On tour, they can be used with any mp3 player.. sound great and are quite inexpensive(around 40 dlls on ebay) Dont hesitate to buy this product, you wont regret it... Enjoy your Sansa.

<Title>Made the right choice
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a lot of research before purchasing my first MP3 player. Fairly computer savvy but a novice to MP3 players. Was close to purchasing the Zen but was concerned about how many people said they froze up. Fortunately I looked a little longer and discovered the Sansa e260. Great reviews though some mentioned them freezing up. Seeing that seemed an inherent problem with MP3 players, I knew I'd just have to take my chances. Finally went to the store and actually saw and held both the Zen and Sansa. After examining them both the choice was simple. The Zen felt cheap and not very durable. I liked the weight of the Sansa and the size of the screen. Didn't know if I'd really need 4 GB but figured if I was going to get one I might as well get one with a lot of storage with the ability to add expansion.  All that said, I have had the Sansa for about two weeks and while I have not had the time to REALLY explore all of its features, I can say that so far I am EXTREMELY pleased with it. Downloading music from my computer was cake. It is holding its first charge exceptionally well. After two weeks and about a half-dozen uses the charge is still about 98% full. Don't know but I think that is pretty good. The pre-loaded video demonstration was awesome. Still have a few minor issues with the ease of use of the different menu screens but I'm sure with more time to play with it I will find it very accommodating. I have found the earphones that come with it quite good, but again I've not tried any other headphones with it. I mainly wanted an MP3 player to listen to tunes at the gym and to keep me entertained on upcoming plane travel. So this MP3 player is PERFECT for me. May run into 'issues' down the road, but so far I can say that this is a magnificent piece of technology. I did download the firmware from the Sandisk website (highly recommend visiting it before and after purchasing one of their players), which I think is advisable.  Yes, the buttons on the front are small but I have small fingers so it's not a problem - but could be for a guy or gal with larger fingers. The screen is a very nice size and seems to have very good resolution, although I did finding watching the demo videos a bit difficult and had to find the right angle to hold the player to see them more clearly. But I do think if you want this player for a lot of video downloads you will be pretty satisfied. I do wish (and hope) Sandisk starts producing more accessories specifically for the e200 series, but until that time there are many companies making accessories compatible with the series (can someone recommend which AC adapter charger is safest and best for this MP3 player?). All that said, I can say "So far so Great!" I think this is a very high quality, very user-friendly, durable MP3 player that is worth whatever cost you pay for it (and boy there is a wide range - I would just advise buying it locally and not on-line for the obvious reasons - possibly used, damaged, and if you have to return it you can run into a lot of headaches). I am almost embarassed to say I paid through the nose getting it at Wal-Mart, but if I need to return it it is much easier than having to mail it somewhere, and I was able to play with it before actually buying it. Just a personal choice.  I hope in a week or two I'm not dealing with a dead or dysfunctional MP3 player, but at the moment, early on, being a novice, I think this player ROCKS! I can highly recommend it, and I think if you are down to either a Zen or Sansa, go for the Sansa. The Zen is cute and offers a lot of neat accessories, is smaller and colorful, but the Sansa is far more durable, offers a larger screen, and in all just seems to be a more durable, better quality item. I wasn't even going to go near an Apple Ipod! The "proprietary" conditions with them regarding music downloads really turned me off, and in general the user reviews are not good. Check them all out in person and see what feels 'right' to and for you. But absolutely give the Sandisk a look. I am a very satisfied owner.

<Title>Good decision
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To the people who seem to have a problem with the wheel "hurting their fingers," they need to seriously toughen up.  It is true that the buttons may be difficult to press for people with large fingers, but I think that most peoples problems are user errors.  People complained about having to press buttons twice, but that is because the first press bring the unit out of sleep mode.  Just takes a little getting used to, but it works well. As for the one negative that I have found, I still cannot design my own playlists besides the "GO list" designed on the system.  Songs must be added to the list individually to the list.  I have not been able to load other set playlists on from my windows media player sync.

<Title>Better than iPod for many reasons
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Maybe its just my rebel nature to not flow with the status quo, but I have yet to understand why anyone would choose an iPod over just about any mp3 player.  This is my 3rd player thru the years and the first that is actually "branded."  It is a jewel.  I see complaints about scratching, etc, but any small piece of electronics (think about your cell phones here!) scratch easily.  This player feels durable enough to me and the color screen has an extremely clear display.  I am not tied to a proprietary service that allows me to only play one type of music file.  The player syncs to WinXP as a flash drive; it is recognized and files can be dragged/dropped.  Complicated software is not needed for loading it.  For those who complain about the speed of loading, is your computer USB 2 compatible?  The radio, voice record, and video viewer are all great extras.  But... the one feature that prompted me to purchase this player is a **user replaceable rechargeable battery.**  That is a significant cost saving feature if you have ever owned something of which you could not replace the battery and had to pay a company for that priviledge!

<Title>iPod vs. Sandisk
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> I've bought 2 ipods already, once four years ago and again 2 years ago. The first stopped working, I mailed it back to Apple, and they told me it was no longer covered by the warranty, because of external damaging to the casing (which, incidentally, happened at the beginning of our torrential but short relationship, and had minimal reference outside of this...) they had the audicity to ask me that, for it to be repaired, it would cost more than I initially bought it for. It was a 15 gig model they were no longer making. We lasted 7 months before my heart was broken.  (Yes, my life is 13-17% better having direct and constant access to music)  Now the second iPod I bought was a Mini, used. It was great, a complete conveniency, but once again it stopped working. This time the warranty was voided because I was not the original owner. And yes, I am nitpicking, Apple is technically (contractually) is their right, and this I grant them. But I am an individual, this was my experience with Apple was that they were providing a fix, like drugging their customers to get them hooked, let 'em keep coming back for more. They came upon and then cornered a market in the neccessary progression aurally (like the first makers of CDs or DVDs while everyone else is tapes and VHS) and, as far as customer service, and their side of the transaction, they did a screw job.   Now to SanDisk. This is a quality item I would endorse over the iPod according to its merit...  1) Possible to upgrade with the expansion slot  2) If the battery drops out on you (which it will, this is how consumerism is, a la cars and making a lesser quality product so the consumer will have to spend more, blahblah sick cycle) one can replace it  3) For me it really comes down to having bought 2 iPods and being treated like a number, a profit margin or a training telemarketing and phone centers to refer to section 13 sanction g) when dealing with an irrate consumer, er, customers complaints, be repetitive and condescending till they hang up; or SanDisk, which in 4 months has been no problem, CHEAPER, and better than the iPod, like an improvement, just read other reviews and you will see that this experience resembles a lot of other frustrations over this, and the bottomline is that other companies have to bend over to try and solict customers who are eating up the Apple (yeah, I know, terrible reference with the Apple, so what...).  Apple + thumbs down to the power of screwjob = go ahead and be a sucker if you want to 'consume'  SanDisk with a variable of whether or not I need to vent in 8 months because SanDisk did not cook my eggs right (overhard on Wednesdays) I change this review denouncing them, too, but right now I'm satisfied, eating eggs.

<Title>e260r review: quite the hassle
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa Rhapsody e260r, which I believe is the same as the e260, fell into my temporary possession because a co-worker could not figure out how to use it for a number of weeks.  I spent several hours trying to have it work with various programs or use what was on it to no avail.  I finally was able to delete some gimmicky software from the player and then transfer mp3s to the player either by using the OK Musicmatch Jukebox portable manager and then finally by dragging and dropping.  Either transfer method lost the titles of many of the songs, though they remained sorted by album/artist.  The player's "wheel" is a poor knock-off of the ipod's, which in its many forms that I have used is the best 'hardware' for mp3s that I have found (although I am not a fan of it due to its specific file type & software).  The e260r also has non-intuitive "pause" for stop... no actual "stop" that is apparent... and often a hidden "resume song" (or something to that effect) to get back to where the user was... and other awkward features.  I'm glad I borrowed this player... now I can give it back.

I was so surprised and impressed when I opened the box, plugged in the player and started uploading music onto it.  I really expected to have to download some software and do some formatting etc. but I didn't have to do anything and it was great.    As far as functionality goes, it's super easy to use, very small and lightweight and offers lots of fun features I didn't even know it had (like photo and video storage).

<Title>Nice features, terrible design - not recommended
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this gadget in Nov 2006 as an alternative to the Nano.  I wanted something small and also something that would work with Napster's On-the-go feature, which is not compatible with the iPod.  Had it not been for this particular requirement I actually would have bought the iPod without hesitation.  So, to be straight, I haven't liked this thing almost from the moment I purchased it.  Partly due to design, partly due to reliability issues:  1.  Button design.  The buttons around the wheel are very hard to press b/c they're depressed below the surface of the wheel, unless you jab it with your nail's end. If I want to rewind or fast-foward, my finger won't catch the button properly, even though it feels like it did, and when I release the button the track just skips to the beginning or end instead of rewinding/fast-forwarding... ANNOYING. 2.  Quality.  In the last month, the center function button has been giving me problems and doesn't always respond to my press, as though it's sort of stuck.  Poor mechanical design.  I haven't dropped it or poured water on it... this is a result of simply having used it normally.  If the button stops working, this thing will become totally useless... KILLER. 3.  Record button design.  I never use the record feature, and who does??  But the HUGE button is prominently located on the upper left side, right where it's comfortable to hold your index and ring fingers as you curl them under the device.  Particularly when I jog with it, my finger frequently accidentally hits this button and it STOPS playing the track and starts recording, which is ridiculous, but the worst part is... 4.  Record feature bug.  ... recently, after I accidentally hit the record button, it won't STOP recording!  I press all the buttons to try to make it stop and even try to shut it off, and nothing happens.  It just keeps recording until all available space is used up, making it totally unusable for minutes at a time.  KILLER. 5.  Dumb subscription synch feature.  If you haven't synched it in a couple weeks and you use Napster On The Go, the licences will not have been renewed so you are asked to sync it again to update the licences - FINE, this is normal.  But if I play an album that happens to need renewing, it will cycle through EVERY song and spend seconds on each one, flashing me a message to re-synch.  OKAY, I GET IT.  It won't let me cancel out of this annoying cycle until it's done going through every song in the album.  18 tracks on an album that aren't updated, and man, there's a 2 minutes of my time spent staring at my MP3 player wishing it would just stop.  And the power button won't kill it.  KILLER. 6.  Power button does too much but not what I want it to do.  The power button is a multi-function button that takes you to various menus.  But the bloody thing doesn't really do well what it should:  turn the unit OFF promptly.  It doesn't interrupt certain functions (read above) and seems to be a bit picky, esp b/c you have to hold it down for several seconds to get it to shut off.  If you don't hold it down quite long enough and get impatient, you'll be taken to various menus instead of getting it to shut down.  Not killer, but STUPID.  So, in sum, the design and reliability of this thing have been sub-par by any standard.  Although it plays music with nice audio quality, if I get annoyed with it every other time I use it and it prevents me from playing music, even for just a minute, it's garbage b/c it's not fulfilling its mission as a music player.  On the plus side, the audio is quite nice - although the audio on the iPod is better, as the equalization is simply better.  The video feature is really awesome.  the screen is nice and bright, and synching video with the included converter is pretty easy.  Photos display well, too.  The recorder, I presume, works well but I never use it. I suppose it could be handy if you're looking for that feature.    My conclusion is that this is a nice unit with good features and good ideas that make it a good contender to the iPod.  But with so many little, simple flaws that inhibit my easily using it, which drive me crazy, and bigger reliability issues with buttons, I wouldn't go near it despite the attractive feature set.

<Title>Best Mp3 Player -  Sansa E260
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In the past I got myself a fake iPod.  Once it broke I decided to check out the Sansa E260 MP3 player.  So I did some research and thought that the E260 was the best player on Cnet.  So I got one from Wal-Mart and tried it out.  So far I like it the blue turn wheel makes it very sexy I even had friends asking me if it was a new iPod?  I told them it's just a Sansa E260 now everyone I know has one.  I also gave one to my girlfriend and she decided to buy a pink leather case while I got the black leather case.  Which I purchase from Amazon.    Pros:   1.8 inch screen - Great for viewing photos/movies Turn Wheel:  Very Sexy and like the color - Matches my PC and my Blue LED Fans Buttons:  Very easy to move and it's like the iPod Nano button system  Cons: Freezing:  I heard it does freeze and I had a E260 that would freeze during charging or syncing files. Firmware:  Sansa's new firmware isn't good the Song titles and artist are not space out and it looks weird Software:  Easy to convert movies/photos.  However it doesn't change gifs to moving photos when coverted to the player. Battery Charging:  Only thru the USB Cable to PC.  However I seen some off brands that will charge it thru the wall or car charger.  Also when charging you can't listen to you're songs. Accessories:  Very limited not much to buy with the player.

<Title>quite good but some troubles
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT INSTEAD OF AN IPOD BECAUSE YOU CAN EASILY CHANGE THE BATTERY (INSTEAD OF AN EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT WITH APPLE IPOD) AND BECAUSE IT HAS A RADIO AND YOU CAN RECORD FROM IT. I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT BUT A FEW DAYS LATER IT FROZE. APPARENTLY IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME PROBLEM WITH WINDOWS. FORTUNATELY THE PEOPLE FROM TECNICHAL SANSDISK SUPPORT WERE VERY HELPFUL AND FOLLOWING THEIR ADVICE I WAS ABLE TO RESET IT ( I THINK YOU ACTUALLY FORMAT THE DISK INSIDE)BUT I LOST ALL THE INFORMATION STORED. NOW I AM HAPPY AGAIN BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM I HAD CAN HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY SHOULD SOLVE IT BEFORE SELLING THE PRODUCT

<Content>I find the device easy to use and so far I've had no problems with it. The only drawback is that you have to connect it to a USB port to charge it. Sandisk should sell it with a home charger, at least that is what I would like; therefore, only 4 stars.

<Title>Good Features
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very pleased with my MP3 player.  I have loaded over 650 songs on my 4 GB unit and have room to spare.  The radio seems to work well too.  I like the fact that I can replace the battery if it wears out.  The controls are confusing and the Sandisk's instructions are poor.  Other players which cost more have better controls.  I actually phoned Sandisk's help number and they were very good - they solved my confusion.

<Title>Good for music and radio!
<Date>Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this some time ago.. barely used it. Music works great. good quality. I like the Radio feature too but one thing that fails is the video feature.. you'd think that a video that is 640x480 on your computer and 20mbs would be smaller in size when converted to such small res. but thats not the case here... the video triples and sometimes quadruples in size! its amazing. I don't like how the little software that Sandisk provides us with gives us absolutely no control over the settings while converting a video.. and longer videos don't even convert fully... say past a minute? it just stops.  but it's alright since I don't really plan on watching any video on a screen that small.  Over all I'd recommend this strictly for the music. if you want video, go get an ipod video or a zune. they are much more better.

<Title>Sansa - a great mp3 player, excellent value
<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned the 4gb version for nearly 1-year now and I love it!  The fact that this does not use "touch buttons" (like ipod and creative's devices) is a huge advantage in my mind. That means you do not have to press the hold button every time you place the player in your pocket and again when you want to change something. Not being forced to use itunes or any other music software is also a key factor for me. I've never used the video feature as I have no desire to watch video on a 2" screen.  In my opinion, Sandisk's Sansa is the only other real competitor in the flash memory mp3 space.  Hey Mr. Softy - why not just buy SNDK (only $12B) and stop throwing away $$$ on your very poor internal attempts?  Positives: * Works extremely well with Media Player 10 - simply click and drag. But you don't have to use any particular software, no need to feel stuck with MP or itunes.    * Actual buttons - no touch wheels.  You do not have to use the "hold" button when it is in your pocket.   * Solid music organization software. Sandisk constantly provides updates which you are alerted to when you connect to your computer.  * FM player * Great battery life (also battery is replaceable, I bought a cheap back-up just in case) * Relatively cheap * SD micro memory expansion * Not an ipod! I personally hate having the same thing as everyone else, plus apple has always annoyed me with their proprietary/closed systems * Nice and small, but yet not fragile feeling. The metal backside gives it a solid feel (I've dropped mine numerous occasions with no issues).  Negatives:  * You need to remove 4 small screws to get to the battery.  I have had my Sansa freeze up maybe 7-10 times over the past 10 months.  To reset the player, you need to remove the battery, so it can be a bit annoying to have to use a small screw driver (would be better if you could access the battery as easy as on a cell phone). But given the infrequency of this issue, it has not proved to be the end of the world.  * I really don't like the record button on the side.  This gets accidentally pressed somewhat often (maybe 2-3 time a month), which can be annoying.  If I could, I would disable this button.  Who wants to record the radio or a conversation with their mp3 player anyway? Maybe some people do, but I personally will never ever (intentionally) use this feature. * Not a ton of add-on products.  This seems to be gradually changing, but I have not seen a nice car player built specifically for the Sansa.  Not a big deal for me, since I find an old school tape player adapter to sound way better than generic FM transmitters in my car (which has a high end Bose stock system) and I have bought a really cheap AC charger from a 3rd party.

<Title>Perfect for me
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an excellent device.  Its easy to use right out the box. Very stylish, I love the blue glow spin wheel. the sound quality is great, but the ear buds it comes with are not. I have my own much better pair that made a difference in sound quality. the video play back is very clear and crisp even for the small screen.  The recorder is excellent for radio and voice. The expansion slot is a great extra feature. If you can find a card on sale you can upgrade for far less than paying for the next level built in storage. The buttons take a little adjusting to if you had an ipod, its not a click wheel but not to difficult.  The menu/power button is odd but not a terrible feature.  The only hang up is no bookmarking for audio books. In all it is a great portable media player that I'm glad I purchased.

<Content>The Sansa has been great so far.  When I bought it for him, I had read some unflattering reviews about the screen freezing and having to download new firmware... none of that has proven to be true.  He loves it, has plenty of space, ergonomically fine, good screen, good sound... what else could you want?  We subscribed to Rhapsody and intend to keep it.  I'd recommend it to all those who don't want to be a drone in lock-step to the Apple hype.

<Title>Awsome
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I friggen love this thing as my first mp3 player I did a ton of research before buying and i must say I love this unit. I have my entire cd colletion on here at 128 mbps with a little under a gig of space left. the factory sound quality is not that great but it has a custom eq with 5 different sliders so after about fifteen minutes of tweeking I got this thing diled right in. Ditch the factory headphones Im using a pair of sony Highest end ear buds (non sound isolating) and the bass hits as hard as my car. battery lasts forever. Read some reviews about synching taking for ever.. If you down convert the bit rate from your computer to the player it has to convert the file before it synches and yes this takes forever. But if you turn of the auto synching in windows media player after the initial download. it only takes like two minutes or less to add a cd. have not tried video or pics. Would never do the pics but I wouldnt mind trying the video wish i would have gotten the 6gb unit.. I cant compare to i pod as ive never owned one but I am perfectly pleased with this unit.. My only complaint is that it took me a while to figure out that auto synche deal..

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player performs exactly as it says it will. We bought three; one for me, one for my lady, and one as a present for a friend, because we thought so highly of the earlier ones we bought. These purchases were after several other brands that were very disappointing.      I've been using it for about two months now, with no problems. It's everything I could want in an mp3 player, plus the FM radio receiver, which works very well. The battery is easily replaceable (unlike the iPod), although I haven't had any reason to do that yet.      Songs are easy to download with a drag-and-drop facility from your computer's HD. Your can also sync to WPM playlists. It charges the battery by simply plugging in the USB connector to a USB port on your computer, and the battery runs for several hours on a single charge. Sound quality is good. You can also store images and videos, if you want to eat up the memory space with that kind of thing. I'll admit to loading on a video of G.W. Bush bloopers for entertaining my politically-aware friends.  MY ADVICE: Avoid iRiver players. We bought one and it promptly failed. A Google search revealed a lot of other people who experienced the same kind of problems: the OS fails and is usually impossible to get working again. We also bought a generic Chinese player. It kind of works, although the user's manual is such bad Chin-lish that we show it to people to get a guaranteed half hour of uncontrollable laughter. Beyond the humor value, the manual is utterly unintelligible; there's no way of learning how the thing works!      Also, unless you're an absolute diehard Apple fanatic, stay away from the popular iPod. It's much too expensive, very proprietary (Apple has a long history of shooting themselves in the foot with this approach), and there are battery problems (again, a Google search will fill you in on the details of this problem).      If all you want is an mp3 player that has all the latest features and works exactly as advertised, you can't go wrong with the Sansa player. I suspect there are other players out there that also perform well. There's certainly an overwhelming assortment of them. But, if you want to be sure you get your money's worth without doing extensive research, you won't go wrong with the Sansa.

<Content>This player is very simple to use. I like how much music it holds. To me it is not perfect because the unit does not put songs in the order that you download them unless it is an entire CD. I am still trying to figure out how to download video to the player. It comes with software to do this but isn't always easy for me. I do like the adjustable equalizer so that I can find the sound that I like.

<Title>Definitely A Worthy iPod Nano Competitor
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had been using an iRiver h10 for a little under a year and it died a horrible firmware death that was unrepairable, so I got this unit as its replacement.  Let's clear up one thing up front:  THIS UNIT DOES NOT SUPPORT MP3's ABOVE 256KBPS.  SanDisk does not acknowledge this or post this as a part of the product, but their tech support will admit it if you call them about it.  The 256kbps cap isn't  asuggestion -- the unit will choke and stutter badly on anything higher bitrate.  So just know that ahead of time that you'll have to convert your MP3's down to 256kbps at least before you can use them on it, and plan accoridngly.  For me it was an annoying oversight (especially since my old iRiver H10 happily played 320kbps files), but not a really big deal because with a half-hour of work I could convert my 320kbps files down to 256kbps and transfer them over for use.  All that aside, it's a great little player with a very nice display for its size and value.  The sound is good, controls and UI are solid, and the battery life is fanatstic (2 more hours batt. life than a Nano).  Its 4GB of storage is a solid capacity and value.  The playlist plays through a number randomize function, which is a GOOD thing.  Each song is assigned a number, and when a randome number is chosen the corresponding song plays.  This is nice for one reason -- if you change the contents of the drive while it's paused, the device won't choke when it tries to resume a file that's no longer there.  Instead it will play whatever file has that same number now, or skip ahead to a new number if that number simply no longer exists.  It's a very small thing in the grand scheme of things, but a big annoyance that it prevents and I've seen other players not be abel to handle such a simple scenario.  One other downside I found was the media conversion tool to import photos and video (since this unit plays video).  On the video side it unfortunately converts to QuickTime, which is IMHO an absolutely terrible video format that results in bloated movie size on the device (80 MB video files become ~160 MB after conversion).  However it converted over my little DivX movies with almost no hitch.  And the screen is small for video, but not entirely unwatchable.  I personally still find it more novelty than useful though, but it deifnitely works as well as it can.  On top of it all, it also offers MicroSD expansion, and a rather nice FM Tuner -- neither of which an iPod can boast.  So if you don't want to be an iSheep, and you don't need iTunes or similar music management software to help manage your device and are happy with Windows Explorer copy-n-paste to move your media on, this really is a very nice little player for its price.  I have to say I enjoy it a lot and would definitely recommend it, especially to anyone specifically trying to avoid Apple's iPod empire.  IMHO it not only matches them, but beats them in many areas.

<Title>Problems with Video and Support
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device is advertised as a Video Player.     To Transfer videos you are required to use the supplied Media Conversion software.    Any Video converted with the included software which is over 30 minutes gets split up into multiple videos on the player.  That is not a problem but the second, third, etc video file do not play correctly.  The video is jumpy and does not match the sound.    Sandisk was contacted multiple times and they suggested I try transferring with another computer...  Did that, no help.     Try formating the player (losing everything I loaded) then try again, no help.    Finally they are basically washing their hands of the issue and saying they don't support the software they provided and require you to use (which comes from ARCsoft).    The software is required for loading videos but they will not support it!    They want me to contact the software company to get them to support the free software.   That will never happen.   My last request to them asking for alternate softwae solutions has not yet been responded to.  I am strongly considering returning my device.

<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used this product for approximately 5 months and I love it. It does everything you would expect of an MP3 player plus it also has video capability, an FM radio, and can be a voice recorder. All in a very small package. I especially like the Windows interface for depositing songs onto the MP3 player. Rip the song with your favorite software and then simply drag -and-drop it onto your player, it is that easy. I would use this method and avoid the MP3 software that comes with the player. I found it cumbersome and non-intuitive.

<Title>Great MP3 at a good price!
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got Sansa e-260 4 GB about a month ago and I have really enjoyed it.  I had previously owned a Rio Sport and a Dell DJ Ditty.  I was tired of the "disposable" feel to both of these; I did not, however, want to invest in an Ipod Nano or Video Ipod.  The Sansa was a great alternative to both of these.       The size is great, it is very small and the screen is crystal clear.  I have not yet downloaded movies to it, but I have downloaded pictures and it really couldn't be easier.  The price on this is reasonable for the stylish design and the features.  It is really a great looking player.  The sound quality is good on most of my music...there are only a few tracks that the volume needs to be up a little louder, but this could also be because they are copied tracks. You cannot make multiple playlists, only one "GO List", but otherwise navigating your music is super easy.   The case it comes with is really nothing more than a felt envelope, so be prepared to buy a case of some sort, but that really is the only thing that I have to say on the negative front. My 15 year old son saw it and loved the look and features, so we will be buying another one for him. Great, affordable MP3 with a stylish look!

<Content>With a 4 gb drive and additional SD slot for more space, the Sansa e260 4 gb mp3 is far superior to the overhyped, overpriced Ipod. I cannot belive people, especially the younger uninformed crowd continues it's one sided love affair for anything Ipod. Sansa lasts much longer and provides piece of mind. I know that it will be there when I want it to perform and the music and photos are outstanding. Why run like lemmings to everything Ipod? Grow up.

<Title>Lets be realistic...good but not great.
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>People seem to be overrating this product just because it is not an iPod.  Is everyone so amazed by the fact that another company can but out a halfway decent mp3 player?  I think their expectations of this unit are way too low.    Anyway, here's the good stuff. +Good style, the blue on black is very nice. +Cheap, you're not gonna find this much storage for this price in any other mp3 player. +Its not an iPod, which means it will work with subscription music services like Napster and Rhapsody and you don't have to use iTunes.  Now for the bad. -The e200 does have some quality issues.  Others have already mentioned that it may stop playing out of one side of your headphones.  This has happened intermittently on mine over the past 2 months I've had it.  It also lost all my music licenses so all the files on there were useless.  I had to wait until I got home that now and format the whole thing then copy over 3gb of songs again. -The middle wheel is just not right.  It is no where near as smooth as the iPod's or the creative zen's navigation control.  You'll find that sometimes it just goes one too far. -It takes awhile to boot up.  It takes somewhere between around 15 seconds to turn on where you'll be standing there having to listen to other people talk on their cell phones. -The hold button is not well placed.  It is too close to the headphone jack on the top so it cannot be reached easily when trying to take off hold with just your right hand. -The interface needs to be streamlined.  When listening to music it takes two separate button clicks to get back to your music list.  Depending on where you go it may have to hit another button twice to get back.  The center wheel can be used to navigate up and down but you can also also use the buttons located on the top and bottom of it to do the same thing.  This is redundant.  Instead the functionality should be spread out allowing quicker navigation.  All in all this is a good mp3 player.  The best reason to buy it however is its price.  Compared side by side to other units it doesn't stand up.  A few small fixes and it could be an iPod killer, but right now its more of an ankle biter.

<Title>e260r rhapsody version
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK, so I wish somebody would have reviewed the rhapsody version when I was shopping.  Not sure Amazon has it yet.  BUT, WOW.  First, it is FAR superior to any ipod because with rhapsody, you sign up for the service for $15/month, but then you can listen to ANYTHING you want.  You don't have to buy or rip everything you want on your player.  Since I got rhapsody, I haven't touched my CD collection at all.  All you have to do is type in the name of an artist you want and you can put a single song, or the whole CD on your player with a simple drop and drag. No 99 cent charge!  It's unlimited!!  It also has "radio stations" that come pre-made, or you can pick artists you like and it will play them and others who are similar at random.  It's a great way to listen to new music that you might love.  Basically, this service is unlimited.  I can't believe everybody hasn't switched to this!  Also, unlike an ipod, the player comes with FM radio (that you can record) -- which comes in really handy at the gym when you need it to listen to TV, or if you want the current news or whatever.  It also has a voice recorder, so you can make notes for yourself or record a lecture, or whatever.  The battery lasts 20 hours!  It's light, and since it's on flash, it's more durable than a hard-drive model.  I'm in love.

<Title>Easy to use so far....
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player because I already had a subscription to Napster, and it was listed as a compatable player.  I had a 1gb card that I bought by accident, so I was able to use it with this device luckily.  After I took the time to delete off all the items I would never use (sample videos, photos, and all of the Rhapsody playlists) I found I have a lot of space... 425 songs so far and still 2 gb left!  Also, once I got used to having to switch between modes and logging on to update music (which I have to do anyway to power up the battery) it's been fairly simple uploading.  Napster allows me to make playlists, I could upload CD copies from iTunes, and both can be blended by Rhapsody, so I am set.  No major problems so far except I can't find a decent pair of plug in speakers to play it through.  Headphones, no problem.

<Title>Simply awesome.... And inexpensive!
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not a very tech-savvy guy so please take my review with a pinch of salt.  After using it for a few days, I fail to understand why people buy iPod. This mp3 player is significantly cheaper, has nice features and doesn't look bad either.  I love the FM radio and recording features which I believe iPod lacks. You can also expand its memory by plugging in a memory card.  The only gripe is that the navigation buttons are a bit difficult to access because of the elevated dial but I can live with that.   All in all an excellent product.

<Title>Excellent multi media player
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Excellent multi media player  I love this player from the first look at it. I have got 4 months ago SanDisk Sansa 250 2GB for my daughter and I really like it. The only concern I have for it was the size of the memory 2GB. It is not big enough for a videos and movies. Therefore I have got Sansa 260 with 4GB this time. It all work nice and I am happy with the radio, video, music and record ability. Battery last for long time - I have tried to dry out the battery in order to trained after that with full charge and it took over 17 hours to exhausted it completely by playing music and radio. I have loaded a lot of pictures and about 1000 songs and my Spanish lessons with no problems. Performance so far is flawless. It is very good gadget for the price and in my opinion it is better than I-pods. Enjoy it

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product because I was looking for the most options and the lowest price in an MP3 player. The radio gets great reception. The photos are clear and colorful. The record function is easy to use and high quality. The mp3 files are easy to organize and navigate, and the sound quality is great. This player can handle a variety of music file formats, and it works with any computer I plug it into (I have to change its USB function for some). The only weakness that I have found is in the video function. While the Sansa plays 15-60 second video clips with ease, I have had no success loading longer videos onto this player. I never expected to sit and watch movies on it, but I hoped to load a few tv shows. I recommend this player.

<Title>Sandisk MP3 - first experience of an MP3
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Haven't got any previous experience with MP3's so have nothing to compare it with. The sound is very good and the operation is extremely easy. The downside is the ear pieces - which keep falling out - would recommend they change to something more universally fitting and comfortable.

<Title>Sansa e260 4gb mp3 player
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was peeking around for an mp3 player that would hold more than ten minutes' worth of tunes but didn't have to have enough space for the Congressional Library's archive of music.  And thus, I settled on this one.  goods -sturdy; not invincible, but sturdy contstruction -radio -fluid file transfer; just click and drag folders or files -good sound quality, and it has a volume inhibiter so you don't blow out your eardrums, you pantywaist, you.   bads -has frozen up once or twice.  just unscrewed the battery cover, disconnected the battery, reconnected and closed up.  seemed to solve the problem -some files corrupted for no apparent reason (but then again, i'm no techie wiz).  ended up formatting the whole memory, and haven't had a problem since.  quite pleased so far, so if you're like me and don't want an iPod because theyr'e EVERYWHERE, this is a purty darn good buy (and a hell of a lot less flimsy than the Nano)

<Title>Good MP3 player and voice recorder
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm quite pleased with this device.  The built-in FM radio has good reception and sounds good.  It also has a built-in voice recorder that I'll use when traveling to make notes about pictures I take.  No more tapes to bother with!  The only thing with which I am not satisfied are the ear buds.  They are uncomfortable and don't stay in my ears very well.

<Title>This is a great alternative for a Nano
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this Sansa two months ago after seeing one of my friends with it. i was impressed with the memory size and the striking resemblance to the nano. this player was a really good decision, i have not had any problems getting my music onto the player, but i did have one issue when i tried to put a video onto the sansa. when i converted the video files, a part near the end of the video was completely lost, it had vanished. i tried this with other video's, but the same thing happened. a 5 minute video that i had did play in full though, so i think its only with the long vids. other than that, the sansa is great. the tactile scrollwheel takes time to get used to, and the side buttons are hard to press unless you use two hands. the best thing about this sansa is the amazingly amazing brightness. the lowest brightness level is about the same as a nano, and the highest is incredible. the voice recorder has great resolution, you can record songs from the built in radio too, which is pretty cool. the headphones that come with the player are really good, they're big, so they fit in your ear. its a bit harder to get back to your song list than with a nano, you have to push the bottom button, scroll to "Back to Music List" and press the center button. battery life is great, i have never drained the battery completely, and i charge it like once a week. so all in all, there are some weird aspects of this player, but it is still a great buy, and if you are thinking of buying a nano, this mp3 is a lot cheaper and a lot cooler, wit more memory.

<Title>Great product, lack accessories though....
<Date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After researching on MP3 players for several months, I finally decided to get the Sansa 4GB unit right around Christmas time and have been very satisfied with the product.  It has great battery life, and it had never died on me, the music quality is great.  The photo quality is also great.  The scroll wheel can be improved though.  I love the FM radio although sometimes reception is not that good.  The only thing that I feel is that there isn't enough accessories that go w/ this product.  If I had more accessories to choose, this would get a 5-star.

<Title>A terrific MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great MP3 player. I researched several players and decided to go with this one. I am very happy I chose the SanDisk Sansa e260 MP3 player. It's a nice size and easy to use. It works with Windows Media Player 11. I have not had any trouble adding music, photos or videos. The sound is very good. The photos and videos look great. I also purchased a silicone skin belt clip and a screen protector to protect it from scratches. I would highly recommend this MP3 player, I am very satisified.

<Title>Great features, good value.
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought a couple of these for my kids (12 and 10), even though they both wanted Nanos.  When I asked them why they wanted a Nano, it had NOTHING to do with features, performance or value.  I want a pink one!  All my friends have Nanos!  They look cool!  When we actually went to a local store to physically compare the Nano and Sansa side by side, and I explained the Nano had an FM tuner, could play videos, had a voice recorder, bigger screen and was less money, they were sold.  My daughter now tells me her friends with Nanos are now jealous of her Sansa.  She loves being able to play music videos, not only music.  Sure the screen is tiny, but it is workable.  I try to teach my children about making intelligent choices, and not simply following the crowd.  The Nano is a good player, the Sansa is also a good player, but has more features and is a better value.  If you want function and value, the Sansa has the Nano beat hands down.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Both units are working perfectly.  Good sound, easy to navigate, no issues uploading media (audio and video), id3 tags work perfectly, good FM reception.  My kids even use the voice recorder to practice presentations they have to do in school.  Very happy with the Sansa.

<Title>I Like It
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got this one a week ago---e260 4 gig--easy to load with music using Windows Media Player, in fact I had a lot of music in Itunes, so I transferred them to cd's and then loaded them into WMP--worked great!! The only problem I have had is playing it through my car stereo--I have an aux input in my car radio, but none of the songs are loud enough for me. I have to have the volume up to MAX, and the player on HIGH, and stll some songs do not play loud enough to hear them.

<Title>TERRIBLE product, and bad service
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my wife a year ago.  Within the first month she was having problems with it freezing.  The customer service person said to take the battery out and restart it(which required a glasses repair kit for a screwdriver that small).  This became a monthly routine until recently when it would stop playing out of one headphone (tried multiple headphones) and it never worked.  Since the 1 year warranty is up Sandisk has offered NO help.  I would NOT recomend this product the system freezes, sound quality is Average (when working), and it is a pain to use the multiple software programs to load the different files onto it (MP3, .jpg, mass files, etc.).

<Title>Awesome Overall
<Date>Mon Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It has great features, the sound is great, the look is great.. I just had one problem. When I added all of my songs to it right when I got it, there was a bunch of songs I didn't like so I plugged it in and delted them from the music folder... When I turned it back on the songs were still there on the list. When I tried to play them it would come up with "bad track" and skip to the next song, it still does that to this day and is very annoying. But other than that it's a great buy.

<Title>Neat little device
<Date>Mon Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had my Sansa e260 for over 2 weeks now.  No problems so far.  Have read many complaints about the navigation wheel and location of the control buttons beside the wheel, but I find both to work just fine.  Only problem I have encountered is lack of a bookmark function for  audio books, otherwise would have rated it 5 stars.

<Title>Beats The Ipod By a Mile
<Date>Tue Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I dont wana say much, but i have owned 2 different ipods, shuffle 2nd gen and nano first gen. The 2 gig Sansa is cheaper than an ipod shuffle (1 gig) and has more space. This is either 60 or 100$$ cheaper than a 2 gig ipod nano.also the expansion slot allows you to add from just 1 gig to 8 gigs more space, both of which are cheaper than and ipod nano 2g. all i can say is dont go for the name, go for the game(that was lame)i dont know how else to persuade you to buy this...JUST BUY IT

<Title>Problems with Sansa.
<Date>Sun Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's a lot to like about this mp3, however they seem to have some serious quality control issues.  We bought two and have had to replace 1 once and the other twice.  The good news is that they go bad while still under warranty.  If not for what to me is a huge problem, I would rate this product at least 4 stars.
