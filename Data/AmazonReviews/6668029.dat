<Title>Excellent Price Point, Leaves a Bit to be Desired
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved my Nextar MA99T in the mail today, and upon the transfer of several songs to it, I noticed a very interesting and notable thing--the audio output of this MP3 player measures 2.5mm (1/10") in diameter, as opposed to the generally accepted by every modern audio component manufacturer's 3.5 mm (1/8") stereo mini plug.  Such a serious disparity with other MP3 players should be mentioned on Nextar's website, or at least the Instruction Manual (which I found poorly written and not entirely helpful).  Thus I was very disappointed when I couldn't plug the headphones I currently owned into the player, and am forced to use the rather crappy earbuds included with the product.  I highly recommend purchasing an adapter that will make this player compatible with your current (or any different) set of headphones.  Minus that rather strange deviation from the electronic norm, this player is a rather stylish piece of manufacturing, as well as a pretty sturdy player.  The audio quality seems rather decent for a player of this size, but I cannot comment on its quality fully until I can listen to it on some decent headphones.  I find the buttons easy to use, and simply and logically arranged.  I find that the buttons react readily and consistently to me pressing them, without my having to press a button more than once.  I'd say the player's biggest flaw is its employment of a 2.5 mm output.  The unit is extremely portable, which is a plus.  However, if one is searching for booming sound, this unit has a rather low power output (one internal lithium ion battery, 1.5 volts) that generates 4mW per side.  Again, can't totally comment on that because of the terrible earbuds, but it seems like the volume is a little weak.  It's no IPod Nano, but the screen is easy to read, even if the navigation of the menus is a bit convoluted.  The backlight is nice.  I was kind of duped into thinking the exterior was manufactured out of metal--it seems upon further inspection that it is a metal finish applied to a plastic shell.  However, it is still an attractive and durable unit.  Haven't had a chance to test out its battery life (I don't really want to carry it around until I can use some decent headphones with it) but I feel like it will be annoying for some people to charge the unit solely through their computer's USB port.  Overall, those with a little more money to spend would do well do purchase a more expensive model, but a direct cost vs. value comparison reveals a pretty good buy with the 1 gigabyte Nextar MA99T model MP3 player.

<Content>This mp3 player, bought for Christmas, has stopped working already.  First the names of the songs got all wonky, saying one thing while playing another.  Now the battery will not hold a charge at all.  Spend your money on something better!

<Title>if it dont work then send it back to amazon
<Date>Mon Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i got my first one of these a few weeks ago. everything was fine, but the usb cord sent with it dont work so i am using a digital camera one. but before you start addin things to it you must first format it. the manual wont say it but the nextar site says to. i requested a return from amazon and got the new one sent to me in like 3 days. and all i have to do is send back the bad one at a nominal cost to myself. no 25 bucks like the nextar company wants. but as for now the new one is working fine. just remember to format it when u get it and always use the remove hardware safely feature on your computer.

<Title>It doesn't work
<Date>Sat Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these for my 15 yr. old.  It came in the mail fairly quickly, but upon plugging in, all it will do is say low battery.  The unit will not take a charge.  I contacted the seller, and they refunded the before ship price.  All in all, I would have to say this thing is junk, buyer beware.

<Title>Never buy a Nextar product
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product because of the features that it claims it has.  This product is a pile of junk.  It kept turning itself on and off, whether I try to turn it on or plug it into the USB port on my computers (tried on both my desktop and laptop at home).  I called tech support and told them everything I tried to get it to work and all they did was tell me to try the same things again.  I called tech support once more and finally found out how to get it replaced.  They charged me $25.00 to ship a replacement and when it came, it did the EXACT SAME THING the original did.  My wife called the company once more and was told that we could not get a refund.  Save yourself some trouble.  Do not purchase anything from Nextar.  Do not invest in Nextar.  Do not utter the word "Nextar"

<Content>I don't remember all the things wrong with this. Mostly, it was very poor quality. I'm pretty sure the one I received didn't work and that's why it got sent back.

<Title>It's shiny junk, but still junk.
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a gift, intending to load it up with music for my sis before sending it off. Glad I did that, because it gave me the opportunity to see this thing in action before disappointing my sister with it. First of all the buttons are really difficult to push. Sometimes they work and sometimes not. Second, the on/off switch fell off the minute I touched it. Third the interface is insultingly awful. I agree with whomever said to spend your money elsewhere. They should have put less effort into the pretty casing and more into the workings of this thing. I've already tossed it aside and ordered a Sandisk for her. This thing is total junk and isn't worth the materials it's made of.
