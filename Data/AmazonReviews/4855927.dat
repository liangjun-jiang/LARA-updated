<Title>I-Pod ??? I don't think so!
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've eagerly waited for a device that could do all the things the 704 says it can do.  And believe me I've had all the devices out there.  1st gen I=pod to Video I-pod and the Archos 704 Wifi blows them away.  If you are a true techie like myself you'll have to agree that nothing comes close to this little baby.  The screen is excellent especially if you have Divx files, not to mention that it can handle almost any video file out there with the plugins of course.  Mpeg, VOB, WMV, Divx and even Apple Mp4 files without a hickup.  I used to own the Archos 504 but when I saw this baby, wow was I sold.  Connecting to my home wireless network is a breeze and using it as a file server took a bit longer than I expected, but once I was up and running it was easy!  What I'll be looking for next is the ability to watch streaming video or music and then I'll die happy!  In a nutshell, an I-pod is nice to have if you're just into music and paying for one at $299 is not the best way I like spending my money.  I hooked it up to my plasma and it was like renting a DVD movie, clear and sound was pretty good.  I also hooked it up to my LCD projector and was surprised that the quality was also good.

<Title>Very Cool
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a cool product.  Easy to use, great sound, and color.  With docking station it can record directly from your tv.  The only problem I am having is getting movies on it from my computer.  I have not tried to call anyone about it.

<Title>Great for the flight trips...
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the best entertainment you can imagine in an airplane. Much better than the little screen I used before on my Ipod Video. The perfect choice for everybody who travels. Only remark is that there is no place for the stylus in the machine, so I am quiet sure that I have to buy severel of these during the next periode;-)

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me start out buy saying that I have always been a huge Archos fan. This is my third one and it is GARBAGE. It arrived borken (from Archos). Instead of taking the broken unitback and sending me a new one, they insisted on trying to fix it. It came back still not working. I was told to wait 5-6 weeks for a firmware update, that would fix my issues. When the firmware did finally come, it did nothing to address any of my issues. So called them. Still wouldn't send a new one; wanted to try to fix it again. I paid, again, to have it sent out. Came back broken again. Keep in mind, each time you send it to their horrible tech and customer service, it takes 4-5 weeks to get back. So now I called them and told them I just want to return the item for a refund. I was told I was past my 30 days! hahahhaha. I told them I haven't had a working unit for 1 day and the only reason I have held onto the unit is because you guys told me your firmware would fix it. So I now have mailed the unit back a third time and it has been sitting in limbo with them for 4 weeks now. I ordered this unit the day it was released. It is now months and months later, and I still have no working item; even worse, the nest generation 705's will probably been weeks away when I finally do get a wroking unit. This customer support is pathetic. I am a huge backer of Archos, and I am telling people to avoid this company like the PLAGUE. They got to big to quick and can't keep up with what is going on around them. They don't care what their customers think as long as they haveyour money. You will hear a ton of people say that "mine works fine - I don't know what he is talking about". Trust me. Go to any Archos site dedicated to Archos, and there is just one horror story after another, talking about broken units and zero help in getting them repaired or replaced. If you happen to get on of these lemon units, the company will acts as if it is your problem and you must have done something to cause it. As stated...I have always been such a huge Archos fan and have heared the horror stories, but now that I am on their side of the fence, I know completely what they are talking about. STAY CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY. Purchasing anything from them is like putting $500 down on black in roullette -- you have a 50-50 chance of hitting with a winning unit, but if you don't your out %500. Because they will not give you your money back and it will pretty much become a second job getting it fixed (they put you on hold fo HOURS at a time - and then they eventually just let the phone system disconnect you. At which point you have to call over and get back into the waiting line - which will take hours again). Please do yourself a favor. Look at Cowon or some other company.

<Title>Good device overal, mediocre WiFi performance
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to rate this device just about slightly above average.  It supports only 16 millions color, so some of your higher color pictures might not display correctly. Large files (>4MB) take a couple seconds to load. Photo viewer software is similar to the iPod's, all of your pictures are shown on screen and you have to scroll around to find the one you are looking for. I wish Archos let us organize the photo to folder on screen (you can do this, but not through the viewer).  7" screen is great for web surfing, if you have a decent wifi signal like at home. I tried it with some public network, and while it can detect the networks, it could not connect at all and this is the deal killer for me. If accessing the internet is what you want, this is not really for you. Especially you can buy a laptop now for less or just a $100 more.  Video player is good. I have no complaints there.  I will wait for the 5th generation. However, I believe this is the only Archos that comes with 7" screen. If you don't care about wifi capability, this Archos is definitely for you.

<Title>Better than a Ipod
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 704 is just like a ipod almost.  I love the bigger screen and being able to transfer my recorded shows from my dvr is great.  Only draw back is it is taped in real time and not a direct transfer.  I put all my music videos on it because it is to hard trying to watch them on a small ipod.

<Title>Cool for recording kids shows and in-car viewing
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using Archos since the AV400 for the same purpose: get rid of the "Are we there yet?". the touch screen is cool but not so if you had to use your finger instead of the stylus; you'll really have to press hard and get your finger prints all over the screen. You'll have to purchase the DVR cradle before you could record from TV. The timed recording is good too, but the new Generation 5 that's almost available on the market now has a feature that enables you to record a specific show from the Program Guide.  PROS: -	clear screen, touch screen -	good sound -	good battery life (enough for a 3-hour trip) -	ok WiFi reception (if you were desperate to go online!) -	good portable backup -	all functions are easily accessible by remote control -	records and plays in multiple video formats (AV series used to only record and play AVI)  CONS: -	nowhere to place the stylus when docked -	you need to buy a DVR docking station to record from TV (not needed in the old AV series) -	very slow PDF reader (takes forever to load the user manual)

<Title>It needs work
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the 704 in August and while I really only wanted it to view my photos I found that it was a locked system, even though it runs on Linux. You can't add any programs or other software to it. It is suppose to have Adobe Acorbat on it but I can't get it to open. I have not been able to download a complete movie yet, it always cuts out after an hour to an hour and a half.   The biggest thing is when I contacted Archos Customer Support they told me that they would be no longer suppporting this model as it was hardware dependent and they would not be updating the firmware. The representative offered me a 15% discount totrade for a new 705.  The inital impression of the unit is great, but after awhile you will see that this is just a poor imitation of the real thing.   Don't buy the 704, wait for the 705 or wait for the 706!

<Title>Customer Service IS NOT Archos
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When you call Archos 'Customer Service', you are getting a contracted call center. Their reps tend to answer calls for a variety of 'clients'. They also take calls for iPOD and MS Zune. The reps are given binders with VERY LIMITED information on any given product. That's why it's easier for them to just have you send the product back to them since they really don't have any staff 'experts'. If anyone sounds remotely like they know what they're doing; they're not Archos reps (there are none), these are just senior call center employees. SO you see they really don't have any PAID Archos technicians. The product is mass produced so the service provided is likewise.

<Title>Great Video Player
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this Archos Video Player for about 1 month now and am completely happy with it. I have been using DVD decrypter to strip copy protection from DVD's that I own and compressing them with Gordian Knot to about 700 Meg in size in DIVX format. Given the 80GB hard drive installed that equates to over 100 movies on a very nice 7 inch touchscreen display. The sound quality is very good and volume is acceptable for airline or auto use. I also purchased the optional video adapter that lets you view video on TV as well as use the internal hard drive like a digital video recorder (DVR) both work exceptionally well. I would recommend purchasing a extra battery for it since while using it for video the battery pack only lasts about 4 hours, I havent measured the battery life with MP3's. MP3 and WMA playback is very good as well (I purchased mainly for video play while traveling). The only drawbacks I have come to find is that the wifi link only works with a unprotected Wireless network, and the internet browser that is included is Opera, which is sometimes difficult to use for those used to Firefox or Internet Explorer. Other than those two drawbacks, this is a fantastic video player that I thoroughly enjoy and find it a much better value that the Creative Vision W or the Apple Ipod.   ps....I have now had this player for 3 months and am as still pleased with it as the day I purchased it. I have been reading some complaints that people have been having over the size of it. If you are only looking for a MP3 player this is not the device for you. If you want a device that has a fantastik large 7 inch picture with great sound, there is no better device. It does weigh in at about a pound, but is much lighter than lugging a laptop around while traveling...plus the wireless internet is a godsend on short trips so I can leave that laptop at home. I have had absolutely zero issues with this player and have over 100 high quality movies loaded on the hard drive. The one and only thing I think archos coul dhave improved on is an even larger hard drive option. Other than that...you cant beat this portable video device.....Dont buy and Apple IPOD....Buy this!

<Title>Archos 704 pretty picture but . . .
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> Pretty picture and a smooth Video Player but .. it's still a brick (weight) of a Portable Media Player. Archos 704 color screen is absolutely gorgeous, vivid color in all angle of views. Its touch-screen technology is flawless for a handheld with 7" color screen. Interface takes some practice but as is with anything else- different. The truly shining feature has to be getting-the-DVD-into-the Archos 704. Simple and quick for you to get going on a train or plane or automobile. WiFi is somewhat slow but it's handy when you need to get to the email. Opera built in browser can be better, a lot better. Music as smooth with MP3 but unlike iPod where Apple owns the iTune. If you're a big fan of DVDs or have long commuting, this is it. It's the one.

<Title>Not for the "not-so-tech-savvy" crowd....
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted desperately to love this device (the ultra-cool big touch screen, the external speakers and the ample 80 GB hard drive) but after spending countless hours of trying to transfer music files with no success I am sending it back. Also, after transferring my photo files onto this device, about a third of my images would show up greened-out with just a sliver of image showing. However, all the thumbnails showed up fine. That is definitely a defect in my particular device. The Opera Web Browser is sluggish and the touch screen doesn't always respond to either your finger or the stylus. When you use your finger, the screen does that funny ripply effect. I imagine that after some time you could actually damage the touch screen by using your finger. The PDF instructions of this device that I downloaded onto to my regular laptop are not as clear cut as they should be.  I will not say "don't buy this device" because I am sure that many of you can figure out how to make the best use of all the features of the Archos 704 WiFi. For those who are looking for ease of use, however, please give purchasing this machine a second thought.
