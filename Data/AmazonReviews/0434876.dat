<Content>My five year old daughter LOVES this! She wanted an iPod but I chose this instead. She wears it on a lanyard around her neck & rocks out. I like that I am in control of her music. We also have downloaded some podcast stories for her & it has been a great bedtime companion too. LOVE this item!

<Content>I gave this to my neice for christmas and she loved it.  It only downloads mp3 type files, but it is easy to work with.  The sound is ok, not even as good as an iPod, but good enough for a young child to fool around with.

<Title>disappointing product
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was really excited to purchase this product for my son, but was really disappointed in the product. The seal for one end never closed correctly, the size of the product is tiny, and I could not easily use the product. The forward and backward buttons are useless and you are suppose to be able to shake it forward the song, and this never worked. I have purchased several apple ipods and will purchase one for my son, for the extra few $ it is worth it!

<Title>My 6 year old loves it -- even though the bottom cover doesn't stay on
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son got this for Christmas and so far loves it.  The only flaw is the bottom cover constantly falls off.  So much so that he leaves it hanging.  It bothers the heck out of me but he doesn't notice. In general it seems like a design flaw, having the bottom cover twist off in the same motion that skips to the next song, but I can't believe that it is this bad on all of them.  I'm taking it back to exchange it for another.

<Title>Wow - What a great MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Frankly, we thought we were buying a toy. It was pink, small and inexpensive. Who would have thought that it would turn out to be a great MP3 player for kids? Says it's for older kids buy my 4-year-old loves it. Easy to use for her as long as I load the music - which I prefer anyway! Amazing amount of technology in a small hand-held device. Only downside is that you can't see which songs are next. But at this price, who really cares.

<Title>She loves it!!
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product!!  I was unsure about the built in speaker, but it is a great thing.  My six year old is small and the earbuds were too big for her (have not found any small enough yet) so the speaker allows her to listen even without the earbuds.  It is easy to use, easy to load songs onto, and it is just cute!!  I was also concerned about the shake to change songs thing.  I was afraid that it would skip songs as she jumped around dancing, but you actually have to press the power button as you shake to get it to switch songs.  And why shake it when all you have to do is twist the bottom ring a bit to go to the next song?  I love this and so does my daughter.  It was her favorite Christmas gift!!

<Content>I purchased the Sansa Shaker for my 8-year-old daughter. Pros:  Built-in speaker---she loved sharing her music        Ease of use---no menu is involved; easy twist or shake to change tunes and volume        Price---very reasonable for 1GB  Cons:  No menu means finding a particular song becomes tedious as number of tunes increases.  Overall:  Good choice for you kids but unsatisfactory for tweens and up.

<Title>Wonderful music player for young children!
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Sansa Shaker for my handicapped son. My son Shawn functions at about a 6 year old level.  This product is the best toy I've had in a long time for Shawn.  Because there are minimal buttons it was very simple for Shawn to operate.  Also the SD card is easy to load & multiple SD cards can be created to make a library of various genres of songs for him to listen to.  A special feature of this MP3 player is that it has a speaker so you can listen to songs without the headphones.  Great product for kids!!!!

<Content>My daughter received this for Christmas and was hooked right off the bat.  Easy to use.  The little speaker is a huge plus since I don't want her with ear plugs in her ears all the time and they don't fit well anyway to small ears.  Battery usage is as described - though given it's popularity still means that we are chewing through batteries.  Get rechargable batteries...

<Title>Nice for Kids, but not perfect
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this MP3 player for my 4 year old son.  It does what I wanted: It plays lots of different songs that he likes, with the ability for me to get rid of ones that annoy the grown-ups.  It does so while minimizing the dangers of using headphones on a toddler (both hearing and stranulation).  It is a fairly primitive and limited device, so don't expect it to replace your iPOD.  Pros: --Small, comfortable to hold, good sound, lots of capacity, easy to setup (only file manager drag and drop is available) through either a card reader or the included USB cable). --Has support for two headphones (not included).  I didn't try this, but with my two boys, this may come in handy for car trips when they're older.  Cons: --It can get quite loud, and when the speaker is pressed against the ear, this cannot be good for hearing, certainly no better than headphones. --Hard for a 4 year old to operate.  The button is a little difficult to push, and must be held down for a couple seconds to do anything but pause the playing (leaving the device on and consuming batteries of course).  Try as I might, I cannot convince him to hold the button long enough while shaking to shuffle tracks, he just says it doesn't work. --Shuffle (hold button and shake) doesn't actually choose a random track, it just skips a few (1-3?) tracks in the playlist.  When my playlist has 1000 items in it, and it comes to the dreaded "Country Music for Kids" section.  It takes a dozen shuffles beofore even moving to the next album, not what anyone with a grown-up media player would put up with.  PS: the playlist appears to be determined by the order which windows copied the files, not by any sensible order. --The MP3 decoding is buggy.  Occasionally (maybe 1 in 20 tracks) it will play a track vveerryy sslloowwllyy.  At first I thought it was due to the sampling rate of the track (it only supports the standard CD rate), but upon skipping ahead and then re-winding, the track is back to playing normal so it is an intermittant bug.  This happens even on brand new batteries, so it isn't in the below list. --It eats batteries fast, and when low acts erratically.  Some of the signs of low batteries: will not turn off, shake mechanism no longer works, or shuts off unexpectedly.  Two weeks after Christmas, and I've already recharged the battery twice (Duracell NiMH 1xAAA).  It doesn't help that my kids put it in pause mode instead of turning it off, but still. --The end cap isn't perfect.  In two weeks, it only fell off once, and that was when I was using it not my son.  But it shouldn't fall off at all, or the little brother has access to both a AAA battery and a memory card for chewing on.  If it is at all targeted for kids it should have the screw on the battery cover that is on every kids toy these days. --The included music is 4 kids songs and 4 classical songs, nothing too spectactular, but ok demo music until you can get to a computer to delete them. --The CD included is a waste, PDF version of the 8 page user manual.  Conclusion: Buy it for yourself to listen to when you don't want to wear headphones (car, desk, bed, etc), put only your most favorite playlist on it, and lock your kids in another room when they play their leapfrog toys that play the same 5 songs over and over and over and over again.

<Title>Ideal first mp3 for kids
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my niece when she turned 5, and she absolutely loves it. Very easy to use (not for me, but im not a kid), and she has fun listening to the sound effects when skiping tracks. I bought the 512MB version cuz I dont think a kid knows that many songs, and it seems to be enough. It's a great first gadget for young kids and it gives them confidence around technology, which I like. She normally uses the speaker, and the sound it's alright for a low cost mp3, and I dont have to worry about headphones and the hearing damage, bla bla bla. I do recommend this, its a nice looking product, easy to use, worth the money.

<Title>Good product for the price
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my 9 year old son.  He enjoys listening to it while he is playing (on speaker mode) and on the bus (headphones).  Overall I am pleased with the product.  The sound quality is adequate for a kid, and the battery lasts a fairly good amount of time, even on speaker.  My only real problem is the bottom twist off where the battery and card are inserted does not stay tight.  Luckily the bottom lid is held on by a cord, but it is rather irritating to have it always fall open.  Overall, a good buy for the money.

<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great mp3 player, especially for the preteen since it has its own speaker and does not need ear buds.  Because it has its own speaker, my wife loves it (we are getting another one for her).  The only down side is the lack of a shuffle play, the random function does jump somewhere in your list of songs, but then continues sequentially from there.  Memory card size is not a problem.  We had an extra sd card from our camera (we went from a 1gig to a 2gig card) and can now switch between them quite easily.  I would recommend rechangable batteries.

<Content>I bought this as a gift for my 6 year old. It's recommended for an older child but she was able to learn how to use it pretty quickly. The sound quality is great and the battery life is decent. If you buy a name brand 8-12 pack of batteries, it should last for a month at least. She likes to dance and on her birthday brought it to school and it was an instant hit. I highly recommended this product for a young to preteen child, the price is right and it's very user friendly.

<Title>Great MP3 Player For Kids!!
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the 512MB version, but the only difference is that they've included a 1 GB SD card instead of 512MB. Overall, this is a great MP3 player for kids. If you are looking for an adult-oriented MP3 player, this is not for you.   We've had ours for several months and it still works perfectly. Very sturdy. The "rings" which allow you to control volume and track selection are perfect for young kids, since you simply twist the top or bottom of the device. The only button to press on the unit is the on/off switch. The ability to shuffle tracks by shaking the device (with a corresponding goofy sound effect) certainly appeals to kids.   One of the main selling points for me was the built-in speaker, so the kids are not reliant on wearing headphones. I worry about hearing damage to young ears while using headphones, and the speaker is a FANTASTIC option. On the down side, I was expecting / hoping that the unit would be a little larger (it has the size, shape and appearance of an average salt shaker). However it can be attached to a lanyard to make it more difficult to lose. That said, it's bigger than many MP3 players. Speaking of MP3 plaers, I wish the device was compatible with WMA format; but this is just a personal preference and not a serious criticism. My kids love it.

<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had more problems than anything else with this MP3 player. The shake feature does not work and often shuts the system off. It's stops playing for no reason, there's no shuffle feature or way to view what else to play and worst of all the bottom cover (where the disk and battery go) constantly falls off. If you want to advance to the next song, the cover falls off if is isn't already off. A very poor design.

<Title>Great for kids who have difficulty with hand eye coordination, kids in general  & adults 
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the shaker for my nephew who is slow and has difficulty with hand, eye co-ordination. The mp3 player he currently owns he is unable to control the volume and change the songs by himself. He also has difficulty turning the mp3 player on & off that he has now. With the shaker when you turn it on it makes a "clip clop" noise like a horse. When you turn it off it sounds like a drum roll winding down. My 10 year old daughter tested it out & loves it. I am certain he will be able to enjoy himself and use this device on his own. I am now buying this for my 10 year old & my other nephew as well. I have shown it to many family & friends and they're buying them as well. This is great for kids & adults.

<Content>I bought one in blue for my kids - 3 years old and 5 years old. Very kid proof and durable. They have really given it a beating, and it still works great. It's easy enough for young children to work. The built in speaker is great, so are the dual head phone jacks. The only reason I gave this product a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the battery runs out quickly and the bottom lid always falls off. A piece of tape and rechargeable batteries solve those problems, but maybe on their next version they could fix those things. Over all, I would buy it again.

<Title>Perfect Player for the Pre-teen...
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was the perfect December birthday gift for my newly-turned-8-year-old daughter!  She was utterly speechless when she opened the many layers of wrapping and saw "my own ipod".  Big Sis corrected her: "MP3 Player."  I was very happy that it came pre-loaded with a few songs just perfect for her age.  She and her two companions were able to start dancing to the music as soon as the package was opened and the battery inserted.  I just LOVE this little device.  The built-in speaker is perfect for sharing the tunes.  It gets plenty loud for them all to hear, even over their chatter, but not so loud as to be annoying to us folks.  The speaker sound is quite good for what it is and considering the audience.  (Don't expect it to sound exceptional to the trained ear.)  She also isn't able to turn the volume up too loud with headphones --a nice plus for the young age group.  She loves that she can `shake' it to the next song.  Most of the kids who have this will probably be great at Name That Tune with the fast succession of shakes I've heard..."I can name that tune in one note"...shake to the next!  It comes with all the necessary accessories including software and the cable to hook it up to the computer.  I've used neither of those, however, as it's so easy just to put the card into my card reader and drag and drop the music she wanted.  Though I find it not to be a problem, my biggest time-consumer was downloading a free converter to convert my wma files to mp3, as this player only recognizes mp3 format.  But even that is not a detraction to this great little player.  I've read other reviews that the bottom falls off, etc., but I really don't see how that could happen unless it was forcibly pulled apart instead of the little `twist/click' it takes to remove it and replace it.  It does take smaller hands than, say, my husband's to get the right grip on the bottom.  The design is quite good for the aimed market, namely 6-10 year olds I'd say.  Even younger if headphones aren't being used.  And I'm going to plug the brand itself.  I bought my husband a Sansa last summer because the price was right.  But I was happy with the quality, sound, and size, too.  And after my 8 year old's birthday her sister turned 13 and I got her a different model Sansa--her favorite feature of that model is the FM tuner so she can record her favorite songs on-the-fly (something not even an ipod can do).  I won't be looking at the more (overly) expensive models of MP3s anytime soon!  I highly recommend this player and this brand!

<Title>Great for youngsters
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 8 yr old wanted an "ipod" for Christmas this year but this being her first MP3 player, I opted for the Shaker. It was less than $40.00, the 1GB version holds -plenty- of music for her, it has the two jacks, & I  thought the speaker would come in handy. As it turns out, the speaker is just about her favorite part. Mind you, it's no BOSE wave system, but it's certainly a step up from the transistor radio's some of us grew up on.  Her older cousins thought it was "cool" she could share her music with others. It's durable so far. It's been dropped & kept on playing. Loading & deleting files couldn't be any easier. As far as the bottom cap coming off too easy, people are likely just not making sure it's *clicked* shut. We've had no problems.  Battery life has been surprisingly long, too. She's been listening to it non stop now.   My only gripe is the lack of WMA support, but that's minor.  The price, features, durability & capacity are just about ideal for kids.
