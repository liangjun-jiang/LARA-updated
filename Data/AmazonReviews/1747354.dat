<Title>Its been great for me
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the gigantic harddrive and easy intereface. I use this a lot and have never had any trouble. I am in college and I like to download books for class and listen to them while I exercise or work, that way I can study and not be stuck in the house, I am able to find a lot of audio books online that are compatable with this MP3 player. It is also handy because I can store data files on it like a flash drive and bring them to school for presentations. As far as durability goes it gets scrached up really easy but other then that it seems industuctable. The battery is fairly good I have never run out of juce and I brought it with my on a 14 hour flight, my only problem with its battery life is that it does not have the ablity to attach to any external battery for long trips. The screen is great for movies I have several full length movies on mine as well as tv shows and the picture quality is great, though it does kill the battery to use it. All and all if you buy this you will like it, it is a wonderful economical alternative to a Ipod and in my opion is better then my brothers 30 gig Ipod both in quality and usuablitiy

<Title>Forget Apple! This is the MP3 player for you!
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I can't say enough about Creative's MP3 players! No, they don't pay me, but darn it, they should, as much as I tell people how great they are! The battery life dwarfs iPods and the software - way better for keep track of your music. Ever asked someone for a copy of a song they have, from iTunes? Ya, good luck with that. I've given these as gifts because they're so easy to use and work so well! I don't travel anywhere without mine!

<Title>Zero Complaints
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is always really nerve-racking for me to make these kind of purchases because half the reviews for most products say "greatest thing ever," and the other half "terrible!" But the reviews seemed pretty good for the Zen 60 gb, so I decided to order it about 8 months ago.  So far, so good. It has held up incredibly well. And the 60 gbs of space is hard to fill. I am up to 45 gb, and I have everything I could imagine wanting on it already!  The thing I like most about this player may simply be the fact that it supports so many formats. The major concern I had with getting an MP3 player (and the reason why I didn't get an Ipod) is whether or not my various video files and sound files would be difficult to get on here. And, it isn't hard at all. I have had zero problems now with the various formats of videos I download offline and whatnot, and it supports my music file of choice, WMA, perfectly. It would be cool if it supported WMA PRO, but apparently NOTHING does yet....or at least nothing I have seen.   I love the program it comes with. IT couldn't be easier. I select my music from my music folder, and load it right in. It could not be any simpler. I do not use it to compress music-- my Windows media player does a great job at that-- but I simply use the program to add files that have already been ripped onto my computer.   Battery space is very good-- I have yet to not have enough battery power for the various times I have used it. It was great when I flew to hawaii. I switched between listening to music and watching movies without running out of battery power. It seems to go about 3-4 hours on video depending on the loudness of volume. Obviously that exceeds the length of most movies.  But the other thing I would HIGHLY recommend is getting a wall plug in and car adapter. I cannot stress how nice it has been to be able to charge this in my car, from a wall, and from my computer. Basically, there is hardly ever a time when I have to worry about it running out of battery power, because I can always charge it, from anywhere. I plug it in my mp3 line on my car, and listen endlessly. When I took a major road trip with my girlfriend, I listened to (and she watched) through a couple different movies. It was awesome!  So far so good with battery power, memory, and functionability.  It looks like at 192 kbps, I can fit about 600 full length albums on here, along with about 70 vids. Hard to tell. Right now I have 440 albums at 192 kbps, and 70 vids, and I am I still have 15 gbs left.

<Title>Excelente reproductor de audio y video
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compre el Creative Zen Vision M:60gb en agosto de 2007. A enero de 2008, sigue pareciendome una excelente compra. La capacidad es desbordnte. Tengo cerca de 40 cds en mp3 (musica comprimida!!) y todas han entrado en este reproductor de musica. No he tenido inconvenientes hasta el momento. Si bien la bateria no dura como lo ofrece Creative (en musica me da 13 a 14 horas, y no 16, pero es lo de menos!!) vale bien a pena para quienes hacen largos viajes, van en autobus, o simplemente desean toda su musica en un solo dispositivo. Debido a que tenia 30gb de espacio libre luego de poner toda la musica, empece a incluirle videos, y la calidad es magnifica. No uso mucho los videos pues prefiero la musica. La seleccion de canciones, y el facil manejo del menu, es fabuloso. Loas loas loas! Lastima que no sigan vendiendo la version de 60gb. Fui afortunado de ser uno de los ultimos compradores del Creative Zen Vision M: 60gb.  Ah, y lo mejor del Ipod: Creative tiene radio. Si te gusta escuchar noticias (como a mi), bien valia su precio.

<Title>Hitting the iPod Where it Hurts... (Everyone's a Critic)
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't believe some of the poor reviews for this item based on very minor flaws. Yes... it's thicker than the iPod but does that really affect it's use or is it just a fashion statement to have the thinnest player available..? How thin does it really need to be..? And as for the interface... I really don't see the problem. There are at least three ways to navigate the Zen and one doesn't even require the Creative software to be loaded on XP...  If you want to be a fashion victim then buy an iPod. If battery life isn't an issue then choose the iPod. If you like to be controlled by software instead of the other way around then ipod and iTunes is the way to go. If sound and video quality are not your prime concern (which would be an odd thing for anyone buying a music/video player) then go for the iPod. If you really must have a player that is a fraction slimmer that the competition, then once again, I urge you to buy an iPod.   However, if you want to buy the best at what it does, if longer battery life would be of convenience, if you require the best in terms or audio and visual quality, if you wish to avoid compatibility issues with video and audio formats, if you want to transfer music and video in a familiar Windows-style navigator and if you want all this at a price lower than it's nearest rival then you must, absolutely must opt for the Creative Vision M   In addition to the features hinted at above, the Vision M also has a built in FM radio, sound recorder with integral microphone, AV out facility for watching you stored videos on TV and much much more.   Buying an iPod is an easy (lazy) choice given all the hype, but anyone wanting to make a smarter choice in personal multimedia players would be well advised to look closely at what the Vision M offers. Don't be sucked in to the iPod hysteria.   I'd owned my 60GB variant for around a month at the time of writing this review and as yet I'm struggling to find fault with the player. The control interface is excellent and probably the most intuitive of any gadget I've ever owned. Only mind control would make navigation any easier. Loading media has been a breeze with complete hassle free transfers and conversions. I can't believe anyone would want to use iTunes after experiencing the Zen Vision's PC interface.   I'm constantly disappointed these days with products that fail to live up to expectation or designs and functions that miss the point completely. However, here is a product that is spot on. Currently there is none better than the Creative Zen Vision M.   The iPod is dead... long live the Zen...

<Title>Vision:M 60GB; Above Par
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Pros: + Comes with a plastic cover the screen out of the box. I left it on because it had no bubbles. + Best Video with good amount of space. + Best Sound Quality + Great Interface, in my opinion. + Most Formats + DRM compatible +Great battery life + FM tuner, built in microphone, and can act as USB host. + Great with To-Go subscription services. For $14.99 a month, I can fill up my Vision:M (all of it) with music, legally, using Rhapsody. The next day, I can fill it up again with new content. It will never cost me more than $14.99 a month.  Cons: - Thicker than iPod (pro in my opinion, I broke a Razr before) - Must be charged on a computer, unless another cord it bought - Comes with a silly pouch, and is difficult to find a case for the 60GB Vision:M (I did find it, I purchased it from Audio-Outfitters, and will update on the quality when it arrives)  My Explinations: Having built my own computer through a lengthy process of upgrades, I have learned to thoroughly research any computer-related product over $50 before I spend my money on it. I bought a Sound Blaster audio card for my PC, and was completely impressed with the sound quality. I even invested in some speakers for my computer, although I had no prior intention of turning my computer into a multimedia machine. Lucky for Apple and Dell, not a lot of people have the desire or know-how to research technology. Dell has created half-decent computers that are available to the public. The iPod became the first widely known MP3 player, and by all means, is decent. If you are looking for something more than decent, then this is the machine for you.  Its video, although not as colorful as a PSP, was way more colorful and vibrant than an iPod. After testing all three with the same video at the same brightness, I will say the Vision:M wins because it is able to play whole movies, is the most vibrant, and the PSP requires an expensive memory card to do so. The sound quality is the best, hands down. This is expected from Creative Labs. Its interface is awesome. Having had an iRiver, used and iPod, and still owning a PSP, it is best, in my opinion. It's great. The buttons are great for selecting things. Unlike the iPod, I can pause and go to the next song without my thumbs messing with the volume. However, the volume pad in the middle makes it easy to turn it up quickly. By starting in the middle and moving it down to the bottom, it turns the volume down at a fast speed. The size is no big deal for me. It is the size of a pack of Marlboros. Although Camels are my personal favorite (and slightly smaller), the Vision:M is no way cumbersome. The multiple formats make it easy to sync. In video, it does more than just MP4s. It does AVI, MPEGs, and DivX to name a few. It plays MP3s, of course, but also WMA and WAVs. It plays all common image formats. The USB host feature also makes it possible to get the video and images off a digital camera. The only thing the Zune has on the Vision:M is the WiFi transfers, but they expire. Digital Rights Managements (DRM) makes Vision:M win. Rhapsody To Go (my personal favorite) works flawlessly with the Vision:M. iPod only works with iTunes. Zune only works with Zune Market Place... The Toshiba Gigabeat works with Rhapsody To Go, but operates with Microsoft Portable Media Center. In my experience, avoid PMC! It has great battery life. I do not know much about the batteries of other devices, but it lasts 16 hours with just music, 5 with video. Additional features: the FM tuner is a nice feature, along with the built-in microphone (which records well, by the way). As I said it can act as a USB host for cameras. A side note, the software that came with the Vision:M ripped and transferred my scratched CDs without giving me an error. They were played in a CD player before and after, both times it would get stuck and skip. Windows Media Player would say "Unable to rip" on the tracks that skip. Creative records over the part that skips, and although the quality of the scratched part is lower, it has saved me at least $60 in replacing these CDs.

<Title>Buyer Beware - False Advertising!
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased this model because it advertised the ability to record radio. This feature was missing when I opened it though. I E-Mailed customer service and the reply was "Please be informed that Creative no longer supports the FM Recording feature." It turns out after threat of lawsuit the new firmware for the 30 gig model has this feature back however for this 60 gig model the newest firmware lacks this option. If the "Record Radio" feature is important to you please contact Creative and ask them if and when this feature will be re-incorperated. For now, this feature is advertised and not available. Be warned.

<Content>This is one awesome player; my coworker with an iPod is envious of the clear display.  However, the accessories are very limited. Creative's website lists this unit as the same size as the 30GB model which is incorrect; the 60GB is about 1/8" thicker so silicone cases just don't work without mashing the buttons.  Bummer!

Please consider buying this one--I only wish it came with an even bigger hard drive--WOW!!!  I've purchased my second Zen Vision M yesterdy!!  I am truly hooked!!  I transfer my Tivo recordings to my zen and I sit back and watch extraordinary colors and sound!!!!  I've had a Dell, an iRiver, a Rio 600, Rio 800, creative nano and now the zen vision M (2).  So far it is my pick for the best player out there!! Everyone complains about scratches but to date I have none--just keep your player it the soft pouch supplied with your zen vision, you'll be fine!! I haven't tried an ipod yet--and I may never--The zen vision M is truly a WINNER in my book!!!!

<Title>*Mostly* better than an iPod, some things you should know:
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this way more than a comparable (and more expensive) iPod Video, but the player has some quirks you should know about first.  I picked this player because it has a built-in voice-recorder that I could use for interviews and to record school lectures, and the built-in FM radio receiver is a nice touch.  The Good:  The player works, sounds, and looks great, and is easy to use.  Another great thing is that it acts literally just like an external hard-drive, so you can put songs on it - or copy songs off it - very easily from any computer with a USB drive (unlike the iPod that goes out of its way to keep you from accessing your files).  You can record audio that is super long, there are FM radio pre-sets, a nice bright screen, and the controls have some very innovative features to make it easy to quickly find the album or artist you are looking for.  It also natively plays lots of popular video-formats, so if you're into downloading TV shows off the internet, you can usually watch them without having to convert anything.  The Bad:  Their software for putting songs and video on the player is just terrible, but luckily you can do it yourself with the Windows Media Player or the regular File Manager.  The FM Radio reception isn't that great, but works fine most of the time.  There are also some quirks you have to get used to:  -When listening to music, the screen won't turn off after a period of time to save battery (like the iPod) unless the player is "locked".  I hook this up to my home stereo-system all the time and always forget to lock it, then when I do, I have to fumble with the controls to un-lock it when I want to change songs or play-lists.  You don't have to lock it (and I've never had the battery die on me), but it just feels dumb to be wasting power to keep the screen brightly lit when I'm not looking at it.  -It takes some time to boot up.  I'm not sure how long exactly, probably less than ten seconds, but it is quite obnoxious when you want to listen to something and have to wait for it to start.  Once the player is on, everything else is quick (Switching between menus, loading files, etc).  -You have to adjust some of the controls to make it really work well. For example, one of the buttons comes factory-configured to make a completely random song start playing, which I see as a totally useless feature.  But with a few clicks you can easily re-program that button do anything else you want (like jump to the "now playing" window as I did, or the artist selection page or whatever).  Overall I really recommend it, but only if you are a bit nerdy and won't freak out about having to change some settings or use software other than what comes in the box.  If it's a gift for grandma, I'd say to stick with an iPod, which is meant to be super easy for anyone to use.

<Title>Amazing internal hardware, but with a casing problem
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say that the Zen Vision:M is a fantastically designed piece of equipment, as far as how good the electronics of the thing is. It can play most everything you can throw at it, especially most of the video formats used by groups puting television shows on the net. This was one of the main reasons that I bought the player (I am currently living in Korea, and the only way I can watch American television is by downloading episodes).  But there is a downside that has been present in both the 60GB model that I recently returned to Amazon as well as the 30GB model I previously had: annoying dust will get under the external plastic casing and onto the LCD inside. If you don't mind your portable media player having dust on the screen, than I guess I would still recommend this player for you, but for people like me, it will drive you insane.  Though the video playback is not as rebust and I will have to convert everything I download from the net for it, I will be going for a video iPod next, because of its better external manufacturing. I really with the Vision:M would have worked out for me, because other than that one flaw, it is a great piece of electronics.

<Title>Best Player Ever!
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This an amazing player. One of the best things that I found its the fact that you don't have to convert any file in order to import it to the player; in the case the format of the file its not handle by the player, it will be converted to a one that its handle by it.  I had a little trouble playing videos since the player hang and I had to reset the player in order to get it working again. I updated the firmware an d problem solved. I have to say that creative's web page its really useful and has a lot of articles that may help with any problem.  The resolution, the sound, the player itself its perfect. The only con that  it has its that it is a little bit thick.  I will really recommend this player, specially if you don't like ipods XD.

<Title>One serious flaw, but mostly musical heaven
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen products (I've owned the 30 GB and now the 60 GB version) feature powerful amps that can give a world-rocking sound experience, especially in combination with Bose headphones.  I love the ability to hear my music even on a noisy airplane at 30,000 feet.  Crying babies and turbulence announcements can be drowned out and replaced by "musical heaven."    I chose Zen because I wanted a player free of most proprietary constraints.  There are a few companies in the world who are not above taking advantage of their popularity to achieve increased prices.  While I envy them, I also do not want to part with my own money quite so easily.  The Zen works with Windows Media Player, so pretty much any song you can play with that program will also play on your Zen.    The biggest flaw: no easy control to allow fast-forward or fast-rewind to the next or prior song on a playlist.  So many times I wanted this function but it is a cumbersome multi-click and menu-driven process.  It should be a button or two, just like every other music system I have ever owned. (Duh.)

<Title>Great at first, but wait till it needs fixing
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Creative Zen Vision:M at the beginning of the year, in about March.  I was loving it, it was working great.  The sound quality was fantastic, it was easy to use, and it was awesome.  UNTIL!...  Only six months later, the player suddenly ceased being recognized by my computer...or ANY computer, for that matter.  Even the Zen's own software wouldn't recognize it.  I did everything possible to get it back up and running, but in the end the only option I had was to send it in for repairs, and thereby lose TWO THOUSAND SONGS in the process!  So a music library that took me months to put together was gone in one fell swoop, fed to the void.  I am sorry, but a product that only lasts SIX MONTHS before it has to be refurbished is a terrible product.  I shouldn't have to rebuild my library every few months or so.  And I feel that my $400 was completely wasted.  I spent less than that on my whole computer, and it's never lost all my data before, or come even close.  Not only that, but the customer service reps were incredibly rude, completely unhelpful, and they CHARGED me for being rude and unhelpful!  I am never buying a Creative Labs product again, it's just not worth it.  Stick to the bigger names, they at least can afford to make their customers happy.

<Content>This is my 2nd creative MP3 player (the 1st one being Nomad Zen Xtra 30GB - which I still love and use BTW). I was already impressed with creative MP3 players before I even bought this one, and this one did not disappoint me at all. My 1st player still is in working condition, and the reason I bought a second one was the color screen. Creative products (MP3 players, speaker systems, sound cards etc) will always have the best sound quality in the same class - bar none. This player has very good battery life and amazing sound quality - two most important things for any MP3 player. Plus, its screen resolution is much better than any other player out there. When you combine all the great features with its comparably low price, its an absolute no-brainer. It will be very difficult for Apple/Microsoft/Toshiba to lure me away from Creative any time soon.

<Title>What warranty?
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Three months after purchasing my Zen Vision:M 60Gb I have little good to say about it.  The lauded 18 hours of play time per charge was actually less than eight.  After three months I plugged it into my five month old laptop (as I usually do for charging and adding music) and they both fried.  The computer got a new motherboard, the Zen support website gave me a headache.  Before the headache and the usual lost time dealing with web-tech was over I was charged 25 bucks plus postage to return the Zen for repairs.  If the MP3 player hadn't been so expensive I wouldn't have bothered.  What happens when it breaks again and my computer isn't under warranty?  How much will it cost to replace the Creative device the next time?  It seems to me just about everything these days comes with at least a one year warranty (or commonly two years).  Does this company already know its product line is garbage?  Is this a joke?  I bought the Zen Vision:M by reading the reviews.  Were they all written by the creative company?  With the reviews I have since read by other dissatisfied Creative customers I have to agree.  I will never buy another Creative product.  Why would I when there are so many other manufactures out there willing to back up what they build with a no hassle replacement.  Best of luck in choosing an MP3 player.  Ipod isn't sounding so bad after all.

<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 2 of these less than a year ago, one for myself and one for my husband because it seemed like the best non-Ipod product available. Was very happy initially although both tended to freeze up at times and required resetting.  First one and then the other have subsequently stopped being recognized by my computer, which on further searching seems to be a fairly common problem.  So you can't upload anything else. Ever. Of course they are no longer warrantied and Creative support is poor.  See other posts on amazon.  Save your $ and buy something else.

<Title>If they had a 6 star rating, I'd give it a 7.
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've toyed around with the Ipod video and this little gadget.  The zen M is a little bulkier, but not by much.  The resolutions is great, and the sound is even better.  I primarily use it to store music videos and it works great with my mobile video.  I even used it at a party with a big screen tv, and it turned out perfect.  The one thing I wished was on here was a random switch/button/something for the videos.  Like I said before, I use this for music videos, and to have to select a new video every song is a pain, but I haven't seen a portable media player with that feature to date.  I'm not anti Ipod or pro Creative, but if you are, you should go with your choice respectively.  This is a great little machine for the price.  Just as a heads up, I've had this for about 6 months now, so I've had a chance to get used to it.

<Title>Napster Compatible and Great Storage
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player, though not one of the most widely publicized players of this day and age, has features that can compete any day with other players. The 60 gig  hard drive is more than enough to put full length movies and thousands of songs on! Its syncability with napster makes this the perfect player for me! I previously had an Ipod... and will never go back after experiencing the innovation of this Creative product.   I was worried that watching movies and videos on the small screen would be hard, but the awesome resolution puts no strain on your eyes... and even though the menu control buttons are different, they are easy to master and provide for some features that blow the Ipod away!  I highly recommend this product... and its a MUST HAVE if you are a napster subscriber...   If you have problems getting it to sync at first, dont worry... just look in then napster forums and theyll tell you how to fix it... they got it working for me...

<Title>The best mp3 player out there
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The screen is fantastic, the sound is great, and the battery life is stupendous.  The only drawback is the interface.  While it is certainly not a product killer, it can be annoying at times.  The pad seems to be a little finicky for responsiveness at times.  Adjusting the sensitivity can make this a marginal problem though.  Overall, I am extremely happy with this player.  It beats the iPod hands down.  The DivX compatibility makes it great for movie playback.  You don't have to convert file formats just to watch your collection.  If the player can't play the file, there is a built in converter in the sync manager.  Creative has made the best mp3 player on the market as far as I am concerned.  Way to go Creative!

<Title>great machine
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>after my ipod died I decided to look around for alternatives. I'm sorry, i don't feel like I should need to replace my mp3 player every 2 years. I am surprised there isn't a lawsuit about the longevity issues with the ipod.. cause it is a big issue. Hopefully this holds up better.! At first I wasn't too fond of the navigation, but now that i'm used to it, it is great.. The sounds is so superior and the screen.. wow.. it is a beauty!! the battery lasts forever too. Oonly bummer right now is i'm having troubles finding a protective case to fit the 60 GB model. Buy this and you won't be disappointed!

<Content>The player worked fine for about three weeks after Christmas, when it was activated into use, then suddenly the screen became blurred and was unuseable after that.  I am currentlly in the process of getting it exchanged, since the tech support could not get it reset/restarted and working properly.  The process has been somewhat cumbersome to get satisfaction from the company.

<Title>Fine Player - Terrible Software
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Many reviewers have commented on the fine points of this player. I agree with them. It is a beautiful player with outstanding music reproduction; with a decent pair of headphones few could complain. Musical pieces I have been familiar with for years, are now surprising and fresh.  I write, therefore, with hesitation, to register a complaint. The software that comes with the Zen M is dreadful. With any player of this kind one asks that there should be easy ways first, to organise, and second, to transfer music to the player; in addition there should be an easy way to create playlists - after all with 60gb one can put literally hundreds of CDs on this player - and it is important to be able to organise the music in ways which facilitate easy recognition and playing.   Creative, unlike its competition, supplies software that is torture to work with. It is, first of all, very difficult to use the software to organise music on one's computer hard drive in such a way that when it is transferred to the player, you know what it is. I have had an education these last two weeks on the intricacies of ID tags and have had to relabel the identifying "tags" on dozens of CDs. This isn't Creative's problem, of course, but I defy anyone to use Creative's software to help in this task. Then, after transferring the music one discovers that similarly labelled tracks get dropped. If, for instance, the second movement of a Mozart piano concerto, played by say, Ashkenazy and Perahia, are labelled in the same way, then you will lose one of them! Next, if one wishes to make a playlist- say putting 20  tracks of Beatles music together - and then get the player to recognise this playlist, chances are very high that in using Creative's software, you will duplicate the tracks on your little player. This causes substantial problems if you then want to play the original album from which some of the tracks were drawn,  as many tracks will repeat! The Enigma Variations thus become truly enigmatic. In short, the music on the player  gets bloated, and the system of organising the music breaks down comprehensively. (I report only some of the difficulties.)  Needless to say, the documentation and official website meant to explain how to deal with these difficulties are of very little help.   One is driven, in these circumstances, to search the web for alternatives to Creative's software and, to be sure, one can find many good suggestions. But be prepared to put in long long hours - for good advice is not always easy to find as it is often buried in somewhat obscure posts in specialised Forums; and, if you take the advice, be prepared to put in the hours of experimentation to get your music onto the player in a way you recognise it as such. The most important piece of advice is to dump Creatives's software and use instead a fine music organiser and synchroniser which goes under the odd name of Media Monkey. But even the latter cannot perform miracles, and playlist creation as well as transfer of album art remain problems.  Interestingly enough, as one reads the posts on various Fora, these complaints are widespread, as is the frustration. Especially as the player itself is such a marvel. Creative, however, is acquiring a reputation of being singularly unresponsive to the complaints of its clientele. What a shame!

<Title>Great player - NO ACCESSORIES
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player for all the great reviews it has been getting. BUT ... BUYER BEWARE - this is an ipod dominated market.  THERE ARE NO ACCESSORIES FOR THIS PLAYER.  Think you will find a good all-in-one fm transmitter/car charger - think again.  I have been searching for days and although there are transmitters with USB ports for charging, the FM tranmitters on these products suck.  This does not seem to be a problem for ipods since the best products are made specifically for ipods.  So I have to buy the fm transmitter and charger separately and if the battery runs out I have to unplug my transmitter to plug in my player so I can't listen to music anymore until the stupid thing is charged.  The same is true for in-car stereos.  Many have inputs/chargers for ipods but none have this for other players.  There is also an issue with finding cases for this model because it is thicker than the 30gb.  Hopefully as the popularity of this brand increases so will the supply of accessories to go with it.  At present though, I am really begining to regret my decision to get this player rather than an ipod.

<Title>The real ipod killer
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So much has been made of the Zune, which was supposed to be able to take on Apple's popular ipod that almost nobody noticed this little gem hiding in the background. As I began my search for the ultimate awesome media player, my choices came down to the 80GB video iPod, or the 60GB Creative Zen Vision M. After nearly a month of weighing pros and cons, I decided to go with the Zen, and I have not regretted a minute of it!  I have compared my new toy with the video iPods of friends and I can honestly say that the screen is nearly twice as sharp and full of color than the ipod. The touchpad take a bit of adjustment, but within a day or two I was zipping around easily, as easily as the ipod's clickwheel.   The device is fully customizable. You can add any picture you can upload as a wallpaper, customize themes, create playlists and display album art. You can search by album art (or just album), artist, genre or have the player select a random album for you. The player can be instructed to play complete random, all the songs in a randomly picked album, only songs that you play frequently, or songs that you have not heard in a while.  The voice recorder also comes in handy, making recording my classes a snap. The sound quality is perfectly acceptable for what I use it for. The radio is a nice feature too, also lacking on ipods. You can have the device autoscan for radio stations and set them as presets, or you can manually set the presets yourself.  But above and beyond is the video playback. I was pleasantly astounded at the quality of the movies played ont he tiny screen, as well as how sharp the video outputted to the tv was! The Zen can handle nearly every video format you'd run across on a regular basis. Unlike the ipod which require videos to be converted into a format playable by the ipod, the Zen will play mpegs, DivX, Xvid and WMV without conversion. But what sold me on the device was it's ability to play .tivo files. Since I work alot, I don't often have time to watch the things my tivo records. I wanted a device I could drop my recorded programs on and take with me on the go.  If you own a tivo series 2 or above, you can use the tivo-to-go feature to rip the shows from your tivo to your computer. Using Windows Media Player 10 or above, you can sync the shows to your devices and take them with you! Add the optional AV cable and output your video, music or slideshows to the nearest tv for all to see.  The only downside to the device is the frustrating lack of accessories for it, although several cases and other accessories ARE out there, you just have to search a bit. Some people might find the device to be a bit thick, compared to the ipod, but I find it fits very comfortably in my hand and pocket with no bulging.  All in all, I think it's fair to say that this is the device that could seriously take on the Goliath of the iPod. Zune, Sansas, and many others don't even come close. And it's so awesome to be able to tell people who ask "what kind of iPod is that?", that it is the device that will leave thier ipods in the dust! Nothing more satisfying that pointing out all the features and coll bits on this thing (especially the screen and video playback) to people who spent the same amount (actually a  bit more) for a video ipod.

<Title>great player
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pro: This is a great mp3 player and is very compatible and easy to use.  There are so many features that is packed into this machine that you know you are definitely getting your money's worth.  Pictures, video, music and an av output so u can play it on your tv.  Charge time with an av adapter is about 1hour from empty to full, about 5 with the usb cable that's included.  I found out that the psp charger fits just right if you already have a psp.  Con: The device is rather bulky but is alright if u just want to carry it around in your pocket.  Its not very good if u wanna work out or something like that.  I got the 60gb player and had a lot of trouble getting a skin for it.  Most skins are only available for the 30gb device.  Also, not compatible with mp4 (very dissappointing).  Conclusion:  Great device if you wear loose clothing (so you can leave the player in your pocket).

<Title>Mediocre Product, Terrible Customer Service
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the player as a Christmas gift and was excited to have it.  Unfortunately, owning the product has been a terrible experience.   The product itself, for the literally two days that it worked properly, was OK.  Nothing special in comparison to my previous players, but not bad.  Sleek design, OK battery life, good screen size, and relatively easy to navigate (although not entirely intuitive).  There were a few minor hiccups in downloading music via Windows Mediaplayer, but no deal breakers.  So far, not bad. Two days after I received it, my player suddenly would no longer sync up with my computer.  Wouldn't charge over the USB and wouldn't upload any music from my computer.  After a week's worth of back and forth with customer service, Creative finally concluded that the product was defective and agreed to send me a new one.  If only it were that easy.  After being instructed to ship back my defective player in its box with its accessories and after waiting about week, I received my new, operable player in the mail from Creative.  In theory.  In fact, I received a completely different (and incorrect) model player, on its own, w/o headphones, USB cable, box, or an other accessory.  I called up Creative, informed them of their mistake, and was told that they would ship the correct player to me that day.  Two days later, I called back to see if it had shipped.  It had not, and was not scheduled to ship for several more days.  Good thing it hadn't shipped, actually; they told me that, their mistake, they had planned to send me the incorrect player, again.  After being assured from a supervisor that the correct player would, indeed, ship that day, I waited.  It didn't ship that day.  When I finally did receive the package more than a week later, I opened it to find... the wrong player.  Again.  Now, after fighting for them for more than a month, I have the wrong player (after two attempts) and they arrogantly refuse to give me a refund.  I don't need this.  I resisted an IPod for a while, although right now, I couldn't tell you why.  What I can tell you is that I'm done with this product and done with this company.  Avoid - the marginal (at best) upside is not worth the hassle.

<Title>A Good Choice For The Right People
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I shopped around a lot before buying this player, and it was difficult for me due to the fact that almost every review is extremely biased. iPod fanatics insist that their favored product is far superior, while Creative fanboys tend to do the same.  I, for one, do not think that neither the zen nor the ipod come out as a clear victor, but are simply two good players that will be right for a person depending on what they want to get out of it.  The Zen, to me, has advantages. For one, the video out port on the charging adapter is excellent. The picture looks great on my HD, and has essentially replaced my dvd player due to convenience.  Furthermore, I'm enjoying my xvid encoded movies far more easily. Those of you familiar with getting videos on the internet will know how ubiquitous the xvid and divx codecs are, and it turns out to be a very nice feature when combined with the video output of the zen.  My experience with ipod video on televisions has not been nearly as enjoyable.  The equalizer remains another preferable feature for me to choose the zen.  The lack of an equalizer on the ipod puzzles me, as one would imagine an 80 GB player is meant for the market of the more audio-savvy among us, who care enough to change the audio settings of our music.    I know this is not a critical factor, but I for one enjoy the ability to customize the background of my player.  Its nice knowing that I can just throw on any picture of my whim and utilize it as a wallpaper for my player.  The ipod outdoes the zen in terms of storage, size, and the ability to play games.  I admit that I would prefer a thinner player, though the thickness is the zen is not so severe that I cannot easily slide it in my pocket.  The ipod does offer an extra 20 gb on their player, but one must also pay for the extra storage, it is a more pricey player.  Games are a nice feature, but as far as I'm concerned, it is not something to complain about a lack of; this is a music player.  The aesthetics and interfaces of the two players are equally nice as far as I'm concerned.  As far as durability the reviews that I've read seem to imply that the Zen scratches more, but I've kept mine naked (I left the sticker on the screen from when I got it, and leave it in the included pouch when I'm not using it...purchased a podskin and an invisishield but decided not to employ either) and it is fine.  People must treat their pmp's quite brutally, because I have seen nary a scratch on my player in the approximate six months that I've owned it.  My cohorts' ipods all seem to have taken more wear than my zen, especially on that shiny chrome back.  Is the Zen a good player? Yes. Is the ipod a good player? Yes. Pick what fits your needs, and you will be most satisfied. I would give this product a 4.5 more accurately, simply knocking off a half point wishing that the Thin Model 60gb zen was in America, which is the same thickness as the 30gb one.  Everything else on the player works great.

<Content>I looked at ipods that friends own and didn't care for them. When I used the Vision M for the first time I loved it. It is easy to use and the software that comes with it is also easy to use. The sound that the Vision produces is great. It is loud enough even when mowing grass. Be careful though because it will go real loud!! The only drawback I see so far is the black case shows finger prints. Buy the Vision M and have fun. It is a great product!

I recently repaired a friends ipod and trying to get music onto it were a hassle to say the least.  With the Zen Vision you click and drag your music into the folder and you're ready to go!  it's a great player.  thanks for reading

Voice recorder, plays multiple auidio/video formats without restrictions like the Ipod has... and gives you the ability to partition the hard drive for PC usability... translation:  If you want, you can make this into a 1GB mp3 player, 59 GB USB Drive!  Which means you can store any type of information on this for transfers between PCs.  Regular 4GB and up USB drives cost a few hundred dollars, so this is definately an added benefit.  You can sync with Outlook, and have your appointments, tasks, and contacts sync'ed.  ... Awesome!  :)  Enjoy!

<Title>Great player, but has a few minor issues.
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I want to start off this review by saying that this player is awesome. The screen is crystal clear, the text is easy to read, and navigation is a snap. If the videos on your computer are any kind of decent quality, they will be the same quality on the player. Plays the most common formats, and comes bundled with a converter for the file types it WON'T play.  That's the good, now for the bad. I'm not sure if this is isolated to my computer, but I want to throw it out there as a possibility: when using the Zen Media Explorer software (Comes bundled. Easiest to sync to the player with.) The "close" button on the window won't work, and I can't navigate to a different location. Not that big of a problem, just use Ctrl+alt+delete to open the task manager and end the task. It's just annoying. Other than that, I haven't had a single problem with the player.  The conclusion: With a 60GB hard drive, easy navigation, and format compatibility, this is definitely a good substitute for an I-pod, which always earns points in my book.

<Content>I've had my Zen for about a month now, have had a chance to upload my entire music library to it, and to put about 10 movies on it as well.  This thing is slick.  The screen is gorgeous, the battery life is excellent, and the controls are fairly intuitive-- just make sure you set the touch pad to your liking, as it can get a little difficult to control if it is too sensitive for you.  All in all, my experience with the Zen Vision:M has been great.  For those of you looking for something comparable to the ipod, but without itunes and other such nuisances, this is it.

<Title>Zen Vision: M is better than iPod
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Vision: M is definitely the best mp3 player available. The only problem (and a cosmetic one, really) is that the 60 GB version is a little thick. Maybe I should have gotten the 30GB one, but I am just now (I've had it for a month, now) putting a lot of CDs on it, and I think I may want all that space, ridiculous as it seems.  Pros Good sound quality and strength. Plenty of space (not flash memory; actual harddisk) Good features (radio, voice recorder, video playback) Many supported formats (although it's not really a problem to convert with the included software) Well-customizable UI (differently colored menu bars, custom background image)  Cons Sometimes freezes, requiring use of the reset button. Slight high whine on voice recordings (This may be just mine, but I'm reluctant to ask about it or send it in, now that I have so much stuff on it.) Somewhat vague battery meter (not much of a con).  The radio recording feature that used to be available on the 30GB version was removed with a firmware update, and new versions of that player will probably not have that capability, but there's always the chance that it can be restored with a future firmware update. It was never advertised for the 60GB version, but that's possible, too.  It's also possible (in fact, more so than with the radio recording) that the problems with hanging and freeze-ups will be fixed with firmware updates.  As a hint, the freeze-ups seem to occur when one tries to view pictures that are corrupted, or not fully downloaded from internet sources (solely a dial-up phenomenon).

<Title>Better than Ipod
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A few people have made a big deal about the fact that this player is thicker than the ipod. Yes it is but so what? It has an excellent battery life and holds 60 gig which I have yet to fill, even though I have 12 movies and about 30 Gig of music on it.  The fact that it accepts .avi files as is with no conversion should be imitated by all MP3/Video players. It will refuse certain audio codecs in .avi format but most are ok. The refused ones can be converted to acceptable codecs using VurtualDub. Ipod doesn't accept any .avi files without a lengthy conversion.  Cons: Many of the accessories are quite expensive unless you seek them out at Ebay where they are in the $3-$5 range.  The major dislike I have is that selection of cases specific to the M60 is VERY limited.  I got an ugly silicon one which I paid about $15 for because I wanted to be sure of fit.  However the silicon case does protect the player quite well. There are other cases at Ebay for about $5 but they don't specifically state that they fit the 60 Gig model.  If you require a leather case you are out of luck.  The plug on is proprietary and though it looks the same as Ipod's I have been warned that it is different and that using Ipod charging/playing stands will burn out the unit.  The selection of charging stands for the M60 is very limited.  It is also annoying that Creative hasn't seen fit to support album artwork very well. Some artwork uploads while others don't and there is no way to see it in larger, more detailed size.

I dont think i even have a complaint.... hmm the touch pad is a little odd when u fist use it but after like an hour it becomes natural. The sound quality is xilent! as far as i know the wmv format is much smaller than the mpeg video format so you could have the same size players and the zen would be abble to hold more than the ipod (video). I personaly already have all my music (only like 150-200 songs right now), star wars (ep3) and full metal jackt on mine and ive only used 1.8 gigs! in mpeg format the videos were at least twice the size as wmv. Oh one bag thing is it doesnt seem to suport .gif images, but as far as i know it converts them.

<Title>COOLEST MP3 PLAYER AROUND?
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What can I say? I've owned a few Creative products and I've never been dissapointed. This thing is a jewel in its class. There's nothing bad about it. Even the fact of being thicker than an Ipod doesn't bother me at all, as it feels sturdy and quality in my hands. The only thing I wasn't super happy about is the sound. It's great, hey, don't get me wrong, but I got so used to the blasting bass sound that the good old iRiver H-120 has provided me for almost 4 years, that it is now hard to find a match in this field (SOUND QUALITY AND POWER), but anyway I can say the Creative Zen "does the job" more than decently. Ipod was the only mp3 I listened to that matched the overall sound quality that iRiver has, and I'd dare to say it even sounded a tiny bit better. I'd put the Zen on third place in the "Sound Rating chart". All tested with a decent pair of Sony MDR-EX81 earphones.

<Title>The Best Choice of all PVPs and PMPs
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Zen M Vision 60 GB is perhaps the best buy amongst video and music players.  Although very similar to it's smaller sibling (the 30 GB version) is only 0.2 inches thicker with same height, width, controls and screen.  The additional 30 GB allows double the amount of music, movies, pictures, etc as well as to backup the entire content of a typical computer (up to 16 GB).  I have had mine for two months and before, had a Zen M 30.  Also tried the Archos 504 and a Sansa for less than a week each.       Zen's M 2.5 inche display is the best in its class for resolution, contrast and illumination in a size that balances battery power and performance.  Unlike the Archos four inch screen, Zen's screen dims itself when being used as a radio or music player.  As a video player, the screen goes black (obviously).  Movies, photos & videos can be watched in any type of lighting environment on the Zen's display.    Controls are located on the front face and once you get used to, you'll see the logic that Creative had when designing them.  These are brightly illuminated in soft blue and sensitivity is adjustable trough the settings.   The headphone jack is conveniently located on the right side of the top of the unit next to the on/off switch.  The Sync Adapter, although controversial for some, has many advantages such as capability of direct connection to a charger and at the same time, output for a TV or monitor.  It also has the connection for  the usual USB-2.0 port.       Creative's software is sufficient for music recording.  If you want to transfer DVDs to your Zen, you'll need additional software which is readily available for free on the internet.  Of these, the most useful is Iriverter (plus the necessary music & video codecs).  Videos look surprisingly good even at its native minimum resolution (320 X 240).  You will see no ghost effect or pixilation.  Titles and subtitles look sharp and bright.  Battery life as a music player averages 14 hours which is enough for two days of listening to your favorite albums while at work.  As a video player, battery life decreases considerable to four hours; about two movies.  Although this number make look low, for purposes of comparison, the Archos battery life was from 8-10 hours on music mode and less than two hours as a video player.    Overall, Creative is offering an amazing product at a reasonable price that not only has all the features stated above but has also a recording mode, an FM Radio, synchronizes your computer calendar and allows you customization of music files by artist, title, genre, etc.  Has anyone mentioned compatibility and synchronization with Amazon's Unbox?    Thanks Creative...

<Title>Way better than iPod!
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For Christmas I received an 80 GB iPod.  After about a month of fighting with it to do what I did very simply with a Dell Digital Jukebox I finally gave up and returned it.  I have an extremely large music collection so I began to search again for the biggest player out there.    The Creative Labs Zen Vision: M fit the bill perfectly for what I was looking for: large hard drive and easy to use features.  I would have preferred an 80 GB if not larger but I'm fine with 20 GB's less to be rid of the iPod.    Features of the Creative Zen are really what sets this apart from the competition.  The color screen does a great job of showing not only the track name and artist but also the cover of the album itself.  If you can see the button in the upper left hand corner below the screen, this button is for randomly choosing the album of the day.  This is a nice feature for those that want to listen to something different but really don't know what.  The touch pad is MUCH easier to use than the iPod circular touch pad.  The iPod touch control was very difficult to control - especially when trying to select an artist a ways down the alphabet.  With the Creative Zen all you have to do is hit the button on the right side of the touch pad to move the cursor to the alphabet and then just use your thumb to move down the alphabet.  Another great feature is the "add to selected" feature.  While it may be available on the iPod, I could never find it - despite reading the manual.  This makes adding various songs, albums or even artists to the now playing extremely easy.  As a nice side feature once you're finished your only about 3 clicks away from saving it as a playlist if you choose.    There are quite a few other great features but I think the point has been made.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  [...]

<Title>software issues - buyer beware!
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to have a Zen Micro and loved it. Just got the vision 60GB for my birthday. It took almost 8 hours to fully charge. Once it did, it was fine and I transferred my music onto it.       The very next day, Windows XP says it doesn't recognize the hardware. In the past 2 days I and my husband have spent over 13 1/2 hours trying to fix in incompatibility. I've gone through pages of creative forum boards help tips, installed drivers, reinstalled patches and upgrades, and done everything Creative help desk has said to do numerous times. My systems and memory meet all the requirements.       Nothing has worked, and it looks like I'm out almost $300 unless Amazon will let me swap for another one. I've downloaded, uninstalled/reinstalled so much junk for my computer as suggested by all sources I've researched - that now my computer is so messed up I will need to bring it to a professional to try to wipe clean and start from scratch b/c I don't know how to do that myself.       I begged my husband for a year to buy me this product, and now I'm very sorry that I did.

<Title>Why limit yourself in iLand when you can be free in Zen Land?
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little baby does everything I wanted it to. Gorgeous screen image, loads of storage space, interfaces with Outlook. The controls are easy to use and I especially like the My Shortcut Button for quickly jumping to your most used function.  Sure, it's bigger and heavier than those iThings, but it plays a much larger variety of formats and isn't shackled to the clunky iTunes software. You can use Creative's software or simply drag and drop within Windows.  The only downside to this product is the difficulty in finding good silicone skins. If you aren't a silicone skin fan, there are plenty of other case options out there.  So, set yourself free from everything "i" and enter the wonderful world of Zen!

<Title>Buy One NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> Pros: Ease of use, Sleek design, Quick music file transfer, great value for superb features, huge memory capacity. Great screen display. Shows album cover art. Touch pad takes awhile to adjust to even though I have the Creative Touch which also has a touch pad. However, the learning curve is very fast. You can adjust the touch pad sensitivity. You can change the wallpaper (screen) display. Amazing little device. Leave the clear window display protector on since it doesn't hamper screen visibility! Too many great features to mention all of them here.  Cons: Ear buds could be of higher quality perhaps, AC charger must be purchased separately, Creative doesn't have a case for 60GB model, yet. My Creative Touch's case will work perfectly, though.  Other Thoughts: I got it today. I read all the customer reviews on this site. Some mentioned problems with the software so that worried me. I charged it for 5 hours(I also ordered the AC charger) so it'd be fully charged when I got home from work (at least one review recommended it be fully charged before beginning.) I also noted that several reviews complained about customer service. This is my second Creative device. I am satisfied with Creative's service. It is true that phone support is only free for the first 60 days (an extended warranty is avaiable for about $60.00). I called the customer service number and tho' I didn't have the serial number with me, the person was very helpful. He assured me I didn't need the software as long as I had Windows XP and Windows Media Player 11 (I do). Sure enough I connected my player to my notebook and it was EASY! I synced 317 albums to my Vision M in less than 90 minutes. I'm out of words. Just get one!

<Title>You won't regret this luxury. =)
<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an excellent buy for anyone. I highly recommend this product, especially if you're not willing to jump onto the iPod bandwagon.  Coming out of the box, the Creative Zen Vision M is a rather sexy gadget for an MP3 player. It actually looks good enough to warrant a good protective case/jacket/skin... you do NOT want to scratch this thing BECAUSE it looks that good. =p  It's actually a rather large device, which kind of surprised me... and it's even a little bit on the weighty side. I was disappointed to see that the Zen still has an open interface port... great for collecting dust and the like.  Those were my only "complaints," if you can even call it that.  Having the 60 GB variant, I will never have to buy another MP3 player for at least 5 years or so. Seriously, the capacity will suffice to contain your entire music collection, a bunch of movies, your photo collection, and still have space left over.  Sound quality seems like it is dependent on the file. No sound [...] from the player itself. Which is awesome. =D  Image quality for video and photo viewing is also awesome. I love graphic quality, and this doesn't disappoint. Very vibrant colors, seamless play, and enough battery power to view at least a movie and a half (I believe... haven't watched any movies all the way on this thing yet).  I'm a type of person that usually just throws on music on to the player and play at random, so I can't really say anything about playlist creation. Nor can I say anything about the software, since Windows XP Professional w/ SP2 picked this up and read it as a storage device... which is exactly what I wanted. No installation of unnecessary software... unless you want to harness the power of convenience of a GUI. =)  It's expensive, it's hefty, but this Zen will NOT disappoint. [...] is a lot of cash to put down on a multimedia player, but trust me, it's worth it if you're looking to spoil yourself with a little something. =)

<Title>Great!
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player.. I love it.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for the following reasons:  1.  It is not easy to find accessories.  There appears to be nothing specifically designed for the 60GB that allows me to play the files in the car.   2.  Very limited instructions.  Maybe for those already familiar with players, it's no big deal... for me, synching was an absolute nightmare.  Do not.. I repeat.. DO NOT use both the software that came with the player and Urge to synch unless you're better at directing the software to locate specific files.  Both programs synch to the player-- and they synch ALL of the files on your computer.  No big deal-- you can direct the software to synch certain files-- except this wasn't clear when I first opened the package-- nooooo instructions.  Otherwise, I love it... love love love it. I highly recommend it to anyone who, like me, just refused to buy an ipod!

<Title>Zen Vision M ROCKS!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had a Dell DJ, an IPod Nano, and now this.  I have found this to be a very nice MP3/Video player. I also got the video cable.  The video converter software that comes with it, does an alright job, but after much testing and evaluation of other video converters, i have found DVDFab Platinum to produce the best quality.  It comes out at 700-900mb per video, which is a little big, but it gives an output that when viewed through the video cable on a non HD tv is great.  Watching videos on the built in screen is great.  A little small, but totally watchable.  When the wife takes me to a movie I don't like, I can watch a movie on my zen that I do want to see.  Getting data onto the zen is very easy.  The included software is an explorer extension, so the zen shows up in explorer, not quite a USB drive, but still very easy to use.  It is play for sure, which means plug it into an xp machine and you can see it, and copy data to it, with out installing any other software.  In conclusion, BUY IT!  You will not be sorry.

<Title>This lacks some features of the 30 GB model
<Date>Tue Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zen Vision because I wanted to listen to music and to record FM broadcasts. I went with the 60GB model because I thought bigger was better. Although I like the MP3 player, I'm sorely disappointed by two things: 1. This is slightly bigger than the 30GB model, so the 30GB Vision cases don't fit. I've been unable to find any cases to fit this model, even on the Creative website. That's pretty poor customer service, in my view. 2. For unknown reasons, the 30GB model can record FM broadcasts, but the 60GB model can't. This is a subtle difference that isn't made clear in the promotional materials. You'd think the bigger and more expensive model would have more features, not fewer. Very poor product design and marketing.

<Title>vivid but easily scratched screen
<Date>Sat Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very happy with my recent upgrade to this player from my 3 year old 60GB Creative Zen Xtra (which is still barely alive after regular use).  The video feature is great, and worked perfectly with dvds that I ripped using a guide I found online (google "Zen Vision :M DVD Ripping Guide").  A full DVD takes up almost 1GB, so the extra capacity is really nice.  The screen is impressive but scratches very very easily -- NEVER remove the protective plasic sticker that is on the screen.  Mine came with a bubble underneath the sheet, which left a small smudge underneath when I pushed it out.  So, I took off the sheet and wiped the screen with lab-quality lens paper and cleaner, which somehow put small scratches in the plastic, leaving it worse off than when it started.  I also really wish it included the optional tv out cables and wall-charging cord.  After using a friend's zen micro, I was worried about the ease of use of the scrolling pad.  However, Creative has really perfected this feature in this model, which is only slightly less intuitive than the ipod's scrolling wheel.  Other than these complaints, this player blows everything else out of the water -- is definitely the best current option if you want high capacity and demand better features, screen, and battery life than the video ipod.  I'm hoping that it lasts as long as my last Creative player.

<Date>Sun Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've only had the player 4 days and absolutely loved it while it worked. When I plugged it into my computer yesterday I got an "unable to recognize device" message. My first assumption was that there was something wrong with the computer and reinstalled software, etc.  But after spending about 18 hours working on the problem, I realized that it was a malfunction with the player.  And I have A LOT of company...there are HUNDREDS of posts online from people having the same problem.  Just try doing a search on "Vision M USB" or "Vision M unknown device"    If you're still thinking of buying this, go to [...] (the manufacturer) and go to the forum pages and search "unrecognizable USB".  You will find an unbeliveable number of posts from people with this same problem.  And Creative has no solution for it. You have to mail back the player and wait weeks or even months for them to mail it back.  Several people have had the same problem with more than one player.  If I had known about this, I never would have purchased this player.  I will follow up this review with the results of my return for repair experience.

<Title>Am Happy and Just Lucky (?)
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player in mid Jan and waited a while before I would come up with a fair review :) I thought why not spend a bit more to get the extra 30GB and I didn't regret it! I updated the firmware and did everything I am supposed to do and it never gave me any problem so far. I've read many reviews about it not being recognized by windows etc so I guess am just lucky? Been using it quite a lot. Battery life is great and the screen is amazing. It sounds good even with the included earphones, much better than my old Sony and new Philips.   So it is a tad thicker than the 30GB version (and Ipod of course) but so what? I like how it fits in my palm and I don't carry it when listening to music anyway. I often read reviews about how bad the sensitive touch pad is etc but it just took me a few minutes to learn how to work with it. Oh and it never hang on me - surprisingly or luckily?  The good about the sync adapter - you don't need to pay extra for it, it lets you charge and use the av out at the same time. Well the bad is of course the hassle of bringing the adapter wherever you go if you didn't purchase a direct wall charger (which many people complaint why it didn't come with the player in the first place) and the chances of losing it. So I guess you just can't win. I bought a car charger/wall charger/av cable pack on ebay and they work great. The price of ZVM is decent enough without the wall charger. I wonder why many guys keep attacking that issue. Why don't they just pay a few bucks and get it delivered in few days VS many charging hours and complaint in the future? The wall charger on ebay + ZVM still beat Ipod's price!  I love the drag and drop function. Like I said I didn't face any software issues so it's been a great experience for me. I keep my music in the pc by artist name/Album depending on the circumstances. Creating playlist for them with ZVM Media Explorer is so easy. Just right click on a folder and select Create Playlist, voila! But to create playlist with songs from different folders, I would actually use Winamp to select all the songs first, save the playlist then sync with ZVM. The sync software will search for all playlists on the pc and copy them to ZVM. That's fab!  The player is great but nothing is perfect as usual hence the 4 star. It wouldn't play some videos that were successfully transferred. It says bitrate not supported. I have yet to find out why and there are many resources/forums online such as anythingbutipod etc. So I'd just skip watching those vidoes on ZVM for now. No harm done! Creative should have included a decent case instead of that silly pouch since 60GB version costs more. Not that it's expensive to buy somewhere but a 60GB silicon case is nowhere to be found! Hmm... Talk about being Creative? I would also love to see a firmware update with FM recording like the 30GB and gapless play back.   So overall - great features, good price, good (enough) media formats, ease of use, nice screen, bla bla bla... I just don't know what could you ask for more. Go get one now and kill the pods, YAY!

<Title>Just buy an iPod
<Date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this after a week of investigating the various alternatives to an iPod.  I wanted a good portable mp3/video player with a lot of storage capacity.   Unfortunately, when I got it, my computer refused to recognize it as anything but an "Unkown device".   Searching the internet, I discovered that is a VERY common problem, with all of the Creative portable media products....unfortunate that during my initial investigation no one mentioned it in any of their write-ups on the product.  Do a google search for "Creative Zen" and "Unknown Device" and you'll see for yourself.  I spent about 10 hours over the course of 2 days trouble shooting to try to get the unit to work on my PC.  I tried everything various websites suggested (except one thing mentioned in a bit) and also called customer service.  The joy of customer service is they told me to do the same things the web sites had said...which I'd already done before calling.   In the end they told me to return it for a new unit.  It won't help, the unit works on my girlfriend's computer...it's an issue with my pc.  But, my pc works great for everything else I do with it...there's nothing wrong on my pc end either except, perhaps, something conflicting.  As to the one thing I did NOT try to do to make it work.. they said to roll back from Windows Media Player 11 to 10.  Stupid, considering the unit came with an 11 installation disk... Also something I'm not willing to do, as I use functionality in WMP 11 for wireless sharing of all of my media files with several other devices in my household.  I followed half of Customer services advice.. I returned the unit, but not to exchange it for a new one.    I bought an iPod.  In the same period of 10 hours I WASTED on the Zen, I was able to transfer every bit of music and video I own to the iPod with enough time left over to actual go do something fun.  And, suprisingly to me, the iTunes software is incredibly useful for multimedia management.  It has features I hadn't seen in other software of it's type...I'm quite pleased that the Zen was so horrible or I may never have caved in and found out just how great having an iPod is.      To those like me who are avoiding iPod merely because it is Apple, I say only what I learned.  There's a reason for the iPod's overwhelming dominance of the portable media player market...and it's called quality and ease of use.

<Title>Not Ready For Prime Time
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the player for it's large storage capacity, sound quality and wide format compatability.  But I'm beginning to think that the negatives outweigh those advantages.    The negatives:  Poor user manual, no ability to select and play an album (except through playlists, it will play a randomly machine selected album however...It looks like you've selected one, but a random one plays), stupid dongle needed for charging/computer interface, charges only though a computer and said computer must be kept in full on mode (no standby) for the 5 hours it takes to charge (now this is green, isn't it?), battery apparently not user replacable when it wears out, non-intuitive frustrating controls, buggy on-computer software. I hate tap pads!  Give me a wheel.  The charging issues seriously limit the practical usability of this player.  You can spend another $100 to get a car and a home charger.  Incidently, I tried two different USB telephone chargers, one Motorola and the other Blackberry.  The Motorola lit the machine up and it showed that it was charging, but in the morning the battery was no more charged than when I started.  The unit did not respond to the blackberry at all.  Apparently Creative has rigged it so only a computer with their software (and I did mention that you can only install the software on one computer per license, so only one computer will charge your device, not just any computer), or their USB chargers will work.  Thumbs down to Creative, and I give them the award on how to create bad feelings amongst their customers.

<Title>What's all the complaining about?  It's a great player
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the people who complain that their computer won't recognize the unit, I'd be willing to bet that the majority of them didn't bother to let the unit charge completely before turning it on. I let mine charge via the USB connection for nearly 8 hours before turning it on and it was recognized perfectly by Windows explorer.  I than proceeded to use WMP 11 and MediaMonkey to transfer music to the player.  It's pretty nice not being constrained by iTunes and to be able to do what I want with my own music (i.e. download it onto another computer if I so desire).   The absence of an AC charger is annoying--especially given the sine qua non of charging the unit completely before using it--but not a big deal.  I bought one on ebay for less that $10.    I've waited about two weeks before posting this review because I wanted to make sure I really did like the zen vision:M (dumb name, eh?) before posting.  And I do like it.  The screen is fantastic and the menu items and rubrics are intuitive.  I sold my iAudio x5 30gb to get the zen vision:60.  I think the iAudio had slightly better sound and way more features (fm radio record, which is a disappointingly absent from the zen vision:M, despite what the amazon descriptions says), line in, etc.  But the utilisation of id tags in with the zen vision:m makes the reduced feature set worth it.  I don't have as much control but it's easier to use with infinitely easier and more satisfying navegation.  Also the batter life of the iAudio really stunk.  (So far the battery life of the zen vision:M is GREAT, but then again, it's new). I love the user-determined button on the upper left--I've programed mine to activate the voice recorder at the touch of a button.  Try that with an iPod.  Anyway, all in all, I'm happy with this player. Oh yes, I forgot to mention that it is annoyingly thick--apparently a 60gig version is coming out that is the same thickness as the 30gig version, but this one is fat.  Still not a big deal, I'm not planning on going jogging or anything with it.    I'd recommend getting the player.  If it had radio-record I'd have given it 5 stars.  If you're feeling nervous because of the numerous less-than-enthusiastic reviews, you might want to take the safeguard of getting it at a local retail store with a good return policy.  But I'd say go for it.

<Title>More features than iPod, but iPod has penetrated the mp4 market more
<Date>Sat Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After looking at the features of the ipod vs the "non-pods", I bought this Creative Zen Vision M 60gb MP4 player. I like the slightly thinner iPod, but it really is very insignificant when compared with the Vision M's features.   You probably already know the Vision M allows copying of Tivo recordings through Tivo Desktop and .avi (DVDs) through ripping software. I have Lost, Desperate Housewives, CSI, and Bones automatically updated each week on my Vision M when I dock my unit. Sometimes I like listening to books when I commute, so now I can download them through my local library for free. The library uses Overdrive and NetLibrary to check them out to me for 3 weeks, and guess what? No late fees, they just disappear from my list on the due date the library gave me. Owners of Ipods have to buy their audiobooks from Apple because Apple refuses to allow Overdrive or NetLibrary to use their iPod format for providing downloads. So, nothing for free for your iPod.  This was a big factor for me because this proprietary attitude is what caused Apple to lose marketshare in the 80s and move from a frontrunner to last place in the PC market.  Anyway, I recorded a meeting at work that took over 30 minutes using the built-in microphone and it caught everyone's voice just fine. I wish I had this years ago in school.  I use to carry a 1GB flash drive with me, but since I partitioned 4GB of the Vision M, I don't need it. I have about 8 movies, 20 short video clips, 600 songs, 15 word files from school and work, over 100 photos of friends & family, and I still have 30gb left to fill up.  I go on walks and have a wide range of choices now: listen to FM stereo, MP3s, audiobooks, a movie, or a TV show.  What can the Vision M not do is the question! I accessorized the heck out of this. I highly recommend buying the retractable cable set with adapters. It plugs into a USB, household power, or the car accessory plug with included adapters. Creative I-trigue 200 speakers are perfect for blasting sounds at home. Kroo puts out a nice black leather case that protects the unit from scratches, has a belt hook, and a kick stand so the player can stand up on its own, which is great for watching movies. I also highly recommend the Creative video cable. My VisionM hooked up to my 36" TV in seconds. The picture from the movie played just like having my original DVD. I have a 7.1 megapizel camera and my photos from that are on my Vision M, so when we put them on the TV, what detail! Case Logic puts out a nice case that holds the unit and all attachments securely. My Vision M is about two months old now, but I'm so happy with it and I am still discovering the amazing features of this unit.  The only drawback is that I cannot find a decent cassette adapter (tried Sony and Coby) or FM transmitter (tried one that cost $80 from Target) for playing MP3s through the car's system. Perhaps its time for a new car stereo with a built in MP3 jack.

<Title>Creative Zen Vision:M 60GB
<Date>Sun Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recieved this for my birthday two weeks ago. So far, I have added 60 CD's, 600+ songs from my computer, and various images. I still have nearly 50GB worth to fill. The Zen is soooo much better than the iPod (which my brother has). The program that comes with it is so easy to use, a very useful thing indeed when it's 3am, you're drunk, and you have just downloaded some songs that just have to go on your zen...   The zen itself is quite a nice looking little fella. The black front panel, with the blue LED's for the buttons add for a very nice looking bit of kit. The white backing of the zen makes for a nice contrast to the front. It has a large, crystal clear display screen, which is bright, but not overpowering (this can be adjusted). The controls of it are easy to get to grips with, 4 buttons and the scroller in the middle (which i prefer over the iPods' circular version).   It is a bit on the weighty side, but having said that it is not exactly going to weigh your hand down, and it does not feel as if you are going to drop it.   The sound quality of playback is amazing and, even with the headphones that come with it, the quality is very high with no outside interference. The added FM radio feature is a nice bonus too, though granted, I have not used this yet. The video playback quality is high, and as the zen plays many more types of file than the iPod, that alone puts the zen above the iPod (in my opinion).  The only bad points about the zen are: there is no audio input lead, and the adaptor is a bit hefty, but other than that, perfect bit of kit. Best buy!

<Title>Worth every Dollar you pay for it
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Here some corrections to a review:  --> The negatives: Poor user manual, no ability to select and play an album (except through playlists, it will play a randomly machine selected album however...It looks like you've selected one, but a random one plays)  You can select an album and you can play that album. I have no idea what Jan is talking about?  --> stupid dongle needed for charging/computer interface,   that is a weak point, but I got a USB cable with a connector for ZEN so I don't need the adapter dongle any longer.  ---> charges only through a computer   not true. You can charge with a car charger or a AC charger. I found that the charger for my digicam actually works for charging the ZEN ;-)  ---> battery apparently not user replicable when it wears out  I haven't been in the need to replace it yet, but on Websites it stated the battery is replicable and I don't see why it couldn't be done by the users themselves...(?)  ---> non-intuitive frustrating controls  In the system settings put the touch pad sensitivity on "high" and the controls work much better!  ---> buggy on-computer software  All you really need is the ZEN Media Explorer and the Sync Manager. Forget the other programs that come with the CD if you think they are too bulky.  ---> The charging issues seriously limit the practical usability of this player. You can spend another $100 to get a car and a home charger.  I agree on that, but the problem is all the MP3 player manufacturers try to make some extra money there... You have to look for used items to save some money there.  ---> Apparently Creative has rigged it so only a computer with their software (and I did mention that you can only install the software on one computer per license, so only one computer will charge your device, not just any computer)  I installed the software on three PCs and a laptop. No issues or problems whatsoever!  ---> Thumbs down to Creative, and I give them the award on how to create bad feelings amongst their customers.  I still think the negative points don't outweigh the positive points. I don't know about the charging possibilities of the iPod (as the market leader) but what I look for in a multimedia player is multi media capability! And iPod clearly has to many limits on what media types it supports!  I give the ZEN Vision:M a two thumbs up. It's not the most perfect player out there, but it's among the best!  I hope this helps some people in their decision making! :0-)

<Content>I totally agree with all of the other high reviews. This has been a great purchase and a fine piece of entertainment.  My only complaint is that if you delete songs and/or an albums from your computer (Windows Media Player e.g.) to save memory, the next time you sync the player it will also delete these items even if you still want them on your player. If I have all of these songs on my player I don't need them on my laptop also. Gets to be very frustrating.

<Title>One very happy customer
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this player in my hands just over a week now and I am totally happy with everythig about it. Well, almost everything.  First the good.  I found the sound, picture and video quality fantastic.  Setup was a snap.  I followed others advice and let the thing charge a full 5 hours before transferring just under 6000 songs to the player.  This took another 3 or 4 hours. The wait was well worth it.  All the album art was all there.  I've read some people have had trouble in this area.  I'd just suggest using Windows Media Player and make sure your library is cool there first and then it will come out cool on your Zen Vision.  Scrolling through the menus was really simple and after a short time I felt like a pro. Another thimg some people had a little trouble getting used to.(they must have previously owned iPods)  Finding one song to play or playing an entire album from start to finish is all real easy.  Another feature I love is the favorite button.  This button you can assign to do a specific thing when pressed. I have mine set to play all tracks randomly.  So I can be in the middle of watching a video or anything else and press this button and I straight to music.  Very cool feature.  Now the bad.  The "play all tracks randomly" dosn't really mix them up real well.  It could be my imagination but I swear I hear some tracks more than others. I can live with that.  If you are looking for an FM transmitter dock style for your car forget it.  I don't think you can even get a case for the 60GB yet. I'm sure all that will change by the time I post this.(at least I hope so)

<Title>I LOVE THIS ZEN PLAYER!
<Date>Tue Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Zen Vision:M mp3 player a little more than a year ago. First off, I absolutely LOVE how this zen looks (my zen is green)!   ------Here are the pros:------- -Awesome look -10 star sound (rated by me...:) -10 star video -10 star picture quality -10 star easiness to work with -Fits perfectly in my hand -huge video screen -nice features -o.k. price -FM radio -Voice recorder (this is great to use when learning lines for theater/plays) -Doesn't scratch that easily, sturdy and durable! -long battery life -fantastic memory space (I am currently using 3 GB of the 30 total- this means I have 6 full-length movies and about 900 songs)  ------Cons:----- -harvier -somewhat bulky -hard to find accessories in the stores, I have had to order everything on-line (this isn't that big of a problem though) -...can't really think of anymore at the moment!  I LOVE putting new songs and changing videos with this player. It is really fun-- also great b/c I can watch videos when I am running on the machines at the gym or doing the stair stepper.   My zen has only 2-3 scratches (that are somewhat noticeable) and I have had my player for over a year now.   Overall, I would give my zen a perfect+ rating. All of my friends have iPods, for that reason, I purposly didn't buy an iPod (I also wanted FM radio and better quality and the green color) and thus I am beginning to think iPods are overrated.   ***If you want something amazingly cool, durable, with awesome features and great sound, then the Zen Vision:M is for you! If anyone is trying to decide Zen vs. iPod, defiantly go with the Zen!

<Title>Almost good
<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall it is a good player.  Battery life, size, weight are OK. Sound quality is good. USB disk functionality is very useful and I really love the fact that I do not have to install any software to use it with XP.  However... Buttons for next, previous and fast forward are unbelievably uncomfortable. They are just terrible. Seems like frame was designed around the touch pad when someone just remembered that forward and rewind buttons are also needed. The scroll/volume control touch-pad is uncomfortable and not accurate enough for navigation in lists.  Playback sound quality is good, and interface is OK but player hangs too often when I try to skip to the next song while one has not begun or just began playing. My record was 3 hangs in 10 minutes. Luckily I had the pin to hard-reset it. However, that was not the case when player froze in the middle of trans-Atlantic flight. I was ready to throw player out of the window. It is good that airplane windows can not be opened :) Since software is not perfect reset should be doable with a ball-pen.  Startup time is too long. Deleting songs is slow. Charging and listening at the same time is not possible. If it is possible I did not find a way to do it.

<Title>The problem is product reliability
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this in December.  The first unit was DOA,  went right back to the online merchant for an exchange.  The second unit has been here a few days. Software installed on two different computers.  On one computer I get the "device not recognized" issue discussed elsewhere.  On the other,  the computer and the player can talk to each other but file transfer rates are inordinately slow -- initially about 40 files per minute,  but as the player's hard drive begins to fill up it gets ridiculous -- currently with about 2600 files on the player transfer rate is down to about THREE files per minute. Ack!   I performed a reformat and firmware update as the Creative technicians reccomended but post-cleanup the  same problems happened all over again.  I played back some music files,  sound quality is excellent,  but alas this unit number two is going back to the seller for yet another exchange.  Update,  March 07:  I am now on my third unit.  Currently transferring files from my hard disk to the Zen player. This player has the same problem as the preceding on I was sent:  once you have a thousand or so files residing on it,  transfer times for succeeding files are EXCEEDINGLY slow.  It is currently doing about 200 files per hour,  and getting a little slower each hour.  Since I have about 8,200 titles to transfer,  this is going to be about a 40 hour job.  Forty hours to transfer about 30 gb of music is unacceptable.  I previously owned a Creative Zen Touch,  and it had no such speed problems.  Everything was nice and smooth until it got stolen....

Sound on the player is excellent when you use top quality earphones (Bose). One problem you may experience is the USB recognition; this can be quickly resolved by going to Microsoft Support and downloading the MTP file to your HD.The player should be fine after that. Just give the batteries a chance to charge first. Best Buy sells the 30gb version for $249; Shop around and you will probably come back to Amazon! Got the player in one day!

<Date>Sat Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very good Personal Media Player. I've had it for over a month and have had very little problems with it.  It's easy to use reliable and pack with good features. The video images on the screen are awesome very vivid & colorful. They look better than the Video Ipod (You can see them side by side). You can just drag and drop your music and files into it... With not much hassle. You don't need to convert your files to another format like with a Vid Ipod. It's very easy. Also you can transfer pic or or files from your camera without the need of a computer through the USB host function it's a good feature when you need some extra space.   However it does have a few set backs... It's a little bulky about the size of a box a cigarettes. There aren't many accesories for it...far fewer than the smaller 30GB version...you'll be hard pressed to find a case for it...and it needs a good case because the damn thing scratches quite easily. Also it has no compatibility with Macs (I think this is more of Apple's fault than Creative's) so you can plug it in to a mac to load files or other things. It can also be a bit noisy while the harddrive access information. And the buttons are a bit sensitive but you can learn how to adjust them.  But besides those complaint I think it's a solid player that deserves more attention. If you get this you'll enjoy the advatages it offers over Zune and the Ipod particulary not being tied down to a proprietary software...just drag and drop your files and enjoy.

<Title>Its an OKAY device
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have spent a lot of money on MP3 players and such.  There is no perfect player.  They all have good points and bad points.  I was convinced that the ZEN is the master of multiple formats but that is not true; its says it supports MP4 video but it refuses to play/load them so I am back to converting to AVIs.  I find the sync software to be lacking and inferior to the iTunes software ( for device management ).  The buttons on the corners are too senstive to a car mounting device so I have to lock the player after mounting it, which also means I cannot make adjustments by simple touches.  Overall I found the software for synchronization to be very poor.  If you simply load your media through the USB connection ( as a removeable drive ) then no problems there.  If you like to sync with music folders, pictures, movies, etc ... i hope you have better luck than I.  On the bright side ... the ZEN player has great firmware built in - far more functional than the current iPods; better features for media show and tell; cool image backgrounds, and most important -- that little reset button at the bottom.  My video iPods would freeze every-so often ( its a natural disease ) but there was no HARD RESET button.  The ZEN has it and I have used ut.  It actually boots into a firmware menu which gives you the choice to reformat the player ... not bad i suppose but there is the first option which is a simple hard reboot - it will rebuild your index and with in minutes, you have you player back and with all its media; if this happened to your iPod, you have to let your battery die first.  on the battery note ... its pretty good; better than the iPod we still have ( one iPod was stolen from me on a airplane )  iPods are more prone to theft because of their popularity so maybe the ZEN is better ( a theif would pass up on it ) ... oops back to my battey review ... I watched one two hour movie  ... and listened to about 2 more hours of music ... with only draining less than 50% ... not bad.  There is no perfect player ... repeat, there is no perfect player.  Would I recommed this player?  Only to advanced users.  Do I like having it?  I suppose .. for now I will use it  UPDATE - so my woes came from a faulty desktop but more over I had problems with my laptop too.  But my IBM thinkcentere running Vista Ultimate works like a charm; I can sync and all that fun stuff with media player 11.  My other systems run media player 11 too but ... ehhh ... again I will leave it at the same rating.

<Title>Great Little Gizmo!
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let's just say right off the bat that I am somewhat technologically challenged when it comes to these new fangled gadgets, at least until I get used to them. I still used the CD player and CDs.  Well, my 33 year old son told me I needed an ipod.  He has a friend who is really into this stuff and said to buy Creative Zen, because they are better and cheaper, with better capabilities. I picked this one because I wanted plenty of room to hold DVDs and music.  Besides for sixty dollars more, you double the gigs. I bought this gizmo and asked my son to figure it out for me.  Big mistake!  He started loading all his stuff on it, so I had to buy one for ME and give him the first one.  All that said, and also that I am just getting my feet wet with it, this is an awesome little gizmo and I am tickled pink with it! Will be travelling in a couple of months and HAVE to take my Barry Manilow music with me.  I would go into serious withdrawal without it. I've got 46 songs loaded already and it didn't even make a dent in the memory. It loaded in seconds.  Was amazed at how fast.  There's no little wheel.  It's a rectangular touch pad and 2 buttons to each side.  It needs only a light touch for the pad.  You can also lock the pad so it doesn't get moved by mistake, like if you want to start it playing and leave it on.  You can also set it to turn itself off in varied amounts of time if you leave it on by mistake.    I think it takes tens of thousands of songs and a couple hours of DVD. You can load photos too and can also pull in radio stations. The screen is a couple of inches square and it shows a crystal clear picture.  You can watch a DVD and actually see it! The music is clear.  Man!  What a neat little gizmo.  It's small and packs a whallop! I can load ALL my 7000 Barry Manilow albums (well, maybe not quite that many), and still have room for some meditation music for the plane, some Wayne Dyer motivational stuff and maybe add a little Earth, Wind and Fire, and Benny Goodman, and Harry James, and whatever and STILL have room for a DVD.  It comes with earphones and a charger that plugs into the computer.  It also has a software disc that comes with it and a fabric type pouch. You charge it up and start.  Can't wait till I really get into this gizmo.  Welcome me to the 21st century! If I can do it, you can too. (Not nearly as scary as I thought.)  PS--My son is even more tickled than I am, cause he understands the gizmo better (but not for long).  He's just not tickled pink--maybe blue, or green.  Actually, he likes green. He is an electrician and has loaded a bahzillion songs on his, so he plays it while he is wiring stuff all day long.  Anyway--Buy it.  You'll like it.  Update:  The sound quality is AWESOME. I hear things in my CDs that I never heard before, and these are CDs I have previously played over and over.  I loaded songs all day yesterday, maybe something like 40 CDs and I still have something like 48 gigs left! I already loaded enough songs to take myself to France and back and I still have room for tons more stuff.  No kidding, I DID load my ENTIRE Barry Manilow collection (and it's a big one) + 8 meditation CDs and some old stuff like Reader's Digest set of 4 1950s CDs.  Come to think of it, I might have loaded more like 50 CDs yesterday.  Anyway, you get the idea.  Did I say this gizmo was a nice size for your hand, guy or gal.  Not too big, not too small, but j-u-s-t r-i-i-i-i-g-h-t! One of the best buys I ever got for my $$$. And, my CDs are here, so if they get scratched in CD form, I've got 'em right here!  Oh, if you copy something to the gizmo you don't want, you can easily delete it off through the software.  Look out world!  I'm starting to get into this gizmo!  Another update: it's really easy to load songs.  The software practically does it for you.  All you need to do is find the "Rip" and "Sync" buttons. You can also change titles or artist info later and it updates automatically when you sync something else.  Got a pair of Bose headphones for my gizmo at the Bose outlet in Hagerstown Sunday.  Awesome!  I'm cookin', man! Am still in search of a just-right case for it. Meanwhile, I'm using an old CD belted holder.  Think I might have found the right case.  Will let you know when it comes.  Check my other reviews for wall charger and auto charger and cases NOT to buy. Yes!  Finally found a great case.  See it in my other reviews.  May 1 update--still LOVIN' the gizmo! Ladies, guess what!  Some of the purses out there have a nice outside pocket that the Giz fits in perfectly.  Put the Giz in the pocket, dangle the wire from the Giz, and go shopping while plugged in and with your purse on your shoulder.  Love it!  I've got so darned many CDs on it now, it's pityfull, and I STILL have 47 gigs available! I am sooo glad I came to my senses and bought it!  Oct 2007 Update--my son wanted me to tell you all that he has beaten the heck out of his gizmo, unintentionally of course.  Being an electrician and wearing it on the job while he crawls through things to wire stuff, it gets banged, dropped, etc.  Anyway, he wants you to know that it still works fine even though it has taken one heck of a beating.

<Title>Zen Vision M
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'd been searching for an mp3 player since this past Christmas.  After a few months of research, I finally settled on this one, and I'm glad I did.  I just got it, and I've already added several albums to it.  I've wanted something with that capability since I was 12!  It's easy to use, and while the touch pad is a little sensitive, it's no trouble to use when set on low.  The four user interface buttons surrounding it aren't as difficult to press as I've heard.  If you download the newest version of Windows Media Player (11), you won't need to install the enclosed CD-ROMs.    My only complaints are the lack of a wall charging adapter and a decent protective case.  I paid $19 for said cord, but such a basic accessory should not be sold seperately.  A small carrying sack and a thin vinyl cover are included, but they don't really cut it.  That aside, I highly recommend this.    PS:  There was an issue using Media Player, but it's easy to correct.  Make sure that when you use the "snyc" feature, uncheck the "automatic syncing" option and do it manually.  That way, if you delete from your PC whatever's loaded to your ZVM and want to add new material later on, nothing will be lost.  Trust me, I learned the hard way.

<Title>Many Perks
<Date>Fri Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first got the product I was worried about the start up time, before reading that the product can not run off of USB, only battery. After the battery gained enough charge to start up (I used an AC->USB charger that my phone uses), it was fine. The main reason that I purchased the product was for the Codec support that it lists. This works great, and XVID encoding can get some full length TV shows encoded at the 320x200 resolution with movie quality audio for anywhere between 41mb to 70mb, much better than the 120mb required for a standard encoding. The ear phones included are decent but I went out to get actual ear buds because, though audible, I can hear everything in the background. The Stereo works fine if there is a strong signal near by. It is nice to be able to play any sub-category from the menu of the tracks, either by band, genre, album, or variation of songs just by hitting play when it is selected. I bought the product for the many variations of encoding it supports, so that I could get a decent size product (60GB) and fit an even larger amount of media on it though the encoding. I am still working on the A/V cable issue due to the different wiring that is required, and have not tried the voice recording. From what I have seen, the product is worth the buy in my mind.

<Title>Better that iPod!
<Date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zen a few weeks ago and have loved using it.  It holds a ton of media and displays it on a surprisingly high quality screen.  I decided on this unit over the iPod because I have had two iPods both of which have lasted no longer than a year and the Zen is about $100 cheaper.  Pros:  Compatibility!!!  Not only is this device compatible with almost every form of video, but you can just drag and drop files onto it.  You can also use it as an external hard drive and even partition it as such.  A/V quality is excellent.  Cons:  Creative definitely has the right idea by adding more tactile buttons, BUT the most important button of all (the select button) is not tactile.  This makes it a little difficult to use but I am already very used to it.  It is also a little on the thick side, but I am hoping this will mean that Creative didn't miniaturize everything so much that the hard drive will fail in a year like the iPod.  Some people complain that the 60GB Zen doesn't record radio, but who on earth wants to listen to a lousy radio recording all the time?!?  Overall, I am very happy with this unit and so glad to be free from proprietary rights issues that plague Apple.

<Title>2nd Times a Charm
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The first one I got I had to send back because it didn't work straight out of the box. This one works and it has a lot of great features such as built in FM tuner (where's the AM), recorder, and ability to set your pictures as wallpapers. Still not sure how to add songs to a playlist in the device. There does seem to be a lot of software issues with it. I have another 30GB version that I have to send back to Creative because it just stopped working one day. Had it for about 3 weeks, then no computer could recognize it.

<Title>Great Product!!!!
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:  I travel frequently and need entertainment to get through long delays.  The Zen Vision M holds every CD that I own with plenty of room to spare.  I also like the fact that the 60 GB model can download photos directly from Canon cameras.  I've found that 100 pictures can be downloaded in approximately 10 minutes.  I also have purchased movies and TV series from Amazon's unbox service.  The Zen screen is sharp and provides a reasonable picture and sound.   However, problems may occur when synching Amazon downloaded video to the player.  The material transfers to the player, but can not be played and a message "no license to play appears".  Apparently, "Hotfox for Windows Media Format 11 SDK (KB929399) causes this the problem. Once the update is removed the problem disappears.  Unfortunately, Windows will continually attempt to redownload this so called "fix'.  Microsoft at its very best!     Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and use the player daily.  Below are some downsides a potential purchasers should cosider before purchasing the Zen Vision M 60GB:  Cons:  Poor Manual, Size, lack of Creative case, Charging only via Computer and Battery life  The Creative directions are skimpy and not particularly helpful.  The same goes for support via the web.  I've had to figure out how certain features work by trial and error.    The player itself is somewhat chunky.  This is not a problem on planes, but is not ideal for using the player at the gym.    For the 60 GB model, Creative does not make a case that fits.  However, I did find a case at www.podsplus.  Creative makes no accessories for this player.  The Zen does not come with a wall power adapter,  the player must be charged using a computer and the USB cable.  Creative charges [...]for a wall charger.  I bought a travel charger set for[...]that included a home AC charger, an auto charger, a battery extender cable and an extra USB cable.  The battery life when listening to audio is a reasonable 11-12 hours.  The battery life for viewing videos is a little more than 3 hours at best.  Thus, I carry the battery extender which allows one to run the player with 4 AA batteries.

<Title>froze computer - short circuited my motherboard
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used the Vision M 60gb for about 3 weeks, very light use, mostly playing music while in the kitchen cooking and eating dinner. on about the 3rd time to charge it, I plugged it in via USB to my computer to recharge, and it immediately froze my mouse, then I noticed my whole computer was frozen, I had to manually shut my laptop off. ever since, my laptop never rebooted, not even back to BIOS, no video at all. so I took it in to a local computer shop and they said my motherboard was fried, some bad circuits. I paid 312$ to get it fixed. Creative said they are not going to offer to pay for this nor did they offer any additional advice. I now have it working again, and get nervous every time I plug it in. I feel Creative was quick in their response and Amazon was quick in mailing the mp3 player to my house, but the actual manual and compatability of the USB charge is faulty. I still think, on paper, the Vision M is best deal for the money. I gotta have radio N PR in the morning and music in the evening. but because it actually cost me more money, becuase it broke it's recharging device, my laptop's motherboard, I cannot give it 5 stars.

<Title>Might be useful for propping up a short table leg
<Date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I can't get this thing to charge.  This is my second one with the same problem. I returned the first. (Nice job with getting me the replacement, Amazon.) I try charging the unit and the blue light on top flashes, but the unit won't turn on and even after 20 hours of charging it does nothing.  Once in a while, while charging, it'll randomly turn on and you can use the menu, but after a few minutes it goes black.  I've tried charging with a USB wall adapter and PC USB port.  Same behavior.  Very disappointing after reading all the good reviews.  Creative labs support site has been no help.  They suggest pushing reset (which does nothing) or upgrading the firmware.  How do I do that on a dead player?  It needs power for the PC to recognize it.  Spend the extra $100 for an iPod.  Hours fudging with this thing to get it to charge: 10.  Hours spent enjoying it since purchase four months ago: 10.  What a huge waste of two hundred and seventy-five dollars.

<Content>Sound quality excellent, screen resolution excellent, usability excellent, value for money excellent, battery life excellent (6-8 hours playing music). A dramatic improvement over previously good Creative products. The only issue has been that it hangs a couple of times and you have to reset it through the pin hole on the bottom. This seems to happen when disconnecting the USB cable from a PC. Infrequent problem.  All in all an excellent product...

<Title>Excellent Product Although Description May Be Misleading
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This one is pretty bulky the dimensions listed on the Amazon page for this device are the same for the 30gb, which isn't true this one is a bit thicker (it's 3 IPODS thick and weighs 6oz, the 30gb is 2 IPODS thick) I returned it and am going to get a 30GB instead, besides that the Zen is pure awesomeness, the sound quality is ABOVE that of an IPOD and the display is very crisp, the front part is a glossy plastic so you should get a silicon case with it and not remove the plastic screen protector that comes with it. It may take a few hours to get used to the buttons but it's not complicated. If you have an EXTENSIVE music/video collection and don't mind the it being a bit bulky (.8" thick to be exact) go for this one if you don't and keep media on some other device (like on your computer) i would go for the 30GB since they only differ in size and storage space and price (the 30gb is $50 cheaper and it doesn't take very long to transfer files if you have USB2.0 on either of them). i'd recommend this over an Ipod to anyone it's the best bang for the buck. One downside is that you can't browse files while listening to FM radio.

<Title>Buying a headache.
<Date>Thu May 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased this with overnight shipping.  Arrived as it should.  Plugged it in, nothing.  Blue light flashed.  Waited, waited, waited.  Nothing.  Won't charge.  I try all USB ports, I get a battery USB charger, and a 110V to 5V mini-USB charger.  Nothing except the occasional "battery charging" icon.  Then it quits.  Tried to call the Customer Service they tout.  Can't find the number, it's hidden in a CD somewhere.  Tried "Live Chat".  Says my browser won't accept SSL, which is nonsense.  I "Chat" a lot, and buy a lot over the internet.  I went for email support.  I got an automated response with a list of stuff to try.   I'm instructed to try ALL of those, and then email back.    Their first suggestion is that I downloade a firmware upgrade dated early 2006.  Why that might be appropriate I don't know.  This is 5-07.  I download it, though.  Now, to install the firmware the device has to be connected.  It won't connect.  It won't turn on.  Period.  I've emailed "tech support" again, twice.  The first time was 4 hours ago.  No answer.  Stymied.  If this company, their product and especially their touted "Customer Service" were a fraud, they'd act exactly like this.  Precisely like this.   It does seem that a few people have made it work.  But unless one is interested in purchasing a project I'd pass on this.  It's not worth taking the chance of having to deal with the company.  The only computer experience worse than this was with Symantec/Norton software.  Update:  Now ever the "battery charging" icon has disappeared.  And I still can't contact the company.  It's back in the box, and away it goes. This isn't worth it.  Corky Corcoran

<Title>ipod killer..if only..
<Date>Thu May 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm usually too lazy to write a review, but after spending so much time in researching for my "dream player", I thought I'd help some one make a wise decision. OK, so I waited for almost a year, going through different options for "any thing but an ipod" - archos, Cowon, etc. and finally decided on the Creative 60 gb.   And I loved it when I finally got it! Yes, all the nice things in the other reviews are true - amazing screen, excellent music quality, ipod-killing features, etc. But then, I also read some reviews where they mentioned about the hard drive quality of the zen, and how it freezes up often. Well, I was praying that the issue must have been with only certain pieces, and hoping it wouldn't happen to mine!.......guess what, I was wrong! Waaaaah!  It's just so disappointing that a product that is loaded with features can't be built sturdy enough! It's like creative chooses to give more features than ipod, but compromises on a quality hard drive / firmware. I filled my zen with almost 35 gb of music and videos, and found out that it freezes sometimes when trying to skip a track, with no specific pattern. And more so with videos. And then when I reset it, it took 10 minutes to "rebuild" the whole library! ??? I can only imagine what it would be like to fill it up to its capacity.  I just returned it today, and I'm back again on the search for my dream media player... or hopefully creative will take note of my review and send me a free zen after they fix it...  (ya right!)

<Title>Why out now
<Date>Sat May 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm rating this 1 star only because why come out with a 30gb player then after months or maybe it was even a year a larger space 60gb one after I already BOUGHT the 30gb one? That really aggravates me and totally unfair. I'm sick of shady practices to get you to buy more. Hopefully my 30gb will hold out for space.  If the 60gb was initially available I would have bought that one.  Ipod came out with both a 30 and 60gb sizes. Creative was in direct competition so they MUST have been contemplating the space issue.  So whats the deal?  Trying to push early to get sales??? I don't know but I'm sick of this!  I can't stand nice products then a better version gets realeased. Xbox does this and drives me bonkers!  I buy a new system and literally 5 months later afer I can't return the darn thing a new updated one with much larger hardrive whis is a necesity if buying xbox live material (you can't do it on a 20gb initial hardrive which by the way the sysem uses 7gb anyway), and HDMI port for better access to HDMI connection site for 1080p gamining eventually.  So once again not MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR additions still the basic system but enough to really tick you off because inorder to get complete satisfaciton of these products are the version realeased later but not such a difference in the actual product to pay double for a new system.   That's it.  Maybe I'll just buy a 60gb Ipod next instead of the Zen because I'm totally ticked off!   Microsoft is really bugging me lately and am wondering if Apple has less buggy programs, and more reasonable to customers. I can't stand it anymore.
