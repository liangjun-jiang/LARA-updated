<Title>Virus Beware
<Date>Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved this item the other day and installed the required software on to my laptop, the great thing about the software is it contains several trojan viruses which caused fatal errors on my computer. Not to mention this mp3 player wasn't compatible with windows media player, atleast not mine so I couldn't even get it to work properly! Complete waste of money, I hate returning items but this was by far the worst thing i've bought! But hey if you don't want to listen to me and decide to buy this item, I hope whole heartedly that you don't have the same problems as I did!
