<Content>For the price this is better than most. Whish it could play longer than 5 hours before recharging. I like carrying my songs in such a small unit. With out the earbuds,

<Title>This Player Is PERFECT!

<Content>I bought this unit after reading the features - I saw the price and said to myself - well, if it is too good to be true, it must not be so good.  I bought it anyway - and I must say - it is EVERYTHING that it claims to be.  There is some uncertainty about which drivers to load from the CD included (a mini CD), but everything works fine.  I do not recommend this for somebody who expects everything to "just work" with no thought - THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS UNIT IS.  While intuitive - the player requires some time and effort to unravel some of it's aspects.  I give it FIVE STARS FOR VALUE, THREE STARS FOR EASE OF USE, and FIVE STARS FOR OVERALL QUALITY OF WORKMANSHIP.    
<Overall>5
