<Title>Upgrade from Micro Zen
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First let me say this, no subscription service Apple, no dice.  I want a choice and ITunes does not cut it.  I really don't care how "popular" and "cool" it is to have an Ipod.  I owned one and after using subscription music services I won't go back.  I have used my Zen Micro with Napster and Yahoo Music Service, both are excellent.    Decided to upgrade to the new Vision:M and I must say Creative has done a wonderful job.  The user interface is improved, mostly due to a larger color screen.  All 4 buttons are now real buttons, not a touch pad.  They also added Forward and Reverse buttons on the side of the scroll bar.  Addition of accessory port on the bottom is a huge plus, even though there are not many devices yet.  Battery life is very much improved, watched 2 hour video and listened to 3 hours of WMA protected files and still had half the battery life.    Software could be improved, Creative needs an all in one solution.  I had to use third party programs to download album art and convert video for the player.    Video looked great.  On the down side, dongle required for USB and charger.  There should be more accessories available in a few more months and I would like to see better cable options for video and audio output.

<Title>Great Player, A good choice.
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>  I would first off love to say that I respect apple and the ipods are great. But, when a better product comes along lose the fanboyish attitude and open your eyes. THough its all based on opinion. Anyway the Zen vision:m is an amazing player. Its got a beautiful screen and amazing video quality. The navigation system is quite interesting and takes a couple of days to master. Its touch pad is sensitive making scrolling easy. ALso in my opinion its a sleek player. The smooth black with the white backplate is elegant. Also, the blue lit buttons add to the effect. The earbuds were comfortable and the audio quality and the amount of sound impresses me. It is bigger than a 60g ipod but I have become used to the feel of 3rd generation ipods and this one feels comfortable in my hand. The software was basic enough and I found it easy to use. Also what I like about this player is the ability to set backrounds. I don't know if the ipod does it but this is one of those little features that I have come to love.   A note to those who like to make the ipod and non-ipod arguments like its life and death. Calm down creative has been making jukebox ipods before apple and ironiclly holds the patent for the touch technology for the two. Also there mp3 players generally recieve positive reveiws. Its all opinion, this is a place to review not to bash things.

<Title>Wonderful except for the touch pad
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After having done about 20 hours of Internet research and then going to a vairety of electronic stores, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision M (Black) because of its features and sound clarity. This is my first MP3/Multimedia device, and I am amazed with how easy it is to "rip" CD's and video. I strongly recommend this one for beginners because its variety of  features, including using it as a "flash drive".  The video playback is as good as any newer computer monitor or the handheld TVs which have recently come on the market. It is much better than the Portable Play Station.  However, and here is why I gave it 4 stars, the touch pad and button controls are extremely hard to get used to. The first thing a new user needs to do is change the sensitivity from "high" to "low". This is no easy feat because the instruction booklet, at least the English version that I got here in Tokyo, does not do a good job at all of explaining how to use the pad. It was very annoying and frustrating to learn that to go from the vertical menus to the horizontal menus that I did not need to tap the pad, just glide my finger over to the left or right. Even now, I have not figured out how to use the keyboard to input my name into the owner information.  Honestly, Creative could have come up with a much better designed touch pad and button system. If this were a first generation MP3, or if touch pads were a new item, this one's problems would be acceptable; however, since this is not a first generation concept, what were they thinking?   I asked a few friends and family members to try it out and they said they would not purchase it until the touch pad is improved.  For me, and I am the principle user, I hope that I will get used to it and figure out how to use it. In the meantime, I'll just do without using the keyboard.  Of course, I must learn how to navigate between menus.    The touch pad aside, the battery life, the picture and sound quality, the voice recorder, the FM radio, the organizer, and the really easy way to load music and video make this a pretty good product.

<Title>Perfect Gift 
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought one for my brother in France. It is really cool! Smart screen and amazing video quality. But some concern comes to the adapter. As Amazon's description says, 'Power Adapter with 2 interchangable plugs'. But there is only one US plug in my box. I thought there should be another EU plug. Have I missed sth or I got this missing-part box from amazon unluckily? Feel free to contact me kangtong61@gmail.com

<Title>The Amazing Mp3/Video player 
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an amazing gadget. After waiting for more than a month, (I just got it today) I couldn't believe how innovative this toy is. Indeed great things come to those who wait. 262K Screen, beautiful if you see it for yourself. You can view photos while listening to your music, which has great sound quality. And the customizable wallpaper is an awesome extra. Support to multiple video format is fantastic. And I won't get stuck to using iTunes.  I just had to adjust on how to handle the touchpad, quite annoying at first but you can adjust to it pretty quickly. This is not even available in our country yet, and Ipods are abundant here but the only reason they are selling better is due to the good marketing strategy of Apple. Well, I'm a smart buyer and I won't buy to marketing alone. Overall, regardless of the minor issues, this is a great buy. Try it. Ipod is great too, but this one's greater!

<Title>Great player but set touchpad sensitivity to low
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This a great player.  Buyers might be put off by the touchpad the Zen uses because its so unwieldy to use at first but just know its the same technology laptops use with their touchpads except this one is shaped like an oval that's up on its end.  But as another review mentioned, one of the first things you should do is change the sensitivity of the touchpad to 'low'.  A touchpad on **normal** sensitivity setting is great for navigating a big laptop screen but for the Zen's relatively tiny screen (great screen btw) you'll be all over the place.  But trust me once you buy this player, one of the first things you should do is to set the sensitivity of the touchpad to low.  Everything I've tried with this mp3 player is great, good interface, fast, long battery life, the Zen is just very well designed.  Although the interface/buttons on the player are good, there is a little bit of a learning curve to figure out what all the buttons do but with some practice and consulting the user manual (which is kind of meh in my opinion), it can be mastered in a few hours.  BTW, don't get the Toshiba Gigabeat mp3 player.  Its a total piece of crap compared to this.  I bought the Gigabeat, found out it **couldn't** play mp3's compressed at 64kbs, 44khz (even though the product description AND the user manual says it can).  I'm returning that POS.  But the silver lining is that I would have never discovered the Zen if I hadn't tried out the sorry Gigabeat.

<Title>I love this MP3 player
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research before I ended up buying the creative zen vision m.  After my research it came between the iaudio and the zen vision m. I didn't even consider the ipod video since these two players had better video quality play back then the ipod video.  They also had more features and more formats when it came to video.   I ended up getting the zen vision m because for 30 bucks more I thought it was great having the extras.  The audio is great, and video playback is great.  What I love the most about it is that I can click and drag my video files into my zen vision m not having to convert it first.  The only thing is that I wish battery would last longer.  I've read reviews that made the zen vision m seem really big, but in all honesty it is bigger than the ipod video but it can easily fit in your pocket.

<Title>iPod Killer!
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M is an excellent player.  I prefer Windows Media Player to iTunes, so I'm glad there is an alternative to Apple.  The Creative software that comes with the player is very good for those people not in love with Windows Media Player.  The sound and video is of the best quality I've seen in any player.  The controls and usability are of the greatest design. I highly recommend the Zen Vision:M

<Content>Finally...its like someone at Creative did some usability research and despite the engineering difficulties....they went with a "Vision" and just made it happen..but...FYI Creative, even though this is a top notch competitive product, there is still a long unbeaten path to perfection.    For once I feel like were on the same page and that's comforting. Kudos.  Ps. Hire me if you hear me.

<Title>Same as iPod, but more versatile
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a 60GB Ipod video for x-mas, and almost opened it, until I read that this was coming down the pike. After a bit of inverstigating, I realized, that I would be spending a lot of time converting video to have it run on the Ipod, but that wouldn't be the case with the Vision:M.  To get video from my Tivo to my Vision:M is a breeze. Only 1 very quick conversion is needed using DirectShow Dump (about 2-3 minutes per 1/2 hour of video) to strip the Tivo code and leave a plain MPEG-2 file that can be viewed on the device.  The screen is phenomenal. It's why I got this instead of the original Zen Vision (I wanted the bigger screen, but heard lots of bad things about the Zen Vision's screen).  Album art works pretty well, but not great.  The headphones, I thought, were pretty darn good, but I upgraded anyway b/c I had the $$$ available.  It's does everything I wanted/needed a device like this to do. I have a few complaints though:  - THERE ARE NO ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR THIS THING!!!! - 30GB goes quickly with 192kbps MP3 files, and video and pictures. - some videos build audio sync problem as time progresses, but this is easily corrected with a quick Pause/Play. - it scratches just as easily as the Ipod, so do yourself a favor and order an Invisible Shield at the same time. - the little adapter is a bit of a pain as I'm probably going to have to order at least one more to be my "travel adapter".

<Title>Wish I'd bought a video Ipod
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Vision:M is a decent little player - except for the "little" part.  30GB for a video/mp3 unit is not enough, especially when the Video IPOD offers 60GB - 2x the drive space - for $50 more.  After loading my average size song collection of 15GB, my Vision M has only enough room for about 2 - 3 hours of MPEG-2 (TIVO) video.     Creative would have been better off leaving out the seldom used FM and digital dictation functionality, and putting a properly sized hard drive to serve the core MP3/Video purpose.

<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Allright, I don't normally review things I buy, but I think the purchase of a good music player is important to everyone's mental health so I'll consider this my good deed to the world for the day...BUY THIS THING!  Everybody is looking for different things in their mp3 players.  Here is my situation - I decided to switch from minidisc to mp3 because I have a huge music collection and I wanted to be able to take it all with me wherever I go.  I was one button click away from buying a 30 gb ipod when I saw this online and researched it.  I have had it for a couple weeks now.  I'll make it simple since there are lots of reviews on here already:  -the most important things to me are sound quality, battery life and overall quality, which is why I chose this over ipod.  I tried out some ipods and the Creative killed the ipod in all of those things.  I bought some decent headphones and the sound quality on this thing is INCREDIBLE, I am a musician and my life has now been blessed with new listening experiences daily.  The battery life is great and I have watched full videos and music and photos (I put 10,000 of my digital photos on it as well as 22 gigs of music).  The overall quality is great, it feels well built and the screen is simply amazing. I haven't encountered much scratching at all but who cares about that outside of the screen?  Just cover the screen with a little screen protecter you can buy anywhere and you are fine.   I am also easily putting podcasts on here and you can use any podcasting service if you link it to the zencast software that comes with it!  The downfalls I have encountered have to do with the occasional difficulty I have tranferring everything the right way from one place.  I am able to get EVERYTHING and every video and song format I want on the player (including Quicktime files) but sometimes I have to try the different softwares that come with the player...there isn't one central place to do everything.  I am going to try to do everything from Windows Media Player now cuz I hear that's the way to go. In general, it just takes some patience to figure out the software and controls.  I continue to laugh at all the ipod owners jumping on here and smearing the Creative Vision, but I have to admit that if I had dropped all that cash and got sucked into Apple's trap, I would be pretty angry myself after seeing this come out.  With this player I have full freedom and consider it an extension of all the files on my computer and subscription services, rather than only what I can pull through itunes.  I have no problem with the size and I take it skiing with me.   The bottom line is it's a sweet player, great quality, with the player's positives much outweighing its negatives.   It has so many little details and options, making it that much more fun than what ipod has to offer.
