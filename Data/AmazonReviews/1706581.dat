<Content>I bought this player for my 15 year old daughter.  There are no instructions on how to get the music from your computer in to the player.  The only instructions that are included are in regards to the buttons on the player itself, and these instructions are extremely poorly written.  I have asked to be able to return the player, but they will not accept it back.  They say it has been too long since we bought it.  But we were trying many times and many different ways to get the player to work, so that is why the time passed.  Anyway, I am now stuck with this player that is absolutely worthless to me.  Beware before purchasing this item!!!  I would definitely not recommend it.  My son has an Apple Ipod and it is extremely easy to use. Wish I had spent the extra money and bought one of those for my daughter.
