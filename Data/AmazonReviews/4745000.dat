<Content>What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks.

<Title>My second iPod shuffle.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Wll, they are small, so I misplaced my first one (I 512k).  Found it later.  But I figure that it will wear out anyway (even if switches go on forever, batteries WILL eventually die) given the heavy use I put it to.  I really like the fact that it does no need an external cord like the newer ones, which is why I bought it even though it was the same price as the newer one.  I also use it mostly in the car, since I do not tend to like headphones.  Also, the iTunes has gotten better as a program, but I have not bought anything better from the service.  I had a CD collection before I got the iPod, and feeding in my older CDs has gotten me to reacquaint myself with a good many CDs.   Now, about that vinyl...

<Title>Big on Hype - Small on Performance
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money.  Don't buy this one.. keep looking.  This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player.  This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music.  Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music.  This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.  My iPod Shuffle irreparably died after one year and one month - just one month after the warranty ended.  I've heard similar horror stories so I know that I'm not the only one to have experienced this.  Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like "hold" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.  Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year.

<Content>I received my shuffle promptly, but unfortunately have had problems with it.  It downloads properly, but won't shuffle the songs (they play in the same order all the time), and some songs have never played at all. My daughter ordered one at the same time, and hers works perfectly, so maybe it's just my particular product, but I have been very disappointed.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This little device works really well. The battery life is as advertised. There is no skip what so ever unlike the iPod, so this is ideal for running. It is small and light and easy to take with you cycling or running and great for skiing and snowboarding. Another great feature some may overlook is the storage factor. This product also serves as a thumb drive so instead of buying a 512 thumb drive and using it for storage if your a college student like i am, you can buy a 512 shuffle and alot as much memory as you want to storage and to music for only $20 more...good deal. Ive read some reviews that say there is no "hold" feature and this is false. If you hold down the play button for a few seconds it will "hold."

<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is going to make my weight lifting MUCH easier  If you thought that the iPod was small, then you're gonna LOVE this thing! it's smaller than most packs of gum!  Some people have been knocking this player's sound quality, but I have found its sound quality to be superb! ---- the player is solidly constructed, very small, and very lite - the perfect exercise companion  Unless you love flipping through playlists, then this is all you really need, in any music player - having an LCD would be nice, but you won't miss it - the price makes this thing a TOTAL steal  and lastly, I'm very impressed by the disk use capabilities - I have already used my 1 gig as a USB drive for some files - I'm very pleased with its versatility - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

<Content>The iPod Shuffle (IPs) is great for working out. Pros -No moving parts, no chance to skip -Easy navigation, don't need to "look" to skip tracks or adjust volume -Headphones sound as good as previous iPods -Price is right Cons -Headphone a *little* long when working out, can get "in the way" when exercizing; your miliage may vary. -Cannot manually sync with more than one computer without erasing the music content  each time you connect to another computer (unlike earlier iPods) -No "repeat" function  Overall, a really well designed product and fun to use. I'd recommend it to parents for youngsters who aren't ready for the responsibility of a "regular" iPod, but want a portable digital music player.

<Title>Got it, returning it
<Date>Mon Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this because I needed instant gratification and everyone was sold out of the 20GB iPod (except for the U2 version, but who wants that?!)  I apparently don't have a USB2.0, so it never got more than 3 files copies over at a time before crashing.  My computer is 2 years old and has been upgraded with RAM, but apparently no amount of RAM is enough to run iTunes on a Windows XP machine.  This was supposed to help in relaxation and reduce stress through music ... not happening. I'm going back to breaking stuff.

<Title>Pros and Cons are silly 
<Date>Tue Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love all the reviews of the iPod Shuffle that list the "Pros" and "Cons", as if you would then look up some other MP3 player and compare its pros and cons to this one.  Is anyone really doing that?    The reason to own this gadget is that it is the current "it" gadget to own.  If you don't get it, i.e., "why no screen?", "why so expensive?", "why does the battery only last 12 hours?", "why is it different?", well, then don't buy it.  You don't get it.  The reason to buy and own this is because once you saw one, once you held one in your hand and marveled at its design/weight/simplicity/smoothness/color and all the rest, you had to have one.  You don't buy the iPod Shuffle because it's "exactly what I need in an mp3 player."  No it isn't.  It's not "exactly" what anyone needs.  But it is the coolest gadget you'll buy this year.  Addendum: Here's a weird thing I've noticed with my shuffle: When in "shuffle" (random) mode, I seem to hear the same songs  more often than one would expect if it were truly random. OR, maybe this is just a trick of the mind associated with all true randomness: we expect random to mean that once we've heard a song, the liklihood that we'll hear it again is really low, when in fact, the liklihood that we'll hear it again is as high as the liklihood that we'll hear ANY of the songs on the player. I guess it depends on how they wrote the "random play" program as well (like, did they include something in the algorithm to exclude the same song being heard twice in a row, even though in true ramdomness, that should be possible).

<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just made a trip to the United Arab Emirates and back (12+ hour flight each way) and although I packed my 20 gig 2G ipod, it never left it's case. I wore the shuffle around my next with headsets in my pocket and they never set up the myriad of security alarms and the batteries lasted forever!  On the return trip I discovered I hadn't shut if off, charged it from my laptop and still managed to use it 99% (watched a movies the other 1%) of the flight and there was still battery left for the additional 3 hours to get home from JFK.  I let Itunes pick the songs and then eyeballed the ones it selected and changed the ones I knew I didn't want.  Did I miss the screen no, did I enjoy the randomness, YES...actually heard songs I'd forgotten I owned.

<Title>Cool gadget...with a flaw
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is a fantastic little device created by the genius designers at Apple.  They know how to make things work. The user interface is very easy  on the Shuffle.  The flashing green and orange dots mean different things, but they don't take long to learn.  The sound is excellent. I was very surprised by how it handles every song and seems to strike the perfect balance in pitch, tone, bass and treble.  The only draw back is that it charges through your USB port.  If you have USB 2.0, it charges fast. However, your computer has to be on for it to get power. If you own a laptop (I own an iBook), your computer has to stay on - you can't charge the USB if the laptop is in sleep mode.  This usually means I am using the laptop's valuable power source to charge the Shuffle and I dont usually keep the laptop on for 4 hours (Apples recommended charge time).  I highly recommend you buy the USB power charger from Apple.  Other than that, the iPod Shuffle is a perfect device for work, studying and just listening to music.  I haven't taken it off in days...

<Title>BLAND
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is disappointing.  Buyer beware, if you plan on using it mainly for a thumb drive that it cannot go in at a certain angle, especially into certain Dell USB ports.  I bought this specifically for a thumb drive use and to listen to mp3s while I walk to class.  I got to class today, tried to plug it in, it would not recognize it through the front port.  Just beware if you are planning on buying it strictly for a thumb drive.  Other than that it is ok.

<Title>Horrible value, a piece of garbage
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my first iPod Shuffle about a year ago (8/05).  It lasted til the following May, and then started to act weird.  The lights would flash, and it would crash my computer, but wouldn't play music.  Took it to the Apple store, they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty.  The new unit lasted a few months, and then it also bit the dust, in the exact same fashion as the first one.  I'm gentle on my iPod, never dropped it, left in the hot car, etc...and yet they both have died on me.    I'd recommend the Creative Zen Nano.  It's cheaper, much easier to add songs to (no iTunes required), and has a small screen that makes it more navigable, not to mention an integrated voice recorder and FM tuner.

<Title>Unreliable.  Cute Design.  Bad Engineering.  Poor Quality Control
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the "Genius" bar. At that appointment, the "genius" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple "genius" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The 'genius" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.  Perhaps it should be retitled the "idiot bar."

<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod shuffle is small and compact, and easy to use. Plus, now that the new version is coming out, this type will be a lot cheaper. I love the shuffle versus other players, because it gives me a chance to listen to all my music, whereas if I could see the song I was listening to, I'd be more apt to go straight to my favorite songs and never listen to all the other great songs I have. I'm a college student, and the shuffle is perfect for me: cheap, small, and durable. **EDIT** Haha, yes the person who commented was right. Itunes has an option that converts songs to 128kbps so that you can fit more songs on your Ipod. I now have 163 songs on it and it is only about half full. This is a great mp3 player for the price. Sorry about the confusion before! Bottom line: If you want a cheap iPod, the shuffle is the way to go.

<Content>I bought my IPOD Shuffle a year ago and a half ago and it crashed on me in 9 months. The Apple store here in India, replaced the same under warranty with another and that one crashed on me again in nine months.  However, in the process, I have become an ardent fan of the extremely user friendly design that I am looking forward to the new and yet to be released 'METAL' version of the same. I just hope this product lasts a lot longer than the warranty period.  I have learnt from experience with Apple products, that if Apple wants a product to last they can make it last and vice-versa.

<Content>The iPod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other iPods. I've had one break on me, and my new one doesn't work on the "shuffle" setting when listening to podcasts -- what I use my shuffle for.  On the other hand, the full-sized iPods don't do the things I need a shuffle for -- mainly, be really, really small and pretty indestructable. However, I haven't tried out any of the new generation of iPods, so they may solve one or both of these difficulties.

Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle. Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere!  On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol!  Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go.  So if you are a fast paced, mobile and not a control freak, then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it!

It almost feels fragile and I'm wondering how long it will hold up in use (for me to use when I run).  The on/off switch is somewhat difficult to move without feeling like I'm squeezing the thing to death.  It seems if Apple had just put a finger nail slot in the slide switch it would have been much easier to use.

<Content>The Ipod Shuffle is an amazing music player. I just got it, and I LOVE it. It never skips (due to the flash player) and is so light, I forget it's in my pocket. It's the easiest thing in the world to hook up to your computer, it charges fast, and it saves you money. If your the type of person who has millions of songs (literally) but doesnt have the time or the enrgy to make playlists, or to shuffle through a million songs on a big ipod, then get this one. It's easy, it's light, and it's really amazing how small it is.

<Title>Don't Buy This
<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is useless and expensive. I don't like ipods in general because they have an internal battery that only lasts 8-12rs new. Which means after a few months of usage, the battery life starts to shorten. Before you know it, you need a new battery which Apple charges a hefty $99 to replace as stated on their website. The ipod shuffle is the worst of ipods.  Here's why:  1. No LCD screen so if you have the 1GB shuffle with 200+ songs on it, have fun pressing next until you get to the song you want.  2. Battery life is horrible. Only 8-12 hours so about 10hrs of realistic battery life. The Sony NW series (NW-E75, NW-E95, NW-E99) have 70hrs of battery life on 1 AAA battery. I have a Sony myself and they're not lying when they say 70hrs.  3. Ipods hold less than half the amount of songs as a Sony with the same storage capacity. The 1GB shuffle holds 240 songs as advertised. The Sony 1GB NW-E99 holds 640 songs. Why? Because Sony has better compression software while delivering the same sound quality.

<Title>Love it! 
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this for about a week and I absolutely love it.  I have never written a review for anything, so I have to say that I am pretty impressed with this. Also, I don't own any other ipod products - this is my first intro. to the ipod world.  I've been reluctant because of how expensive the other gadgets are, and also because I did not want to fuss with setting up docking stations, syncing software, etc. I really like computer stuff to be like a TV - plug it in, turn the power on, and it should WORK the FIRST TIME.  That is exactly what I got with the IPOD shuffle (finally something that works without aggravation).  The iTune software is easy to use to compile and store all your music.  The ipod shuffle really does work like a regular USB.  Sound is incredible (however, I use my own noise-cancelling headphones instead of the in-the-ear headset that I just can't get used to).  Battery life is as stated - about 12 hours off of one charge.  It couldn't be any lighter, doesn't skip, and the buttons are intuitive.  The one GIG version holds a serious amount of music.  While you can't carry around your entire CD collection, you can carry around your very favorite songs from your collection, which is how I've been using it. The cons: The buttons seem so sensitive that I'm a little concerned about durability.  Also, its too bad that this device doesn't include radio.    Overall, I think that it is an excellent MP3 player and it really is worth every cent. I highly recommend it to people who want something very easy to use, don't need to have their entire music collection at their fingertips and for those that are new to MP3 players.  Also, great for those who use public transportation (I don't think this thing plugs into a car stereo like the other ipods).

<Title>ipod shuffle versus creative muvo tx fm
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>hopefully someone will find this helpfull if torn between the two. I have both the muvo and the shuffle. The muvo since Christmas and the Shuffle for week. The muvo is a 256k and the shuffle is the 1g. In comparing the two they both have strong point and week ones. Cost the muvo 97.00 the shuffle was 145.00. Size is comparable. Weight goes to the shuffle. Display to the muvo, although I rarely look at it other than to remember a song title. Feel to the muvo for hefty solid to the shuffle for elegance. Sound quality a draw. The muvo has an equalizer which can be adjusted to suit your needs. The shuffle sounds good all the time. The sound in the shuffle maybe a little truer to the source. Battery life is yet to be determined. The muvo will eat the battery fast if you use the display alot or change settings. The shuffle is still on its first charge after a week. Headphones to the shuffle. They seem to fit better in the ear without jamming them in somewhere. They stay in the ear better and don't fall out.Attachments a draw. The muvo has a nice plastic slip case with a clip for the belt or pocket like a cell phone. The case has a hole for a lanyard of your choice. The shuffle has a lanyard only.Software to the shuffle. The itunes is alot easier to look at and more fun to use. The creative media source is utilitarian, but works fine. I use these items for walking and yoga and find them both to be great products. My biggest concern with the shuffle is the fact of the replacement of the rechargeable batteries. My hope is in time when I need to do that there will be a less expensive alternative. Also, consider the fact of buying batteries over the same time period for the muvo. You could get rechargeables and see how that works. The shuffle does have a battery pack attachment which will add life and make it weigh a little more than the muvo. If you go that route the shuffle would go on and on but with battery power. I hope this helps someone with their purchase. The reviews I read were helpfull to me. You can't go wrong with either choice. I use both and would not hesitate to recommend either.

<Title>iPod suffle - Pros vs. Cons
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: Good price for flash MP3 player Slick looking  Cons: Where are all the goodies for MP3? (No LCD, No EQ, No changable battery - would it cost another $100 dollar as other iPods?, etc.) No lyric supports. (Yes, I said lyric support. Some places you can download the lyric with music so when you play the music the lyric shows on your LCD. Thanks to no LCD technology.) No voice recording, FM options, etc.  (The SanDisk makes MP3 players at same cost with LCD/VR/FM/EQ/ etc.)  Well I think this iPod Suffle for following people: who just want to listen 100-200 songs in random without any options. (Why don't you just listen on FM radio?)

<Title>What the shuffle is, what it isn't
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My shuffles got delivered last weekend. I ordered a 1GB for myself, and a 512MB for my wife. Since the 512MB version is for my wife's B-Day, I had to keep them hidden through the weekend. I set up both, and I will discuss the 1GB since it's the one I've spent time with.  Packaging: True to form, this is another example of excellent Apple packaging. The green box is distinctive, and obviously will be the color of choice for all shuffle related packaging. One interesting note is the package has a "loop" plastic closure tab, so these things are meant to be hanging on a display rack. I imagine we will eventually see these things for sale everywhere. Opening the box revealed a simple set-up... laynard, earbuds, and the shuffle. Beneath the contents was a small CD folder containg iTunes and instructions. I actually haven't read the instructions yet, but intend to once I don't have to keep the thing hidden from my wife.  Shuffle: Man, this thing is light. Almost disturbing at first, it just doesn't feel like anything. However, I got past this once it was in my pocket. It's great because you don't know it's there... ie there when you want it, not in the way when you aren't using it. The slider switch for Off, Playlist, Shuffle was stiff at first, but after moving it a few times it became easier. (Of note, this was hard to operate when my hands were cold, so be aware of this). The navigation ring is very simple and obvious. Play/Pause, Forward, Back, Vol Up, Vol Down. That's it. The battery button is cool, I would like to see some times for how much juice is left when it is amber, but otherwise cool idea.  Setup: Taking the cap off of the USB connector, you see either 1GB or 512MB printed on the connector. I have an older mac, so I only have USB 1.1. This wasn't a big deal. The mac recognized the player, asked me to name and register it, and we were ready to go. iTunes has a new window for the Shuffle, giving choices on Auto-Fill or Manual, Source for autofill, and a few other settings. Hitting the iPod button gives more advanced settings such as auto-conversion to 128kbs AAC from other formats, and setting aside memory allocation to use as a data storage device.  I set mine up for 256MB data storate, 744 MB of music. I chose a specially designed playlist as my source, and hit Auto Fill. iTunes picked approx 190 songs from this list randomly, and started to transfer. USB 1.1 transfer time was approx 15 minutes (glacially slow compared to firewire), but really, this was OK since I'm going to use USB to charge the thing anyway, which takes 4 hours.  Use: I got to use it for the first time yesterday on my walk to work. I use my 40GB iPod in shuffle mode while walking anyway, so this was no different. Sound quality is excellent. It fits in any pocket, and while I haven't used the lanyard yet, it does look like a great solution for occasions where you don't have pockets. I'm sure it will look a little dorky at first, but I have a sneaky feeling that everyone will be wearing these things like jewelry very soon.  As a flash-memory key, it is formated in FAT-32 (windows) format, which is handy.  You can use it effortlessly between mac and windows, transfering files, pictures, etc.  Very useful, and it is plug and play ready for this purpose.  Two thing that I really appreciate: 1. Weight. It's so light, as discussed earlier. Just perfect for walking / biking / working out. 2. Navigation ring. Far superior to scroll wheel for use while in my pocket. Very easy to get to by feel through my coat, pants or shirt. Easy to change volume, fast forward, pause, etc. Just brilliant, simple engineering.  iPod -vs- Shuffle: The shuffle isn't for everyone. The lack of a screen makes it a tough primary player unless your only use is for working out / walking around. Not usefull at all as a source of listening for a home stereo, maybe usefull in the future in the car. However, I doubt I'll every use my 4th gen, 40GB iPod as a portable device again. I think it's found its permanent place in my home stereo, as a complete substitution for CDs. The shuffle is perfect for my mobile needs... I'm not just saying this as an Apple fan... it is PERFECT as a mobile MP3 player. Just music, long battery life, low cost, and seemless integration with iTunes. Even USB 1.1 transfer times are tolerable since you have to charge the thing anyway.  I was hesitant when the shuffle was announced, but now I see the light. I can't wait to give my wife hers, I'm sure she will absolutely love it. It looks like her mini is going to find a permanent home in the car.

<Title>Great for what it is: A simple flash based player
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Simple and elegant. This is what makes the ipod line great. I have owned a 20gb ipod for just over 2 years. It just happens to be the biggest ipod ever made as it is a second generation machine. I have used it long and hard enough that I have replaced the battery. With Etymotic Research ER-6 earbuds, the sound is phenomenal. So, why a shuffle?  I commute about 2 hour a day using buses, trains and subways. As a female, I don't always have pockets or belts to attach my ipod. It is usually in my bag. As I get jostled around, I don't know how many times that either the earbuds are pulled out of the ipod or out of my ears (ouch).  At first I wouldn't even consider the shuffle, but as I thought about it, I realized it would be great for the commute for the following reaons:   1. I can listen to all the songs that I have purchased through iTunes. 2. I can listen to audiobooks downloaded from Audible. 3. The ipod is light and hangs around my neck so there is no trying to find a place for it in my bad and/or losing the song as the earbuds get ripped out of the ipod or my ears. 4. As I tend to lose stuff, I am not going to be as upset to lose a $150 shuffle as opposed to the 20GB ipod that I paid a premium for as an early adopter. 5. I tend to listen to the same 200 or so songs out of the 1900 I have on my ipod.  So, what do I think now that I have it in hand? I like it. I like it a lot. The sound quality is surprisingly the same as with the ipod. With $100-$150 earphones there seems to be no difference. It is light and works great for the commute. I'm not hung up on the fact that it does not have a screen I did put a few favorite songs on twice so it would be more likely to show up. Also, if I want, I can set it to play in order and those songs will come up. Rating songs in iTunes is very helpful for this. All in all it makes a great supplement to my regular ipod.  One of the things that did upset me though is this: It is supposed to work with all macs; however, there is a caveat. You *may* need an adaptor or better yet the ipod shuffle dock if the shuffle doesn't fit "some computers" (sarcasm mine). I blithely assumed it would be some Windows box. Come to find out that it is too big for the recessed usb ports on the eMac. I was livid. I felt that two Apple made items should be compatible. I borrowed a male to female usb cable and it worked fine, and I also have a Powerbook that I can charge it with, but it was an unpleasant surprise.   The shuffle is not for everyone as it lacks the features of its more expensive brothers and sisters as mentioned in previous reviews. However, I believe it is perfect for what it is, and it exceeded my expectations as a device (compatibility issues aside).   *Note (2/10/05) I just found out I can fast forward, rewind and set bookmarks in audiobooks with the Shuffle. That bumps the rating to 5 stars! I just can not change it on the scale section. kmm
