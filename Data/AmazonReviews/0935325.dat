<Title>A Great Product
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm checking out some of the reviews here, and have decided to post my *complete* thoughts on this topic.   First off I'd like to say that it doesn't matter if the iPod is black or white.    Second:    Alot of people here seem to be angry about the "freezing black apple screen".  It can be frustrating.  If, however, you depress the center button and menu button at the same time for about five seconds the iPod will reset it self (this process requires about three minutes to complete).  My songs have never been lost when this happened.  I'd also like to note that I've had this iPod for 14 months now and use it from 4 to 10 hours in a day, every day.  I'd again like to note that I bought a rubber case for my iPod 14 months ago as well.     It has only frozen about 4 or 5 times, which has only cost me about twenty minutes of silence in 14 months.      Some of these reviews speak of the low quality of this product, like saying it has crashed, or is now completely useless, or apple is an impossible company to deal with (this I agree with), or the procuct is over-hyped, or... well this is just a montage of thoughts and quotes.       I am very happy with this product and I expect it to work for at least 3 more years, but I'll never know because It's practically filled up and will have to move on to a much larger allotment of space. I have about 3 gigs left.  At 160 kbps I have 10,419 songs I have 152 songs that are over twenty minutes long, some album sides burnt to CD then ripped to my iPod.  This is a product to take advantage of people, while It's still around.  I bought mine new for $400 dollars, I just saw a 5 Gig on sale at the mall for $189 dollars thats half price with TWELVE TIMES LESS SPACE!!!! A rip off if I've ever seen one, especially when you can buy the 60 gig on this site for considerably less than I bought mine for.   I do not work for apple of amazon email me for more details  buyers.

<Title>Awesome...
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been an iPod user since I bought a 5gb way back in '02, and they just keep getting better!  I have owned a 60GB white 5th gen iPod for several months now, and I'm very very pleased with it.  I use it for upwards of three hours a day, since I not only have all my music on it, but lots of TV shows, podcasts and audibooks.  I also recently bought the AV connection kit, and use that to watch my TV shows from the iPod on my TV  Things I like about it: * Easy to use and look good * Excellent sound quality if you encode your music at a high bitrate and use a decent set of headphones * Plays TV programs on my TV with surprisingly good quality * iTunes is awesome - probably my prime reason for sticking with the iPod * Podcast support is wonderful - I look forward to new episodes every time I use the iPod (I'm a Scott Sigler junkie too)  Things I don't like so much: * Poor battery life if using the backlight * 60GB ain't enough for me now, but that's not the iPods fault..

<Title>Great music player, Video an added bonus.
<Date>Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unfortunately my 4G iPod photo that I was very happy with was lost/stolen.  This led me to buy the 5G video product soon after it was released.  I bought it as a music player first and foremost, with the video as an after thought, assuming I would rarely if ever use it.  After 5 weeks of ownership, I am very pleased. - Considering the 60GB size, I was happy that this was still smaller and lighter than the 30GB 4G.  - I have been nervous about the screen scratching and have been looking for a better case than what was in the package...but so far not even a minor scratch. - Had no expectations for the video, but the quality is excellent considering the screen size.  Watched an episode of Lost on a plane (irony) and found after taking a moment for my eyes to adjust to the size, that it was really easy to see and the size posed no problems.  It's been fun to download some free trailers and so forth...but still overall, the video seems like something I will only use in the air. - Sound seems slightly better than the 4G, but I do not have a great ear, so it's barely noticeable.  Battery life is definately a concern if you plan on using it for video, but the 40% more batter life for the 60GB versus the 30GB was worth the additional $ to me.  The exclusion of the AC charger is dissapointing and would pose a problem for those who travel without a laptop.  Thankfully, I didn't lose that on my old one, so I'm set, but others should take note.  Well, I wish I didn't lose my 4G and could have waited for a few more upgrades in the product, but considering my expectations I am a happy camper.  As the title says, a great music player, with massive storage and good sound, with the added bonus of a quality video playback device with a vivid picture making up for the size of the screen.

<Title>Apple Service is woeful
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm looking at this jazzy 60 GB iPod with Video Playback, but I have a problem.  About 16 months ago, I bought a 40 GB Wheel iPod and loved it. But just over a year after buying it I had difficulty in getting the iPod to charge. So I paid Apple $65 for the battery replacement service and sent my iPod off. Nearly three weeks passed, without hearing anything from Apple, so I called Apple Customer Service. After waiting on the telephone for 25 minutes I got a customer service rep who, after finding my record, reported that there was nothing wrong with the battery, but there was a hardware problem, and that in order to get it fixed, I would have to pay $265.  "It would be cheaper to buy a new one," my customer service rep said.  So naturally, I thought about upgrading to the new Video apple. But I have a problem:  what do I do with the piece of junk that my first iPod turned into?  And there is an additional potential problem: what happens if I spring for $400 for the upgraded Apple, and THAT turns into a piece of junk?  The lesson learned (the tough way) is this:  Apple turns out junk and then doesn't stand behind its product.  The iPod is a nifty creation, but if it doesn't work for more than a year, it isn't worth a damn. And if Apple itself doesn't stand behind their products, then one has to wonder whether buying an Apple product is a wise investment. From my experience, Apple is more concerned with its profit margins then supporting the products it does produce.

<Title>Great Music and Video , AWFUL BATTERY
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the IPOD this week.  The music, photos, videos are great but there is one draw back.  The 20 hour music playback time is a bunch of garbage.  I did the test where the backlight was on maybe 10 seconds at the most, had the hold switch on and had the playlist on repeat until the battery died.  It died after 8 hours.  I called support and he said 10 - 12 hours is the norm.  I said the advertisement claims up to 20 hours and he said well i don't know about that. I now have to test if the video will last 2 - 3 hours as they claim.  Not sure how they can get away with this deceptive advertising.

<Title>Looks good on the outside
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Beauty is in the eye of the eye of the beholder so if you like the astethics and beautiful video screen technology, you will love this.  I have an IPOD Video 30 Gig bought right before Christmas 2005.    If you are like me and like simplicity, relatively bug free software (I can live with minor bugs and expect a few), and ease of use, then this is an overpriced duckling.  I have tried to get this to work on my Windows XP and my Windows 2000 operating systems with no luck.  The interface hangs indefinitely.  I have patience, having no children and not much else to do, so if it ever did decide to "unhang" I'd be here ready to use the loading of media software.  But it doesn't wish to be compatible with any of my Windows operating systems.   I am a stockholder of AAPL and wish it to make me lots of money.  But I'm more beholden to good technology than increased shareholder value and this, my dear reader, is a POS.  The screen of the IPOD always seems to read "Do not disconnect" no matter what I do.  It doesn't like to turn off.  I can't load anything easily.    If I were to design this, I'd want a cableless interface where the USB connection pops out from the unit and plugs directly into the computer.  Of course the software would work with all standard operating systems...duh.   I never got far enough to see if the file structure supported multiple sub directories.  If not, that would be very important to me.  It should function like a normal hard drive fur chrissakes.    Anyway, I'm going to wait for their customer service complaints to go down and to get an later version.  It's not the smartest thing to buy the first version of software or hardware kits.    Not recommeded.

<Title>Scratch Prone Display, Expensive Accessories Needed
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have to say, I was all for the new 5G iPod until I started getting into making the portable device usable in various settings. Apple is killing their customer base by turning a highly priced $400 portable music device into a $600 item by gouging customers for every single accessory needed - even splitting up the wall charger and the cable needed to connect the charger to the iPod ($60 to charge your iPod through an outlet)!  The screen scratches, even with a soft cloth.  You will have to buy a screen cover of some sort right away. The class scratches easier than even the most fragile coated sunglasses I have ever owned.  Why can't they just use the same scratch resistant glass everyone uses on PDA screens?  Here's a break down of what I've spent so far on my $400 iPod:  $400 - 60 Gig 5G Ipod Video (comes with a usb cable and worthless earbud headphones that will have to be replaced. $30 - usb power adapter (allows the iPod usb cable to charge the iPod. No usb cable provided, so you'll have to use the one that was provided for your computer synching (a pain, I know). $30 - usb cable for the usb power adapter $40 - universal dock for my home stereo $30 - usb cable for my universal dock (none provided with the dock) $22 - 1/8" mini headphone to RCA cable for connecting to my home stereo (Monster Cable brand, could have gone cheaper for basic Radio Shack cables) $20 - 1/8" mini to 1/8" mini cable for connecting the iPod to my car stereo or other speaker systems (Monster Cable). $20 - for the cheapest rubber protective sleeve offered to keep the HIGHLY scratch prone screen from scratching.  This turns a $400 item into a $592 item.  If you want the remote for the dock or any other accessories, the dollar figure continues to grow. In my opinion, if you haven't already heavily invested in the iPod, go another route. There are a plethora of other portable media devices out there that give you much more bang for your buck.  From companies that actually have the customers needs and best interest in mind. And besides, you'll be cool and unique and not like every other conformist out there (yes, I am one of those conformists, but learn from me).   If this review was helpful to you, please click on "yes". Thank you kindly.

<Content>I have just gotten the white iPod Video 60gb for Christmas and I am amazed! It is surprisingly easy to put photos and videos on it, contradicting what I have heard so far. But if I were you, I would buy a case that protects the iPod and the delicate screen. I recommend the InvisibleSHIELD. Here is the link: http://thinkdifferentstore.com/product_info.php/products_id/1431         The graphics and the quality are exceptional for such a small device. But a word of caution, the battery drains faster.

<Title>This is a great digital music player!
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great music player.  It work well.  It is also easy to use.  I have news for you.  When the iPod says do not diconnect you have to go to iTunes and eject the iPod.  Read the Adobe iPod features guide to learn more about that stuff.(It comes on the installation CD.)  I recently had the Creative Zen Portable Media Center.  I didn't even have it for a year and it broke.  It might have been defective.  Though this iPod is smaller and lighter.  They pretty much do the same thing.  If you want a small music player, a photo viewer, and a video player get the iPod Video 60GB.  It is the 5th generation of the iPod.

<Title>L-O-V-E my iPod, love my hubby for getting me an iPod!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I couldn't decide if I wanted the Nano or to bite the bullet, and get the new iPod video ($400 is pretty spendy).  Well, hubby surprised me with the 60 gig iPod video.  Everything about the iPod is beautiful, right down to that packaging.  The video quality is UNREAL.  The sound quality is bright, crisp, and I can hear things in songs that I've never heard before.  I highly recommend a case for the iPod, to protect from scratching (I chose a pretty pink leather one).  I've been using the iTunes software for about a year for downloading music, so I'm pretty familiar with it, but a first time iTunes/iPod user should have no problems using this.  I plan on investing in a docking station for work and an adapter for my car very soon.  This item is a MUST for any music lover.

<Title>I bought one as a gift , then caved and got one for me!
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I must say -- I was a holdover and didn't own an iPod.  I wasn't big on the security rights limitations on iPod music -- which is kindof freaky.  Recently though, I bought one as a christmas gift and of course part of the gift was organizing her music...Wow...it was easy to upload music but loading 120CDs took a while but iTunes recognized most of the CDs and labeled them for me.  All in all, the CDs used up 10 gig or about 1/3 of her 30gig iPod.  In the process of doing this, I came to realize what I'd been missing ... organization.  iPod makes it tremendously simple to organize, sort, find All your music...so I got one too! only I got myself the 60gig option as mine had to be bigger (I am an avid photographer and plan to move pictures from my camera, and I'll also use it as a portable hard drive).  Two things I noticed after I held both units, the 60 gig iPod is twice as thick as the 30gig -- something that the sites don't really tell.  So if you want shiek thin, get the 30gig and if you want cavernous storage get the 60gig...hehe I've always wanted to use the word cavernous in a sentence :-).  Two, the battery lasts 16 hours on the 30gig and 20hours on the 60gig.  I also downloaded a Podcast just to see how it would work...wow, the screen has some very high resolution and everything looks really sharp with very smooth playback.  David Hasselhoff of Knight Rider looks a bit anachronistic against the shiek white of the iPod.  Hats off to you Dave, was a big fan of the show as a kid and now its the first video on my iPod. I should've downloaded Galactica -- not a ton of choices out there for TV but I'm sure that will change soon.  I also played the Podcast on the computer and its not as sharp although pretty good quality -- I definitely think they're made to be viewed in the iPod.  Download from the site for a 45minute episode over broadband was slow about 2mins but download to the iPod from my computer was pretty fast 10-20 seconds -- not as speedy as music but then again its video.  Ok but then I discovered Podcasts...basically you go into iTunes and you can subscribe to news shows, comedy shows, sports shows all for free!  There's a gazillion free newsvideos etc out there. Example, I love Meet the Press -- I can watch it whenever I want.  If you love sports, there are tons of sports related podcasts etc.  Its great!  I think this 5th generation is amazing.  If you own an older model...I think they're awesome and I'd upgrade. I have the white iPod and I'm enjoying the music that was buried in CDs at the back of my TV armoir for years. I hear black looks cooler...but that it shows scratches easier (don't know).  So there you have it, hope it helps guys.  Of note, I own a pair of Shure headphones and I must say...whencombined with iPod, I can hear nuances to music that I didn't know where there!  Amazing sound.   Got both (and the Shure) from Amazon -- shipping was fast and everything looked great.

<Title>Please Read This BEFORE BUYING
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>To start off, this is overall a very good product, but there are a few setbacks that need to be considered before buying. Here are some pros and cons:    Pros: -Simple to use. Like most products made by Apple, the IPods interface is very user friendly with the simple click wheel for navigation. Uploading music and Synchronizing Photos is also very easy to do with the Itunes software. Working with video is another story (explained in cons).  -Size. While the 60gb model is not quite on the small end, it does pack lots of features for its size. Apple was able to fit 60gb worth of space into an IPod, which is actually smaller than the original IPod. Not bad.  -Clear video playback (if you can get it to work)  -Battery Life. The 60gb model comes with a bigger battery than the 30gb, giving it very good battery life. For playing music, I can leave it running all day and still be at half charge. For watching videos, I can manage to get all the way through Lord of The Rings before the battery dies.    Cons: -Screen. The Screen on the IPod sucks. It is so bad that if you rub your finger along the screen, it will put in scratches. On a normal IPod, this wouldn't be bad, but if you want to watch videos, scratches on the screen distort the image. If you are going to buy this you NEED a hard case that completely covers the screen, or one of the sticky screen protectors.  -Video Playback. In that area, Apple has tried very hard to limit you. The problem is that the videos need to be in MPEG4 format with a size of 320x240. You can buy nicely formatted shows off Itunes Music Store for a price, but that would add up fast. You can put your own videos on, but since Itunes is not a video converter, you need a 3rd party program. The only one I found that works is Videora IPod converter, but even this takes an expert to convert it the right way. If you are good with computers and have a lot of patience, then you can get most any movie on (even DVD movies). However, most people who buy this IPod never manage to get movies to work. Keep that in mind if the video feature is one of the main reasons you are looking at this item in the first place.    Overall, however, this is a very nice product. I have enjoyed many hours of use and continue to enjoy it. The cons it has need to be taken into consideration, and so do the other options out there for Portable Video Players. These include the Creative Zen Vision, the Archos AV500 Mobile DVR, the Sony PSP and others. Look into all of this before buying the IPod.

<Content>Another upgrade to the existing product by Apple.  Seems to have better battery life than its predecessor. The only drawback to this product is the limitations Apple puts on copying itunes downloads, which at times can be inconvenient. Back up copies of purchased music will be in itunes format and not playable on any computer not authorized by the purchaser. If you have never owned an ipod, you may want to carefully review what you purchase on line to assure you will be receiving the charger and ipod and not just the ipod alone.

<Content>For this price I expected a decent product.  It breaks just after the warranty expires and they tell you they don't repair products, only replace them within warranty period.  Zero stars would be much better as that is what I give it.  It's difficult to get songs into the iPod and when it breaks you're out the whole enchilada!  Look elsewhere if you want a decent personal jukebox and definitely avoid all things from Apple.  I will be in the future.

<Title>Quality is not so good.

<Content>I love the features of this product, but the quality is something to be desired. The Mac people love to talk about the PC's "Blue Screen of Death", well, this Apple product has the "Black Apple of Death". It freezes and locks on a regular basis. If you are lucky, it only seizes for a few minutes and then resets. If it is not your lucky day, it will freeze completely and be completely useless until the battery dies and it can be recharged. I have the same complaint as everyone else, too, it was marred and scratched with hours of purchase. I'm sorry I bought this product. I love having an mp3 player that plays video, but I should've bought a different brand. Thankfully, there are many 3rd party companies that make accessories, because Apple charges a whole lot of money for every little thing.

<Title>Nice, but not w/o problems
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had several minis for 3+ years and have had very few problems.  In the 4 months I've had had this 60 GB it has frozen 3-4 times requiring the "5R" treatment including wiping the thing clean and reloading all the songs back on.   The wheel also sustained a crack in the plastic while it was in a very sturdy case in a padded pocket in my purse.  This is odd because I only use my ipod on my my commute for less than an hour a day and am quite meticulous about its care.  The best part is the more-than-ample space for my music.  My kids are disgusted that I have a video iPod (they don't), yet I refuse to buy videos.  This iPod should give me space for the next few years if it lasts that long.

<Content>Unfreakin' believable on how much you can put on this puppy.  Have all my CDs on it, and still have 50+ gig left. :-000  Next to go on it are my audio books.  The sound quality, even with the earbuds is pretty cool.  Bought the gizmo to listen to it via the car's tape deck, sound quality isn't outstanding, but it's great to have all the music in one spot.  Also bought the car recharger as well.  Also have the Logic3 speaker-charger-sync device.  Works like a charm.    Right now, I get NPR's Science Friday podcast.  Great to listen whenever.  As far as the videos go, for such a dinky screen, it's not bad at all.  I'm using it more for sound  As other reviewers have said, you do need to buy a screen protector, but that's true with any handheld device.  And as far as durability, any honest idiot knows you gotta be careful with any kind of handheld!!!

I love the fact that the iPod has graphics now, everything looks completely different and better, and that you can watch music videos on it. I also like the newer big flatscreen. :)  However, I have one concern. Is Apple going to make an even better product soon? It seems to me Apple is being money hungry and doesn't really fully explore the options of what an iPod could have before they actually make them.  They make ones, and then a year later they make WAY better ones. So then the iPod that they made a year ago could've already had the features that the new ones that they are just releasing have, but instead they just give it the "basic" features and then pump out newer iPods which has features that the old iPod from a year ago could've already had but they don't, all just for you to waste more of your money on. Not everyone can afford to buy the newest iPod every new year.  Last year I received my first iPod for Christmas and it *was* the newest one with 30GB (if not newest pretty close), and then they came out with a few more and now this one and I got this one this year because well my family knew I wanted one. So now my fear is that by next year an already better one will already be out. Apple will you please stop pumping them out like this because this is getting old.  My very old friend who I no longer talk to used to have an iPod way before I had one...So then I get one for Christmas, the *newest* one last year, and then shortly she also knows about it and thinks about buying it. I think also the iPod Minis were shortly released before mine was (which by the way, Apple stopped making them as of July '05) and she also wanted that one. I think she did buy one of them but I'm not sure which. Now this year, they release an iPod Nano and this iPod. MY GOSH!

<Content>I don't know what is so fancy about it, but the new iPod with a larger screen, video playback and thinner body ROCKS.  I have owned a Shuffle (512MB) and a Color Display 20GB. I got this one yesterday and even though first impression was not as good as the previous (packaging is not that great), when I connected it to my iTunes and saw it transferring my massive 50GB music library i almost broke down and cried.  The display isn't just larger, but clearer and with better contrast. It is incredibly light for a 60GB unit and battery lasts forever (of course, its new).  All of you who think that video is useless in the "tiny" screen, are more than wrong. I used to think that way and now i'm trying to convert my dvd concerts so I can have them always with me.  Apple Rocks!

<Title>It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can die a happy man. This is the best, the absolute best, piece of gadgetry I've ever owned. I'm currently in the process of ripping my 3+ briefcases of CD's to my external HD; I've only filled up 20GB so far, and that's including the second and third volumes of Family Guy, plus the Stewie movie.   Which brings me to why I can die a happy man: watching Family Guy, in great resolution, wherever I want? Is there anything better? I would argue that there is not.   As an aside, everyone should know: Apple tried to make it difficult to watch your own movies on the iPod. In a perfect world, iTunes would be able to rip DVD's to MP4 format just like it rips CD's...but, alas, Apple is trying to get you to buy their music vids and TV shows from iTMS, so, there is no such feature. However, I did some Googling, and found the 2 utilities you need. First, download a free program called DVD Decrypter (http://www.dvddecrypter.com). This allows you to rip the VOB files from most any DVD, so long as you have a drive that reads DVD's on your computer. However, VOB's can't be played on the iPod. So, you need to download the Videora iPod Converter, from http://www.videora.com, as well. This will convert VOB's to MP4's, which will play in your iPod. Videora's website has a great tutorial.   Why all this? Well, to take your iPod Video to the next level, you need to be able to watch more than silly U2 videos on it. It has the space you need, so why not? Music anywhere is great and all, but DVD's anywhere? That's the complete package.   So, as for the rest of the product:  -The aesthetic design is sleek and pretty. However, I've noticed (as has pretty much everyone else) that the screen gets scratches if you so much as look at it sideways. This is terribly frustrating. I bought a case for it, but because Apple is so slow with shipping, I went for nearly 2 weeks with just the little leather case it comes with. I never got anything near the screen, I only used one of those silk sunglass polishers to clean the screen, and I was oh-so-careful with it. Yet, there are still faint scratches if you look at it in the right light. I'm telling you, if the rest of this product wasn't so well-designed, Apple would never be able to get away with this flaw. But, so be it. Now, my case just takes the scratches instead, which is nominally better.   -The onboard software is good for playing music, but I've found it to be somewhat glitchy when playing videos. As I noted above, I uploaded a bunch of Family Guy episodes. When I watch them, the battery level suddenly dips down---once in awhile, if, say, my battery meter is at half, and I try to play a movie, it will cut back to the menu without playing, and the battery meter will be red, on empty. As soon as I switch back to music playback, the meter goes back to half. I don't understand this jump. On top of that, sometimes, after playing videos, the unit refuses to turn off. I have to stop playback and wait for it to turn off automatically. I'm not sure whether this can or will be fixed by future iPod software updaters, but it's pretty frustrating.   All this leads me to believe that Apple rushed the whole video concept to market, without thorough product testing, to get in under the holiday-shopping wire. Then again, maybe it plays fine when you're only using Apple's paltry iTunes video selections. Either way, while the video quality is absolutely fabulous, these glitches are a little annoying.   -The battery life for music playback is more than enough for me, most of the time. However, the video playback drains the battery pretty heavily.   -The interface is pretty easy to use, and I like the click wheel. Given that the calendar & contacts databases aren't editable (they're simply downloaded from Outlook, etc.), they're pretty much just a minor convenience, in case I forget my palm or cellphone, and need someone's phone number or my schedule. The games are nice, especially the music trivia, which uses your own library. Since the only iPod I've owned prior to this was a Shuffle, I don't know how it compares to previous pods. Overall, though, it's easy to navigate your music. One complaint I do have with the way Apple organizes your music is that, if the "Artist" field has any guest artists inserted, then it creates an entire new folder and artist. For example, when I bought the new Thievery Corporation album, the majority of the songs had guest artists. Like, instead of just "Thievery Corporation", it was "Thievery Corporation featuring _____". So when I went to browse through my iPod by artist, it created a new category for each one, which was about 10 categories just on that one CD. And this was an album bought from iTunes. Slightly annoying...but I digress.   Overall, it's an amazing piece of machinery, dispite its glitches and design flaws. At the end of the day, I'll be able to have my entire cd library in one little box that's the size of my wallet. Given that, not 15 years ago, we were still doing research with encyclopedias, and I got my first CD in the early 90's, I'd say that this is simply amazing. I've heard songs come through on random shuffle that I haven't heard in 5 years! While I am disappointed by the fragility of the casing, among other small things, this is 5+ stars--no doubt.

Id liek to state sumthign that ive noticed people complaning about . ok the ipod video isnt just an mp3 player its more of an mp4 player(video playing) and once u thigk about the price isnt bad at all. cuz if u buy a portable dvd player(around 200 to 300) and buy a 20 gig mp3(cheapest brand) ull still over exceed even the price of my 400 dallor 60 gig ipod. ive realized this and im only 16.but i love this thing ive playd it at school all day, ever day. oh and ya the battery is alittle short but theres ways to deal with that(just as soon as u get home put it on the charger, in the morning and stuff, it lastes the whole day at school for me(barly). i say dont buy it just for the video, cuz the battery sux wen watching videos only cuz of the huge screen thats liek HD. so ya. its worth every penny. its a must have. and i used to hate ipod. so this is a huge turn around. i used to hate ipod cuz it was so easily broken(unless u have a nice case for it. but yes a must have!

<Title>A functional work of art!   What a great business expense...
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have only come to the world of iPod recently and, I admit, somewhat reluctantly. I started with a Nano which I have been very happy with. Recently it occured to me that an iPod 5G could serve very nicely as an external backup drive so I immediately ordered one (can you spell "Business Expense"?)   Here is what I love about my iPod:   1) Beauty  2) Clear, crisp, large display for videos  3) Got to love that click wheel interface  4) iTunes, the best software bundled with an MP3 player that I've seen.  5) Great battery life... this thing will last through a full day of travel.  6) 60GB is enough to back up everything on my laptop which only has a 60GB hard drive!  7) The ear buds that come with this iPod are actually very nice, comfortable, stay in my ears (thats the big one!) and have good sound.  8) Equalizer, I got my rock and roll sound goin on!  9) I love the clock feature, I setup all the time zones that I could want with a separate clock; from Hawaii thru Florida.  10) I downloaded my calendar and contacts from Outlook so now my reminders show up on the iPod, how cool is that!  11) I love rating my songs as I listen to them on the iPod; lets face it I'm a ratings-aholic!   Now you may be wondering, why didn't I give this baby 5 stars?   1) Where are the accessories? you might as well tack on an extra $100 to the price of this for the accessories you will need to buy: AC adapter ($30), case ($30), etc...  2) I get frustrated with the fact that I have to plug this thing into a computer to do anything with it. At the very least I would like to be able to delete songs. And why can't I modify playlist settings and stuff like that?  3) You better just buy a case for this before you even take it out of the box, and even with my case on it I see it is getting scratched.  4) I'm a little miffed with Apple that they sabotaged my favorite player (MusicMatch) so it won't work with the iPod :( At least my Rhapsody can talk to it...   You've been warned, now get on out there and buy yourself one of these puppies. I vote the iPod Video my favorite business expense of the year!

<Content>I am amazed at what this ipod does. I use it for calendar, contacts, notes, music, and videos, but I am most thrilled that it has opened the portable world of podcasts. I am able to subscribe to great free podcasts of radio shows that I previously had to listen to on my computer. My only complaint is that I wish it had come with its own charger so that I don't have to keep my computer on while I am charging the ipod.

<Title>Best iPod yet. Video out works better than expected with right settings.
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the 4th iPod I buy and is of course the best one I've owned. I've had absolutely no problems whatsoever and it has worked great for me. I was a little worried about the scratching issues that I had heard before buying it, but in my own experience can say that it is not as "delicate" as others claim. Of course it CAN scratch as any other of the plastic iPods can. But as of today 2 months after getting it and using it a LOT, only a few scratches are visible on the chrome side because I hadn't gotten a case for it. I went with the white because I find it more "classic".  One of the features I was interested in trying when I first got it was outputting video to TV. I purchased a US$5 video camera cable at an electronics store which worked just as well as any advertised iPod-specific AV cable. (Note: With the cable I bought two of the RCA colors where "switched". I'm not sure if it was the particular cable I bought but video goes out through red and right audio goes through the yellow. Left audio goes through the white as it normally would. I guess that with an iPod-specific cable this is not the case. Just hook them up until you see video if you get one of these cheaper cables.)  Apple's "standard" settings can be a bit confusing if you don't know anything about compression. You don't HAVE to encode in 320x240 or 480x480. There are other settings as well. Look up "last ipod video guide" with your search engine to find a good article which includes handy tips about the video settings you can or should use with the iPod.  I found that compressing widescreen footage to MPEG-4 video at 640x352 pixels at 2.5Mbps was the greatest quality I could get. I would leave audio at the standard 128 kbps AAC encoding. H.264 looks great on the iPod but because of its size constraint I think it's not the best option if you want to output to TV. I tried hooking the iPod to a Samsung 42" widescreen television (HDTV-ready) with the first settings I mentioned and I was surprised by the quality. There are plenty of shareware apps and one or another freeware apps (such as iSquint) with which you can achieve great looking video which compress video even faster than Quicktime.  Of course the iPod has many other cool new features like the stopwatch, the lock and a higher-res screen. But I mostly use it to listen to music or output video to TV.  I definitely recommend it.
