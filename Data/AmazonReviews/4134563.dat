<Title>No Good - Randomly Stops Playing - Going Back
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Player stops playing songs randomly. No rhyme or reason, just stops. You have to hit play twice and the song starts where it left off. FM radio works very well, it's too bad it has bugs. I am returning mine and will try a different brand.

<Title>Creative Zen player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just an absolutely incredible product.  As a musician it is what I was looking for.  It plays with excellent fidelity, records from the internal mike with clarity, records faithfully from the line in jack. Has enough capacity to allow me to carry all the info and music I need to and from gigs.  I would highly reccomend this to anyone wanting a reasonably priced recorder/player.

<Content>I purchased the Zen media player for my husband for Valentine's Day.  He loves it!  He immediately loaded it with music and pictures.  My husband is sometimes hard to please, but he surely loved this item very, very much.  Now I want one for me too!

<Title>Great Music Player; Not So Great Video Player
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compared to the competition in its price range, this a very good choice for a music player.  It's small and light, and the interface is intuitive and easy to set up and customize.  The OLED display is visible from any angle, but is dim in outdoor lighting.  The display is not very sharp, so this is really not a good player for photos and video.  However, the audio is way above average once you replace the included earbuds with something better.  It has lots of EQ settings and a good FM radio, and the included Creative MediaSource Organizer software makes loading of tracks and set-up of playlists quite easy.  I listen to a lot of podcasts and was disappointed with the included Zencast software, but found that if you turn on the MediaSource "media sniffing" function it will automatically find podcasts in my iTunes library (iTunes makes podcast subscriptions ever so easy) and they can be readily dragged and dropped into the Zen.  As noted in other reviews, USB charging from a computer does take a lot longer than it should, but if you have a USB wall charger it goes much faster.  I don't think I would buy another one of these, but overall I am fairly happy with it for music and podcasts.

<Title>Is there a real user manual for this thing?
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Okay, this is my first mp3 player, so maybe they're all this user-unfriendly. If so, let me know. There is a serious lack of information available for the operation of this unit. The user manual does not supply it. So you're left to figure it out for yourself. First of all, I'm able to download stuff, (except for the five songs I bought on Itunes for 99 cents each), so I'm using it. But you must find out by trial and error how to use the thing. I'm used to devices picking up where you left off when you stop it. But if you don't save your place in a book or podcast, if you don't unpause the unit by the time you're time runs out and the unit shuts down, you have lost your place!! Why doesn't it pick up where you leave off automatically? Are ALL mp3 players like this? If you're interrupted and don't have the 20 seconds or so to save your place, in a bookmark, you're screwed.  Next, to get from menu to menu, you must push the proper buttons in the correct order, which you learn by trial and error, and must press them for the proper length of time (!) or you can also lose your place.   You must also NOT press certain buttons or you'll lose your place. For instance, if you are listening to a book, and happen to press BACK on the tiny joystick, it will exit playing and take you to a previous chapter or even the start of the book!  I'm sorry, but I'm used to cassette players and CD players and I've never had to be so careful in pressing a button on a player before. Are ALL mp3 players like this?  And there is no help from the user manual. None. Not even online.  You're on your own.   This is only the beginning. I have no idea how to make a playlist. And there is no information on how to do so. Not on the Creative site. If someone out there knows of where I can get this information, please let me know. The menu system is clumsy and unfriendly. Everything about the unit is clumsy and unfriendly.   I may buy an apple ipod if I find it is more user-friendly, and just use this unit for....   I have given it 2 stars because at least it works, but I'm not happy with it.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Labs Muvo2 and loved it.  Unfortunately, the hard drive fried after the warranty expired, and I was infuriated by CL's policy of charging for tech support calls.  I swore I would never buy another CL product.  I did a lot of research before buying a replacement and considered the iPod Nano and Zune.  Finally, with my Christmas money in hand, I went to Circuit City, ready to buy an iPod.  I asked the salesperson which mp3 player he had, and he told me he had the Zen V+.  I asked why, and he said that, for the money, it was the best player on the market, and includes a radio, video capability, photos and a huge capacity for storing music files.  He was so enthused that I figured I had nothing to lose.   I brought it home, set it up and was amazed at how intuitive the software was.  I loaded ten CDs in rapid order and downloaded all of my music.  Within two hours I was groovin' to my entire Taylor Hicks download collection (I'm a Hicks fan, what can I say!)  The FM tuner picks up my favorite R&B station, which doesn't always come in even on the best stereo.   I highly recommend this little player.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! unbelivably better than the ipod... but...
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is an awesome mp3 player, except it has a few problems...  Pros: brilliant color screen makes it easy to see what you are doing, even if you are using it outside where there is a huge glare  I dont care what people say about the stupid thumb navigation being too small... its fine. if I made the mp3 player, I would have chosen a different mechanism to scroll and stuff... but there is no real problem with it  Look at the size of this thing!!!! its TINY!!! its AWESOME!!!    Cons: i have had it for 3 weeks and it has frozen 4 times. 3 out of the 4 times, I very simply resseted it and it was fine, not really a problem unless you don't have a small paperclip.   Here's the big con you have been waiting for: one of the times it froze, I reseted it and it turned on again and it looked fine, until it froze again. OH NO! I repeated the process of finding a small paperclip and reseted it. IT FROZE AGAIN WITHIN SECONDS OF ME TURNING IT ON!!!! i repeated this process many times, but it was no use. I emailed the creative labs support thingy and they gave me a simple solution. Here it is if this happens to you. reset it, and when you turn it on, it will go through the regular startup screens of the creative symbol, and saying Zen V Plus. When it says the creative symbol, hold down the play button and a "recovery menu" comes up run the "cleanup" and then "reboot". it worked for me, so it should work for you.  last couple of cons:  video is bad because of the small screen  line in encoding is hard to use  Thats all for now!

<Title>Here's the Major Problem.........
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software doesn't work, the computer doesn't recognize the unit... .these can all be fixed.  I have had my Zen since October, and like everyone else I initially fell in love with it.  I really loved the fact that I could download all my 2-year-olds music to make car trips so much easier!  I loved the size, the Outlook sync feature, and the FM tuner.  However, it does keep freezing up when you disconnect it from a power source.  And this time putting a tiny pin in the reset hole to hit the hidden button won't do anything.  It won't shut off, and it's frozen on the beginning screen- it won't go anywhere else, won't hook up with the computer, and repeated attempts to reset are not working.  It's very frustrating to not be able to access the reset button- one reason I think I will be moving over to the tried and true Ipod.  Creative really needs to work on this major design flaw!  Don't buy this unless you want to be really frustrated!

<Title>Very Nice Little Gadget
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my wife after owning the 30GB Creative Zen Vision:M for a year. I am a fan of  Creative products and the Zen V Plus is another great one. It is really a neat looking player with a very nice looking display that is crisp. The navigation is simple to use although the little joystick is a bit tricky to get use to. I highly recommend this product both on style & function. One other bonus is that your music can be encoded using .wma format which can reduce the files sizes significantly (about 40% or so) allowing you to fit more music on it. My only complaint is that, as is typical with all non-iPod players, the accessories for the Zen V Plus (and Vision:M) are very limited and the provided software takes some time to configure properly to sync with your computer.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I first saw the Zen V Plus in Glamour Magazine, and thought, "interesting, I wonder how it compares to the ipod". My brother got it for me this past Christmas, and now I don't go anywhere without it. I love the size and how idiot proof it is...i'm not very smart when it comes to gadgets, but even the downloading cds on to it is childs play. The only downside is, the first time i used it, it froze on me and I had to wait for the battery to die to get it to work. Other than that, its great. And it hasn't happened since. Buy this product! Its worth every penny you spend on it.

<Title>Constant connection problems
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player has constant connection problems, and either the software or the player constantly freezes.  I've tried resetting the player, and that unfreezes it.. Until you try to download again..  This is a headache, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it as a gift for anyone who doesn't enjoy spending hours on a computer trying to get it to work right.

<Title>Definitely one of the best MP3 players out there
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen V Plus after browsing through what seemed like hundreds of MP3 players, either flash based or hard drive based. I read reviews everywhere too and finally decided on this product. After a month of using it, I have no complaints whatsoever - all my music, videos, and pics are easily transported onto my player, and the sound is GREAT! I would definitely suggest buying a new set of headphones though; the ones attached aren't that great and probably won't fit your ears.  The FM feature is great too! Of course the reception depends on where you live and where you're located. But generally it gets good reception - unless you're in a cave or something.  The screen is definitely nice, and the menus are really easy to navigate. You won't regret buying this product!

<Title>Terrible Documentation
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Physically attractive, with many interesting features, the Zen suffers from serious limitations.  Most significant, the documentation is grossly inadequate and fails to set forth how to utilize many of the most important features. For example, nowhere is it seen that in order to enable the resume feature when listening to an audio book, you have to shut down the unit. And nowhere does it indicate how to shut down the unit. Scrolling ahead and back is also a problem. If not done very carefully, the unit freezes and must be rebooted. The earphone  connection is poor, often requiring jiggling to restore sound in both ears. The Ipod is a far superior unit. The only advantage of the Zen is its ability to use items downloaded from the public library. The Zen is a major disappointment.
