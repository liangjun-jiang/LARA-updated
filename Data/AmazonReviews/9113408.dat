<Title>a bargain...
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For a mp3 player / recorder / thumb drive this price and for 1GB, this is a good bargain, but there's always room for improvement:  1) ear buds: without cushions, it will always fall from your ears; 2) the headphones cable sports a "heart". What was that? 3) not much contrast from the LCD. 4) only red colour.  Despite the aforementioned, I liked the sound, the EQ options are quite good. And - important - it has a USB connector - a plus!

<Title>does what it's supposed to
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I use this primarily to listen to talk shows that I record so most mp3 are 2 hours long.  This creates issues that don't exist with just music use.  Files are larger so playing off the player directly from the player with a PC or when attached to the PC is a must.  Fast forwarding speed is extremely important for getting past commercials or queuing up to the middle of the file.  Too fast will make getting the right place difficult, going to slow will be frustrating to get to the right place.  I really wanted a direct insert device so I wouldn't have to carry around a cable.  I purchased a Samsung &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-YP-U2JXB-Direct-Insert-Digital/dp/B000ET7668/sr=8-6/qid=1162751966/ref=pd_bbs_sr_6/104-1252734-7579144?ie=UTF8&s=electronics">YP-U2J&lt;/a> but was disappointed with the fact that files couldn't be accessed directly by an operating system and it required Windows XP with Media Center 10.  There are 2 categories of direct connect USB mp3 players: mp3 players and thumb drive/mp3 players.  The difference is thumb drives do not require drivers or software to sync or transfer files.  I prefer thumb drives/mp3 players.  Pros: 1. Works as portable storage device: no need for Media Center or other software.  Works in any OS.  No need to sync.  Can play songs with PC directly from device.  99% of mp3 players can not do this.  Very frustrating for large files.  2. Fast forward works fairly well.  Starts at 10x (10 seconds per second), speed ramps up to 60x (1 minute per second).  This works very well for me.  3. Uses AAA batteries so you can have backup power when you need it.  4. Pretty colors for back-light.  Green, Cyan, Blue, Red, Purple, White.  Cons: 1. By far the most annoying thing is that it does not resume.  When you pause and the player turns off, when you turn it on it starts in the menu.  When you go to music it starts at the beginning of the first file.  Ridiculous.  2. Song order is difficult if not impossible to manage.  No play lists.  2. Battery life is terrible.  With included alkaline, battery lasted 40 minutes.  I've switched to NiMH 600mAH and they seem to last about 2 hours.  Still not good for such a limited device but I can manage since my commute is only 20-30 minutes.  Would be nice if it included charging for NiMH and NiCd batteries.  3. Shoddy construction.  Glass screen cover broke when I was changing my oil.  I was careful not to roll over on it but it still broke.  Took it off and it works fine.  4. Kinda big.  I really like the Samsung's size better.  5. Menu system is annoying.  Samsung was very intuitive.  6. Fast forward same as next track.  Hold button to fast forward tap to skip.  Obviously annoying when fast forwarding 60 minutes into a show just to skip to the next track.  Even with all the problems, I like it better than any mp3 player that requires drivers or special software.

<Title>Not worth the price
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is trash. The battery dies every other day. Half the time it shuts off for no reason. Can not get the voice recorder to even work. It holds the songs and it sounds great when it actually works.

<Title>works well enough for the price
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought this because I wanted a good bit of space for as little money as I could manage.. and with that in mind, it's not bad. The controls are not at ALL intuitive, unfortunately (and the manual is NO help with anything), but I eventually sorted out all its quirks. Files can be sorted into folders, which is very nice. The main drawback I've found with this is that you CAN NOT put more songs on it without completely wiping off everything else first. You can delete just fine within the player's interface, but you cannot delete tracks from (in the case of Windows) the My Computer window. And it tells you everything is write-protected if you try to add something more on without having deleted everything first. Given that I only swap things out once a week or so, this is a managable flaw, but still a needless one. Apart from that, battery life is decent, and so far mine's put up with rain and pretty large temperature variations, as well as being dropped a good bit. Sound quality's not fantastic (most of the equalizer settings sound atrocious), but it's not to the point of being irritating.  Again, for the price and the amount of space, it's decent enough. Works just fine, once you sort out the controls. The size is also very convenient, it's perfect for just casually dragging it around with you everywhere in a pocket or what have you. (And much less to worry about than an iPod!)

<Title>Great for the price; has some bugs
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Good if it meets your needs.  That would be a player that demands small size and low price.  Music during exercise, shopping, computer lab, falling asleep, or just as a flash drive.  You must be willing to accept these limitations.   1) Random play.  Serial browsing is obviously ridiculous for 1 GB (probably 350 songs at 128Kb), and it doesn't have resume, so you must like random.  e.g. you don't mind skipping through selections until you find one you want to hear.   2) Power on / off.  Sometimes the unit decides to shut off during power up.  You have to briefly disconnect the battery to fix it.  Also, you have to return to the main menu (vs. song play) before power off works.   3) Battery.  If you fall asleep listening (that's me), your battery is of course dead in the morning.  Bought a cheap ($10) nimh charger that comes with some batteries (ray-o-vac).   4) User interface.  You have to learn two durations of button press to navigate.  Also, the unit appears dead (like 1-2 seconds!) when entering and leaving the play menu; indexing songs I suppose.  (This and #2 are probably generating a lot of product returns.)  Sound is fine.  I've had equalization problems with more expensive players (GoVideo, Rio).  Random play is fine.  Random on some players is a joke (Memorex mp3-CD).  Removable battery is great.  Who wants to get stuck with a dead lithium that costs more than the player to fix?  I'd rather carry an extra battery in my pocket.  Has a hold slide switch, so you can put it into your pocket.  Being able to choose the backlight color (from a rainbow) is cool. [...]

<Content>This is by far the best deal for mp3/flash drives on the market. Great sound, and when they say 1GB they mean it. Also, Mach Speed is a great company. I cracked the face of the display and they sent me a new face plate free of charge. Customer service and tech support are A+.

<Title>software upgrade for this great player
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player for a month now. I really like it.  Sound is OK It drains on battery quick....since I use rechargeable its ok for me. There was no folder browsing - which made me hate this player in the beginning. Now Machspeed has a software upgrade for this player. You download from their site and upgrade your player. This upgrade allows you to browse folders and go to the music you like. I just discovered one more - may be a feature -  I turn the recording on and speak into the headphones ( that come with this player). It records them. Even though the clarity isn't that good this way it is good for taking quick notes.

<Title>Sucks big time
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I give this product a one star rating because there's no option for zero. Got one for myself and my husband and as soon as it arrived I immediately put it to use. it was working great, i even fell asleep listening to it, up till the following morning when i changed the battery and then the damn thing wouldn't play. It got stuck at menu and non of the buttons were working  worst of all it wouldn't turn on at all after an hour no matter how many batteries i replaced it with. This product is not worth $39.99, a dollar or even this web page that it's on. will never try an off brand again.

<Title>Same product, different name.
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this same MP3 player, only it was marketed under a different name. It worked awesome for about two months and then started shutting itself off and on continually until the battery dies. When I called tech support they essentially said "tough luck." Mine looks EXACTLY the same but is silver and has the manufacturers name "Kanguru." I wouldn't recommend it and I hope that the Coby 2GB that I'm thinking to buy doesn't do the same thing to me.

<Title>Broke on day three
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was satisfied with the product - until I actually used it in the real world. The second day I carried it in my pocket (with nothing but my cell phone knocking against it), the glass screen cracked and broke apart. In my pocket. Guess what happened when I reached my hand into my pocket which now had bits of broken glass into it?  The third day I was using the Machspeed Trio was when it died. I put some documents onto the drive and went to Kinkos to get them printed. When I gave the clerk the drive, he was unable to get information off it. He couldn't even get it to register in the computer. He tried it in four different computers, and none of them worked. He gave it back to me, and I couldn't even get it to turn on. I changed the batteries - no good. It just died.  Thanks, Machspeed Trio. I really enjoyed your product for about 18 hours. But $30 for 18 hours isn't enough.  Please don't buy this product.

<Title>Bargain MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use this to listen to audio books while I exercise.  You CAN have it pick up where you stop.  You just first of all pause before you turn it off.  Then the next time you start it up, it begins where you left off. I found that it is much easier to see if you change the back light to yellow from the default blue. The battery lasts a long time.  Since I don't use this for music, the sound is just fine, and it is about the cheapest one you can find for 1 GB.

<Title>Good enough, despite some issues
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've got this player for my B-day two and a half years ago. It's still alive, after a couple month in coma.  For the first year I was quite happy except it refused to read names of files in the form I saved them. It is inconvenient if you listen to foreign music: be ready to recognize songs by how they sound, bitrate, length, etc. 'cause you won't see the title in a readable way. After a couple months the cap started slipping off. They really should include a roll of tape in the set. After a year the start button started to malfunction, and image in the window shifted up about 1/4 of an inch, so track # and other info was no longer in the field of vision. In addition, the paint on plastic easily scratches. Back then the player used to cost $170. Today it worth of 30 bucks, I think it's a pretty good deal comparing to pathos i-pods.
