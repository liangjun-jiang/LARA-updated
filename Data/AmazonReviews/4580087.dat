<Title>nano killer!!
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>great player. 50$ bucks cheaper than nano is what made me buy this. but then its features keep amazing me. fm player, recorder, fm recorder, photo viewer, video player, cool looking. i have run it for two weeks now and have faced no major problems. downsides: 1) doesnt come with armband. 2) Slideshow feature doesnt work 3) slightly heavier and probably thicker than nano

<Title>A quality product
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to replace my SanDisk SDMX1 mp3 player. The only reason I did not give it a 5 rating is that the manual is rudimentary at the best. It tells how to use a function but does not explain what the funtion is for. The navigation is somewhat odd. Although my music are organized in folders, once they are copied to the e260, the folders are no more visible. The player lets you play all songs, by artist, albums, genre, playlists, etc. This is completely different from the SDMX1 in which you navigate by folders. The photo display is sharp with good contrast. The video playing is also very good. I still recommend it.

<Title>Disappointment 
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went to BestBuy to purchase a 1GB shuffler (for running) and a regular ipod 30GB for my long commute everyday 2.5hr. The sales person recommended the Sansa 260e, for $190 4GB and all the options it made sense for me to purchase it.....however file transfer was confusing (MCP mode all the songs displays unknown) while connected to USB can not use the sansa, also the unit comes with sample songs which it freezed the unit,  but it dose not have a reset button so you have to wait till battery drains. One good thing was video transfer was simple and worked. Unfortunately I have to get the ipod but I'm glad I decided to purchase it locally vs. shipping

<Title>love it!
<Date>Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i've been looking for an mp3 player like this for a long time.  the ipod is nice, but i always had little gripes that stopped me from getting one (such as the inability to use anything but itunes to load music).    this player is a great alternative to ipod.  it's about the same size as a nano, but a tiny bit thicker, and a little heavier.  the scroll wheel has a nice tactile feel to it, and contrary to other reviewers i like the way it feels (although i concede the buttons are a little hard to press without adjusting my hand).  the screen is impressive-- bigger, brighter, and clearer than nano.  the menus are well thought out, though this is my first tag-based player (vs. folder-based) so there is a slight learning curve for me.  mine came already loaded with the most current firmware.  the first time i connected it to my computer i nearly panicked-- the unit would turn on, then show an error and turn off.  then i realized i had the "hold" button on.  switching it off fixed the problem.  i didn't install any of the sandisk software and windows xp found the device and gave me the option to sync it with my music in windows media player.  you can also open the player as a folder in my computer and just copy music that way if you prefer.  to copy photos or videos you do have to install the sandisk software.  i copied over all the music i could think of (maybe 30 albums?), and i still have 1.5gb left.  i was considering ordering an extra mini-sd card to expand the memory, but now i think i will hold off since i'm having a hard time filling it as it is!  all in all, great mp3 player!  i will update my review if my impressions change.

<Title>Some notes about the e200 series
<Date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The other reviews have already commented on the features and performance, so I'll try to comment on those aspects that haven't gotten much attention.  This is a great player, but I will concentrate on some annoying aspects:  1. When you charge via USB, the display on the device is always on. It doesn't fall asleep or go dim. The device is also nonresponsive in this mode, ie the buttons won't work and you won't be able to play or do anything.  2. If you have a USB wall charger, the display will dim and the buttons will work while charging. But the device must be on, it won't charge via AC if the device is turned off.  3. Playlists can be made on the fly, but you have to play each song you want to add to the playlist in order to bring up the option.   4. Video conversion software only installs on windows XP. It also breaks up larger files into smaller ones, and it's not very intuitive to copy whole DVD's. The quicktime format it uses is proprietary. Also, video files are only recognized in the root folder, so the device won't see files located in subfolders. Videos run at 15 fps.   5. Has the option of choosing MSC or MTP mode. MSC loads the player like a flash drive so you manually drag and drop files. MTP works with wmp 10, and some other third party software to manage your syncing. I prefer MSC, but I switched to MTP because when you unplug the USB cable in MSC mode, the device reboots itself. It does not do this is MSC mode.   This is a great player, but you'll need to spend some time configuring everything to your preferences. The Sandisk firmware has good basic functionality, but if you're used to lots of features for customization, be prepared to work for it with this device. I miss features like "play most recently synchronized" that my old player had. The good news is that these firmware drawbacks may soon be addressed when Rockbox firmware is released. The hardware and build quality of this device is truly excellent, and it will be the best flash player on the market once Rockbox firmware is released for the e200 series.

<Title>AWESOME MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is sweet.   PROS:   1. Has more space and more features than the IPOD nano.  2. Video. I have encoded a bunch of Family Guy episodes and they play great.   3. Nice design.  CONS:   1. USB only charger. This is crap. Most MP3 players do this however. You simply need to buy a 5 dollar USB to AC adapter via ebay to be able to charge on the go. MP3 player companies are retarded thinking that a person is always going to have computer access.   2. Breaks up video into small chunks. If you want to watch a 1 hour movie, it will break it up into 10 minute movies. Not a big deal but it just means you'll have like 6 files for an hour long movie.   3. Not many accessories at this time. I want to buy accessories for this puppy but since it's brand new, there's not much out there yet. Hopefully that will change.

<Title>Ipod Terminator
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Strengths: Affordable, Plays Video, Flash-based storage  Weaknesses: Low(er) Capacity (compared to hard drive players), case shows marks/fingerprints easily, cheap headphones included  Excellent player for the price - like a smaller version of a Video Ipod, but better in some ways! It is flash based - so no moving parts to break or wear out. The battery is user replaceable so you're not up a creek when it does go out in a year or two.  The software it comes with is just basic, but simple and easy to use - just choose some files (including DVD .VOB files), and it converts them and puts them on the player for you - pretty quickly, too. (Much faster than 600mb per hour that another reviewer said, though I haven't clocked it.)  There's good community support, and talk of their being RockBox support coming up for this player, which will make it even better! It's arguably the best thing out there for the price!   Highly recommended - you can't go wrong with this one.

<Title>A GrEaT bUy!!!!
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great multimedia device.  After hearing that the ipod gets scratched and cracked too easily I decided to look elsewhere for my traveling entertainment.  I did my research and so far I am glad that I chose this device.  I was reading some of the other reviews and I saw that someone had mentioned no stop button, there IS a stop button!  Also, someone had written that the picture slide show does not work, it definitely does!  Plus, I called Sandisk with some questions and they were very patient and helpful.  The ONLY negative (so far) is that there are no accessories for this item but Sandisk has informed me that they are on the way.  We will have to wait and see...  I would say that this is a great buy!!!

<Title>Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought a SanDisk Sansa e270, and deeply regret the purchase.  I need a travel charger and a spare battery, but you don't sell either, and will not tell me what other chargers, if any are compatible with the e270.  Your technical support representative's answers are absolutely useless - I have cut and pasted my questions and his responses below.  Given the non-existent customer support, I will not buy another SanDisk product again.    ===============     Your Question/Problem: I want to use the Sansa e270 when I travel, but won't be carrying a laptop. How do I charge the battery since you don't sell a travel charger? Can I use the IPod Nano/mini charger brick and plug the Sansa USB into it? If not, what can I use.  Also, I want to buy a spare battery since it is user replaceable, but you don't sell it either. Where do I buy one?  ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/20/2006 08:09)  Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. As of now there is no available wallcharger and spare battery for the Sansa e200 series. Also we do not recommend that you use the charger of the ipod player, considering that is not a product of SanDisk. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!  Sincerely, Michael Louie I. SanDisk Technical Support ________________________________________ Your Response: (06/21/2006 08:03) My trips typically last 2-4 weeks, so I really do need to charge. Since you do not sell chargers and batteries, and recommend not using non-SanDisk chargers, that makes my SanDisk unusable after the charge runs out. The only alternative is to use the IPod charger - please tell me what the correct voltage, amperage, and polarity is to charge the Sansa e270. I am willing to use a non-SanDisk product even if it means voiding the warranty. Otherwise I have wasted almost $300. And when will you start selling spare batteries, since one of the reasons I bought the Sansa was because SanDisk advertised it had a replaceable battery - although this may be true in theory, it is not true if you don't sell one! ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/21/2006 08:03)   Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. The ampherage, polarity and voltage are all proprietary information that we are unable to release at this time. You may try to do a search on a compatible charger for the Sansa e200 series player. However we do not guarantee that anything will work with it until we put a charger on the market. But we have no information when it will be out. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!

<Title>e260 vs Nano - an easy decision, heres why
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased a new nano for my fiancee, and one of the e260 for myself.  My thought was that I wanted to buy her a nice expensive unit, and I would settle for the less expensive unit.  However, it turns out that the e260 is way better than the Nano.  I'll break down why, and to be fair there is a couple of things also listed that the Nano does better.  THINGS THAT e260 DOES BETTER THAN NANO: 1.) e260 can do more     - You can play video on the e260 - great for little vacation clips from your camera. 2.) e260 screen is bigger, more colorful and brighter 3.) e260 battery is replaceble, no need to throw your unit away when the battery dies (since apple ipod would charge too much to send it in and get battery etc). 4.) Price per Storage ratio.  Nano cost $175 for 2GB, e260 was $140 for 4GB (prices at my purchase time) Thats TWICE AS MUCH for LESS MONEY. 5.) e260 is more scratch and break resistant.  Built better. 6.) e260 has an FM TUNER, you can listen to radio! 7.) You cannot use a coupon or coupon code on any Apple products at any store anywhere, you can with e260. 8.) e260 has memory card slot, yes you can add even more storage and/or move stuff off/on with a little micro-sd card. 9.) Battery charge - you get at least a couple of hours more from full charge out of the e260. 10.) Drag and drop your music onto the unit, no need for management software.  This means the unit can also be used as a file storage device like a USB drive.  THINGS THAT NANO DOES BETTER THAN e260: 1.) Nano is slightly thinner. 2.) Nano has more accessories on the market, its hard to find them for e260. 3.) The scroll wheel of e260 is mechanical, the nano scroll is sort of touch based.  Some prefer the mechanical, but the touch based is prefered by me.  Its no contest for me, I will never buy IPOD again, you just do not get what you pay for.  Really, if there was an IPOD Nano out there with the same features as the e260 and same storage space, apple would charge over $500 for it.

<Title>Solid alternative instead of the iPOD
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This boy it's really good, good sound quality, good file compatibility and it's really easy to use, you don't depend on a messy program to use it, you can use Winamp, Windows Media or simply drag and drop music in it!! To insert videos you will need the converter but it's not a big deal! Overall, really really nice, i'm really happy with it!

<Title>Would not purchase this product again
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought a Sandisk Sansa e260 and our son had problems getting it to synchronize from the time that he took it out of the box. Then today his Sandisk Sansa e260 fell 2 feet to the floor while he was sitting down and now the screen is destroyed with lines running through it internally. One would think that a 24" fall would not be enough to destroy a flash drive player, but even a rubber skin on the player was not enough to protect this poorly designed player from internal damage. I called the Sandisk company and spoke with a manager who stated that the Sandisk players are not designed to resist ANY TYPE of falls "even if it only falls 12" or less." I did not tell this manager that our kids previously owned the Sandisk Sansa m240 which not only stood up to the abuse of MANY impacts and falls, but one of them went through the wash and still worked! The new Sandisk Sansas do not hold up to the quality that their players once were. These e260 players are less expensive than some and they have decent sound quality, but don't waste your money on these players if you want a player that will last more than a few months.
