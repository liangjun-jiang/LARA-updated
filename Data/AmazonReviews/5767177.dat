<Title>A great first MP3 player!  Cool features and a great price too!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sandisk's MP3 players have really come into their own.  Not only are they packed with features, but the price is reasonable.  Sandisk has come a long way from their original Digital Audio Player.  This model has tons of things going for it. - great sound, nothing not to like there - light-weight  - FM tuner - voice recording - ergonomic design - great navigation and sorting features  - Microsoft PlaysForSure compatible (for those who are into that) - USB 2.0 connectivity - replaceable battery!!!  The cons are minor in my opinion - limited shuffle features - built-in microphone could have been improved - mediocre backlight - slower transfer speed on older computers  For those needing more space, the Sansa M240 and M250 offer more space in the same form factor.  This unit is not ideal for those who primarily want to use it for recording.  Sony's various models are all superior in that regard.  One thing I have to wonder is why Sandisk didn't include an SD slot in this bad boy.  I've already seen a few similar players with them.  I took a test drive and I liked it so much, I bought it as a holiday gift for a friend.  I would definitely recommend it.  I wanted to keep it myself, but I'm gonna get my own instead.  :)  Enjoy!

<Title>Nice sound, Nice features, Nice price
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wouldn't say that this is a top of the line audio player, but with better headphones you can get a great sound.  For a little more, I suggest you get the M240 or M250, which have the same features, but with 1GB and 2GB of storage, respectively.  Why to buy this unit:  -Rock bottom price -Decent sound with your own headphones -Nice interface -Works with various music subscription services (somtimes requires firmware upgrade--see sandisk.com) -Has "Plays for Sure" software embedded. -Can be used to store any type of file (mass storage mode) -Can shuffle play -Comes with an arm band and player sleve for walks, workouts, etc. -Lightweight -Plays for 11 Hours on 1 AAA battery  Why not to buy this unit: -You want to use it with I-Tunes (not possible) -You want a unit with rechargable battery (buy rechargable AAAs, only option) -You want a unit with swappable media (SD or flash) -You want a unit that comes with good earbuds or headphones -You want a unit that has 1GB or more (see the M240 and M250 or a variety of other players) -USB modes can be confusing, causing unit to suddenly not register as a compatible music device with windows (easily fixed by changing modes back to music playback instead of mass storage) -controlls sometimes require futzing with to get what you want.  I recommend this player for a first-time player and for those who need a cheap player with good sound.

<Title>A nice mp3 player for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is really the first mp3 player I have owned.  I initially looked at the IPOD's but was turned away from the price and also the fact that I had to purchase the songs from Itunes.  This player is simple to use, sounds really good, is very small and lightweight, and is a good deal for the money.  If you want to store 1000 songs, or watch videos, then this is not the player for you.  If you want something that's easy to afford, and can store around 200 songs, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this one.  I rated only 4 stars, as you may want to consider the 1G player as it would hold somewhere around 400 songs.

<Content>Husband received this as a christmas gift.  It didn't work with his (older) W98 PC, but works great with my XP laptop.  I got it loaded and working in about 5 minutes.  Not slow as some have reported.  Could use a little more memory, but at this price I can get another and have my genres separated.  I was holding out for an iPod, but this little baby kicks! Better fitting earbuds would be my personal choice, but that's no big deal.

<Title>Good First MP3
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very good first MP3 Player. I don't listen to a very wide range of music, so 512 MB is plenty for me. The one problem with it was, we tried to use it with iTunes, but it wouldn't download to it. So we had to burn a CD then take it from the CD to the MP3. Overall, it is a very good product and its not very complicated to use.

<Title>SanDisk Error
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product that SanDisk markets is not compatible with Mac computers. The manufactor does not disclose the fact it is not compatible with a Mac computer, until you call for tech support at SanDisk. When asked how to resolve the problem is to return it or sell it to someone else. SanDisk is not accountable for the error and dismisses the customer to resolve their error. I give this product a ZERO because of the lack of integrity by the company.

<Title>A good Mp3 player, but.........
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its a good Mp3 player, and once it get even slightly smacked, its a dead Mp3 player, I got one of these "the square model, I forget the name" and that broke by being in my pocket when I fell, and I used my warrenty, and they gave me this, I had it for 2 days, and I dropped it by accident, and it was busted, so dont buy this if you think you might drop it, it is a good Mp3 player, but its too fragile.

<Title>I really found what I want!!
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like this player very much.  First, it is very easy for using. I believe for any electronics, easy using is the first for user. Every step is so simple. You will never feel pain to find out how to use it.  Second, transfer songs is just copy and paste. That's it! Before I bought this player, I have a Sumsung 20G player. But transfer songs is so difficult. Many songs can't be transfered for no reason. But for this player, what you need to do is drag the songs and put it into player. Just like using a usb drive. Then, enjoy~~~~  Third, it can be used as a usb drive. I really need this function. I don't need to pay money for another 512M usb drive.  The last and very important thing is the sound is so great~~~~  The only pity for me is it can't be extended by SD card. If this works, I think that will be perfect for me.  But I like it!

<Content>WMP will sync only the songs if you sync MANUALLY, but if you use WMP's AUTOMATIC syncing, then the playlists themselves (as well as the songs) get put onto the device (note that WMP still doesn't SHOW that the playlists are on the device, but they are definitely there and can be used).

<Title>Especially for first timers, this is your player
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've never had a personal MP3 before, so I found this one at erwincomputers, via Amazon for just under $24, including shipping.  Its a good intro to the world of MP3 and WMA, loaded onto, basically a flash drive with a player.  This player in particular is easy to operate in both transferring Windows Media files and replaying them.  Also, it's durable and nearly foolproof in that it just continues to play faithfully when the controls are locked.  It comes with a clear vinyl cover w/beltloop, but I just lock the controls and drop it upside-down into my shirt or jacket pocket.  I doesn't interfere with most activities.  Even if I ever decided to upgrade, I can't see any reason not to have one or two of these on hand. Oh yes, and the sound was much more dynamic than I had guessed.  You can hear all parts of the music in proper proportion and the little (cheapo) ear buds you get with the player are actually pretty good.

<Title>I like this new toy
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ordered my Sansa m230 Sunday, was in the mailbox on Wednesday, and I was working out at the gym with my new toy by Thursday.  I didn't know an MP3 player could be this affordable, so I looked like a dork at the gym with my DiscMan up until this week.  (Okay, I'm an over-40 woman--I'm not into gadgets.)  I took this player out of the mail box, and had all my favorite songs downloaded to it (with my custom playlists) 2 hours later!  This is probably the best thing I have ever bought for less than $25.  I highly recommend it.  Go ahead and order the silicone case w/clip if you get this player.  The earbuds that came w/it are the best I've ever worn; somehow they stay in place very well for me.  Plenty enough volume to drown out the cell phone yakkers on the treadmill next to ya!  The only negative comment I have is that the tiny quickstart manual teaches you nothing about how to scroll thru the menu on the player or the menu's different features.  It took me longer to figure all that out than how to burn my music onto the thing.

<Content>I purchased this product mainly for the radio tuner to use at the gym.  They have tvs that use the radio stations, in order to listen to them.  The signal is great in the gym, don't have any problems there.  It does drain the battery a little fast but I use rechargeable batteries.  It has enough space to save several songs to listen to while working out.

<Content>Honestly, you get what you pay for. From the minute I got this thing in the mail, I loaded it up with music, put new batteries in and was ready to go. Unfortunatly, the device was not. I had to keep playing with the battery to get it to turn on. When it did finally turn on, I listened for a bit and put it on pause.....when I did that, it shut off and once again, I was playing with the battery to get it to work. I've tried Energizer Lithium batteries and Duracell thinking maybe it was the battery but sad to say, it wasn't. Like I said, you get what you pay for...what do you expect for 20 bucks? lol. When it wants to work, it is great....but those with little or no patience are urged to stay away from this device.

<Title>Great value, SanDisk stands behind warranty
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this unit on "Black Friday" (day after Thanksgiving) at Best Buy - couldn't beat the $40 "early-bird special".  After about two weeks, after trying to load it up with some more songs, the unit got stuck on the "finalizing update" screen when I disconnected it from the computer.  I e-mailed SanDisk about it and they responded quickly with a few things to try.  Those things failed, so I called them the next day, and they had me do a few more things, which also failed, so they issued me a RMA number to send it back to them.  A few weeks later, a brand new unit was shipped to me, and I have had no problems with the new unit.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who's looking for a relatively simple device that will support WMA files from services like Napster (my personal favorite), MusicMatch, or FYE; iPods will not work with WMA files.  The FM tuner is also a plus.  However, my only problem with this unit is that the USB cable that they give you with it is very short - less than a foot - which tends to make it a bit of a hassle to connect it to the computer - since it practically has to lay on the floor while you're adding or removing songs from it, if your computer doesn't have any USB connectors on the front of it, you'll need to either "rubberneck" to the back of your system or get a longer cable.

<Content>I bought this on black friday for only $40 and it's the best mp3 player for $40 dollars. It doesn;t have a huge memory but it's good for young costomers. it's vert easy to use and is a bit bulky but fits nicely in your pocket and in your pocket. I suggest have some back-up headphones because first-of-all thier the most cheeeeeeesiest headphones i've ever seen and they might get screwed,lke mine.It's has very easy to use controls and frowards pretty quickly. I had some problems with it, i didn;t even know what, either the songs wouldn't delete or it just tirned off. I suggest making an account at SanDisk.com/support to help you out. The usb cable is really short but doesn't bother me I use rechargeable batteries but i listen to music every day and used it since black fiday and have only rechaged then 3 times. If your in the market for a new mp3 player, the Sansa m230 is PERFECT!!!!!

<Title>One of the best little players for it's price
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Alright, so mp3 players, yeah there's so many to choose from, it gets really annoyin, especially when all of your trendy friends are telling you to get an ipod. Don't get me wrong, ipods are great, i have one in fact, and i love it. But i rollerblade (not recreational, like the kind where you go to skateparks and grind handrails and various other things). So the the ipod's size makes it more prone to be broken, which is why I love this thing. I'm going to skip all the candy coating and get straight to the tootsie roll filling:  pros: -Most other mp3 players are a little bit thinner, but the sansa has a flat control panel and the back is round to fit in your hand, i know, i know, you're going to put it in your pocket, well just put the interface on the inside of the pocket and none of the buttons have a chance of breaking, or the screen.  -The sansa has an extremely long battery life for one little AAA, around 20 hours, which is awesome since i hate buying batteries, but that's not a problem because i have rechargable AAA, but it's gets extremely aggrivating having to recharge batteries everytime you go out.  - The buttons are perfect, they're big, they're bold, what more do you want, and i noticed most mp3 players put these tiny little pin size buttons on their players, what's the point of that.  -The menu is really straightforward and simple. You just press the menu button on top of the player, and then use the 4 buttons (play/pause, previous track, next track, and stop) as the directional buttons on the menu.  -I used to have the older version of the sandisk mp3 players (256mb) and it was never loud enough, like i would be on the bus or in a busy area and not even be able to hear my music! Thankfully they enabled it to become louder and have a better sound quality.  -It's very inexpensive, i payed 40$ for mine  from a seller on amazon. And that's about how much it goes for retail everywhere else.  Cons:  -The only problem i have is that the earbuds that they come with aren't the best in the world, but i still use them, they're the only earbuds i have ever found that have fit my ears without a 2 billion dollar price tag. Or i would get new ones.  -The fm tuner that comes with this is junk, i get a good signal every once in a while, but it really shouldn't be used as a marketing gimmick, considering most flash mp3 players have one now.  Ok, well thanks for reading my review of the sandisk sansa 512mb. I forgot to mention that it has a decent voice recorder for notes and such, but i always have mine filled to the the rim with music, so i've never really had the oppurtunity to really try it out.

<Title>Exactly what I was looking for
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is exactly what I've been looking for.  I wanted something small and durable so that it would withstand rattling around in my backpack (as I am a college student), and it seems quite sturdy so far.  Also the buttons and interface are very user-friendly.  The volume control is also easy to access and adjust when the player is in my pocket.    The earphones are (in my opinion) very high quality, and I am pleasantly surprised as to the quality of the sound this thing produces.  And here's a plus: when you have the earphones on, other people can't hear them.  This is how it should be, but a lot of times with other MP3 players' ear phones you can still hear peoples' music.  Not so with these; they're intended for the listener only.  And their style and design is also quite sleek-looking.  I am also quite pysched about the built in radio.  I enjoy listening to the radio from time to time, because of the variety of music available.  And in comparison to Apple's I-pod, you have to buy a sort of "add on" radio tuner to be able to listen to the radio with an I-pod, and such an add-on costs around $50 by itself.  For just $13 more, you can buy this MP3 player instead, and still be able to store your own music on it just like any other MP3 player.  I should mention about the radio though, that you only have access to FM stations and not AM stations.  Overall I found that this player has everything I need.  It's really an amazing deal for the amount of features you get, and I am quite pleased with it.  I highly recommend it.

<Title>Best Flash Player for its price
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this last Thanksgiving for only 30 dollars at Best Buy, plus 10 dollars for a 2 year insurance. Awesome deal. It was way more than I could ask for, for only 40 bucks.   The pros imo: - Very light weight. I could barely even notice I had the Sansa in my pocket when I used it at work. Also, the arm band is very handy so you can keep the cord out of the way while doing things. - Buttons very easy to reach. I could push the play buttons through my sweater without even looking at them. - Equalizer options are great since you can cuztomize your own. - FM tuner, is always a plus, but it didn't really work for me because I live sort of far from Boston so I couldn't get the good stations. Well I can't get the good stations even on my house stereo. Only in my car's stereo I can tune in to them. - The case that comes with it is a perfect fit, and it protects the sansa from scratching. - Playlist support if you sync it with WM player. That's such a neat option that lets you create playlists and update them to your player very easily. - Also you can access the sansa with windows explorer, and add music by drag and drop.   The cons: - 512 MB not nearly enough for my needs. This is not really a con, because for the price it's still a bargain. But that was the main reason why I sold it to my friend for $50. I'm planning on getting a hard disk now. - When I bought this player I thought that I could upgrade the memory by adding a sandisk flash card to it. Guess I was wrong, but some other Sandisk players do have that option, even though they're twice as expensive. - Earbuds are kinda crappy. I mean they fit nicely in my ears and also had that little cover, but after about 3 months the left one started dying on me. I had to keep the cord in a certain position so I could hear the sound. I guess I broke the earbud because I kept getting the cord caught on places and I kept pulling on it by accident. The sound quality is great though. - You can't use folders as playlists. You can't use any other player to add playlists to the sansa except for WMP. I used Real Player (not a good player I know) to upload my music, only because it gave me the option to convert my mp3's to wma while adding the music to the sansa. I hate wma files, but I used it so I could fit more music into my player. You get almost twice as much space if you use wma instead of mp3. Later on I found out that the sansa won't recognize Real Player playlists. Then I tried to Create playlists on Windows Media Player then add the songs that were already in the Sansa to the playlists, but you can't add files to a playlist that way with WMP.  So no playlists for me, just regular playback through all my library. I could still play by genre, or by artist, but still wasn't the same. If it wasn't for that I think that this player would have been perfect.

<Content>i love the mp3 player. sure there isnt a folder system but organized by artist is fine (with legit songs) for me. the big thing is not being able to stop the music besides pausing and turning off the mp3 player. is there some way around it like pressing two certain buttons at the same time or smth? lol i would rate it five stars if it was present (minor nusiance for some) ---so easy to use !! :-D   i bought it from j& r music world only because there was a 10$ rebate (69.99-10.00= 59.99) and besides, i wouldn't have to wait for the mp3 player to arrive to my door; the downside of J&r  was the NY sales tax that came up a tad higher than i expected so my purchase came up to 75$ and after rebate it will be 65$ instead of less than amazon (with supersavings and tt long wait with supersavings).   if only sales tax could be abolished!

<Content>I purchased this for my 12 yo son. He has recorded music (sister's band concert song), downloaded songs and listened to the radio. He has had no difficulty manipulating the buttons or using the mp3. The sound quality is fine. The head phones are okay quality. If you are looking for a decent first mp3 this is it.

<Title>Great little mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this mp3 player to go running and exercise with. You can fit approx. 3-4 cds on it, which is more than enough for an hour or so at the gym. This little mp3 gives off great sound, takes batteries, and is really light weight. It is easy to see and figit with. The buttons are so accessible that I can even change songs when I am running.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't come with an armband... at least the version I purchased. I had to buy a separate armband that didn't quite fit is and made it difficult to use.  Other than that it is a great product and I recommend it.

<Title>Disappointing...
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this mp3 player as a gift and was very excited. It was small, portable, and had many handy features. The big issue was that it runs on batteries. Well, it DID run on batteries until it broke and wouldn't run anymore. For some reason, the programing on it corrupted. I would not recommend getting this version of the SanDisk Sansa. After talking with a few other people who owned this same player, they also said they had problems with it and ended up buying something else. I would most recommend upgrading to the 1 GB version of the Sandisk Sansa.

<Title>Great sound and price
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I used to own a 30GB Ipod but it broke after being dropped only a couple of times. This led me to the conclusion that spending high $ on high tech mp3 players is pointless. Why spend hundreds to store tons of music? If you want to store tons of music, get a 500 GB hard drive for your computer. When I'm out and about I only need a few cds worth of songs. And if it breaks, who cares? I only spent $25 including shipping! Plus the Sansa's sound quality is great and the headphones it comes with are really good, almost great, and better than the Sony headphones which I bought for $20. So you get good headphones and a low cost, compact mp3 player for under $30! Take it from an audiophile and music collector, the Sansa is worth much more than the low purchase price.

<Title>Had to return to the store...twice
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I felt comfortable purchasing this product after all of the good reviews on this site.  It did have good sound, but the particular player I purchased kept skipping from song to song after playing only a few seconds.  Some songs would play for a few minutes and then skip to the next song, others would only play for five seconds or so.  I returned the player to the store and tried another M230.  The exact same thing happened again.  As I returned this model again, the store clerk privately told me that there had been many returns on this particular model and he advised me to try either Iriver or Samsung.  Hopefully it was just a bad batch that had arrived at that particular store, but I won't be purchasing a Sansa again.

<Title>Sandisk M230 Honest Review
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research on this product before purchasing.  I have several Sandisk Compact Flash Cards that work great, so I knew the quality was good from the company already, so I gave them a try and Amazon had it at a great price with Free Shipping.  Bottom Line about the M230 (M200 series):  The unit is very user friendly and works great.  Some positive notes about it are:  Affordability, Equalizer, FM Radio (20 Pre-sets), Sound Quality, Firmware Updates, Backlit Screen (nice blue), Uses non-proprietary batteries (big plus in my book), comes with a protective case and arm strap that works.  Others have stated the arm band is not any good, but I disaggree totally.  I use my unit at the gym several times a week and running on the tread machine, it stays put and never skips a beat (literally).  I've never used the recorder, but it is good to have as a memo option if needed on the go.  Being I go to the gym regularly, the stopwatch is very handy to have also.  The equalizer settings (Rock, Jazz, Classical and Pop) are good right out the box.  The unit also gives you the option to manually set the sound which is what I use and improves on the already great sound that the preset equalizer gives.  One of the things that really sold me on this unit was that you aren't limited to just one computer to load and delete songs with the unit.  I can use any computer with a USB plug (1.1 and 2.0) and add new songs and then instantly play them unlike some other well known named products which must have the same computer to be able to play the song.  Another key feature is that it uses a single AAA battery and not a proprietary type or worse an internal type which can't be replaced easily or cheaply.  When your internal or proprietary battery runs out of power, that's it. You can't run to the local drugstore and buy some AAA batteries to continue use. The proprietary type must be recharged before reused.  I use 900 mA rechargeable AAA batteries.  The battery life is about 24-30 hours of continuous operation which is great.  A regular Akaline battery in this unit last for 15-19 hours.   The only minor issues are that the the supplied USB cable is on the short side (9").  If you do not have a front USB port, this can cause a small problem, however, I am able to use my Canon digital camera cable for the camera and the Sandisk M230 which works prefectly and gives plenty of length.  The other small issue is the back light stops operating when the battery reaches 3/4 empty which is really understandable being it takes a lot of power to run a backlit screen.  The IPOD Shuffle doesn't even have a screen nor many other features the M230 has.  This was a great buy.

<Title>Best Quality for the Buck
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB blue player near the end of January unfortunately.  I say unfortunately because I missed all of the Thanksgiving Sales!  I could have gotten this for $40 or $50 but I ended up paying twenty dollars more.    The SanDisk is my first mp3 player.  I can't help much in the way of comparison.  But my only complaint is that it doesn't play very loud...which is understandable.  Hard to fit a nice amp in a tiny package!  The earbuds are decent but no way near the quality of my SHURE in-the-earbuds.  The FM radio is decent but doesn't pick up weak stations.  The voice recorder would be useful if I had 1 GB or more space.  Right now the 512 is packed with music so no space for voice recording.  The buttons are easy to use and the menu is simple.  But as stated in other reviews, the shuffle feature needs a better algorithm.    I would recommend this mp3 player because downloading music is very simple and it is very easy to use.  Cost is the icing on the cake.  Updates in future.

<Title>Great Deal!
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recieved this MP3 player for Christmas about a year ago.  I have really enjoyed this player.  It has a fairly good battery life although I would recommend you invest in some rechargeable AAA's.  Music is easy to upload with Windows Media Player, or simply using the drag-and-drop method straight from your computer.  It comes with a plastic case that you fit over the player and that is a really nice feature.  The radio transmitter is great and gets amazing reception.    The earbuds that came with it lasted for about 2-3 months and then one ear went out.  I used them that way for about 8 months and then the other ear finally went out.  I would get this player (since it's a great value) and invest in some noise cancelling earbuds. I also have never been able to get the "playlist" feature to work on the player... I still can't figure that one out.  Overall, I would definetly recommend this player.  It's a great player for the price and does a good job.

<Title>Not that good even for a budget mp3 player...
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Even in a budget mp3 player category, the Sandisk Sansa M230 lacks in so many ways. The FM player is glitchy and can't seem to get a strong signal. The screen is always on(you can turn backlight off, but it always has scrolling text of whats playing, eating away at your battery).  The most annoying part about this Mp3 Player is the lack of the ability to make playlists and folders. Forget about having multiple directories for different genre's of music, they all get arranged by the Mp3 player and stuffed in one list... you can't even pick the order they play. And for someone like me, who listens to Rock and Electronica, thats annoying... They are both great genres... but after hearing Pete Tong lay down a great beat, I don't want it to go into A guitar rhythm by Angus Young of AC/DC.  If you not picky and just want random music, why bother with the Sansa M230? Save yourself some cash and get an Mp3 player without a screen, cause if u don't listen to FM or care about EQ... you get nothing else worthwhile with the M230.  This thing simply looks basic, even when compared to entry level budget mp3 players...

<Title>Voice recorder makes this a plus.

<Content>I bought this as an MP3 Player for my commute into Washington DC last year because it was cheap enough that if something happened, I wouldn't be as distraught as if I lost a $300 ipod.   Well, I've actually wound up using this more as an FM radio with acceptable performance, and as a voice recorder to record some personal phone calls on the speakerphone.  I am sure the sensitivity of the microphone is not as good as a dedicated voice recorder, however that advantage would make this a buy again for me.

<Title>Great little player, only a few flaws
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, I use this thing nearly every day.  I love it minus a couple flaws which I'll explain.  1.  If you like podcasts and ever wanna fastforward or rewind them, this Sansa has a tendency to skip to the next or previous track after you've been holding rewind or fastforward for a couple minutes worth of MP3.  In other words, it fastforwards a couple minutes then auto skips to the next track so it's fustrating if you listened to 20 minutes of something already and wanna jump to that spot on the track.   2.  It doesn't let you delete tracks from the Sansa, you have to plug it in the computer to delete tracks.   3.  512 megs isn't quite enough for me, but it works. 4.  It has a funny way of organizing tracks.  It auto groups things by the same artist, which is ok, but the display will show the entire artist, album title, song title bla bla bla like 20 feet long and slowly scroll past so if you're driving in your car, you have to wait to see what's playing or what's next.   5.  The lighted display doesn't stay on long sometimes.  This again is a pain if you're driving at night and have to wait for the title to scroll slowly while the light goes out after 4 or 5 seconds.  For the most part these issues could be addressed by firmware updates from Sansa, but I don't know how much they listen to customers.  I've suggested they change some things and hopefully they do.

<Title>The original sansa player is still a great bargain!
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is a great bargain for those who are willing to give it as a gift to someone fairly new to MP3 devices or someone who is young and has knowledge of digital music.  Control navigation is huge so you can access it easily.  All you need to do is plug the cable (which is included with the player) into your computer and all you do is click and drag any music you want to on your player, it's really that simple.  This is recommended for those who do not have a lot of music on their computer and are satisfied with a handful of music, or for those who do not mind constantly replacing music.  This makes a wonderful gift to anyone who is a beginner to MP3.

<Title>Simple, no problem, mp3 player with long battery life and good support!
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my M230. SanDisk is a fantastic company with great support. I originally purchased an earlier machine and it ended up having a bug. I was offered a new machine. I accepted the offer and was sent this M230.  When the package arrived it had one of the old buggy machines. I gave corp a call and was immediately sent an upgrade and was allowed to keep the buggy machine. My original M230 was stolen so I purchased another one from Amazon (that is how much I love this).  It is amazingly easy to set up. I do not use the included software just copy and paste after connecting the M230. It copies the music fast and after a couple minutes is ready to go.  I use the new, ready to use, rechargeable batteries and after many, many hours have not had to change the battery even once!  I understand that SanDisk is one of the few companies that actually manufacture their own memory. Also customer service is in America (the last time I checked).  Highly recommended. frank

<Title>Say hello to my little friend
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am really happy with my Sansa. I have had mine now for about a month and it's already taken a beating and it keeps on going. It's VERY durable.   I use it daily for my workouts, and the armband that is included is perfect for people who are working out or performing an activity.   I can fit about 90 songs in .mp3 format onto the unit, and it does have a good battery life.   I am very happy with this .mp3 player and couldn't have made a better choice.  Pros: 512 MB of room for songs, or about 90 .mp3s Decent earbuds, I have no problem with mine. Small and convenient, the design of it makes very little difference. Easy to understand and operate. Sleep timer for automatic shutoff.  Blue backlight- very weak, but it works.  FM tuner, again, I have had no problems with signal strength and have had great results with that feature.  Armband included, great for active people. Compatible with real player- so I can use one program for listening to music and downloading music onto my sansa.   Generally, I love my sansa. I use it when I go grocery shopping, when I go to the mall, when I go gambling, or when I am absolutely bored. I love it and highly recommend it to anyone who is on the market for an inexpensive and reliable .mp3 player. The sansa is great!   Cons:  It's not an iPod

<Content>I purchased this player for my son and we are both very pleased with what you get for the money. The sound quality through the earphones provided is terrific and the features are plentiful for a player that cost us about $63.My personal list of improvements would be a longer USB cable for data transfer and a slightly brighter backlight. I also have difficulties with obtaining a strong signal using the radio, but this may be more an issue with where I live versus the ability of the player. Overall, if you are looking for a solid player and not looking to pay the IPOD prices, this is a great player to consider.

<Title>No problems; significant advantages over iPod 
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa is a small flash-based mp3 player that runs for many hours on a single AAA battery available wherever. It is so easy to use I did not and have not even looked at the instruction manual. The sound quality is really good and the price can't be beat. As others have noted, the array of mp3 devices is really bewildering. Basically, there is iPod and everything else. Ultimately, this product seems to be the best of the "everything else" category - and there are some significant reasons why I think people are better off with this than with iPods. Firstly, and most importantly for me, the Sandisk player functions as a drag and drop drive into which you can just put your music files and they play right away. There is no proprietary interface such as iTunes required. This is a huge advantage for anyone who does not use or like iTunes, as I do not. Loading and unloading files can be done easily and seamlessly through the regular windows desktop interface. This results in a device that is considerably more useful and robust than iPods which require the use of the stupid and childlike, yet strangely frusterating, iTunes software - one of the biggest problems of which is that you can only use one computer at a time to sync to your music library. This is really not cool. If, however, you want to use a designated piece of software to sync to the Sandisk, you can use musicmatch or a number of others and it works without any of the hassle of iTunes. In fact, with one click, you can sync whatever is playing on your Musicmatch playlist to the player... something that I never really figured out how to do with iTunes. Furthermore, you can easily use the flash memory to hold any other kind of file just like a pen drive. In the end, I can only attribute the success of iPods to their marketing blitz and to their kind of catchy designs. But these are not really good reasons to buy a music player. I had an iPod for a while before I spilled coffee all over it and I don't miss it one bit. I only wish I had gotten one of these sooner and had given away my iPod to someone who likes them instead of the unfortunate end that it met. I think if you buy one of these you won't regret it. It's not quite as tiny as the iPod shuffle and it does require AAA batteries but it is a much more useful piece of equipment.

<Content>This is a great music player for my 13 yr. old. It has taken a beating and is still going, sounds good, and is simple but does everything even I would need in a MP3 player. Good product if you are looking for something simple.

<Content>This is the first mp3 player I have ever bought. I really like it, sounds great, easy to use and fits right in my pocket while I am walking. I really like it and will probably use this particular one for a long time. It works great!

<Title>Just right
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We now own 2 of these players. My wife likes to put entire CDs on the player. I like a variety of tracks. Syncs up nicely on windows media player. Sound in the earbud headphones is excellent. Great for FM radio too. You can put about 80 MP3 songs on the player comfortably, and can update and replace songs pretty easily as you synch up on windows media player.

<Content>I bought this item for my son.  It is a good MP# for the money.  I checked around at local electronic stores and this one was recommended over the Ipod shuffle.  The only complaint is that the sound quality isn't crisp.  Good sound, but not great.

<Title>ugly but tough little thing
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I  hook this up to my car through the tape deck.(yes both my cars have tape decks)  The good: runs on AAA battery, long battery life. I use this every day on my  7.5miles 20mins commute, and occasional jogging/exercise. Supports chinese character.  Support wma. Plug this into the USB port(windows xp) and it acts as an flash drive where you direct drag and drop files. No crappy itune needed. I bought this to replace the Dell Ditty which was smaller but unreliable, and also as an alternative to my Ipod which doesnt support wma. Sound quality is decent, but I dont really care for my radio talk shows. And unlike ipod, I can leave this ugly thing in my car without worrying someone gonna break in. Becasue of the size, the main buttons are very easy to press which is important when you are driving.   The bad: The designer needs to go back to design school as this is one ugly piece of equipment. For a 512M unit this is pretty big. The battery life indicator is not accurate when I use my 1.2v NiMH battery, it shows full life when it is about to die.    Bottom line: Good for old-school people like me, not for show-offs. No custom rechargable battery or painful softwares to worry about. But dont hang it on your neck unless you want to make a fashion anti-statement.

<Content>I purchased a few of these MP3 Players for our Haunted House and they worked great this year. We used some CD players last year but it's so much easier using the MP3 players because they can hold more than one or two sound effects. GREAT product!

<Title>Great alternative to the iPoos!
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was the first personal mp3 player I ever purchased, and nearly 2 years later, it's still going strong.  I selected it on a whim as I was waiting in line to pay for my other Black Friday (day-after-Thanksgiving) purchases.  With people all around me shelling out $100+ for iPoos [sic], I figured $50 was a bargain.  I was right and then some!    What I love about this is how easy it was for me to put music on it.   Since I already have a 30 gig directory of music I ripped from my own CDs, it was as simple as dragging songs from there to the Sansa. (I've seen my VERY tech-savvy hubby curse while trying to load and set up his different iPods. *cackle*)  Being able to adjust the sound playback style is nice, too (Rock/Pop/Classical, etc.)  I also love that the Sansa has a radio and voice recorder function; no more writing little notes on my hand during the day!  I've also used my Sansa as a regular flash drive to transport files to and from work.  Since it uses standard batteries, I don't have to worry about remembering to charge it, either, and I've been quite surprised at how long I can use the Sansa before I do need to replace the battery.  I'm very impressed!  While I don't recommend it, I've dropped my Sansa several times and banged it around plenty, with no apparent ill effects.  Overall, I'm quite happy with my impulse purchase!  I do plan on getting a new Sansa, only for a larger capacity, though.  When I do, I'll be passing this one along to my 12 year old.  I'm MUCH happier with the thought of her carrying around a good $50 mp3 player than one that costs several times that much.  The Sansa M200 line is a great, budget-conscious gift for a tween/teen or yourself!

<Title>serves its purpose
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted a cheap MP3 player for working out and walking around campus over the summer. Don't buy this unless you're paying less then $40 for it. I wish there were more options for putting the songs in different orders easily. Battery life is good at about 15 hours per pop. However you can get a lot better for the same price now.

<Content>I bought this little MP3 player for my young daughter.  I didn't see spending the money on a children's model when she would outgrow it in a year or two.  I was worried that she wouldn't be able to work it, but it is really simple to operate.  It has really good battery life.  She loves taking it with her everywhere.
