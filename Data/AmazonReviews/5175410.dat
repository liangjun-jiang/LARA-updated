<Title>Not so good....
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Whoa...it was broken out of the box. The plastic trim window over the display came off with the protective clear wrap around the music player. I super glued it back on. The whole unit feels cheap and weakly built. The "gun metal" finish scratches *very* easily. The buttons "miss," by that I mean that pressing the next button might trigger the play/pause button instead of next. The menu system is marginal considering the player has 7 buttons on the face. The player has a 2.5MM jack instead of a 3.5MM jack, so now I have to dig up an adapter because it is not mentioned in the item description. I would not have purchased it based on that fact alone. Quite honestly the manufacturer could have easily put a standard jack into the player. I have not had a chance to verify battery life as I just got the package today. There are positives. File transfer is snappy, the screen is easily read, the FM function works well with the right headphones (the headphone cord acts as the antenna.)  FM record seems a useless feature, but that is simply my opinion. Voice recording quality is selectable (3 quality settings) and functions well enough to take quick mental notes but it would take you a minute to get there. I bought this for gym use, so I guess I will see how well it goes, but I do consider it disposable at this point due to the poor build quality. There are MUCH better products available for only a few dollars more. I highly recommend finding a different player. My advice: call a friend.

<Title>Junk - don't waste the little money this costs

<Content>I spent too many hours trying to get this to work.  I have to resist the urge to buy without doing hours of research.  Read ALL the reviews first.

<Title>Rechargable battery does not work
<Date>Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first i thought it was a good bargain, but this player does not have good quality even for the price, slow control response and poor documentation, my real problem with this player is that the rechargeable battery never worked when i connect the usb cable to charg the battery it starts to connect and disconnect and never charges the battery, so this for me like a disposable player, i hate to say this because i already bought it, but my advice dont buy this poor qualiy player
