<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has done it again.  As a 40 gig iPod owner, I love the shuffle.  Its the go anywhere, do almost anything, store more than music mp3 player. Battery life is great, storage capacity is more than the stated 120 songs, and the sound is INCREDIBLE! ...as is the price.  I used it while excercising and there were no skips.  Easily fits into your pocket and weighs less than a set of keys! The shuffle will fit perfectly into your busy lifestyle. P.S. The required installation software can be a bit of a problem if you already have iTunes on your computer.

<Title>A non-iPod-user's review
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a compact, flash-based mp3 player, the shuffle fills a niche in the market.  Apple's greatest contribution to the mp3 player market was the aesthetics of their players: love it or hate it, you have to admit that the iPod looks unique, and most people (like me) will go as far as saying it looks pretty good.  Before everyone and their neighbor's dog owned one, you could pull out an iPod and make the room stop.  The shuffle continues this tradition.  Apple's sleek, simple design hides a fairly powerful little flash-based player.  It's tiny (although not the smallest player on the market, despite what their ad people may say), feather-light and on the whole, very trendy looking.  The 512 memory is just about the right size for what I suspect is the primary target market for these players: people looking for a small, durable alternative to their iPod for short trips, work-outs, etc.  Other pros:  -Simple, intuitive control interface  -Easy to interface with pretty much any machine  -iPod users can use all their .AAC format music  -No, seriously, this thing weighs next to nothing.  Cons:  -No external LCD.  Apple had to sacrifice SOMEthing to make this product as small and lightweight as it is, and the LCD screen is the first of these things.  While not a problem for those intimately familiar with their music collection or those not picky about what they listen to, many users will definitely not appreciate the inability to easily navigate the songs contained on the player.  -Terrible battery life.  Much like the iPod compared to its competitors (e.g. the Zen Touch), the Shuffle has less than 2/3 the average battery life of comparable features (meaning with no LCD screens).  Again, Apple had to sacrifice something in order to make the product as lightweight and small as it is, and this shouldn't be a problem for the majority of users, as the shuffle seems to be geared toward short trips.  -Like the iPod, you must interface the Shuffle with iTunes.  Now before the pro-iPod army comes and kills me, let me explain: I have nothing against iTunes, it's a great program (as evidenced by Microsoft blatantly copying it with Media Player 10), but I personally despise being forced to use any one application with my hardware.  If Apple had made the Shuffle drag'n'drop compatible, it would have been a much better purchase.

<Title>Sexy, small,  white iPod Shuffle - I like
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own an iPod.  I never felt like I need all the storage.  I would be fine with 120 songs, therefore I ordered my iPod shuffle as soon as it came out.  When I got the package at home, I was in love.  Even the packaging is sweet. I loved the smell of the packaging, the sexy flirty display in the box and ultimately the size.  But wait, how about the sound and the music...  I Love it.  I synced my iPod with iTunes (I only have 40 songs) and listened to it in shuffle mode and WOW... the sound is amazing.  I have found the end of my portable music player search.  Not only does it sound great but its a head turner.  Everywhere I go, people want to touch it, feel it, listen to it.  Stay away!!!  I have to fight them off with a stick.  Now, I walk the streets of New York, shuffled...  Now I drive Shuffled, heck, I even go to the toilet... shuffled.  I'm all shuffled up.  Lets face it, you add songs to your playlist that you love, not bad songs but great songs, and the shuffle feature is awesome.  Its like it picks the perfect songs to follow... Its a virtual dj...  Now, stay away, cause this shuffle is mine.  Till death or technical issues, do us apart.  Yahhhh!!!

<Title>uhhhhhhhh, NO!
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a confessed musicaholic. I could sit and download for hours. But, why would anyone buy this flash memory player when there are other ones with more features AND a display? I will stick to my Iriver any day. The inline recording feature that it has is remarkable. It really is cd quality. Not that I want to rip off the music industry, but with this feature you can record an album, for instance, off of AOL for nothing. It really is cd quality when you record like this. This IPod can't do that. I think the hard drive Ipod is a brilliant idea, and maybe someday I will get one. But for the money, you can buy another flash memory MP3 player, with a display, with a radio, with voice recording (some may find that useful, I don't) and the inline recording. And they look better. Whats with the boring white? Naah I'm not sold on this.

<Title>Don't be taken in
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> Don't believe the Apple hype or the ranting by Apple disciples. Comparably-priced players have a ton more features - a display, FM-tuner (great for the gym), voice recorder, replaceable battery, folders to organize tracks on the player, equalizers, shuffle functions, great ease of use, and on and on... And this player is plagued by the common Ipod problem - when the battery dies the player becomes a paperweight. Steve Jobs once said that the only thing flash players are good for are to sit unused in the back of drawers. Well, his company has made one that will fulfill that prophecy.

<Title>Deserves the 5 star rating, reviewing it for what it is
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No, it doesn't have a display. No, you couldn't get at 512 MB player with a display for $99. The Shuffle breaks new ground in flash memory players not only because it is an equisite player (you gotta hold one in your hand and be baffled at the big sound coming out of such a small piece of plastic), but because of what iTunes has done with it. The Autofill function is awesome, and perfect for what the Shuffle is. I didn't want to take my 40 Gig to the gym for fear of dropping it... the shuffle is fantastic for that. Plus, I can listen to audible books on it and quickly get to them by just starting at the beginning in non-shuffle mode.  This really is just a phenomenal product, and I haven't had any complaints... on the contrary, I'm surprised at everything that I can make it do without the screen. Seriously, I don't miss the screen with this thing. You won't either.  Small, light, inexpensive, impressive performance. What's not to like?

<Title>Perfect for casual music lovers.
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my FIRST time buying an Apple product.  Mainly because they are waaay too expensive.  But the Shuffle is great.  I use it mainly at the gym, or out running.  My Zen Xtra is way to big while lifting weights.  With this puppy, I don't feel like I'm carrying around a tape player that weighs like a brick.    I don't recommend if you're a hardcore music listener.  Casual music listeners/runners/weight lifters will love this.

<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product is not revolutionary by any means as some people would have you believe. It's all hype. There simply are better flash based mp3 players that are equally as small. Have a display, great battery life, shuffle function, fm radio, voice recording, excellent sound quality, and look pretty, and have more codec support, but don't come with all the hype. Creative Muvo TX fm is priced similarly, small, and is much better in my opinion, and also prettier.Don't follow the sheep.

<Title>People Just Don't Get It!
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just because the Shuffle doesn't tailor to your standards doesn't mean it's going to be a failure. The Shuffle is the ideal mp3 player for the active user. When I go to the gym with my iPod mini, I still notice the weight in my pocket and the harddrive is subject to damage when I move. Also I never look at the screen. This is why I got the Shuffle. I don't need a screen BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW WHAT SONGS ARE IN MY MP3 PLAYER! And for 100 bucks you really can't go wrong.  Only Apple could pull off an idea of making the Shuffle's most obvious "weakness" (no screen) and turn it into it's main feature (Life is Random).

<Title>IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL!!!
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple Ipod Shuffle doesn't work with a Windows Computer. I spent 4 days trying to get it to work but it didn't. I had also purchased music off of Itunes to get it to work but it was just all a waste of time and money. I think this is the WORST electronic to buy unless you like getting frustrated and you want to waste your money and time.

<Title>battery sucks
<Date>Fri Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The shuffle works nicely.  Itune is not user friendly.  The battery dies after occasionl to moderate use for a little over 1 year.  What kind of battery do they put in the shuffle.  Normal Rechargeable battery last way longer than that, at least 2 to 3 years minimum.  For a great company and an expensive product, they sure know how to short-change the customer.  Horrible.  Yeah, I'm done with Apple.  That is why monopoly is not good for any company or business.

<Title>Apple 512 MB iPod Shuffle
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It should be 4 1/2 stars but I will give it the benefit of a doubt. I love it.  It is intuitive, very thoughtful and simply designed much like an Apple computer.  But sometimes it would be nice to have playlists or a viewer. 512 MB is about the maximum I would down load into one without the ability to quickly find what you want to hear. I have purchased 2 refurbished Shuffles with no problems for the last 2 years. Just remember to disconnect it the way the instructions tell you to.

<Date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If this product is indicative of Apple quality and customer support than it's the last Apple product I'll ever buy. After only very limited use, the Shuffle won't playback. I did everything that Apple says to do to restore the software, but nothing works. You can't contact Apple by email, so you can't tell them what tou think. P-Poor product and Support. Down with Apple!!!

<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item as a gift for someone. The device was not loading any songs from the internet or a cd. I have tried to contact the seller but he refused to accept the item for an exchange. Apple's customer service help (located in India ) was not much help.   Now I am stuck with a non-functioning Ipod and now I have a reputation for buying cheap items off the internet.

<Title>Stops working after a year
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Shuffel for a little over a year.  I did not like the ITunes but it took over my other mp3 player. After working great, all of a sudden the iPod would not take a charge.  I realized the battery was dead.  I was very upset, I paid alot for this product and to have it die after less than 10 charges in a little over a year was a rip off.  I wont buy an apple product again.

<Title>A Poor Introduction to Apple Products
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's not much more to be said about this product.  It does what it advertises.  And with the newest iTunes, Windows support is better and not as completely annoying to install compared to a year ago.  But this cheap player doesn't really have much to offer.  You are locked into using iTunes to "organize your media" which is very annoying for Windows folks.  I guess this is "personal preference" as most people are willing to jump on the iTunes bandwagon.  Other than the software annoyances, the player itself really doesn't impress.  Battery life isn't that impressive compared to most other flash players.  From what I hear, the battery also dies within 1-2 years AND its not user-replaceable.  The biggest problem for most people is that there is no navigational display because Apple wanted to save money on manufacturing.  That's inexcusable.  The headphones that come with it are terrible and should be replaced immediately with something more comfortable/better sounding.    The manual and website are confusing even for the technologically inclined.  The website is terribly managed and you have to walk through several screens before getting to wherever you want to go if you're looking for technical support.  Don't expect to get much help there.  All-in-all, if you want to "look cool" and do the ipod thing, this isn't the player for you.  You probably will want an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EP4TWQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-4646271-3591145">iPod Nano</a> instead.  If you're a Windows user and you want a good, cheap mp3 player, save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one.  As cheap as it is, its not worth it.  iAudio makes some good cheap players that act as a USB Mass Storage device instead of using proprietary software, but you can also sync it with whatever as well.  Frankly, I don't know who this player appeals to.

<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is my third i pod shuffle, the only complaint will be the battery replacement, not an easy task to do. this is a throw away item (500 full charges more or less). Other than that this unit performs quite well. My next mp3 player will be a cell phone with an expandable sd micro card, hopefully up to 2 Gb.
