<Title>Its been great for me
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the gigantic harddrive and easy intereface. I use this a lot and have never had any trouble. I am in college and I like to download books for class and listen to them while I exercise or work, that way I can study and not be stuck in the house, I am able to find a lot of audio books online that are compatable with this MP3 player. It is also handy because I can store data files on it like a flash drive and bring them to school for presentations. As far as durability goes it gets scrached up really easy but other then that it seems industuctable. The battery is fairly good I have never run out of juce and I brought it with my on a 14 hour flight, my only problem with its battery life is that it does not have the ablity to attach to any external battery for long trips. The screen is great for movies I have several full length movies on mine as well as tv shows and the picture quality is great, though it does kill the battery to use it. All and all if you buy this you will like it, it is a wonderful economical alternative to a Ipod and in my opion is better then my brothers 30 gig Ipod both in quality and usuablitiy

<Title>Forget Apple! This is the MP3 player for you!
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I can't say enough about Creative's MP3 players! No, they don't pay me, but darn it, they should, as much as I tell people how great they are! The battery life dwarfs iPods and the software - way better for keep track of your music. Ever asked someone for a copy of a song they have, from iTunes? Ya, good luck with that. I've given these as gifts because they're so easy to use and work so well! I don't travel anywhere without mine!

<Title>Zero Complaints
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is always really nerve-racking for me to make these kind of purchases because half the reviews for most products say "greatest thing ever," and the other half "terrible!" But the reviews seemed pretty good for the Zen 60 gb, so I decided to order it about 8 months ago.  So far, so good. It has held up incredibly well. And the 60 gbs of space is hard to fill. I am up to 45 gb, and I have everything I could imagine wanting on it already!  The thing I like most about this player may simply be the fact that it supports so many formats. The major concern I had with getting an MP3 player (and the reason why I didn't get an Ipod) is whether or not my various video files and sound files would be difficult to get on here. And, it isn't hard at all. I have had zero problems now with the various formats of videos I download offline and whatnot, and it supports my music file of choice, WMA, perfectly. It would be cool if it supported WMA PRO, but apparently NOTHING does yet....or at least nothing I have seen.   I love the program it comes with. IT couldn't be easier. I select my music from my music folder, and load it right in. It could not be any simpler. I do not use it to compress music-- my Windows media player does a great job at that-- but I simply use the program to add files that have already been ripped onto my computer.   Battery space is very good-- I have yet to not have enough battery power for the various times I have used it. It was great when I flew to hawaii. I switched between listening to music and watching movies without running out of battery power. It seems to go about 3-4 hours on video depending on the loudness of volume. Obviously that exceeds the length of most movies.  But the other thing I would HIGHLY recommend is getting a wall plug in and car adapter. I cannot stress how nice it has been to be able to charge this in my car, from a wall, and from my computer. Basically, there is hardly ever a time when I have to worry about it running out of battery power, because I can always charge it, from anywhere. I plug it in my mp3 line on my car, and listen endlessly. When I took a major road trip with my girlfriend, I listened to (and she watched) through a couple different movies. It was awesome!  So far so good with battery power, memory, and functionability.  It looks like at 192 kbps, I can fit about 600 full length albums on here, along with about 70 vids. Hard to tell. Right now I have 440 albums at 192 kbps, and 70 vids, and I am I still have 15 gbs left.

<Title>Excelente reproductor de audio y video
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compre el Creative Zen Vision M:60gb en agosto de 2007. A enero de 2008, sigue pareciendome una excelente compra. La capacidad es desbordnte. Tengo cerca de 40 cds en mp3 (musica comprimida!!) y todas han entrado en este reproductor de musica. No he tenido inconvenientes hasta el momento. Si bien la bateria no dura como lo ofrece Creative (en musica me da 13 a 14 horas, y no 16, pero es lo de menos!!) vale bien a pena para quienes hacen largos viajes, van en autobus, o simplemente desean toda su musica en un solo dispositivo. Debido a que tenia 30gb de espacio libre luego de poner toda la musica, empece a incluirle videos, y la calidad es magnifica. No uso mucho los videos pues prefiero la musica. La seleccion de canciones, y el facil manejo del menu, es fabuloso. Loas loas loas! Lastima que no sigan vendiendo la version de 60gb. Fui afortunado de ser uno de los ultimos compradores del Creative Zen Vision M: 60gb.  Ah, y lo mejor del Ipod: Creative tiene radio. Si te gusta escuchar noticias (como a mi), bien valia su precio.

<Title>Hitting the iPod Where it Hurts... (Everyone's a Critic)
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't believe some of the poor reviews for this item based on very minor flaws. Yes... it's thicker than the iPod but does that really affect it's use or is it just a fashion statement to have the thinnest player available..? How thin does it really need to be..? And as for the interface... I really don't see the problem. There are at least three ways to navigate the Zen and one doesn't even require the Creative software to be loaded on XP...  If you want to be a fashion victim then buy an iPod. If battery life isn't an issue then choose the iPod. If you like to be controlled by software instead of the other way around then ipod and iTunes is the way to go. If sound and video quality are not your prime concern (which would be an odd thing for anyone buying a music/video player) then go for the iPod. If you really must have a player that is a fraction slimmer that the competition, then once again, I urge you to buy an iPod.   However, if you want to buy the best at what it does, if longer battery life would be of convenience, if you require the best in terms or audio and visual quality, if you wish to avoid compatibility issues with video and audio formats, if you want to transfer music and video in a familiar Windows-style navigator and if you want all this at a price lower than it's nearest rival then you must, absolutely must opt for the Creative Vision M   In addition to the features hinted at above, the Vision M also has a built in FM radio, sound recorder with integral microphone, AV out facility for watching you stored videos on TV and much much more.   Buying an iPod is an easy (lazy) choice given all the hype, but anyone wanting to make a smarter choice in personal multimedia players would be well advised to look closely at what the Vision M offers. Don't be sucked in to the iPod hysteria.   I'd owned my 60GB variant for around a month at the time of writing this review and as yet I'm struggling to find fault with the player. The control interface is excellent and probably the most intuitive of any gadget I've ever owned. Only mind control would make navigation any easier. Loading media has been a breeze with complete hassle free transfers and conversions. I can't believe anyone would want to use iTunes after experiencing the Zen Vision's PC interface.   I'm constantly disappointed these days with products that fail to live up to expectation or designs and functions that miss the point completely. However, here is a product that is spot on. Currently there is none better than the Creative Zen Vision M.   The iPod is dead... long live the Zen...

<Title>Vision:M 60GB; Above Par
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Pros: + Comes with a plastic cover the screen out of the box. I left it on because it had no bubbles. + Best Video with good amount of space. + Best Sound Quality + Great Interface, in my opinion. + Most Formats + DRM compatible +Great battery life + FM tuner, built in microphone, and can act as USB host. + Great with To-Go subscription services. For $14.99 a month, I can fill up my Vision:M (all of it) with music, legally, using Rhapsody. The next day, I can fill it up again with new content. It will never cost me more than $14.99 a month.  Cons: - Thicker than iPod (pro in my opinion, I broke a Razr before) - Must be charged on a computer, unless another cord it bought - Comes with a silly pouch, and is difficult to find a case for the 60GB Vision:M (I did find it, I purchased it from Audio-Outfitters, and will update on the quality when it arrives)  My Explinations: Having built my own computer through a lengthy process of upgrades, I have learned to thoroughly research any computer-related product over $50 before I spend my money on it. I bought a Sound Blaster audio card for my PC, and was completely impressed with the sound quality. I even invested in some speakers for my computer, although I had no prior intention of turning my computer into a multimedia machine. Lucky for Apple and Dell, not a lot of people have the desire or know-how to research technology. Dell has created half-decent computers that are available to the public. The iPod became the first widely known MP3 player, and by all means, is decent. If you are looking for something more than decent, then this is the machine for you.  Its video, although not as colorful as a PSP, was way more colorful and vibrant than an iPod. After testing all three with the same video at the same brightness, I will say the Vision:M wins because it is able to play whole movies, is the most vibrant, and the PSP requires an expensive memory card to do so. The sound quality is the best, hands down. This is expected from Creative Labs. Its interface is awesome. Having had an iRiver, used and iPod, and still owning a PSP, it is best, in my opinion. It's great. The buttons are great for selecting things. Unlike the iPod, I can pause and go to the next song without my thumbs messing with the volume. However, the volume pad in the middle makes it easy to turn it up quickly. By starting in the middle and moving it down to the bottom, it turns the volume down at a fast speed. The size is no big deal for me. It is the size of a pack of Marlboros. Although Camels are my personal favorite (and slightly smaller), the Vision:M is no way cumbersome. The multiple formats make it easy to sync. In video, it does more than just MP4s. It does AVI, MPEGs, and DivX to name a few. It plays MP3s, of course, but also WMA and WAVs. It plays all common image formats. The USB host feature also makes it possible to get the video and images off a digital camera. The only thing the Zune has on the Vision:M is the WiFi transfers, but they expire. Digital Rights Managements (DRM) makes Vision:M win. Rhapsody To Go (my personal favorite) works flawlessly with the Vision:M. iPod only works with iTunes. Zune only works with Zune Market Place... The Toshiba Gigabeat works with Rhapsody To Go, but operates with Microsoft Portable Media Center. In my experience, avoid PMC! It has great battery life. I do not know much about the batteries of other devices, but it lasts 16 hours with just music, 5 with video. Additional features: the FM tuner is a nice feature, along with the built-in microphone (which records well, by the way). As I said it can act as a USB host for cameras. A side note, the software that came with the Vision:M ripped and transferred my scratched CDs without giving me an error. They were played in a CD player before and after, both times it would get stuck and skip. Windows Media Player would say "Unable to rip" on the tracks that skip. Creative records over the part that skips, and although the quality of the scratched part is lower, it has saved me at least $60 in replacing these CDs.

<Title>Buyer Beware - False Advertising!
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased this model because it advertised the ability to record radio. This feature was missing when I opened it though. I E-Mailed customer service and the reply was "Please be informed that Creative no longer supports the FM Recording feature." It turns out after threat of lawsuit the new firmware for the 30 gig model has this feature back however for this 60 gig model the newest firmware lacks this option. If the "Record Radio" feature is important to you please contact Creative and ask them if and when this feature will be re-incorperated. For now, this feature is advertised and not available. Be warned.

<Content>This is one awesome player; my coworker with an iPod is envious of the clear display.  However, the accessories are very limited. Creative's website lists this unit as the same size as the 30GB model which is incorrect; the 60GB is about 1/8" thicker so silicone cases just don't work without mashing the buttons.  Bummer!

Please consider buying this one--I only wish it came with an even bigger hard drive--WOW!!!  I've purchased my second Zen Vision M yesterdy!!  I am truly hooked!!  I transfer my Tivo recordings to my zen and I sit back and watch extraordinary colors and sound!!!!  I've had a Dell, an iRiver, a Rio 600, Rio 800, creative nano and now the zen vision M (2).  So far it is my pick for the best player out there!! Everyone complains about scratches but to date I have none--just keep your player it the soft pouch supplied with your zen vision, you'll be fine!! I haven't tried an ipod yet--and I may never--The zen vision M is truly a WINNER in my book!!!!

<Title>*Mostly* better than an iPod, some things you should know:
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this way more than a comparable (and more expensive) iPod Video, but the player has some quirks you should know about first.  I picked this player because it has a built-in voice-recorder that I could use for interviews and to record school lectures, and the built-in FM radio receiver is a nice touch.  The Good:  The player works, sounds, and looks great, and is easy to use.  Another great thing is that it acts literally just like an external hard-drive, so you can put songs on it - or copy songs off it - very easily from any computer with a USB drive (unlike the iPod that goes out of its way to keep you from accessing your files).  You can record audio that is super long, there are FM radio pre-sets, a nice bright screen, and the controls have some very innovative features to make it easy to quickly find the album or artist you are looking for.  It also natively plays lots of popular video-formats, so if you're into downloading TV shows off the internet, you can usually watch them without having to convert anything.  The Bad:  Their software for putting songs and video on the player is just terrible, but luckily you can do it yourself with the Windows Media Player or the regular File Manager.  The FM Radio reception isn't that great, but works fine most of the time.  There are also some quirks you have to get used to:  -When listening to music, the screen won't turn off after a period of time to save battery (like the iPod) unless the player is "locked".  I hook this up to my home stereo-system all the time and always forget to lock it, then when I do, I have to fumble with the controls to un-lock it when I want to change songs or play-lists.  You don't have to lock it (and I've never had the battery die on me), but it just feels dumb to be wasting power to keep the screen brightly lit when I'm not looking at it.  -It takes some time to boot up.  I'm not sure how long exactly, probably less than ten seconds, but it is quite obnoxious when you want to listen to something and have to wait for it to start.  Once the player is on, everything else is quick (Switching between menus, loading files, etc).  -You have to adjust some of the controls to make it really work well. For example, one of the buttons comes factory-configured to make a completely random song start playing, which I see as a totally useless feature.  But with a few clicks you can easily re-program that button do anything else you want (like jump to the "now playing" window as I did, or the artist selection page or whatever).  Overall I really recommend it, but only if you are a bit nerdy and won't freak out about having to change some settings or use software other than what comes in the box.  If it's a gift for grandma, I'd say to stick with an iPod, which is meant to be super easy for anyone to use.

<Title>Amazing internal hardware, but with a casing problem
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say that the Zen Vision:M is a fantastically designed piece of equipment, as far as how good the electronics of the thing is. It can play most everything you can throw at it, especially most of the video formats used by groups puting television shows on the net. This was one of the main reasons that I bought the player (I am currently living in Korea, and the only way I can watch American television is by downloading episodes).  But there is a downside that has been present in both the 60GB model that I recently returned to Amazon as well as the 30GB model I previously had: annoying dust will get under the external plastic casing and onto the LCD inside. If you don't mind your portable media player having dust on the screen, than I guess I would still recommend this player for you, but for people like me, it will drive you insane.  Though the video playback is not as rebust and I will have to convert everything I download from the net for it, I will be going for a video iPod next, because of its better external manufacturing. I really with the Vision:M would have worked out for me, because other than that one flaw, it is a great piece of electronics.

<Title>Best Player Ever!
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This an amazing player. One of the best things that I found its the fact that you don't have to convert any file in order to import it to the player; in the case the format of the file its not handle by the player, it will be converted to a one that its handle by it.  I had a little trouble playing videos since the player hang and I had to reset the player in order to get it working again. I updated the firmware an d problem solved. I have to say that creative's web page its really useful and has a lot of articles that may help with any problem.  The resolution, the sound, the player itself its perfect. The only con that  it has its that it is a little bit thick.  I will really recommend this player, specially if you don't like ipods XD.

<Title>One serious flaw, but mostly musical heaven
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen products (I've owned the 30 GB and now the 60 GB version) feature powerful amps that can give a world-rocking sound experience, especially in combination with Bose headphones.  I love the ability to hear my music even on a noisy airplane at 30,000 feet.  Crying babies and turbulence announcements can be drowned out and replaced by "musical heaven."    I chose Zen because I wanted a player free of most proprietary constraints.  There are a few companies in the world who are not above taking advantage of their popularity to achieve increased prices.  While I envy them, I also do not want to part with my own money quite so easily.  The Zen works with Windows Media Player, so pretty much any song you can play with that program will also play on your Zen.    The biggest flaw: no easy control to allow fast-forward or fast-rewind to the next or prior song on a playlist.  So many times I wanted this function but it is a cumbersome multi-click and menu-driven process.  It should be a button or two, just like every other music system I have ever owned. (Duh.)

<Title>Great at first, but wait till it needs fixing
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Creative Zen Vision:M at the beginning of the year, in about March.  I was loving it, it was working great.  The sound quality was fantastic, it was easy to use, and it was awesome.  UNTIL!...  Only six months later, the player suddenly ceased being recognized by my computer...or ANY computer, for that matter.  Even the Zen's own software wouldn't recognize it.  I did everything possible to get it back up and running, but in the end the only option I had was to send it in for repairs, and thereby lose TWO THOUSAND SONGS in the process!  So a music library that took me months to put together was gone in one fell swoop, fed to the void.  I am sorry, but a product that only lasts SIX MONTHS before it has to be refurbished is a terrible product.  I shouldn't have to rebuild my library every few months or so.  And I feel that my $400 was completely wasted.  I spent less than that on my whole computer, and it's never lost all my data before, or come even close.  Not only that, but the customer service reps were incredibly rude, completely unhelpful, and they CHARGED me for being rude and unhelpful!  I am never buying a Creative Labs product again, it's just not worth it.  Stick to the bigger names, they at least can afford to make their customers happy.

<Content>This is my 2nd creative MP3 player (the 1st one being Nomad Zen Xtra 30GB - which I still love and use BTW). I was already impressed with creative MP3 players before I even bought this one, and this one did not disappoint me at all. My 1st player still is in working condition, and the reason I bought a second one was the color screen. Creative products (MP3 players, speaker systems, sound cards etc) will always have the best sound quality in the same class - bar none. This player has very good battery life and amazing sound quality - two most important things for any MP3 player. Plus, its screen resolution is much better than any other player out there. When you combine all the great features with its comparably low price, its an absolute no-brainer. It will be very difficult for Apple/Microsoft/Toshiba to lure me away from Creative any time soon.

<Title>What warranty?
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Three months after purchasing my Zen Vision:M 60Gb I have little good to say about it.  The lauded 18 hours of play time per charge was actually less than eight.  After three months I plugged it into my five month old laptop (as I usually do for charging and adding music) and they both fried.  The computer got a new motherboard, the Zen support website gave me a headache.  Before the headache and the usual lost time dealing with web-tech was over I was charged 25 bucks plus postage to return the Zen for repairs.  If the MP3 player hadn't been so expensive I wouldn't have bothered.  What happens when it breaks again and my computer isn't under warranty?  How much will it cost to replace the Creative device the next time?  It seems to me just about everything these days comes with at least a one year warranty (or commonly two years).  Does this company already know its product line is garbage?  Is this a joke?  I bought the Zen Vision:M by reading the reviews.  Were they all written by the creative company?  With the reviews I have since read by other dissatisfied Creative customers I have to agree.  I will never buy another Creative product.  Why would I when there are so many other manufactures out there willing to back up what they build with a no hassle replacement.  Best of luck in choosing an MP3 player.  Ipod isn't sounding so bad after all.

<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 2 of these less than a year ago, one for myself and one for my husband because it seemed like the best non-Ipod product available. Was very happy initially although both tended to freeze up at times and required resetting.  First one and then the other have subsequently stopped being recognized by my computer, which on further searching seems to be a fairly common problem.  So you can't upload anything else. Ever. Of course they are no longer warrantied and Creative support is poor.  See other posts on amazon.  Save your $ and buy something else.

<Title>If they had a 6 star rating, I'd give it a 7.
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've toyed around with the Ipod video and this little gadget.  The zen M is a little bulkier, but not by much.  The resolutions is great, and the sound is even better.  I primarily use it to store music videos and it works great with my mobile video.  I even used it at a party with a big screen tv, and it turned out perfect.  The one thing I wished was on here was a random switch/button/something for the videos.  Like I said before, I use this for music videos, and to have to select a new video every song is a pain, but I haven't seen a portable media player with that feature to date.  I'm not anti Ipod or pro Creative, but if you are, you should go with your choice respectively.  This is a great little machine for the price.  Just as a heads up, I've had this for about 6 months now, so I've had a chance to get used to it.

<Title>Napster Compatible and Great Storage
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player, though not one of the most widely publicized players of this day and age, has features that can compete any day with other players. The 60 gig  hard drive is more than enough to put full length movies and thousands of songs on! Its syncability with napster makes this the perfect player for me! I previously had an Ipod... and will never go back after experiencing the innovation of this Creative product.   I was worried that watching movies and videos on the small screen would be hard, but the awesome resolution puts no strain on your eyes... and even though the menu control buttons are different, they are easy to master and provide for some features that blow the Ipod away!  I highly recommend this product... and its a MUST HAVE if you are a napster subscriber...   If you have problems getting it to sync at first, dont worry... just look in then napster forums and theyll tell you how to fix it... they got it working for me...

<Title>The best mp3 player out there
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The screen is fantastic, the sound is great, and the battery life is stupendous.  The only drawback is the interface.  While it is certainly not a product killer, it can be annoying at times.  The pad seems to be a little finicky for responsiveness at times.  Adjusting the sensitivity can make this a marginal problem though.  Overall, I am extremely happy with this player.  It beats the iPod hands down.  The DivX compatibility makes it great for movie playback.  You don't have to convert file formats just to watch your collection.  If the player can't play the file, there is a built in converter in the sync manager.  Creative has made the best mp3 player on the market as far as I am concerned.  Way to go Creative!

<Title>great machine
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>after my ipod died I decided to look around for alternatives. I'm sorry, i don't feel like I should need to replace my mp3 player every 2 years. I am surprised there isn't a lawsuit about the longevity issues with the ipod.. cause it is a big issue. Hopefully this holds up better.! At first I wasn't too fond of the navigation, but now that i'm used to it, it is great.. The sounds is so superior and the screen.. wow.. it is a beauty!! the battery lasts forever too. Oonly bummer right now is i'm having troubles finding a protective case to fit the 60 GB model. Buy this and you won't be disappointed!

<Content>The player worked fine for about three weeks after Christmas, when it was activated into use, then suddenly the screen became blurred and was unuseable after that.  I am currentlly in the process of getting it exchanged, since the tech support could not get it reset/restarted and working properly.  The process has been somewhat cumbersome to get satisfaction from the company.

<Title>Fine Player - Terrible Software
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Many reviewers have commented on the fine points of this player. I agree with them. It is a beautiful player with outstanding music reproduction; with a decent pair of headphones few could complain. Musical pieces I have been familiar with for years, are now surprising and fresh.  I write, therefore, with hesitation, to register a complaint. The software that comes with the Zen M is dreadful. With any player of this kind one asks that there should be easy ways first, to organise, and second, to transfer music to the player; in addition there should be an easy way to create playlists - after all with 60gb one can put literally hundreds of CDs on this player - and it is important to be able to organise the music in ways which facilitate easy recognition and playing.   Creative, unlike its competition, supplies software that is torture to work with. It is, first of all, very difficult to use the software to organise music on one's computer hard drive in such a way that when it is transferred to the player, you know what it is. I have had an education these last two weeks on the intricacies of ID tags and have had to relabel the identifying "tags" on dozens of CDs. This isn't Creative's problem, of course, but I defy anyone to use Creative's software to help in this task. Then, after transferring the music one discovers that similarly labelled tracks get dropped. If, for instance, the second movement of a Mozart piano concerto, played by say, Ashkenazy and Perahia, are labelled in the same way, then you will lose one of them! Next, if one wishes to make a playlist- say putting 20  tracks of Beatles music together - and then get the player to recognise this playlist, chances are very high that in using Creative's software, you will duplicate the tracks on your little player. This causes substantial problems if you then want to play the original album from which some of the tracks were drawn,  as many tracks will repeat! The Enigma Variations thus become truly enigmatic. In short, the music on the player  gets bloated, and the system of organising the music breaks down comprehensively. (I report only some of the difficulties.)  Needless to say, the documentation and official website meant to explain how to deal with these difficulties are of very little help.   One is driven, in these circumstances, to search the web for alternatives to Creative's software and, to be sure, one can find many good suggestions. But be prepared to put in long long hours - for good advice is not always easy to find as it is often buried in somewhat obscure posts in specialised Forums; and, if you take the advice, be prepared to put in the hours of experimentation to get your music onto the player in a way you recognise it as such. The most important piece of advice is to dump Creatives's software and use instead a fine music organiser and synchroniser which goes under the odd name of Media Monkey. But even the latter cannot perform miracles, and playlist creation as well as transfer of album art remain problems.  Interestingly enough, as one reads the posts on various Fora, these complaints are widespread, as is the frustration. Especially as the player itself is such a marvel. Creative, however, is acquiring a reputation of being singularly unresponsive to the complaints of its clientele. What a shame!

<Title>Great player - NO ACCESSORIES
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player for all the great reviews it has been getting. BUT ... BUYER BEWARE - this is an ipod dominated market.  THERE ARE NO ACCESSORIES FOR THIS PLAYER.  Think you will find a good all-in-one fm transmitter/car charger - think again.  I have been searching for days and although there are transmitters with USB ports for charging, the FM tranmitters on these products suck.  This does not seem to be a problem for ipods since the best products are made specifically for ipods.  So I have to buy the fm transmitter and charger separately and if the battery runs out I have to unplug my transmitter to plug in my player so I can't listen to music anymore until the stupid thing is charged.  The same is true for in-car stereos.  Many have inputs/chargers for ipods but none have this for other players.  There is also an issue with finding cases for this model because it is thicker than the 30gb.  Hopefully as the popularity of this brand increases so will the supply of accessories to go with it.  At present though, I am really begining to regret my decision to get this player rather than an ipod.

<Title>The real ipod killer
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So much has been made of the Zune, which was supposed to be able to take on Apple's popular ipod that almost nobody noticed this little gem hiding in the background. As I began my search for the ultimate awesome media player, my choices came down to the 80GB video iPod, or the 60GB Creative Zen Vision M. After nearly a month of weighing pros and cons, I decided to go with the Zen, and I have not regretted a minute of it!  I have compared my new toy with the video iPods of friends and I can honestly say that the screen is nearly twice as sharp and full of color than the ipod. The touchpad take a bit of adjustment, but within a day or two I was zipping around easily, as easily as the ipod's clickwheel.   The device is fully customizable. You can add any picture you can upload as a wallpaper, customize themes, create playlists and display album art. You can search by album art (or just album), artist, genre or have the player select a random album for you. The player can be instructed to play complete random, all the songs in a randomly picked album, only songs that you play frequently, or songs that you have not heard in a while.  The voice recorder also comes in handy, making recording my classes a snap. The sound quality is perfectly acceptable for what I use it for. The radio is a nice feature too, also lacking on ipods. You can have the device autoscan for radio stations and set them as presets, or you can manually set the presets yourself.  But above and beyond is the video playback. I was pleasantly astounded at the quality of the movies played ont he tiny screen, as well as how sharp the video outputted to the tv was! The Zen can handle nearly every video format you'd run across on a regular basis. Unlike the ipod which require videos to be converted into a format playable by the ipod, the Zen will play mpegs, DivX, Xvid and WMV without conversion. But what sold me on the device was it's ability to play .tivo files. Since I work alot, I don't often have time to watch the things my tivo records. I wanted a device I could drop my recorded programs on and take with me on the go.  If you own a tivo series 2 or above, you can use the tivo-to-go feature to rip the shows from your tivo to your computer. Using Windows Media Player 10 or above, you can sync the shows to your devices and take them with you! Add the optional AV cable and output your video, music or slideshows to the nearest tv for all to see.  The only downside to the device is the frustrating lack of accessories for it, although several cases and other accessories ARE out there, you just have to search a bit. Some people might find the device to be a bit thick, compared to the ipod, but I find it fits very comfortably in my hand and pocket with no bulging.  All in all, I think it's fair to say that this is the device that could seriously take on the Goliath of the iPod. Zune, Sansas, and many others don't even come close. And it's so awesome to be able to tell people who ask "what kind of iPod is that?", that it is the device that will leave thier ipods in the dust! Nothing more satisfying that pointing out all the features and coll bits on this thing (especially the screen and video playback) to people who spent the same amount (actually a  bit more) for a video ipod.

<Title>great player
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pro: This is a great mp3 player and is very compatible and easy to use.  There are so many features that is packed into this machine that you know you are definitely getting your money's worth.  Pictures, video, music and an av output so u can play it on your tv.  Charge time with an av adapter is about 1hour from empty to full, about 5 with the usb cable that's included.  I found out that the psp charger fits just right if you already have a psp.  Con: The device is rather bulky but is alright if u just want to carry it around in your pocket.  Its not very good if u wanna work out or something like that.  I got the 60gb player and had a lot of trouble getting a skin for it.  Most skins are only available for the 30gb device.  Also, not compatible with mp4 (very dissappointing).  Conclusion:  Great device if you wear loose clothing (so you can leave the player in your pocket).

<Title>Mediocre Product, Terrible Customer Service
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the player as a Christmas gift and was excited to have it.  Unfortunately, owning the product has been a terrible experience.   The product itself, for the literally two days that it worked properly, was OK.  Nothing special in comparison to my previous players, but not bad.  Sleek design, OK battery life, good screen size, and relatively easy to navigate (although not entirely intuitive).  There were a few minor hiccups in downloading music via Windows Mediaplayer, but no deal breakers.  So far, not bad. Two days after I received it, my player suddenly would no longer sync up with my computer.  Wouldn't charge over the USB and wouldn't upload any music from my computer.  After a week's worth of back and forth with customer service, Creative finally concluded that the product was defective and agreed to send me a new one.  If only it were that easy.  After being instructed to ship back my defective player in its box with its accessories and after waiting about week, I received my new, operable player in the mail from Creative.  In theory.  In fact, I received a completely different (and incorrect) model player, on its own, w/o headphones, USB cable, box, or an other accessory.  I called up Creative, informed them of their mistake, and was told that they would ship the correct player to me that day.  Two days later, I called back to see if it had shipped.  It had not, and was not scheduled to ship for several more days.  Good thing it hadn't shipped, actually; they told me that, their mistake, they had planned to send me the incorrect player, again.  After being assured from a supervisor that the correct player would, indeed, ship that day, I waited.  It didn't ship that day.  When I finally did receive the package more than a week later, I opened it to find... the wrong player.  Again.  Now, after fighting for them for more than a month, I have the wrong player (after two attempts) and they arrogantly refuse to give me a refund.  I don't need this.  I resisted an IPod for a while, although right now, I couldn't tell you why.  What I can tell you is that I'm done with this product and done with this company.  Avoid - the marginal (at best) upside is not worth the hassle.

<Title>A Good Choice For The Right People
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I shopped around a lot before buying this player, and it was difficult for me due to the fact that almost every review is extremely biased. iPod fanatics insist that their favored product is far superior, while Creative fanboys tend to do the same.  I, for one, do not think that neither the zen nor the ipod come out as a clear victor, but are simply two good players that will be right for a person depending on what they want to get out of it.  The Zen, to me, has advantages. For one, the video out port on the charging adapter is excellent. The picture looks great on my HD, and has essentially replaced my dvd player due to convenience.  Furthermore, I'm enjoying my xvid encoded movies far more easily. Those of you familiar with getting videos on the internet will know how ubiquitous the xvid and divx codecs are, and it turns out to be a very nice feature when combined with the video output of the zen.  My experience with ipod video on televisions has not been nearly as enjoyable.  The equalizer remains another preferable feature for me to choose the zen.  The lack of an equalizer on the ipod puzzles me, as one would imagine an 80 GB player is meant for the market of the more audio-savvy among us, who care enough to change the audio settings of our music.    I know this is not a critical factor, but I for one enjoy the ability to customize the background of my player.  Its nice knowing that I can just throw on any picture of my whim and utilize it as a wallpaper for my player.  The ipod outdoes the zen in terms of storage, size, and the ability to play games.  I admit that I would prefer a thinner player, though the thickness is the zen is not so severe that I cannot easily slide it in my pocket.  The ipod does offer an extra 20 gb on their player, but one must also pay for the extra storage, it is a more pricey player.  Games are a nice feature, but as far as I'm concerned, it is not something to complain about a lack of; this is a music player.  The aesthetics and interfaces of the two players are equally nice as far as I'm concerned.  As far as durability the reviews that I've read seem to imply that the Zen scratches more, but I've kept mine naked (I left the sticker on the screen from when I got it, and leave it in the included pouch when I'm not using it...purchased a podskin and an invisishield but decided not to employ either) and it is fine.  People must treat their pmp's quite brutally, because I have seen nary a scratch on my player in the approximate six months that I've owned it.  My cohorts' ipods all seem to have taken more wear than my zen, especially on that shiny chrome back.  Is the Zen a good player? Yes. Is the ipod a good player? Yes. Pick what fits your needs, and you will be most satisfied. I would give this product a 4.5 more accurately, simply knocking off a half point wishing that the Thin Model 60gb zen was in America, which is the same thickness as the 30gb one.  Everything else on the player works great.

<Content>I looked at ipods that friends own and didn't care for them. When I used the Vision M for the first time I loved it. It is easy to use and the software that comes with it is also easy to use. The sound that the Vision produces is great. It is loud enough even when mowing grass. Be careful though because it will go real loud!! The only drawback I see so far is the black case shows finger prints. Buy the Vision M and have fun. It is a great product!

I recently repaired a friends ipod and trying to get music onto it were a hassle to say the least.  With the Zen Vision you click and drag your music into the folder and you're ready to go!  it's a great player.  thanks for reading

Voice recorder, plays multiple auidio/video formats without restrictions like the Ipod has... and gives you the ability to partition the hard drive for PC usability... translation:  If you want, you can make this into a 1GB mp3 player, 59 GB USB Drive!  Which means you can store any type of information on this for transfers between PCs.  Regular 4GB and up USB drives cost a few hundred dollars, so this is definately an added benefit.  You can sync with Outlook, and have your appointments, tasks, and contacts sync'ed.  ... Awesome!  :)  Enjoy!

<Title>Great player, but has a few minor issues.
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I want to start off this review by saying that this player is awesome. The screen is crystal clear, the text is easy to read, and navigation is a snap. If the videos on your computer are any kind of decent quality, they will be the same quality on the player. Plays the most common formats, and comes bundled with a converter for the file types it WON'T play.  That's the good, now for the bad. I'm not sure if this is isolated to my computer, but I want to throw it out there as a possibility: when using the Zen Media Explorer software (Comes bundled. Easiest to sync to the player with.) The "close" button on the window won't work, and I can't navigate to a different location. Not that big of a problem, just use Ctrl+alt+delete to open the task manager and end the task. It's just annoying. Other than that, I haven't had a single problem with the player.  The conclusion: With a 60GB hard drive, easy navigation, and format compatibility, this is definitely a good substitute for an I-pod, which always earns points in my book.

<Content>I've had my Zen for about a month now, have had a chance to upload my entire music library to it, and to put about 10 movies on it as well.  This thing is slick.  The screen is gorgeous, the battery life is excellent, and the controls are fairly intuitive-- just make sure you set the touch pad to your liking, as it can get a little difficult to control if it is too sensitive for you.  All in all, my experience with the Zen Vision:M has been great.  For those of you looking for something comparable to the ipod, but without itunes and other such nuisances, this is it.

<Title>Zen Vision: M is better than iPod
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Vision: M is definitely the best mp3 player available. The only problem (and a cosmetic one, really) is that the 60 GB version is a little thick. Maybe I should have gotten the 30GB one, but I am just now (I've had it for a month, now) putting a lot of CDs on it, and I think I may want all that space, ridiculous as it seems.  Pros Good sound quality and strength. Plenty of space (not flash memory; actual harddisk) Good features (radio, voice recorder, video playback) Many supported formats (although it's not really a problem to convert with the included software) Well-customizable UI (differently colored menu bars, custom background image)  Cons Sometimes freezes, requiring use of the reset button. Slight high whine on voice recordings (This may be just mine, but I'm reluctant to ask about it or send it in, now that I have so much stuff on it.) Somewhat vague battery meter (not much of a con).  The radio recording feature that used to be available on the 30GB version was removed with a firmware update, and new versions of that player will probably not have that capability, but there's always the chance that it can be restored with a future firmware update. It was never advertised for the 60GB version, but that's possible, too.  It's also possible (in fact, more so than with the radio recording) that the problems with hanging and freeze-ups will be fixed with firmware updates.  As a hint, the freeze-ups seem to occur when one tries to view pictures that are corrupted, or not fully downloaded from internet sources (solely a dial-up phenomenon).

<Title>Better than Ipod
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A few people have made a big deal about the fact that this player is thicker than the ipod. Yes it is but so what? It has an excellent battery life and holds 60 gig which I have yet to fill, even though I have 12 movies and about 30 Gig of music on it.  The fact that it accepts .avi files as is with no conversion should be imitated by all MP3/Video players. It will refuse certain audio codecs in .avi format but most are ok. The refused ones can be converted to acceptable codecs using VurtualDub. Ipod doesn't accept any .avi files without a lengthy conversion.  Cons: Many of the accessories are quite expensive unless you seek them out at Ebay where they are in the $3-$5 range.  The major dislike I have is that selection of cases specific to the M60 is VERY limited.  I got an ugly silicon one which I paid about $15 for because I wanted to be sure of fit.  However the silicon case does protect the player quite well. There are other cases at Ebay for about $5 but they don't specifically state that they fit the 60 Gig model.  If you require a leather case you are out of luck.  The plug on is proprietary and though it looks the same as Ipod's I have been warned that it is different and that using Ipod charging/playing stands will burn out the unit.  The selection of charging stands for the M60 is very limited.  It is also annoying that Creative hasn't seen fit to support album artwork very well. Some artwork uploads while others don't and there is no way to see it in larger, more detailed size.

I dont think i even have a complaint.... hmm the touch pad is a little odd when u fist use it but after like an hour it becomes natural. The sound quality is xilent! as far as i know the wmv format is much smaller than the mpeg video format so you could have the same size players and the zen would be abble to hold more than the ipod (video). I personaly already have all my music (only like 150-200 songs right now), star wars (ep3) and full metal jackt on mine and ive only used 1.8 gigs! in mpeg format the videos were at least twice the size as wmv. Oh one bag thing is it doesnt seem to suport .gif images, but as far as i know it converts them.

<Title>COOLEST MP3 PLAYER AROUND?
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What can I say? I've owned a few Creative products and I've never been dissapointed. This thing is a jewel in its class. There's nothing bad about it. Even the fact of being thicker than an Ipod doesn't bother me at all, as it feels sturdy and quality in my hands. The only thing I wasn't super happy about is the sound. It's great, hey, don't get me wrong, but I got so used to the blasting bass sound that the good old iRiver H-120 has provided me for almost 4 years, that it is now hard to find a match in this field (SOUND QUALITY AND POWER), but anyway I can say the Creative Zen "does the job" more than decently. Ipod was the only mp3 I listened to that matched the overall sound quality that iRiver has, and I'd dare to say it even sounded a tiny bit better. I'd put the Zen on third place in the "Sound Rating chart". All tested with a decent pair of Sony MDR-EX81 earphones.

<Title>The Best Choice of all PVPs and PMPs
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Zen M Vision 60 GB is perhaps the best buy amongst video and music players.  Although very similar to it's smaller sibling (the 30 GB version) is only 0.2 inches thicker with same height, width, controls and screen.  The additional 30 GB allows double the amount of music, movies, pictures, etc as well as to backup the entire content of a typical computer (up to 16 GB).  I have had mine for two months and before, had a Zen M 30.  Also tried the Archos 504 and a Sansa for less than a week each.       Zen's M 2.5 inche display is the best in its class for resolution, contrast and illumination in a size that balances battery power and performance.  Unlike the Archos four inch screen, Zen's screen dims itself when being used as a radio or music player.  As a video player, the screen goes black (obviously).  Movies, photos & videos can be watched in any type of lighting environment on the Zen's display.    Controls are located on the front face and once you get used to, you'll see the logic that Creative had when designing them.  These are brightly illuminated in soft blue and sensitivity is adjustable trough the settings.   The headphone jack is conveniently located on the right side of the top of the unit next to the on/off switch.  The Sync Adapter, although controversial for some, has many advantages such as capability of direct connection to a charger and at the same time, output for a TV or monitor.  It also has the connection for  the usual USB-2.0 port.       Creative's software is sufficient for music recording.  If you want to transfer DVDs to your Zen, you'll need additional software which is readily available for free on the internet.  Of these, the most useful is Iriverter (plus the necessary music & video codecs).  Videos look surprisingly good even at its native minimum resolution (320 X 240).  You will see no ghost effect or pixilation.  Titles and subtitles look sharp and bright.  Battery life as a music player averages 14 hours which is enough for two days of listening to your favorite albums while at work.  As a video player, battery life decreases considerable to four hours; about two movies.  Although this number make look low, for purposes of comparison, the Archos battery life was from 8-10 hours on music mode and less than two hours as a video player.    Overall, Creative is offering an amazing product at a reasonable price that not only has all the features stated above but has also a recording mode, an FM Radio, synchronizes your computer calendar and allows you customization of music files by artist, title, genre, etc.  Has anyone mentioned compatibility and synchronization with Amazon's Unbox?    Thanks Creative...

<Title>Way better than iPod!
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For Christmas I received an 80 GB iPod.  After about a month of fighting with it to do what I did very simply with a Dell Digital Jukebox I finally gave up and returned it.  I have an extremely large music collection so I began to search again for the biggest player out there.    The Creative Labs Zen Vision: M fit the bill perfectly for what I was looking for: large hard drive and easy to use features.  I would have preferred an 80 GB if not larger but I'm fine with 20 GB's less to be rid of the iPod.    Features of the Creative Zen are really what sets this apart from the competition.  The color screen does a great job of showing not only the track name and artist but also the cover of the album itself.  If you can see the button in the upper left hand corner below the screen, this button is for randomly choosing the album of the day.  This is a nice feature for those that want to listen to something different but really don't know what.  The touch pad is MUCH easier to use than the iPod circular touch pad.  The iPod touch control was very difficult to control - especially when trying to select an artist a ways down the alphabet.  With the Creative Zen all you have to do is hit the button on the right side of the touch pad to move the cursor to the alphabet and then just use your thumb to move down the alphabet.  Another great feature is the "add to selected" feature.  While it may be available on the iPod, I could never find it - despite reading the manual.  This makes adding various songs, albums or even artists to the now playing extremely easy.  As a nice side feature once you're finished your only about 3 clicks away from saving it as a playlist if you choose.    There are quite a few other great features but I think the point has been made.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  [...]

<Title>software issues - buyer beware!
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to have a Zen Micro and loved it. Just got the vision 60GB for my birthday. It took almost 8 hours to fully charge. Once it did, it was fine and I transferred my music onto it.       The very next day, Windows XP says it doesn't recognize the hardware. In the past 2 days I and my husband have spent over 13 1/2 hours trying to fix in incompatibility. I've gone through pages of creative forum boards help tips, installed drivers, reinstalled patches and upgrades, and done everything Creative help desk has said to do numerous times. My systems and memory meet all the requirements.       Nothing has worked, and it looks like I'm out almost $300 unless Amazon will let me swap for another one. I've downloaded, uninstalled/reinstalled so much junk for my computer as suggested by all sources I've researched - that now my computer is so messed up I will need to bring it to a professional to try to wipe clean and start from scratch b/c I don't know how to do that myself.       I begged my husband for a year to buy me this product, and now I'm very sorry that I did.
