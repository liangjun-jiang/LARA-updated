<Title>Excellent player...
<Date>Mon Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is truly an excellent player and a great value for money. The player is very pleasant to look at and seems much more aesthetically pleasing to the eye than the USB 2 version. The flip-type case coming with the player is very smart looking- it does have a flaw in that with the case fully closed, one cannot see the LCD screen. I feel that creative should have thought about this and made a slot for the LCD to peer through. The sound quality is EXCELLENT. However, you would need to get new headphones. The ones coming with the player dont do it justice. The player has the same EAX options as the USB 2. One of the biggest improvements is the software. The creative mediasource was a joy to use. The software was able to recognize the ID tags automatically and list each track by its respective title, artist, album, genre etc... This was a major flaw in the playcenter software. The transfer from the PC to zen was flawless. I was really happy with this pleasant improvement. The battery life is amazing too. I am getting around 12-13 hours with one charge. And of course the battery is user replaceable- a huge bonus. Eventually plan to get another battery for those long trips where u cannot charge. However 12 hours should more than suffice for a trip or your daily needs. All in all i think its a great buy and i am nothing short of very happy with the purchase...

<Content>For the money this player is the best available. Great Sound but get better headphones for it. You'll see why when u do. The software however was not as good as the hardware. The creative media source takes too long to download songs to the player. I recommend the notmad explorer instead. Transfers the song faster better interface (adds your jukebox in the windows explorer). Great buy overall

<Title>Incredible sound with a great pricetag!
<Date>Tue Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the Nomad Zen NX fully expecting to return it and buy an iPod. I was having a discussion about the two players with a friend and he suggested that I buy the Zen NX. At $200 less than the iPod, I was skeptical but bought it knowing that if I didn't like it, I could always return it. I have to say that he was right! The Nomad Zen NX boasts incredible sound quality (remarkably better that the iPod), a replaceable lithium-ion battery and a stylish look, though not as sleek as the iPod. The sizes and weights of the two are quite comparable.<p>However, I do have a few reservations... I don't like that all the controls are on the sides. There are none on the face of the player. This makes it especially difficult to navigate with one hand.<p>The scroller/button is a nice navigation tool, but you have to press it dead-on to be able to select the items you are shooting for.<p>The bundled software is a pain to deal with especially if you are dealing with a huge MP3 library that you already own. It's all good if your MP3 tags are correct to begin with, but if not, you are in for hours of tedious tag editing. Because the player uses these tags to sort your files into albums. (Save yourself some time, buy a copy of Notmad from Red Chair Software.)<p>The bundled earbuds are a joke as with any other player on the market. Buy good earphones to experience the true quality of this device.<p>The included case is nice, but it's annoying that it covers the LCD screen.<p>I have owned another hard drive based player and liked that it had a drag and drop interface. Each folder became an album. Not so on the Nomad. It would be nice if this was a fix in future versions of the firmware.<p>My advice? If you are looking for superior sound quality, buy the Creative Nomad Zen NX. If you are looking for something more sleek and curvaceous with a super-expensive Apple logo, buy the iPod.

<Title>Excellent player / Mediocre software
<Date>Wed Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I am quite tech-savvy and spent hours researching which player to buy.  In the end, my two choices were the iPod and the Nomad Jukebox Zen NX (30GB).  Size- and weight-wise the two players are almost identical.  Capacity-wise, both give you varied options.  Price-wise, however, Apple just makes absolutely no sense.  For $$$$ less, I bought the Nomad and boy am I pleased!  The player is OUTSTANDING -- superior sound, great capacity, sleak design, light, nice faux-leather cover, and an exchangeable battery, which is key!  The only downsides were: 1) The earphones that come with the player are crap, but for under $$$ you can buy great ones from any top brand, and 2) the software.<p>The Creative MediaSource performs well in basic uploading of files to your player, but it does a terrible job with maintaining tag information.  Since I have a huge library, that means either manually editing hundreds of tags or ditching the software completely.  I'm going with plan B!<p>Besides that, however, I recommend the player over the iPod anyday!  Whoever priced the iPod was out of his mind!

<Title>Excellent Value, Excellent Player
<Date>Sun Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is my first mp3 player purchase.  I had toyed around with an iPod at an electronics store and was almost sold on it.  It was just so cool.  But after thinking things over I decided it wasn't worth the price.  So I started looking into the Zen.  I was close to buying it when the Zen NX was announced, so I held out for it.  I am sure glad I did!  I was able to buy it for less than $300, but even for that it's an incredible deal.  30GB, incredible sound (according to professional reviewers it has the best sound of any mp3 player, including the iPod), well-designed navigation, and cool EAX features.  Unlike some people, I didn't have any problem at all with the software it comes with.  However, I had ripped all my software beforehand with other programs, so my ID3 tags and everything were all set.  I only used Creative's program to upload them to my Zen.  My only complaint with the player is the scroll wheel is a little hard to click.  While the screen is small, it's sharp and easy to read and navigate.  In short, this is the best bang for the buck.  It's a good, convenient size, feels solid, comes with plenty of space for mp3s, sounds awesome, and is relatively stylish as well!  Highly recommended for buyers unwilling to waste extra money on style (iPod).

<Title>The only affordable, quality MP3 player on the market.
<Date>Sun Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Why Nomad?<br><br>Like most, I was introduced to mp3 players by my friend with an iPod. My excitement was quickly crushed when I learned of the ridiculous price tag. This was nothing new to me, however, as I'm familiar with computers and know of Apple's legendary price inflation on virtually all their products - a business model that has, and will continue to condemn them to the margins of any market they do business in.<br>In fact, my decision to purchase the Nomad Zen NX was a result of the now-familiar decision making process that most made in the past years regarding Apple computers - although the apple product is in some ways superior, its simply not worth the disproportionately high pricetag. As with their PowerMacs, I simply can NOT justify paying more for less power - I have here a 30GB mp3 player that costs LESS than Apple's 15G player.<p>About the Nomad?<br><br>The Nomad, quite frankly, is more stylish to me than Apple's iPod - but that's maybe because I never got into their all-white aesthetic. The Nomad's audio output strength is simply excellent and the sound quality is superb. Where the Nomad is beaten by the iPod is in the menu system, where the Nomad is a little too heirachical, that is, having to go through levels of menus. However, it's not at all &quot;Bad&quot;, just not as elegant as the iPod. Overall, however, the unit is excellent, and to me is an ideal player - relatively inexpensive, durable (replaceable battery!), stylish, and with quality sound!

<Title>Brilliant Product
<Date>Tue Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had the Nomad Jukebox Zen NX for about 6 hours now, and quite frankly I'm pleased. After hearing from my brother &quot;you know what mp3 player you have to get, the iPod&quot; I saw this one at Best Buy, along with the over-priced iPod, and thought it was a good looking.  I've already had much trust in Creative because I have a set of computer speakers by them, and they're incredible.  <p>I do have three complaints about this product. The first which has already been listed, the scroll button on the side.  I anticipated this going out, so I bought the 2-yr. warranty. Secondly, the first time I turned my Nomad on after charging.  it froze up on me, and I had to reset it.  I'm not sure if that'll happen again. And lastly, the blasted case with no opening in front for the screen.<p>Otherwise, this product is amazing thus far.  I highly recommend.

<Title>New Paradigm in portable tunes
<Date>Sat Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>It's got a good beat and it's easy to listen to barely describes this wonderful little machine.  Setting it up takes about an hour and is somewhat confusing but I was ripping CD's with ease in no time.  Other reviewers are correct on the software but I found it useable and functional.  I was able to intuitively grasp the functions without the manual.  After reading tha manual, the rest became clear.  This device does push your PC.  Quite a resource hog.  Keep an eye on the requirements and get what you need before installing.  By plugging in the USB cable, you become another device and are able to see and manipulate the songs.  Quality is outstanding, but only when recording at the higher bit rates.  I finally settled on 224K after ripping about 8 hours worth of CD's.  I erased everything and started over.  I figure I'll get about 3,000 songs instead of the 4,000 at 128K (default).  That's still plenty, believe me.  The &quot;jog&quot; wheel needs to be either beefed up or redesigned.  When building playlists on the fly, your thumb gets sore and the wheel needs to be pushed &quot;hard&quot; to accept your choice.  The ease of taking 800 hours of music with you and playing any song or album in any order far outweighs any negative points.  Get an extra battery!  About the size of a casette walkman but half the thickness.  Heavy though!

<Title>Good Bang for buck!
<Date>Sat Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My three options were to wait for the Rio Karma, the Iriver HD or spend scary money on the IPOD. I needed more than 20G which ruled out the Iriver and as far as the Karma goes, it's expensive, thick, has taken forever to come out and they've got bugs, so I took the creative route and went with the NX. The reason being the quality of sound. After comparing the IPOD to the NX, the sound quality of the NX is far better sounding using Sennheiser PX-200 phones. The replaceable battery is a nice addition and I'm averaging 12-14 hours of battery time. The ipod my sister uses has about 6-7 hours of usage between charges at the most. Yes, the new IPOD is noticeably smaller, but I care about the sound more than the look and the IPOD just didn't do it for me ( distortion, terrible equalizer, 60W compared to the NX's 100W ). Also, the NX you would think is a brick, but it's only 1 1/2 ounces heavier than the IPOD and still looks tiny in my eyes. The biggest attraction was the price and for 30G's, I think I got a good deal especially with the added 3 year warranty I purchased. Negatives are crummy headphones that come with the unit (Don't even bother using them), the Mediasource software ( I purchased Notmad which is brilliant ), the smaller screen, and the case provided which doesn't have a window to view. Small downsides to a solid unit that if stays reliable I won't have any complaints with whatever else comes out. Just think you've got your entire music collection with you no matter where you go. That's brilliant!

<Title>Bad for data, good for music
<Date>Wed Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got this a couple of weeks ago after returning the archos 20mb jukebox. Kudos for amazon in being helpful in the returning process. Anyways, as of what I have seen of my new player, it is very pretty and seems to work good. I dont like that the comp doesn't recognize it as an external drive, so I could use it for data transfer easily, but as for the music it sounds good. I like the 8mb buffer, and the long battery life. The design is sleek, but I don't care about that, only function. All in all, it was a good buy, but keep in mind what you want a hd player for.

<Title>Great Player and Easy to Use
<Date>Thu Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>After being burned by the 20 GB iPod, which we discovered wont work with Windows 98 after we got it home, and it needed a firewire adapter we didn't have, and we needed after market software, it went back to the store. For $100 less we got the Nomad and 10 GB more.  <p>The software was easy to install. We didn't need to read the directions to start ripping CDs. I took this on a trip recently and was able to listen to music for the full 5 hours of my flight. The battery was barely drained.<p>Despite other comments to the contrary, this device is not that much bigger or heavier than the iPod. It fit nicely in the bag that contains my Bose headsets. I took the equivalent of 15 CDs with me in far less space than the old CD player and CDs I use to take. <p>We have started ripping our stories on CD and tape to the Nomad so that we have more than just music on hand. It is easy to convert tapes and music straight from the radio to MP3s. I'm starting to hit sales for new music and stories as this is a great way to have lots of variety handy.<p>I've brought the Nomad to work where I hook it into the auxillary input of my boombox. I set it for random play and have music of my choice to keep me going through the work day.<p>Two things that could be improved are a better backlight on the display (needs to be brighter) and a better button on the side for moving from menu to menu...iPod does both these better.<p>Great price, more bytes...iPod has nothing on Creative Labs!

<Title>Spanks the iPod
<Date>Tue Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My wife begged me for an iPod, so I got her one.  I really liked the form factor over my MP3/CD player, so (naturally) I wanted one.  But, I didn't want to shell out another 4 bills for an iPod, so I took a chance on the Zen NX.<p>Wow.  This thing is fabulous.  The sound is great and the battery life far exceeds the iPod.  It also plays WMA files which are about 1/2 the size of MP3 files.  <p>On the other hand, the interface isn't as cool as the iPod.  The case that comes with it stinks (get a $40 Vaja case instead).  The earbuds are useless--I threw them out.  There is no &quot;remote&quot;.  The green screen looks like old technology.  The recharger is 5V, which is not a common voltage for DC adaptors, even at Radio Shack.  It's bigger and heavier than the iPod.<p>If I had it to do over again, I'd still get the Zen NX.  If you want a small MP3 player, and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the unit for you.  If you want it to play WMA files too, skip the iPod.<p>BTW: Creative Labs just announced the Zen Xtra (I think).  It has a larger, higher resolution, blue screen.  Just a few bucks more.  Looks cool.

<Content>I love the product, the sound quality is excellent and with a $7 adapter cable, you can hook it directly into your home amplifier and it comes out with a very decent sound quality. This ability allows you to play music at home without having to change the disks. <br>It comes with a extensive userguide. However the descriptions on how to set up the music library and transfer the music to the jukebox are not well written and not user friendly. It took a lot of trial and error to get the music catalog right.

<Title>Very Impressed, took some getting used to though
<Date>Fri Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>After my 20 gig Archos nomade croaked in under a year I aprehensive to say the least about going with another hard drive based MP3 player. I decided to give it one more try because nothing else really fitted my needs. My first gripe on getting the product was that it organizes everything based on IDE tags which can be a disaster when so much of the stuff you download is missing it or varies but since I already had all my MP3 file names formatted with the artist name and album title i was able to use a program (MP3 Collector) to automatically go through all the MP3s and fix the IDE tags according to the filename which ended up being its saving grace, otherwise im not sure what i would have done. Now im pleased that i did that because the player makes a lot of use of the tags as you can search and sort more effieciently with them. Player has a quick startup, charges in under 3 hours, lasts for up to 14 I think, not sure since im always fiddling with it. Surprisingly good fidelity thanks to the EAX hardware, slick look, nice backlight scrolling screen and well placed buttons make this a top notch MP3 player. The buttons get a bit getting used to especially the navigation system but once your used to it they end up being very functional. The kicker is it costs about half as much as the IPod, normaly i hate settling for something of lower quality but with this player its definatly not the case.

<Content>Like many others who have written reviews for this product, I was drooling over the ipods, but was reluctant to spend that much. I decided to get this 30 gig for less than the price of a 20 gig ipod. I think that the aluminum case is much more stylin' than the ipod, but the ipod might have better controls. The little black scroll button that you also push to select is a bit funky.  However, I've only had it a week and I'm already getting the hang of it. All in all, I think it is a good purchase. The software was easy to install and the transfer easy and FAST. Ripping your cds is as simple as putting the disc in the drive. I still have about 20 gig left for future music. I am very happy with this purchase.

<Title>Creatives Nomad Jukebox NX - Hits the spot!
<Date>Tue Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Anyone in the market for a hard disc based player should give this cool player the once over. The best price-to-performance and best price-to-capacity ratio I've seen yet! Apart from a few initial hassles with setting up and getting to grips with creative media source, alls well. (I haven't tried Notmad Explorer from Red Chair, so I can't comment on that.) Transfers with USB 2.0 are fast and hassle free. Although I still wish that it was possible to have the player show up as a removable disc when plugged in, and without the need for any additional software.<br>  The earphones supplied with the player are junk. They went kaput after precisely a day of listening to some heavy bass. The supplied carry case covers the LCD when shut, which is an irritant, coz i would have liked to skip songs without opening the case. (By the way, the 10GB iPod, which retails for about the same, does NOT include a carry case, or the dock. it uses Firewire, aka Sony iLink, aka IEEE 1394, so most PC users will have to get an additional firewire card installed. PLUS the pod has a chromed back, which is susceptible to unsightly fingerprints and scratches.) <br> About the iPod-Zen wars; yes the iPod does look fancy, with its track pad and feather touch buttons, Stuff Magazine has rated it as the Must-have gadget for 2003, and it is smaller...but look at how much it sets you back!! And besides, the Zen still sets the benchmark for sound quality. So you have to decide why you want to buy a hard-disc player - to pose with, or to listen to some great sounds. Take my word for it, the Zen's an excellent player, with phenomenal battery life. - extremely desireable and highly recommended.

<Title>A good product
<Date>Tue Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this mp3 player because of the brand name and the price tag. It's about twice the size of the equivalent iPod and the weight is more or less equivalent. The sound is superb, the menus take a little getting used to.<p>The only problem I have with it is the player-pc interface. The Media Source Organizer that comes with the player is somewhat confusing at first, and there is no real real-time syncronisation between selected files/folders and the player (at least none that I could find). This gave me trouble at first because most of my songs are sorted into directories by album, but their mp3-tags weren't set up properly for all of them. This caused some issues with my finding songs on the player at the beginning, but as I use it more and more I get more used to the interface and the handling becomes easier.<p>All in all, it's a very good product and I recommend it.

<Title>Zen NX  Slick device with mediocre controls - flaky software
<Date>Mon Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have been shopping for a small portable jukebox for some time - and wasn't willing to pay the premium for the Apple alternative. I was looking for a device to travel with that could double as a data storage device for my PC files. This is a very promising device, but with some flaws.  1) THe software and documentation are poor - essentially Beta.  2) I have yet to get the file transfer software to work properly.  It effectively creates a shell that mimics Windows Explorer, but adds a folder to move files to the Zen NX.  Accessing the files requires that the computer you want to share files with first install the Creative software - limiting its utility as a file transfer device.  The music MUST be transfered using MediaSource sofware.  (The Zen NX is not yet compatible with MusicMatch, etc.) MediaSource crashed repeatedly when trying to move my 2300 file library all at once from my Windows XP computer using USB1.1.  I had to move no more than 50 files at a time.  Also, the displays and controls on the Zen NX are rather awkward to use.  Most functions controlled with a tiny scroll wheel that is hard to use, and the display is rather limited WRT text and of only fair contrast.  Overall, a good though not greatvalue that works after a fashion.  Be sure to downlod latest drive and software patches or results will be even poorer than mine!

<Content>I personally have found no problems with the software. It runs perfectly on my computer. The player itself has never froze or given me any problems either. I decided to get this instead of the chique ipod because:<p>1. It has a replaceable battery (instead of having it shipped to the manufacturer like the ipod)<p>2. More space for less money.<p>Other reasons include all of the different sound options, like slowing the music down, or creating spatializing effects, and works with USB. I have an older computer that doesn't have a firewire card, which is necessary for the ipod. You do have to get use to the scroller, which is a little harder to use than the ipod's touch sensitive controls.  Though the ipod is more stylish, I just can't justify spending nearly $500 for something that I can get for half the price. Get the Nomad Zen NX, you won't be disappointed

<Title>Perhaps my best tech purchase ever
<Date>Fri Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I'm 40 years old, and I've loved music my entire life. I have owned countless stereo systems (home, car, and portable), TVs, comptuers (notebook, &quot;luggable&quot; and desktop), tape recorders and players of all shapes and sizes, digital recorders, and other media gadgets. I don't think it's an exageration to say that this is quite simply the best tech device I've ever purchased, and now I don't know how I ever managed for so long without one. <p>I have had none of the problems that some people describe with using their players or the software that comes with it. From the time I sat down at my computer with the CD to install the software, it took me about 20 minutes to install it and figure out how to use it. Within a couple of hours I had transferred a library of a couple of thousand tracks to the Nomad, and that was only using a USB 1.1. It is no doubt a lot faster with a 2.0 connection. You just highlight the tracks or folders in the directory on your computer, click a button to point it at the Nomad, click a second button to start the copying, and let it go. I don't see how it could be any more painless or simple.<p>I do have a couple of suggestions. First, I use RealPlayer to copy my CDs rather than the Nomad software. Maybe it's just what I'm used to, but I find it easiest to use. Second, the only problem with the Nomad is that it has some trouble if you have more than one track that has the same name. For example, I have a CD on which the first and last songs are called the same thing, and getting both tracks on the Nomad required some hand editing of the song titles. This is a minor complaint, since this situation does not really come up very often. <p>The battery life is also surprisingly good. You should consider the 16-hour figure as sort of a theoretical maximum, if you turn it on and let it run constantly. In actual use (turning it off and on, etc), I get closer to 13 or 14 hours per charge, which is still pretty good and better than I expected. <p>Although some people complain about it, I like the side-mounted jog-wheel to choose tracks. I find it very quick and easy to use once you get used to it and it can easily be maniupulated with only 1 hand. The headphones that come with it are, naturally, terrible. So plan to upgrade.<p>Overall, I would say this an exceptional buy. Now that I have my entire CD collection in one box, I don't know how I managed before I had it.

<Title>Customer service and device performance.
<Date>Mon Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I registered this product which allowed me e-mail support.  My e-mail address and password were not recognized when I requested assistance.  I was to receive a new password by e-mail and that was never received.  Problems that I had that remained unanswered even after a toll call to Creative's Tech Support.  A message that I'm plugging in a high speed device into a low speed USB connection, even if I have USB 2. The device should be plug and play, but it caused my Windows XP computer to freeze up.  I removed and reinstalled the software and the unit would turn on when connected to USB, but was not recognized when I tried to add songs to my playlist.  The final blow was when I found even after completely removing the software, device, and drivers in add &amp; remove programs, the program still opened. This is why I place my orders with Amazon, as I know they have a good return policy.

<Title>Upgraded from Normal to NX
<Date>Fri Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>After my old one was stolen, I bought a new one.  So here are my thoughts, they may be helpful.<p>1.  No matter what model, if you buy a Nomad Zen then go to www.redchairsoftware.com and buy notmad explorer.  This gives you full control over your player, the ability to right click on mp3 files on windows and do a send to, some auto-id generation, and the ability now to stream your player over your network.  Basically, it's the software you should get with any mp3 player<p>2.  I'm not sure what is going to happen with the remote functionality.  The NX does not appear to have a data connector for the remote, and the previous creative remotes are not compatible.<p>3.  The text size on the screen cannot be resized currently in firmware.<p>4.  The new leather case covers the screen.  With no remote to see what is playing, you have to unsnap and open the case to do anything complicated.<p>5.  The jog dial is now a "rocker" switch.  While the ability to use it as a clicker is nice, it feels a little less solid and robust.<p>6.  Removable battery (the front cover comes off with a push of a button) is a big plus<p>7.  No longer have to do anything with the case to use the usb, but have to unsnap it for ac power<p>8.  Weighs a little less<p>9.  Sound may be a little better.  I think it sounds a little better.  The earbuds that come with it are still the ones with one earbud cable short, the other long.  Looks sort of stupid.<p>All in all, I loved my previous zen, and I like the new one a little better.  If they make a remote for it, put out another leather case, and let me make the text smaller on the display, it will be perfect

<Title>Ipod Who needs one..
<Date>Mon Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I recently bought a Creative Zen NX along with 5 other friends at the same time. After having played and setup an Ipod for a friend of mine I have to applaud the Zen and the Creative Software that comes with it.  <p>I'm an application scripter by trade and come across literally thousands of different software titles. I know when the user interface is intuitive and when it's not.. If any of you out there have tried both Microsoft's Outlook and Lotus's Notes software for your email system you will know what I'm talking about.. Lotus Sucks! I am yet to meet 1 user who likes it.. Same with the Music Match software that comes with the IPOD. <p>Creatives Media Source is really nice and intuitive. I haven't as yet ripped any CD's with it, but making Play lists and uploading music which is so difficult with the IPOD software is a dream. I've read people complaining about connectivity and so.. But it's easily solvable with a soft reboot on the player and desktop. Well at least that's what fixed mine, when it did have a slight hitch. <p>Now the player itself.. it's really nice to hold and is a nice weight in your hand. Looks wise it's got the quality and desirability thing going for it.. The menu's on it are very easy to master and anyone whose used a mobile phone will have it working and customised within minutes rather than hours. Obviously there are a couple of faults like the player's screen being covered when the case is closed and the lack of a remote control. blah blah..  but at this price for such a large amount of storage you can't complain, especially as Toms Hardware site said it sounds better than the Ipod. USB 2.0 SWEET!! the Music just Flys onto the player.. One whole disk in less than 30 seconds.. I think I put 7Gb as soon as I got it in less than 30 minutes or so.. but don't quote me on that.. <p>I gave it a 5/5 because it does almost everything very well and not much badly. So basically if you get it and don't like any aspect of it.. it won't be bad enough for you to hate it, not  the way I hated the software that came with the Ipod, and it's battery life, which seemed to run out easily..<p>Anyways, I hope that helps you out.. obviously people who have an Ipod will say how much better theirs is.. And all the reviewers who write articles don't have to pay for their own players.. I would say the only differences here is that the Ipod looks better and wins hands down on the desirability front..But it does comes with nasty software, has a lower battery life and worse of all it's battery is in built so after about a year and a half of solid use you have to send it back to them to install a new one, while you just open and replace it on the Zen and are able to carry aound spare ones which cost a pittence (thats, Not a Lot).. <br>Bottom line, buy a Ferrari and you have to change your lifestyle to accomodate the car and fork out a fortune, buy a BMW and it enhances your life.. Trust me I've been in both and own one of them.. No not the Ferrari.. hehe.. Have fun and I hope you enjoy which ever one you choose..

<Title>Don't Buy!!!!  Lousy product, even worse customer support.
<Date>Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Do not buy this piece of junk! Mine just stopped working after I had it for a month.  When I sent it in under warranty I was told that the hard drive had failed due to 'physical damage.'  The thing is I never did any damage to the device.  So after paying $300 to get to use the thing a month, I was told I have to pay another hundred to make it work again.

<Date>Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This player is far and away a better deal than an iPod. My only complaints are that you cannot see the screen when it is in the case. A case with a window would be a welcome addition. I am also disappointed with the battery life, four hours at best. Fortunately, it's easy to get a new battery. But that shouldn't be necessary for a unit which is only three months old. Sound quality and volume are great. I have no complaints with any other aspect.

<Date>Thu Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was awful.  I had it for two months before it would just FREEZE for no apparent reason.  The headphone jack was always a bit sensitive, in fact often making songs sound one dimensional.  Thought I was saving money but in fact I am now out $268.  DO NOT BUY...

<Title>great when it works
<Date>Tue Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have owned 3 Nomad versions and upgraded out of brand loyalty.    I am on my 2nd ZenXTRA. The first peformed well and then had serious (as in its internal hardware failed) problems. It was out of warrantee and I purchased another. Very quickly a similar problem occured (now the unit is en route to the USA repair facility).    Pros:  - great sound  - great battery life  - fine software  - excellent &amp;quot;package&amp;quot;    Con    - unreliable    If you get one that lasts (a friend has a 6G that is solid as a rock) you have a great value. Otherwise, you are wasting time and money (I had to re-load approx 3000 tracks several times after required &amp;quot;hard resets,&amp;quot; only to get a &amp;quot;firware failed&amp;quot; message).

<Title>I Know
<Date>Thu May 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I know there are alot of bad reviews on this product. I had actually bought the Nomad Zen 20G months ago and I was happy with it to an insane point...until it broke. &quot;Hard Disk Error&quot;. It occurs alot and yea, the company will find any way possible out of the warranty. However, its this new form of MP3 technology. I've had friends who have had holy Ipods for a few weeks and had them break. All MP3 player are bound to break. With that being said, this really is the the best purchase out there. I'm buying a new Nomad Zen in a few days because this is better than the Ipod. There's a risk in any MP3 player and I would rather take that risk with a better product like this than a crappy Ipod.

<Title>Great Mp3 player
<Date>Tue May 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this because I am in the millitary and go overseas alot.  I have over 300 CDs that I couldn't take with me.  My friend showed me the iPod and I decided I needed one.  Problem was I did not have a computer with firewire.  Then I found this and decided to try it out.  It has been great I have 3800 songs on it and its barely half-full.  The software is very easy to use and organizes your music in folders such as artist, album, genre, song title.  It also keeps your tracks in order they are from the cd.  The best feature is the random which shuffles every song on the player and plays them back randomly.  This has allowed me to rediscover songs I had forgotten about instead of listening to the same songs over and over.  The only complaint I have is that you can't transfer songs to or from a computer with out first installing the software.  I have had mine for 8 months and have only had it lock up twice.  This is an easy fix just take out the battery and it resets and goes right back to the track you were listening to.  Good product, Great price

<Title>When it's not just about the look.
<Date>Sat Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Zen Nx or iPod...which one should I go for? After months of conferring with friends and reading reviews on the net, I finally went for the former. Not once have I ever regretted this decision, and these are the reasons:<p>a) It's so easy and quick to install the software, upload the files and operate the player (I know of someone who was unable to even load the iPod software to their PC and couldn't get any help from Apple since it's essentially not a 'MAC problem')<p>b) The battery life can indeed go up to 14 hours. I can leave it playing throughout the day, even when I'm out on lunch breaks and meetings and come back with it still full of life. A word of advice; Sound effects / equalizers can deplete the battery life, so unless you've got it hooked on to a power source, let it run normally.<p>c) The capacity. I own lots of CDs and I've nearly transferred all the songs I love into my player. I'm in this constant fear that I'll run out of space only to realize I've only filled up 10% of it.<p>d) Though the earphones aren't great, they can easily be changed. Besides, it's not just for my ears, I can hook it up (through the earphone jack) to my surround sound system at home and let it blast through the speakers with all the effects wanted.<p>e) The price - need I write more?<p>My only wish: to be able to view the lyrics through the LCD! <p>So what if it doesn't have the cool white look of the iPod? It has an anodized AL casing which is very modern, doesn't get dirty and a travel pouch that protects it (which is lucky for me, since I've dropped it a few times!) And then, others may say the Zen NX doesn't allow you to play games while the iPod does. Well, the primary use for this device is to play the songs you love, not to play the games you only ever choose to occupy yourself with if you're low on choice! <p>If you want a player that works, is user friendly and easy on the pocket, go out and buy the Zen NX!

Their solution was to send it in for repair, price $190 and wait (likely) 4-6 weeks.  When asked for some kind of assurance that the new drive would not fail...something like a 1 yr warranty that they currently offer on the newer designs, I got nothing more than &quot;these things tend to fail early.&quot;<br>The controls are an ergonmic nightmare and the software is weak at best.<br>Keep shoppng, this one is a disappointment.

<Title>Do your research and don't fall for the hype (i.e iPod)
<Date>Sun Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I live in the United Arab Emirates , and since theres not much of a gadget "fever" here like other places , I've mostly relied on Amazon's members' reviews , which didn't always prove to be scientific .....  I'm a relative late buyer of the NX , I bought it in the beginning of Sep 2004 .  So here's the story , I needed mammoth storage device , for I have a huge collection of MP3s in 4 languages ..... I did my research and narrowed it down to 3 items , the iRiver 60GB , iPod 60 GB , and Creative Xtra 60 GB .... aiming for the best (or so I presumed) .....   And in the midst of my "quest" to find my dream gadget , a nearby retailer was clearing out the older merchandise , so there I saw the Nomad Zen NX 30 GB ,with a price tage of about 150 dollars .... which was amazing as compared to the iPod's hefty 600 dollars (in the UAE) ... I had other gadgets in mind to buy , such as a PDA/Surround ...etc .  I usually trust Creative because I've been using its products for a number of years now , and they always proved top notch when it came to sound products , so I reluctantly bought the Zen NX (after reading the hysterical BUY THE IPOD!!! Amazon reviewers) unable to ignore the 4x price difference .  Well heres the juice :   1- You DON'T need a radio , voice recorder , games , calendar , address book , or any of that babble , most of these specs are available on new age Nokia and other mobile phones .. so its more sensible to get it (IF you need it , because you're paying a hefty difference for these) in a PDA or an advanced mobile phone .In the beginning you might wander around the menu a little , but later on , it only boils down to music playing.  2-NO matter what they tell you , the menu of any handheld device is tiring to venture through , so the least options the better ...... more needless specs complicate things .  Now my review of the Zen NX :  1-Sound Quality : Superb ! I wasn't disappointed to trust Creative on this , specially if you have a Creative surround system/sound card . I'm a semi-pro musician , and I was very impressed by the sound quality .  2-Battery life : It lives up to the 14 hour line , and I use EAX sound effects , so maybe 11-12 hours for me , which is still great .  3-User Interface : I'm beginning to wonder if the iPod is some mystical creature from the garden of Eden ..... because 45 minutes after unpacking the NX (without reading the manual) I knew every nook and cranny in the NX system ... so I'm wondering how easier it can get .  4-Harddisk : After filling 18 Gbs out of 30 , the delay time is very minimal and only if you open an artist with a huge number of songs . You can connect the harddrive to your Laptop (which I did) and its a high quality harddrive .  5-Design : Matter of personal choice , but the front cover never fell off although i did drop the player quite a number of times .  There are some cons , such as not having an LED controller on the headphones' wiring ..... but hey , organize ur playlists and you won't need it , plus , considering the price ... you can't expect it all .  Bottom line is : If you want a fashion statement , go for the iPod (although the trend is fading into oblivion) , if you want a good easy-to-use does-the-job gadget , I highly recommend the Zen NX .

<Title>Nomad Zen NX
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Since I have owned this for a little over a year now, I feel I can give this product a fair review.  When I first bought it I was about to throw it against the wall. It froze constantly when trying to upload songs and even crashed my computer a few times. Nothing but problems.  Now that I think I've kind of figured it out, I'll pass some info on to others that is not included in the manuals. If you are having problems or are on the fence about buying a Nomad over iPod this may help.  Cons: - The software it comes with to 'organize' and upload songs BLOWS. Not only does it crash often but tried to take over my song library and reclassify everything. Don't use it. Use real player, Windows media player, musicmatch jukebox, whatever.  - Playlist functions are a pain. Once a playlist is created you cannot add more songs to it unless you attempt to use the Creative Mediasource Organizer. Then you risk a computer crash and having to reboot the computer and Nomad. - You cannot upload more than about 1gb at a time or else it will overheat and freeze up. Happened to me numerous times. Just take it easy and do a little at a time. - 2.0 usb cable is no great shakes. 2.0 is standard operating procedure for any device of this kind today so don't let Nomad pretend its a great new invention. - If you drop this thing, it will freeze up and you will be unable to use it. The thing inside is like a record player. The 'needle' gets jammed and can't move. How to fix it: extend you arm with the front facing you and twist your arm in clockwise/counterclockwise motion vigorously.  This will unjam the hard drive needle. - Battery life is nowhere near the factory specs. I get about 3-4 hours. Life is especially low when you hook it up to a receiver with the line in and have to crank the volume.  Pros: - If you have things in WMA format this is for you. Those that jumped the shark and bought an ipod found out the hard way that all those songs you downloaded from napster and kazaa that were in WMA format are unreadable on an iPod. Therefore Nomad is more compatible. Also if you are a fan of Windows media player, you will have no problem as it is fully compatible with a Nomad. - You don't have to spend $10,000 to fill a Nomad like you do with itunes. While iTunes is great to get those hard to find one hit wonders, you are NUTS if you tried to fill your Mp3 device with it. - Finding songs with the scroller is weird but you'll get the hang of it. - Sound is pretty good. You can mess with the sound settings and get it to your liking.  - 30 gigabytes is a good chunk of space for music. More than enough room on this guy for years to come.
