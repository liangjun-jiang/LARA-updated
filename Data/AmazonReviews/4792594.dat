<Title>Virtually Flawless
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, im gonna start off by sayin that this MP3 player is absolutely amazing. It has a color screen, touch sensative pad, and the instalation software is incredibly easy. It could display photos, and has a voice and FM radio recorder. and ofcoarse it has its own FM radio tuner, which has a pretty damn good reciever. The only flaws that i have seen with it is that it is very prone to finger prints makin it very had 2 keep all shiny but its easy to clean, and the seperate carryin case eliminates that problem. The only other problem is that seenin as though it is a relatively new product, there are not many accessories for it.

<Title>Finally, an mp3 player worth every penny
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been wanting an mp3 player for 3 years, but due to a lack of a job or cash, I was unable to get one worth its salt. I started working at Kroger a few weeks ago(from the time I wrote this), so I finally have an income. Thus, the search for an mp3 player began.   I looked at the iPod video, and was set on getting that one for awhile. I mean how cool would it be to carry around videos, music, photos, and anything else you could think of, in one pocket-sized gadget? Apple at that point had another willing customer. But then, after more research, I realized just how lame it would be to have to really take care of it, as it does indeed, scratch ultra-easy, and before long, your screen will look like a cat attacked it after a few trips in your pocket. It would get so burdensome, I think, to have to deal with that.  I went to Wal Mart a couple of weeks back, and my eyes caught a small black mp3 player in the display case...This was the Philips GoGear 6 GB. I was instantly attracted to its sleek design and just how wicked cool it looked. I also noticed that it was a little over $100 cheaper than the iPod. Sure, it didn't have near as much space, or video capability, but it still had a nice variety of features. I'll describe them now:  FM Radio: You can listen to the radio on the GoGear, and for such a small item, it picks up a NICE signal. I have 2 rock-station presets on mine(the only rock stations in my area) that both come in crystal-clear. When tuning for a station, you slide your thumb up or down on the touchpad, and a little indicator shows where you're at, much like an alarm clock or small radio's tuning device.   FM Radio Recording: I haven't fiddled with this feature yet, but you can record what you are listening to on the radio, and it's quite easy to do so.   Protective Rubber Case: Included in the package is a rubber case that does actually protect the player, and has a nice feel to it. You might want to cut a small hole in the center of the top of it, because it blocks the headphone jack. A minor, easily fixable flaw.   Earbuds: The included earbuds are a bit new to me, feel-wise, but they look awesome, and sound great! They could compare to the seemingly-perfect sounding white iPod earbuds. These things put out some killer sound.   Voice Recording: This to me, is a really fun and useful feature. You can record messages to yourself(when you have nothing better to do...lol), record your friends' saying things, or even take them to class and record a lecture. I have roughly 3.5 gigs of space taken up on my GoGear, and there is still 3 hours of voice recording available.   Pictures: It took me a while to figure out how to get pictures to show up on the GoGear. They would transfer with ease, (you must use Windows Media Player, you cannot use Windows Explorer)but would not be detected in the player itself. Also, the picture files must be in JPEG format. My pictures were in that format, but still would not show up in the player. I then came up with this seemingly bogus idea of just transferring my pictures to My Documents, to see what that would do. Low and behold, it worked! So remember, when you want to transfer pictures, transfer them from My Documents, not My Pictures. If I'm the only one that had this problem....Forgive me, lol.   Charging Time: Somehow, when I plugged it into the wall for the first time(to charge it, obviously), it was already charged! Every book and site I've seen about this player says to charge it first, before you do anything, and that when it is charging, there will be a battery charging animation on the screen, and it will stop when it is fully charged. I plugged it in, no animation started, and the battery indicated FULL! I still have no idea how that happened, but I've been listening to it for 3 hours now, and it has not failed on me. Perhaps it really is charged...lol. But initially, it takes 4 hours to charge it fully, or there is a 1 hour(70%) fast charge. For a first time use, a full 4 hour charge is highly recommended, unless you are like me, and get one that is fully charged in the package....I still have no idea how that happened.   I hope this narrative of a review has helped you make your decision, and I say this player is indeed, worth every penny. You won't think twice.

<Title>Loved it til it quit completely on day 3
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The color is great, blue light is definitely sexy.  Touch navigation was sensitive and easy to use.  Uploading music was a breeze.  Sound was great, even the color display was equal to my cell phone.  Options for saving battery life (backlight timing, skin options, etc) nice touch.  Slipped right into my pocket while shopping.  Well all that is past tense because today (the 3rd day) I attempt to turn it on to fully discharge the battery before recharging and it will not even power up.  I figure it was in need of charging, so I plug it in to the wall... no life.  Change outlets, no life.  I plug it into the USB and it shows nothing.  I'm so sad.  I love this little thing and now I may have to get an iPod which makes me feel like a sell out.  If anyone else had this problem and it is easily fixed, drop me a line.  I want to keep it, but only if it will work.

<Title>Skip it, buy anything but this one... except for looks
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, I give it to Philips for the killer good design: this thing looks awesome; i.e. if you like looking at mp3 players, buy it.  However, if you actually like listening to music, go buy a 20$ CD player from Wal-Mart, it will do a better job.  First, the sound is horrible: I bet that the earbuds are to blame (yeah, they look really cool too, but sound like crap), but never got to really buying an upgrade.  Second, the installation software won't even run, unless you have your XP upgraded with every patch imaginable: annoying.  Third, during the very first load, after getting about 130 songs on it, the device froze. I restarted it, added about 40 more and left on a vacation the next day. Guess what? When I turned it on, I had only the last 40 songs on it...   Finally, the device crashed for no reason whatsoever after being turned on and off three times and it took me about 20 minutes to reboot it.  I returned it after 5 days and do not plan on buying another Philips mp3 player any time soon: it's a pitty, it is the best looking player I have seen. It also has three times the capacity of similarly priced players, stores pictures, and has an FM tuner... If the designers would stay and the programmers at Philips would be fired, I would wait in line to get their next product.

<Title>Nice Player
<Date>Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nice little 6gb player. The touch pad is very touchy and takes a bit to get used to it. Sound is good and may be better than my old Ipod. The only real down side is that unless you have another program the people at philips leave you with media player 10 which is not the best for managing media files.  You need WinXP SP1 to run this thing and it is drag and drop ready from there which is very nice to have. Its the size of a cedit card and fits nicely into my pockets. The navigation menues are nice and the touch pad makes it a breeze to select all the options. It has several different power and lighting settings to save battery life. I havent let it run down but the most I have gotten is 14hrs on a full charge with the display settings all set in the mid range.  I would recommend this mp3 player for anyone looking at this size HD it is solid player with good looks and sound.   As for the reviewer that had the player die on them, you can do a soft reset by holding the power and + volume keys at the same time for a few seconds and then just power it up.

<Title>Great Little MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought this for myself. I have an archos 6 gig mp3 player that needs to be fixed it stopped charging after awhile, well  i decided on a whim i wanted another mp3 player. so i looked at a few online at walmart's site. I was all set to get the 4 gig archos one, but i decided that i wanted a radio in it also. I loved the look of the philips one.  well i ended up going the next day to get it. (that was this past thursday) It is now sunday and i love this thing. I have decided that in a few months when i can save up i am going to save up for the  30 gig version. I listen to alot of music, and have alot of it on my computer. If you do have this mp3 player don't use the earbuds that come with it they sound like crap. I bought a pair of sony ones awhile back that i just adore that i use with this player.  I haven't really had any problems with this player so far. i like the touch scrolling and the touch controls but as previously stated they do take some getting used to. I just use a light touch to get where i want to go.  i do really love having the option to listen to the radio, after years of using my other mp3 player i was just so out of touch with the radio since whenever i went anywhere i'd use my mp3 player. Now i can at least have the option to turn the radio on and have my presets at my finger tips. and i do love the little recording feature i havent really used that yet but i am sure if i have something important enough to remember i will. I also really love equalizer and the different presets i have kept it on the srs wow setting but i think i will have to customize it :), i like that you get a custom option. most of my music isn't in wma format so i have just over 1500 songs on it at the moment, and since i have over 3000 songs on my computer i have to rotate my music quite a bit but i have to say that syncing with the windows media player doesn't take all that long. I am so glad that this player is so much smaller and lighter than my archos that thing was just a pain to lug around but since it's been a few years it makes sense that they've gotten so much smaller lighter and more portable.  I would recommend this player to anyone with a moderate music collection, who doesn't have as many songs as i do (but then when i can i am upgrading to the 30 gig gogear lol).  great player for the price, if u are looking for multitasking in your devices this is a good one don't go for an overpriced over-rated ipod, the gogear can also store data files for transfering to other computers another thing i was looking for in my mp3 player.

<Title>Great new player
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this recently and so far I am loving it. It has lots of features and is easy to use.  I like that you can use Media Player to import songs or you can just copy and paste your mp3 songs directly to it by opening it from My computer(which is the way I'm used to), they don't tell you how in the instructions, but it's easy to figure out. The menu response is a little bit slow, but honestly I usually don't notice it.  The radio reception is great and radio encoding feature is nice.  You can also use it as a data storage device, which is also a feature I use, but you have to have the cable with you if you want to move the data to another computer.  Great player overall.

<Title>WORTHLESS
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>the one star is because i cant give a negative i bought this mp3 thinking it would be awesome. 6 gigs, color screen, touch sensitive...for 200 dollars too good to be true, and it is. ive had 2 of these players. the fisrt: i loaded my songs, around 600 or so, and let it charge for around half an hour, i admit-a bad idea, but it powered and the battery showed half full, so i took it with me to a friends house to listen to. after about 15 minutes, i turned it off. a little later when i wanted to turn it on it would not come on. i tried charging it over night, it still wouldnt power. so the next day i returned it and got a second player. i charged it for the recommmended five hours, plus one for good luck, and put all my songs on it again. this player worked fine for about a week. until the exact thing happened as did with the first. i went to turn it on, after listening to it less than an hour before, and it would power up. so i brought it home, charged it for about an hour and it still wouldnt work.  the moral of the story....philips isnt as good as i had expected, although the headphones are nice, and the touch sensitive is cool.....it doesnt work, atleast mine didnt. please try to find anothr alternative...

<Title>Performs great - battery doesn't last
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was torn between buying the Phillips GoGear and an IPOD.  I chose the Phillips because it was less expensive and I liked the looks.  I really like the way the Phillips performs, I've got it loaded with about 1000 songs.  The only complaint I have, and that's why I gave it only 3 stars, is that my battery only lasts about 3 hours.  It seems like even though the player is off, it's using up power.  I have even charged it overnight and the power still runs out.  Maybe the one I have is defective.  Other than that the buttons are easy to use, sometimes a little too touchy.

<Title>IPOD beats it even though this is cheaper
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had ipod video and I have been listening and reading about ipod hype. People say there are so many things offered by samsung and philips at lower cost. So I decided lets try one. The audio quality I heard was as good as ipod for mp3s and gogear offers FM, FM recording, voice recording etc. Its even smaller than ipod. It works as HDD which is cool because you can store/backup files; ipod doesn't. I compared to samsung and decided gogear is better for sound. It was a wrong decision but its the decision that gave me reasons why ipod sales beats these other mp3 players by huge margin. Top most reason is simplicity. I started setting up gogear Saturday morning and its sunday evening now its going thru last sync I thing everything will be as I need it. I spent 10 hrs and I know computers well.  First of all, the setup CDs provided are useless. When I put those CDs in, I got message 'recommend newer version for EasyCD connect to internet?'. If you say 'No', setup exits. If you say 'yes' it takes you to microsoft website for windows media player 11. But no download link. Since I have WMP 10, I thoght its asking for version 11. I upgraded to WMP11. It synced fine but started other troubles. Pic were not synced. Then I spent a lot of time on philips support website to fix it. Here is what I found -  1. You will need WMP 10 not 11. Philips provided a plugin for Gogear to version 10. 2. Firmware/Device manager upgrade is must if you are below what they have on there site. 3. I had to install philips device manager. Why??? This thing is suppose to work on standard windows and no need additional software(like itunes). I had to repair using Philips device manager. 4. Adding picture is thruogh WMP sync and its not smooth process. I found that documentation on support. May be its on CD but I was not able to install through CD. 5. On the good side, it has all the additional features I mentioned before. They work fine. FM play and recording is cool. I don't understand how come copyrights companies did not say anything about that. 5. The navigation is confusing. The ff button is same as choose button. Other buttons menu, view are not that user friendly.  Overall, spend more money on IPOD if you do not have intermediate level computer knowledge or time or help. I am sure you will spend few hours setting up. I am giving 3 stars because these additional features I mentioned before. This player has potential but...

<Title>The Nano vs. The GoGear
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using this little mp3 player now for a while and I feel I can give it an accurate assessment. I'm going to compare it with the ever popular Ipod Nano just in case you find yourself like I did, stuck between two heavyweight champs.  -Appearance: I found myself taken right away with the gogear. It's about the same height of the nano but definitely thicker. The entire player is a reflective midnight black with silver plating on the sides. It fits nicely in the hand and looks stunning. It shows fingerprints, but those wipe away easily. It doesn't seem to scratch too easily, unlike its opponent which scratches at the lightest of touches. I knew someone that kept his nano in a cloth case and it still found a way to show scratches. Albeit, the Ipod nano is incredibly small and aesthetically pleasing, but the darn thing just can't take its punches. The screen is prone to cracking and I've never seen an Ipod nano that didn't have a million battle scars on it. Which one you like better is a personal choice, but in my books, this round goes to the GoGear if only because it doesn't scratch so easily.   -Functionality, Playback and Features: Let me start by saying duh! Who would buy an mp3 player that only has a capacity of 2gb when they could get a different one at the same price that has 6gb of storage. I call this a nobrainer but whatever floats your boat. You could shell out an extra 50 to get the superior nano, but it still falls short of the GoGear by 2gb. The GoGear is extremely straightforward in its design. My computer had no trouble detecting it. I quickly and easily synched my music library to the GoGear using Windows Media Player. The main menu has 5 options to chose from: music, radio, pictures, recordings and settings. Everything is pretty easy to find. The touch navigation is pretty good. I sometimes have a problem with it going two clicks instead of one, but that's a small annoyance. The playback on this player is good. It has a couple of different equalizer settings to chose from. Hip Hop is my personal favorite. It has   dedicated volume, power and menu buttons on the side. I do wish there was a button that took you directly back to the main menu. As it is designed, you kinda have to backtrack through to find the main menu. Again, this isn't really a big deal. One thing I really do like about this player is the fact that it has an Am/Fm tuner. The nano lacks this in its feature set, and it is sorely missed. The navigation on the GoGear is pretty comparable to the  nano, though I feel the GoGear is a little more easy to navigate in. Again this is a personal choice, but I feel the GoGear won this round as well. My main complaint with the nano is that it doesn't have a radio tuner. Who dropped the ball on that one?   -Battery Life: I haven't had enough experience with the Nano to really declare one better than the other, but I'll tell you what I know. The battery on the Philips seems to last a while. I would call its 17 hour rating a pretty accurate statement, give or take a little bit. I do know that the Nano is infamous for its suspectable battery life. Most users complain that it just doesn't have the endurance to make it through the day. I'm going to call this round a draw because of the simple fact that I just don't have enough experience with the Nano. Though from other reviews, I would say the GoGear has again bested the Nano.  -What I didn't like about the GoGear: My main complaints about the GoGear were about the accessories. The rubber case that comes  with it is more like a rubber sleeve that outlines the edges. It does nothing to protect the front of the player, but I guess Philips didn't have to supply a case at all. I also couldn't stand the headphones supplied with it. They just wouldn't fit comfortably in my ear. Again though, Philips didn't have to supply earphones at all, so I guess I shouldn't complain. These are minor complaints and they don't impact my music experience with the GoGear.   -The Verdict: In the end, the GoGear is the clear winner. It looks good, it works and plays well, and it has 6gb of storage 6gb as opposed to 2gb the equally priced nano gives you. This amounts to about a 1000 more songs, more or less. There are only two reason why anyone would chose the nano over the GoGear: 1) they are ill-informed consumers that just wanted to buy the popular mp3 player instead of researching the issue or 2) they just really couldn't get over the size of the nano. The Nano may win on the coolness factor by a slight margin, but it just can't compete with the features of the GoGear. Do yourself a favor, and put your money on the ultra sleek GoGear.

<Title>Frustrating software, but great player
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this at walmart after reading reviews for it online. I was intruiged that it showed pics, played tons of music, recorded sounds, AND could receive Fm radio. All of that for the same price of a nano. I got home and it took me a while to sync my song, because the media player is hard to work with. But with that done, I tried to put on pictures. I have Windows XP SP2, and those dang pics would get synced, but not show up on my device. I tried 15 different pictures, all jpgs. After redoing this for hours, I reset everything to factory settings and reinstalled the software. No avail. I checked the troubleshooting section of the Philips site, and it just gave me things I had already done. I decided to call Philips, and the customer support basically read from the manual. They could not diagnose a thing. I am returning this mp3 player for the same one, and hopefull this one will work. I still don't know whether it is a problem with the device or my computer. However, the music sounds great and the color screen rules. I would reccomend this to someone, although they may be taking a risk like I did.

<Title>Dancin' to the beat ... As I shuffle with my feet !
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've read all the reviews on many sites regarding this MP3 player. But we all have our own opinions and without those life would be dull. Like the previous reviewer below my review I got my Philips at Wal*Mart also. Although I didn't seem to have any problems loading pictures into my player or songs. I do have to agree with the sync part being a bit hassle. I accidentally hit auto sync instead of manually sync which is a mistake on my part. Should of read the installation manual first so when I sync my songs into the player it took my Default PC sound effects and any other sound files on my computer from games, etc. I have a hard time figuring out how to get rid of those but after uninstall and reinstall I got it figured out. Overall this is an excellent MP3 player. My older brother paid about the same for his 3GB Archos player and he says mine was a good value. Now if it had a Video player to boot it might just slap iPod Nanos in the screen. Sound quality is excellent and battery life ... I have to say I need to properly charge it first. I only charged it for one hour since I opened it from the packaging. It recommends a 5 hr. or something charge. Overall it's a great player for the price. I'd buy it and compare to your friends iPod they tie overall.

<Title>piece of crap
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i received this player as a christmas gift and since christmas i have spent maybe forty hours transferring songs onto the computer and then onto the player.  the computer i use isn't mine so i erase the music after transfer onto the player.  well, after three weeks of using the thing and just as the storage capacity is close to full it no longer recognizes the five gigabytes of music on it!  i can access the music through windows explorer and media player but the player says that it is empty.  i tried to reset the thing (which erases all of the music) but it gave me an error message.  i tried everything i had patience left to try with this thing to restore it but i've had it.  the documentation     that comes with the thing says that you can register online but the philips web site says that online registration is not available in my area - useless website.  my other major complaint with it is the fact that you have to use windows media player for effective song transfer.  i f*cking hate windows media player.  it puts gaps between your tracks that don't exist on the cd and i have tried every setting in the player that relates to this, it also adds cracks and pops in the beginning of the tracks that sound like you pushed the record button on a tape recorder.   screw this thing, for another hundred dollars i can get twenty four more gigabytes with an ipod.

<Title>Perfection marred by crappy software
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Philips HDD1630 6gb is a lovely Mp3 player.  Sleek design, small size, lightweight, great sound. Unfortunately, the fact that this player is tied down to Windows Media Player AND ONLY Windows XP SP2, makes on NOT want to purchase this unit.    The player itself is nice.  The screen is bright, colorful and SKINNABLE.  So hopefully in the future we'll be able to download more skins for the UI of the players screen.  It pumps out good volume and the different equalizer settings will keep you jamming that much longer.  I personally didn't use any of the EQ settings and it still sounded great.  Navigating through the menus is quick and painfree, thanks to the simplified interface.  There are only two small complaints and that's the 1 or 2 pause between songs when you skip tracks, makes it almost feel like a CD player.  Second is the photo loading takes a bit longer than you might expect, but over all its an enjoyable experince.  UNTIL you get to the software! I know Windows Media Player LOOKS like a good way to use your music, but its not.  At first I thought it was just me and I was just a jaded person since i used an iPod before.  But i gave it to my sister, who has NEVER used an mp3 player, for a couple of days to use.  From her non-computer saavy perspective she said it was terrible to use.  I don't even want to get into all the craziness that I had with the software!  And I've been in the computing world for 17 years.  This would be an iPod killer.. but the software just ruins your experince.  Pros:  Great battery life small screen, nice screen, great features ON the player itself, the menu on the player is easy to navigate and the buttons look cool, skinnable UI on the player.  Cons: skipping songs on the player has a cd-player feel where it takes 1 - 2 seconds to load the next song.  Software is HORRIBLE!! The USB transfer cable / power cord could definitely use some redesigning.

<Title>BEST LOOKING PLAYER, but buggy design
<Date>Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've have done quite a bit of research and now have pretty good experience with several of the latest MP3 players. This is by far the best looking MP3 player in our ipod dominated world. I have used SanDisk Sansa M240 1gb, IRiver 1gb U10, the Creative Labs Micro Photo 8gb and this player.  PRO: 1) Looks. Sleek and shiny with a good screen. Nice blue lighted effects with the slider. 2) Good battery life. 3) Price. 4) Fairly decent headphones included. 5) SRS WOW - 3D sound, great on surround systems. 6) Touch Slider - All that I've tried seemed to be pretty tricky to get used to.  This is probally the best one I've used that comes close to the ipod.    CON: 1) Sound quality a little meager compared to what I've heard with other MP3 players better than the SanDisk but volume even on max setting is pretty low. 2) Buttons. I do agree its hard to make something look nice and be pretty functional. Because of being so sleek, with no tactile feedback, its can be hard navigate the player while doing other things such as driving or working out. I found this more as a little annoyance. 3) My biggest concern was the buggy interface on player itself. I believe it has problems with DRM windows media files, these are the files you download from the "All you can eat buffet" from subscription services. (Yahoo, Napster, & Real Rhapsody) This player would lockup or pause for an eternity several times and be unresponsive even to turn it off. I exchanged it for another one which came with exact same problems. My experience lockups occur more frequently while using playlists.  RECAP: To me this was a love hate relationship.  I loved how it looked and could see the potential of this player. But until they fix these bugs I would have a very hard time to recommend this product.  I almost kept it in hopes that Phillips may make a better firmware upgrade. I eventually went with the Creative Labs Micro Photo that has performed awesome. It just does not have the shiny finish and it is couple clicks lower on the "I'm Cool!" scale. Before you decide to buy, try searching for "HDD1630 freeze" and you will see variety of comments of this model and it's larger cousin that shares the same firmware HDD6330. I believe comments left here and many other reviews have not used the product at all or fully, I had used it for 2 weeks.

<Title>Style over substance, flash over function, etc.
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recommend a healthy dose of skepticism with regards to this player's high average review score on Amazon.  The Philips' HDD1630 is high on looks and low in price (compared to similarly equipped players), but is unstable, behaves erratically, is often slow to respond or unresponsive altogether, illogically designed, and the sound quality isn't that good either (especially the bass).  After a month and a half of use, my own player started randomly adding the current song to the default playlist when I pressed *any* button, and even a system restore via the included software could not fix this problem.  It's certainly possible that some people own HDD1630s that are not buggy at all, but the apparently high probability of getting a buggy one (given the dissenting reviews) makes purchasing this player something of a crapshoot, so beware.  Instability: The player I owned periodically froze up, perhaps a couple times a week.  (This is a fairly negligible problem on its own, but within the player's larger constellation of flaws, is just another reason to stay away.)  Erratic behavior: More often than the player froze up, I would encounter strange problems with loading and playing songs.  For instance, the player might list a song twice, when I had only loaded it once.  It would often skip over certain songs, despite listing them, and would refuse to play them until I had reloaded them.  I think this is a problem with how the player constructs its database of songs.  Fwiw, I relied mainly on dragging files to the device through Windows Explorer, rather than using Media Player, though I believe the same problems occurred when I used Media Player.  Interface is slow to respond, unresponsive: The touch-sensitive "buttons" are very frequently unresponsive.  While the buttons themselves would consistently light up in response to a swipe of my thumb, the player itself would often not register any command.  Additionally, navigating through menus is awkwardly slow when music is playing.  You might hit a button and not receive any feedback until over a second has passed, and the menus themselves scroll slowly.  A second's delay doesn't sound like much, but in the world of electronic interfaces, such a delay constantly forces us to worry whether we need to repeat a command.  Well designed interfaces offer prompt, nigh-instantaneous feedback.  Perhaps if Philips had cut down on the graphical content, the player might've been able to do so.  Mediocre sound quality: Having recently purchased an iPod shuffle, I found it remarkable how much better the sound quality was in comparison to the Philips HDD1630 (using the same pair of headphones).  The shuffle's sound is much richer and offers high quality bass, whereas the HDD1630 sounds mechanically produced in comparison, and the bass level cannot be much increased from its default setting without generating noticeable distortion.  On the plus side, the player does not scratch easily: I carried it unprotected in my pocket (making sure not to put any abrasive objects next to it) for as long as I owned it, and it failed to scratch at all.  All things considered, though, I'd rather have a scratched yet stable player than a cosmetically flawless and buggy one.  Don't be fooled by its good looks or tempted by its low price.  I *strongly* advise looking (or waiting) for a different player.

<Title>Absolutely LOVE this player
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have no idea why some other reviewers don't like this player.  I've had no problems at all.... so here's my complete review.  I've done a lot of research while searching for my next Digital Audio Player.  I had a Creative Muvo 256 mb player (my first DAP) which I was looking to upgrade because I wanted A LOT more space.  When searching for a new one I knew I wanted these features:  Color screen, at least 5 GB of space, FM, jpeg display, album art display, and voice recording capabilities.  Looks were at the bottom of my list, but I admit, this is a great looking player.    I knew the ipods were going to be WAY out of my price range and they don't have all the features I wanted anyway.  Originally, I ran into what I thought was a deal on a $95 5GB DAP, the japanese NHJ VHD-5100.  That was the crappiest player to ever exist.  It locked up on me literally hours after taking it out of the box so I returned it.  (Do NOT buy that one if you happen to find it somewhere).  You get what you pay for, so my search began for better one.  I decided on the Philips GoGear HDD1630 because it had all the features I wanted so I decided to fork out the extra $80 bucks after returning the VHD-5100.  MONEY WELL SPENT.  WHAT I LIKE: - Plenty of space for my music (currently have about 800 songs with lots of room to spare) - Looks sleek, I like the black color, has the neat blue touch-sensitive lighted controls - The sound is MUCH better than my Creative Muvo - I LOVE the headphones supplied with the player.  I have smaller ears and they fit perfectly and sound great - Album art displays with each song (kind of small but there nonetheless) - FM radio, w/ FM recording feature - Voice recording (I like to record my husband snoring and let him hear how ANNOYING he is - LOL) - Slide show jpeg display... I like to show off my kids every once in a while :-) - Great battery life - The price (you get A LOT for your money)  WHAT I DON'T LIKE (very little): - The front of the player smudges a lot (not a big deal to me) - The sound settings are a little strange, some of them sound muffled.  I've had the best luck with the SRS WOW setting. - No case w/ belt clip supplied with the player.  But you can buy a leather Philips one at Wal-Mart for $9.88.  LOADING SONGS ONTO THE PLAYER: VERY EASY.  Despite what others have said, the player was CAKE to load with my 800 songs.  Windows Media Player is NOT that hard to use.  A monkey could do it.  I have no idea what kind of person could not figure this out.  And even if you don't like WMP, you can also drag & drop through Windows Explorer.    ALBUM ART TIP: Some of my album art did not display initially.  A quick visit to the FAQ on the Philips site solved the issue.  All you need to do is place the album art jpeg file in the album folder using windows explorer, and name it "Album Art.jpg".  That simple.  It works best if you make sure your jpeg file is less than 4k, that way it displays on the player quicker.   BOTTOM LINE: This player far exceeded my expectations.  It was simple to use and very easy to load songs on.  If you're not an idiot and do it correctly in the first place, IT IS VERY USER-FRIENDLY.  I would definitely recommend this player to anyone.

<Content>I have had this mp3 for almost a year now.  i got this as a gift from my girlfriend before i got deployed to Iraq.  i am very pleased with it.  this little thing has gone into hell and came out great.  it has made it working around heavy equipment, sand, heat, and my clumsy hands.  it also survived a roadside bomb where i found it later under the drivers seat from where the impact threw it crossed the truck. And surprisingly there is only a couple scratches on it  the only downfall is the case it comes with is nothing but for looks. i have had problems with it freezing up on me, but the reset has always worked.  i have had the problem once where it erased all my music but then again i just reloaded everything onto it and it has worked ever since.   i am very pleased with it and would buy it agian.

<Title>Decent MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While I really prefer listening to music on actual CDs, I bought this MP3 player for the convenience of being able to take several albums of music with me in a small player rather lugging around a bulky CD wallet. I'm not a fan of ipods at all, and the Philips player is a nice alternative. The player itself, while not as compact as an ipod, is certainly small enough to fit inside your pocket or backpack. Also, the player itself feels very sturdy, and it can handle getting knocked around better than some other players out there on the market.  The interface is easy enough to navigate, although the touch-sensor buttons are a little too touchy, but that's nothing serious. The sound quality is just fine, although you might want to invest in some bigger headphones to get a fuller sound. The installation was very easy, and there was no problem loading the player with songs. The player I bought has 8 GB, not 6, which is more than enough space. I don't see how anyone could really need 30-80 gigs of music with them, except if they just like the novelty of having an insane amount of music with them.  The only issue I have with the player is it seems to occasionally have problems playing protected files. Most of the time it plays fine, but every so often it freezes up or takes several minutes to load a protected song. This is a non-issue if you just rip CDs to it, but if you use any sort of online service, it may freeze up from time to time. It usually unfreezes by itself, although a couple times I had to reformat the hard drive, and once had to just let the battery die out.  Despite this, the player plays fine 99% of the time. The Philips player is a fine alternative to the overpriced ipod.

<Title>Poor battery life, "blotchy" appearance
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved this MP3 player when I first received it - I thought it sounded great and looked very cool. BUT I was unhappy to discover how "blotchy" it looks after even minimal handling - it vividly shows every single fingerprint & smudge on every surface of the player. AND despite boasting a robust battery life, I could never get it to play longer than 2+ hours without needed to recharge it (even after trying every suggestion in the owner's manual and on the Philips website). I decided to return it and get an iRiver, which has worked great.

<Content>At first the thing worked fine. I liked the way it looked, the color are very nice and vivid, everything was good. Occasionally it would freeze up and then I would get it reset and everything was ok. Then the other day when I turned it on I heard a clicking sound and then received an error message that said "plug the player into the computer". It was the first time I received that message so I got a little suspicious. I plugged it in and nothing happened. I went on the website and uninstalled and re-installed a ton of stuff. I downloaded stuff from the site and NOTHING worked. Days of this and now I'm about to throw this piece of junk away. I'm on amazon right now looking for another mp3 player

<Title>Had to send for repairs twice
<Date>Sat Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player has a problem that requires it to be sent for service to the repair center.  Occasionally, on a power down, and then the subsequent power on, the Philips GOGEAR will become frozen with the advise to plug your GOGEAR to your PC.  And when you attach the GOGEAR to the PC the Device Manager will not recognize the MP3 player.  Therefore you cannot repair the GOGEAR.  A soft reset will not work (power button and volume + button at same time).  You call customer service and they are helpful, but the only thing that you can do in this situation is send the GOGEAR to the repair center.  This is the second time this has happened to me.  Once with the PHILIPS 6 GB HDD1630/17 and now the second time with the replacement model they sent me HDD1635/17.  The only reason I give this item 2 stars is because when it works it is great.  And the customer service representative is helpful.  But that being said it is frustrating having to repair the items.  I was under warrenty and have not had to pay anything outside  the shipping and handling to get the GOGEAR to the repair center.  But I am not sure I would pay anymore money on an item that is cronically breaking.

<Title>Love it when it works (aka MOST of the time)
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Go Gear for over a year and most of the time its wonderful. The battery lasts me all day, sound is great, no problem with navigation. Then there are the times when it acts up...For some reason, and I can't identify any cause, there are times when the battery doesn't charge fully and when navigating back to the main menu doesn't work smoothly.  There have been a few times when the player has frozen up, but these are pretty rare and were resolved with the soft reset (pwr + up vol). The rubber cover that comes with the player is all but useless, so I wish I had purchased the control case from the start so my player wouldn't have the few scratches it has on the front. With the control case, the player is fully protected and can be hung on a belt loop or pack. Over all, I really like this player. It has been a great alternative to the iPOD empire and I would buy Philips again.

<Title>A pretty good mp3 player
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3 player about a year ago, and its been a pretty good one so far. It has excellent picture quality and the scrolling bar in the middle is very nice. I have 2 complaints about it.   1. I have had to send it back because when i turned it on, it gave me an error message and i couldn't do anything on it. After they sent me a new one it worked just fine.  2. Once you put a lot of songs on it (close to 1,000 or so) it starts to perform slowly. For example if i choose to play a song, it will take at least 5 seconds to start playing, and then another 20 seconds to load up the songs information. And it gets really annoying.  All in all i think it is a pretty good mp3 player for the price, but i would suggest (if u dont want an ipod) to get Creative because that is the other mp3 player i had, and i am thinking of getting another one from Creative.

<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This has got to be the worst player I've ever purchased.  I bought the 8gig version from Wal-Mart and returned it 3 days later.  I spent the first day trying to get Windows Media player to recognize the device.  After finally doing that, this thing too 16 HOURS to transfer 6.5 gigs worth of music.  And to top things off, after the transfer, not all the songs were on the device and some of the songs were only partially there. (they would play for 30 seconds or so and that was it.)  The interface isn't the greatest either.  It was slow and sometimes froze up for several seconds.  I highly DO NOT recommend this product.  I ended up purchasing the 30gig IPOD.  MUCH better product.  Only took 10 mins to transfer the same amount of songs.  The layout and interface is easier to navigate and see also.

<Content>I've had a lot of Mp3/Wma players, and this one still took me by surprise. After all the reviews I read about this one, I expected much, much more.  Cons:  Non-standard connection USB. (cubersome too) Touchy buttons. Forgets everything you put in it, randomly. Totaly reliant on Windows Media Player. (very slow) Doen't work as an external hard drive. (at least not for non-system files)  Pros:  Looks cool. 6gb hard drive holds lots of stuff. Nice picture, although small screen. Easy to navigate. Radio reception was good. Sound quality was good. (and loud)  Maybe I just got a bad one. I was willing to overlook the USB cord. Even willing to put up with using Windows Media Player for tranfers. All because it looked good, and using it was a great experience. But, when it decided to forget all the music I had put on it, which took all night, and for no apparent reason, that was the last straw!  I'm giving 2 stars insted of one, because I still believe I just got a bad one. But with so many better players avalible, I wasn't willing return it for another one. I bought a Zen Micro 8gb for only a little more, and I love it. Still doen't act as an external hard drive, but otherwise, VERY COOL!  P.S. Are people starting to prefer players that rely on software? Give me the good ol' Plug-n-Play variety.

<Title>Absolutely NOT User-Friendly
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In my latest attempt to become part of the 21st century, I decided to do some research and buy an MP3 player.  After many hours of looking, I decided on this player--a good deal money-wise for the 6GB of memory...but...  This has got to be the most cumbersome and not user-friendly piece of computer hardware I have ever used or seen.    Let me list the ways:  1. As soon as I unpackaged the player and attempted to use the software that is supplied with it, I learned something about my computer...make sure your XP is updated.  The supplied software required me to have at least Service Pack 1.  Spent about 3 hours dealing with that.  2. I unwrap the rest of the package to find this absolutely cumbersome power cord/USB cable.  They are attached.  3. With the player's reliance on Windows Media Player (WMP), I have learned two things.  First, WMP is crap.  Second, the downloading took forever.  150 songs took me about 4 hours to download, mainly due to the fact that as I downloaded music, the computer would intermittenly stop recognizing the Philips player as an external source, so I had to unplug and plug back in the USB every 5-10 songs to keep the downloads going.  Needless to say I couldn't leave my computer, otherwise nothing would have ever gotten downloaded.  4.  Once I did get those songs downloaded, I left the player overnight, only to come back to it in the morning to have NONE of the songs on the player.  They were unexplainably (is that a word?) gone.  5.  Finally, there are absolutly NO accessories on the market for this product.  Needless to say, this piece of crap was returned within 5 days of receiving it.  DO NOT waste your money or time!!

<Content>I got this to replace a Zen Micro because the store didn't have a replacement. What a mistake! Although it is very sleek looking and the color screen is nice, there are too many negatives to ignore. The headphones sound awful, I had to use a pair I already had. The interface is very cumbersome and it was PAINFULLY slow to transfer music to the device, because I had to download first to Windows Media Player--you cannot transfer directly from a CD to the device. I also don't like the control buttons on the side, and the hold button does not eliminate the change in volume. Not a great design.  Also, after 10 days it died. Nothing, nada--lost all data (but it is all on my PC with media player), and it wouldn't take a charge. I am getting another Micro. Much better device for the money, and much easier to use.   I was very disappointed.

<Title>Nice Design. Lousy headphone and case.
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>PRO: I was really impressed with the design. Nice and compact. With 6 gig of memory, can't go wrong with that. I already have Windows Media version 10 installed. But I installed the the disc(s) that came with it anyway. (The second disc load the software where you can check if you have the latest firmware). As soon as I pluged it in it Yahoo music recognized it right away. Transfer the music from Yahoo to the device is also a breeze, about 10 second for each song. The sound is pretty good. Came with buitl-in radio. Not that I'll ever get to use it but it could come in handy if needed to.  Cons:  Lousy headphone. For this price can't they give better headphone. It looks like the one they give away on the plane.It doesn't really fit in your ears that good.  Lousy case. With the price almost $200.00 all you get is a rubber case. I expect a genuine leather case or something.  Take a couple seconds to skip between song.  To sum it up. It's not a really bad product for the price compare to Ipod. I kind of like yahoo music and it's compatible with this device and that's a plus. So far I'm loving it.

I kno i can't say much about its performance because i havent had that much experience with it, but it is well worth its money.. considering that the features of the same-price Nano are terrible compared to this.  If youre in the market for a cheap mp3 player with a good amount of storage.. dont even look at the nano.. come right to this.  As for the case, it isnt very good, but who says Philips has to supply a good case?  I like the case, except for that fact that you cant charge it while its on.  I dont like the cords for the charger and USB because they are attached.  If I could plug it in close to my computer it would work out great, but i cant.  So thats pretty much it.. im lovin it for the hour ive had it!

The Toshiba has the same price point with a larger hard drive   and a larger screen also. I could never get my photos to show up on the Phililps, a feature I was very excited about when I got the unit home. All the music disappeared off my unit a couple of times and the front controls are just to sensative. I've only had the Toshiba for about a day now and already I much happier with the unit. I was actually able to transfer my photos onto the unit with a problem.

<Title>Loved it until it stopped working... tech support is terrible
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player back in January, at the last minute choosing the Philips over the Zen Micro I'd had my eye on for a while.  The Philips player looks better, and most of the reviews I had read were positive.  The player worked well enough for a while: I had no problem loading songs onto it and the sound was good enough for my purposes.  The buttons are a little touchy, and so navigating was sometimes a little frustrating, but that was only ever a minor annoyance.  Then, two days ago, the player froze up on me.  It had done this before, and I reset it as I had done in the past, but when it powered up again, it was giving me an error message, telling me to connect it to my PC.  When I got home I connected it, but neither the device manager nor WMP would recognize the device, so I wasn't able to repair it.  I also noticed a soft clicking sound coming from the device as it was starting up--kind of like a small harddrive trying to spin up and failing.  I did a bunch of uninstalling and reinstalling, just to be sure, but at this point I'm pretty sure that I'm dealing with a hardware problem.    The real problem, however, is that I can't seem to get Philips to recognize this.  I called them once, waiting on hold for over 20 minutes, and tried to explain the problem, but I was told to reinstall the device manager from the website.  When this didn't work, I tried using the online chat function on the support site, hoping to avoid long hold times, but apparently hold times at Philips are not to be avoided.  So I tried emailing them, explaining what I'd done to fix the problem and why I think the unit needs to be repaired or exchanged, only to receive a reply saying, "Your concern with the unit needs further technical assistance" (my concern needs further assistance...?) and giving me instructions for doing everything I had already done to try to fix the problem.  At this point, I'm resigned to fighting with Philips until they replace the unit, if only because I don't like the idea of being out $200, but I suspect that it is going to be a long fight.  As far as I'm concerned, it's Philips' tech support that "needs further technical assistance."

<Title>Junk and customer service is a bad joke
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just bought this HDD1630 and spent 2 hours trying to get it to work. Tech support was the worst, like speaking to a rock. Sorry, a rock has more knowledge then Philips tech support. Installed all of their software and was told that Philips onlys sells the mp3 player but dose not support the software. In short if you want to waste your time and pull your hair out then I would go out and buy this Philips product now. If you want to listen to music or audio books then do what I did and return this piece of junk and go out and buy a sandisk for less money and enjoy.

<Title>"Please...not AGAIN!"
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I honestly have to say, I'm really not impressed. For the last three days in a row, I have purchased and had to return three different mp3 players! This Philips being the last I bought. The first two were 4GB RCA's, (sorely, I bought these at Walmart for $139.00) and finally the third was this Philips version which I purchased from Circuit City (this time with their 2-year warranty!)  Each one of these had the exact same problem--A defected earphone connection!! I mean 'come on', this is ridiculous--I could half-way expect this from Walmart, but getting it from a more reliable source like Circuit City and paying $199.00--thats $60.00 more for a so-called better product, and 'still' getting the same problem is... well, lets just say that its an understatement to call it frustrating! My advice to everybody is this: If your gonna purchase this Philips or any mp3 or ipod then do yourself a favor- Go to a 'more reliable' source that offers inexpensive extra warranty coverage-- it is definitely worth it since Philips tech support is time-consuming and nearly useless (this trouble is not uncommon even among other brands)and your bound to have problems with pretty much 'any' digital audio device sooner or later. "GOOD LUCK"!

<Title>Great features, bad shelf-life
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really enjoyed the ease of use and other fun features like the picture albums.  The battery life was fantastic.  The integration with Windows media player was great (no third party P2P needed).  But...notice I am writing in past tense...the hard-drive died a couple of months into my deployment to Afghanistan.  Not a great time to be without tunes.  So I contacted customer support.  At first they said it was out of warranty. Which was weird, because they only started making them less than a year ago!?  Then they said they would replace it, but I couldn't ship it to them from overseas.  So I had to ship it back to my wife who had to call philips and get an RMA and a UPS label and finally ship it to the factory and get it back and mail it back to me.  Anyway, I am not too impressed with the quality of the product or the customer service experience.

<Title>Excellent Player If you update it.
<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I started off with an Ipod mini 4 GB. I was very happy with it until it busted on me. Internal chip became unsoldered. Very difficult to repair. I searched around for MP3 players with approximately the same space. I will never get a nano because of the cost. The Philips MP3 player has a great storage capacity for the money.  When I first got this player, I was dissapointed. It had tremendous lag. Skipping to the next track would take about 5 seconds. It seemed very sluggish. I did some searching and decided to update the firmware to V 2.1. Since the update, the player seems to be working great. It made a huge difference in the response time of the player.   As for the battery life.... I do not get the 17 hours that they advertise. But I didn't get the 18 hours that the ipod mini claims either. I like using the features of eq enhancements, shuffle, etc. I would say I get approx 8 hours of use. It is a very acceptable amount of time considering the battery draining factors I throw into the mix.  Overall I would recommend this player. Best storage capacity for the price. It seems to be more durable than ipods.

<Content>The philips gogear is sleek, reliable, and just plain awesome! It holds 3 times more than the 2 GB ipod nano, has fm radio, radio and voice recording, and better sound quality for the same price. occasionally the screen freezes, but simply restart it and it works fine after that. I like how the buttons light up when you touch them.     Overall,this is a great kid/teenager mp3 player, that holds over 700 songs if you have it on the highest sound quality. I'm 14, and I think its great.

<Title>All's well....until last week.
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My parents bought me the Philips GoGear last Christmas. The player was wonderful. Everything I wanted on it, I had space for, and it didn't cost much. The screen wasn't as big as the Toshiba I had been wanting, but when I got my hands on it, I really enjoyed it.  All was well. I had to restart it maybe once after it froze, but that was not too much of a problem.  Everything was going perfectly, until late last week.  I had bought a new pair of earbuds because my Sony earbuds had started to static (my second pair since the original Philips earbuds), and when I put them in I realized I was getting the same problem: static and no sound. In a brand new pair of earbuds, I realized, as I hadn't before, that it wasn't the earbuds, but the player.  One morning on my way to school I tried to turn on my Philips.  After holding the power button for about 10 seconds (only supposed to be 3), I was greeted with a warning message telling me to connect my mp3 player to my computer.  All my music had been erased.  So when I get home, I redo the music, format it, and reinstall the software. It seemed okay, but it still took long for it to come on, but it did.  Now, just today, I try to turn on my Philips but there is nothing.  I give it to a friend to try to turn in on, and he shakes it.  There is a rattling inside the player.  I would call Philips to get a new player, but they put the serial number on a sticker on the back of the player, which naturally, as time goes on, becomes unreadable.  So now I am stuck with a useless mp3 player, and no serial number to get a new one.

<Title>Not As Cool As It Looks . . .
<Date>Wed Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unfortunately, this item is nowhere near as good as it should be - There are a few good things about it, but the negatives definitely overshadow the positives - especially for me because my previous MP3 player was a CREATIVE NANO which was simple click and drag using Windows without installing special software to add files to the device - This is NOT the case with the Philips GoGear - I'll try to break it down to prove why I gave this item such a low rating.  Positives -   1.) Cool design 2.) Capable of displaying your digital images on a color screen  Negatives - 1.) Loading music is anything but simple because installation of the factory software is mandatory in order to add files to the device. 2.) When connected to a PC's USB port, the device isn't assigned a temporary drive letter for easy file transfer using drag and drop. 3.) The quality of the color screen is comparable to an early color cell phone - (something similar to the Nokia 0001 model)  Overall, if you're just about the music I would recommend the Creative ZEN NANO - If you want performance with looks I would recommend an Apple Ipod NANO it has the ability to display your digital images in color and can hold massive amounts of music.

<Title>A lot of flash, but no bang.  Caveat emptor, i.e., buyer beware!
<Date>Fri Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this item as an alternative to the iPOD nano b/c of its looks and 6GB hard drive.  Those considerations did not help much at all, however, when I could not get the device to sync properly with Windows Media Player 10 ("WMP 10").  The music showed up on WMP 10 when the device was plugged to my USB port, but did not when it was not connected.  Altogether, I wasted about 3 hours trying to add music to this player after installing the Phillips plug-ins, but to no avial.  I would not recommend this player to anyone who seeks a user friendly product.  Save the time and consider another product.  It is really too bad that this design amounts to little of nothing in the end.  I gave it one star so that I could emphasize the fact that it is a NEGATIVE star.  I certainly hope that this saves you the time.  For the record... I am somewhat computer savvy, and that did not help me at all.  The old maxim "caveat emptor" ("buyer beware") definitely applies to this product.  -GCB

<Title>Great product!
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I felt I needed to write this review to clear up a few negative comments made:  "The music showed up on WMP 10 when the device was plugged to my USB port, but did not when it was not connected."  -Not quite clear what you are saying here.  Do you mean the music residing on the HDD1630 or music residing on your hard drive?  Music on any MP3 player WILL NOT show up in the device explorer when you unplug it from your computer.  "Altogether, I wasted about 3 hours trying to add music to this player after installing the Phillips plug-ins, but to no avial."  -You actually do not need the plugin to use your player.  I have used my HDD1630 on multiple computers and did not need the plugin to sync/view music with Media Player 10.  "Loading music is anything but simple because installation of the factory software is mandatory in order to add files to the device."  -This is a false statement if using Windows XP and Media Player 10.  Even WITHOUT the factory software, the HDD1630 will show us as a another drive in Windows Explorer (if you like dragging and dropping...although you need Media Player or something like Napster to transfer encrypted WMA files to ANY player).  Also, WITHOUT the factory software, you can transfer files with Media Player by using the Sync function.  "When connected to a PC's USB port, the device isn't assigned a temporary drive letter for easy file transfer using drag and drop."  -As stated above, when using Windows XP, the device WILL show up as another drive in Explorer (which is more than I can say for the Dell Jukebox which requires it's Explorer plugin installed to even view it)  Please note that I have not tested the HDD1630 with earlier operating systems.  "The quality of the color screen is comparable to an early color cell phone - (something similar to the Nokia 0001 model)"  -Please leave opinions out of reviews.  People, like me, use reviews to help them make the correct decision, based on their requirements in a product, when making a purchase.  Using opinions in your reviews is like saying "Don't buy apples because they taste bad."  (I'm going to go against what I just said, but for the purpose of debate, when viewing pictures with the HDD1630, they looked just as good as when viewing them with my digital camera display.)  My Review:  Positive: 1)  Great style 2)  Easy navigation 3)  Easy to add audio files using only the basic programs offered with Windows XP (any edition) 4)  Photos looked good when viewing them on the HDD1630  Negative: 1) Data and Power cable can not be detached from themselves, which is annoying when wanting to ONLY charge player or ONLY transfer files. 2) Maybe others had better luck, but the radio reception was poor with the builtin FM tuner. 3) Rubber protective sleeve covered up the data/power port (I used a razor bladed to cut open a hole so I didn't have to remove the sleeve when charging/transfering files).  Overall:  Good product and accessories.  Checkout the docking cradle with IR remote control.

<Title>I love this player, I took back my iPod 30gb video for it!
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off iPod is by no means a bad product, it just didn't have what I wanted.  An FM tuner and the ability to obtain my music from somewhere other than iTunes. This is the sweetest little player I've ever seen or played with.  I also tried a creative Zen touch, the software was a nightmare.  The software for the GoGear is easy and fun.  I would suggest doing a manual sync or you might get tunes you don't want.  The FM tuner is awesome and I have no trouble picking up and adding all my favorite stations.  The screen allows you to choose between two background skins and you can run a photo slideshow while you listen.  It automatically finds album art which comes up when the song is playing, if you're not using the photo slide show. Philips offers a great case as well as a docking station for the GoGear. With the exception that it is not compatible with [...] and hopefully it will be eventually, the Philips 6GB GoGear is an incredible, overlooked player.  Did I mention you can record both voice and FM with it?  What more is there to say, a great player for those looking for an alternative to the iPod and other well known brands.  Give it a try I promise you won't be sorry!

<Title>The best PlaysForSure mp3 player
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my hands on a Philips GoGear HDD1630 music player, and I have to say this is the best portable music player for you if youre interested in subscription based music (Napster, AOL MusicNow, Yahoo Music Unlimited etc).  The player does not require installation of any additional software on Windows XP (contrary to what the manual says). Just plug it into your XP SP2 computer, and XP should recognize the device, and you should be ready to go. I did not have to install any software to get this to work with Napster To Go or Windows Media player.  What I like:  1. Its looks The player itself is glossy black plastic, and feels very solid (like a slab of black granite). Unfortunately, it is VERY fingerprint prone - just dont let the FBI get their hands on it if youre in the run ;-) The player is very light, and will easily fight in your pocket or on an armband.  The backlight for the controls is blue in color, and looks very sexy.   2. The controls: The controls are very easy to use, and very sensitive. Navigation is very easy, just slide your finger up and down the strip.   3. Album art The player automatically syncs album art from Windows Media Player if the art is present on your computer. Thats a nice touch.  4. View pictures You can sync JPEG images to the player, and view them on the go.  5. Battery life The player lasts an average of 16-17 hours per charge - pretty cool!  What I dont like:  1. Since this is a relatively new player, accessories arent available.   2. Long-term support from Philips is questionable.   Overall, this is the best portable music player if youre interested in PlaysForSure (subsciption music). It poses some serious competition to the Ipod Nano, and is highly recommended.

Adding Mp3s was so simple. The fm tuner was amazing. The voice recording was surprisingly ok. Then, on the third of having it in my possession, it just quit. I charged it. I let it rest. It just wouldn't turn back on. I had barely used it. I hope that it just happened to be the one I received. If so, I would change my rating in a heart beat. The two is for 2 days it did work. The main problem is that now I am very scared of buying an mp3 player. I don't know who to trust.

<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received this little MP3 player for my birthday in place of an IPod due to the shortage of IPods in this area.  I must say that I am overly pleased with this item.  It holds tons of songs, the play back is very nice, FM tuner is great, options are nice, mine came with a docking cradle, usb cord with power cord, little rubber sleave, ear buds and of course software.  The screen; however small, is very easy to ready and very bright making pictures very visable.    The only things that I find a little frustrating with the actual player is that the battery charge does not hold for as long as I expected it to.  The software which is Windows Media supported is a bit confusing and one needs to work with it if they a novice with WMP.  All in all this is a great little player for the money.  Especially for students on the go.

<Title>Great player, until it crashed and burned...
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this player last year for christmas, and for the most part was fairly happy with it, until a few months later it suddenly died. It was never dropped or misused in anyway. But if you are looking to buy this, please consider the good and bad.  The good:  -Very sleek design, although the black finish has a tendency to amplify any wear and tear (not to mention fingerprints)  -The intuitive interface is exetremely easy to use and remember (although it can get to be a minor annoyance when you forget to enable the hold button)  -Decent capacity for the hard drive it carries vs. other 6gb players. The programing (which is present when you buy the player that accounts for that space you couldn't fit that last gotta have song on it) doesn't actually take up much space, leaving you with more space for what's really important: MUSIC!!!  -You have the ability to place pictures on the device, albeit this can get somewhat confusing since you have to use windows media plays for sure programing and the software (included) vs. drag and drop (so much less time consuming) to actually add your pics to your player.  -USB 2.0 makes for some quick downloads to the hardware after you've finally got everything you want on windows media. (tip: try getting all the music/photo files you want in one folder, the adding it to your playlist and synch the playlist directly to the device. This also saves time in the future of it dumps)   OK, I tried hard to think of the good of the GoGear HDD 1630. And Honestly for the short few months that i did have it, I loves it more then my wife, BUT this device does have some major and critical problems:  -You can take perfect care of it and it will still give you problems.  -There is some MAJOR lag times in between screens, sometimes worse then on my home PC.  -Song transition can take up to four or more seconds when manually skipping through tracks.  -Customer service is outright terrible. Representitives are rude and unhelpfull and require you to pay for shipping and handling both ways to just look at the player and decide whether or not it is viable for them to fix it or replace it with a refurbished player, with a tirn around time of one to three plus months. (and I'm sorry with a possibility of downloading porn onto the player I really dont wish to take my chances with one that belonged to someone else, call me paranoid)  -Within the first hour of owning the GoGear, before even trying to load it with music it froze up on me and wouldn't turn off or do anything. I'm sorry but a brand new, out of the package device shouldn't require customer service withong the hour unless it was a thermo-nuclear bomb and it was counting down in my hand.  I really am trying to be fair in rating this problem, there are some awesome highlights to buying the Phillips GoGear Hdd1630. And in all honesty I would buy this product a second time around, considerering that the problems were fixed

<Title>Machine Doesn't Work
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched so many different Mp3 players before purchasing the Go Gear. I had owned an iPod mini before but it broke and so I was faced with getting a new one. When I recieved my Go Gear I was blown away with the style and finishing touches on it. It is really attractive. If only the hardware was as wonderful. It requires using Windows Media Player which is a CRAPPY program to begin with and the Go Gear doesn't like using it. After working with it for 3 whole days, 18 hours a day, I finally decided to return it, giving up hope that it would be useful to me. I was severely disappointed with it and do not reccomend it to ANYONE. I do however reccomend the refurbished products at apple.com. If you can swallow bowing to apple (which just makes it easier to get accessories and useful tools) you can get ALOT for your money and it has a year warranty. Just a thought. I ended up buying a 20GB iPod (not the color one) for less than what I paid for the Go Gear.

<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read the reviews and I was somewhat hesitent to buy this product, however, the features and memory it offered for the price, I did it.  What a great call by me.  This thing is awesome!  I have over 600 songs on it so far and it isn't even half full.  You can listen by playlist, artist, genre, album, or just shuffle the whole thing and go with it.     The things I was worried about based on other reviews were:  People wrote that it froze up on them (as many computers do). It happened to me about a week after I got it and I just about lost it.  However, istead of wriying a negative review, I went to the Philips website and found the solution to my problem in less than 5 minutes.  All you need to do is press power and volume up at the same time and it resets itself without losing any music or photos.  Personally I didn't like the headphones that came with it, so I went out and got others for $10.  It does show fingerprints, but they just wipe off - no big deal.  For what's out there, I highly recommend this product.  Big features at a small price.  Go for it!

<Title>Too Much Stress for an MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was lured into purchasing the GoGear because of its good looks. I'll admit it; it looks absolutely awesome. The scroller lights up when you use it, and it's quite small (though not as small as a nano, but at least it won't break the second you drop it).  However, I really regretted buying the GoGear; when I tried to sync my music to it with WMP, I spent an hour waiting for the process to finish (I have lots of music). Then, when I unplugged it and looked at the player, there was no music on it. After trying to load the songs onto it three or four times (spending an hour or more each time), the music finally worked. Then, I decided to load my photos onto it. It didn't work. I called tech support. I spent a very long time on hold. Finally, I spoke to someone. He had NO CLUE what to do... he put me on hold, and by the time he got back, I had managed to load a couple of photos onto it. Then, I went to spend the night at my sister's house. On the way there, it froze and there was no way for me to reset it. I ended up having to leave it on until the battery life went out (and lucky me, the battery life is INCREDIBLY long.)  I ended up returning it the next day, because simply getting it to work was more stress than I needed. At first I thought the one I purchased was just defective, but after reading some of these reviews, all GoGears are just poorly manufactured.  Seriously, don't buy this.

<Title>2 times defective
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first one we bought had a faulty display and music kept disappearing.  Tech support was rude & dismissive.  And the voice recognition menus to get there were torturous.  We exchanged the unit for another one.  This one will not load music correctly.  Tech support is again unable to help.  We are returning #2 and getting another brand entirely.  Beware of Phillips.  Lousy support.  Very difficult product.

<Title>Great MP3 player!!!
<Date>Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this MP3 player! It is compact and similiar to an iPod, but better! It has a nice colorful screen. With this product though, you have to lightly tap the the buttons, since it is touch sensitive. Other than that, I really love it. However, in order for you to upload your music to this player, you need WINDOWS XP!!! It is stated on the box and CD that comes with it. For the price, I highly recommend it, and it less than what the iPod costs for 1500 songs with 6GB. You can't beat that!!!

<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is great !! I have had mine for 3 months now. I use it almost ever day. It is easy to use. Slick black look, wonderful color display. Easy to use. I have the iriver fm transmitter to plug it in to in the car. They work great together. With 6 GB I can fit more than enough of my music.

<Title>good when it works
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>mine broke and I had to send it back. It took a month before it came back. The best thing about it is that it is napster to go compatable. In napster to go you can get as many songs as you want for free. but you don't own them its more like renting. you only have to pay 15$ a month.there is a couple of songs you do have to buy sometimes though.one bad thing is that if you are at like all tracks and your at song 400 or something you have skip through the rest of the songs and it takes really long so if you do that you should just reset it.  When you turn it off it might have a little clock and it takes awhile before its really off when it is doing that don't reset because you will lose all your all your songs and you'll have to download them all over and if you have a lot of songs it takes a long time.to reset hold the power button and the + volume for 3 seconds.

<Title>Nice Player, Horrible Software Interface
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>No drag & drop -- You have to use Windows Media Player to organize, add, or remove files. The process is confusing, redundant, time-consuming and annoying. In order to add one or two songs to an extensive list of music already on the player, the entire list is "synchronized", wasting time and often losing some of the songs. Things can be apparently added or removed via the media player software, but later checking the device you find out they weren't. If you organize the playlists, the next time you add music, new playlists are created, even if you put the music into an older folder. If you have music and/or pictures in multiple folders on your computer harddrive, the player software insists on creating multiple folders on the device. It's nice once you get past the poor interface, but I'm not sure it's worth the headache.  If you're short-tempered, as I am, do not buy this player! You'll end up bashing it against the wall out of sheer frustration. (I haven't bashed it yet, but I've come close! ;)

<Title>Look Before You Leap
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I began searching for a digital audio player as an alternative to carrying around a suitcase of CDs when on the road.  I admit, what attracted me to the GoGear was the sleek, stylish look, the amount of hard disk memory, and price.  I didn't mind it being Windows XP (and .wma file) compatible because I had just recently purchased a brand new PC with XP as the operating system, with Windows Media Player standard and already loaded.  That to me made it the perfect fit.  After about a month of normal use and functioning properly for the most part, the first one froze up on me completely, unable to be reset or reset itself.  Tech support couldn't tell me a single thing that I hadn't already figured out on my own.  After sending it off for repair, Philips told me to allow 15-30 days for return.  My third contact/inquiry with them was after it had been over *60* days from the date of shipment.  About a week later, I ended up getting a brand new one as a replacement, so it's hard to argue with that.  The problem that I have with both units is that once I get the hard disk about 2/3 full, it has a tendency to "choke" and then "throw up" every single thing that I had loaded onto it.  When I would "Explore Device", WMP would show me everything that (I thought) I had just loaded onto it as normal, but when I disconnected the device, it showed all lists as empty.  Extremely annoying and frustrating when you've spent an hour or two trying to load the thing up and thinking you're good to go.  Here's how I remedied my problem...when I finally got a free day, I "babysat".  Instead of trying to synchronize 200-300 songs at a time, I would synchronize no more than 30-40 songs at a time, and when I had completed synchronizing each letter in the alphabet, I would disconnect the device, let it load up, check the contents, and then listen to at least one song in it's entirety.  Overkill, to be sure.  But it worked.  I ended up loading over 1200 songs (@ 128 kbps) into the GoGear, and it plays just fine...for now.  It took me the better half of daylight to do it (towards the end, it got reaaaallly SLOOOW), but after shelling out two hundred bucks, I had more time than money.  I personally think that the headphones are stellar, but I can see how someone having trouble getting or keeping them in their ears properly might think otherwise.  The sound quality is very good.  The battery life is excellent.  The 5-band EQ is another great feature that comes in especially handy when using the player for the main reason I bought it (playing it through your car stereo).    The sensory touchpad is at times a little too sensitive and other times not sensitive enough, but the navigation system is easy to use and pretty quick.  The USB connector and AC battery charger being one in the same cord is both a gift and a curse.  The protective pouch comes in handy, and you had better use it because the unit is pretty small and kind of slippery to boot (read: prone to be dropped).  The FM tuner works great outdoors, OK indoors.  I've never tried to load a picture onto it or use the voice recorder, and probably never will.  I personally found a happy medium, but as much as I want to, I can't wholeheartedly endorse this player with a clear conscience, let alone recommend it.  It's actually a pretty good player once you get it to do what you want, but WMP and the ineptitude and turnaround time of tech support notwithstanding, the software is way too buggy and the process I had to go through in order to get it to work (for me) is way too time consuming to make it anything more than satisfactory.  Not to mention that I literally shudder at the thought of another freeze-up or adding even one more song to it at this point.  Update: Six weeks later, the process is still very buggy, but we're now up to 1300 songs and no more crashes, so I guess that's worth another half-star. :-)  3.5 Stars

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Here's Why.....I can guarantee you that this product will crash on you within 3 months. I'm willing to bet ANYONE!  1 of the 3 things will happen to your device:  It will suddenly freeze and the only way to turn if off is if you leave it on and let the battery die, OR ALL of the songs you have spent so much time syncing will randomly disappear never to be seen again, OR the buttons will confused themselves, for example; the  volume button will turn the device on and off.  I've exchanged this device 4, YES 4!, times for the same and EACH has crashed in less than 3 months.  My friend also bought one because she liked the look, price, and that it had an FM tuner and voice recorder (same reasons I bought mine, of course).  Anyway, guess where it is now??  CRASHED, DEAD, GARBAGE! within less than a month of her purchase!! But I just loved this MP3 player so much that I was willing to give it 4 chances and put up with Wal-mart's bulls*it policies.  I've finally come to my senses and bought a nice 30GB Ipod (best decision yet) and so has my friend.  We are so much happier without Philips in our lives.  AVOID THIS AND ALL OTHER PHILIPS PRODUCTS like the Plague.  Customer service is a joke and all they have to say is "well let's troubleshoot" ...no thanks, let's give me my damn refund! By the way, compared to an Ipod, this MP3's sound quality is so weak.  What was I thinking?? It's true when they say "You get what you pay for!" GET AN IPOD OR YOU'LL BE SORRY LIKE ME! rate: -3

<Title>this should be waaaay cheaper
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(before i get started, the begining of this article deals with little stuff that just makes you hate this player. for more serious problems that should drive you away from this useless piece of plastic, scroll down a wee bit until you see stuff in caps) this is definitely not the best player on the market. if it were maybe, 100 or even 120 it would be an okay deal for this thing, but the phillips gogear 6 gig mp3 player is pretty bad. i had a rio carbon, and it was sweet. i think rio is going out of buisness or something because suddenly all their stuff is unavailable. oh well. so i got this one because it was relatively cheap, which was a big mistake. the rio at least did its job, play my music, and it was super small and super portable, with the same amount of space (6 gb) and a great battery life. i have had the phillips gogear for 3 months and i am tired of it.  i dont like the touchpad controls because it has a weird delayed reaction that really goofs me up. it takes it about 4 seconds to register that i hit the frickin button. so i end up pressing it a couple of times, which makes it skip to the next song or whatever. it is awkward, counterintuitive, and just feels wrong and stupid. i am getting chills just thinking about it.  Te interface sucks. ill leave it at that. to many flaws to describe. (here is an example: i added songs to a play list, and it just replaced songs that were already there. barf.   also, the screen is miniscule. im barely exaggerating on this one. it cant be more that 2 inches. it has the option to show the album art, but is sucks horribly. i actually cant tell the difference between album covers. i have completely shunned the photo feature on this piece of [...] for that reason, you wont be able to see anything.  NOW HERE IS WHY I REALLY WANT TO GET RID OF THE GOGEAR: 2 major reasons- #1 the battery life is absolutely pathetic. maybe mine is broken or bad, but its a big enough issue to put in here. i already forget what amazon said it was...12 hours? that sounds right.  i get 5 hours tops.  ill let that sink in. maybe you missed it. 5 hours. the gogear wont make it thru a road trip without recharging.  its enought to make me want to pile drive it. i cant even talk about this anymore. except the worst is yet to come...  without a doubt the most annoying thing about this player is that when i hook it up to my computer to add music, which can some times be a pain in the [...] because it takes a couple tries for windows media player to recognize it, because it is a piece of [...] when i unplug the player, i find all my music gone. what the hell. it is so annoying to retransfer all my music, and when i hook it up to the computer again, it says all my music is there, and i just doubled all of my songs, taking up 90% of the space. aaaaagh. so then i have to delete everything and then reretransfer all my music. what i just describes has happened to me THREE times.  to be fair, i will give the gogear a few compliments.  it has fm radio it comes with an ac adapter, which i guess some mp3 players dont.  yeah thats all the good things about it.  bottom line, stay far far away from gogear

<Title>Looks can be deceiving!
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As another reviewer stated, the Phillips HDD16530 is a piece of (....)! I thought I was lucky when I got this item for $99 as an opened product, but I was soooo wrong. I had problems with all my songs disappearing from my device. I had to reload everything 2x. When it got to the 3rd attempt of reloading, it froze! Phillips' technical support was not helpful at all! They suggested I take it back where I received it. When I took it back I wound up paying an additional $100 to get another like it (why I did that, I don't know). Well, this one did fine for almost 2 weeks until I began to add more songs.... the same problems persisted, lost all my songs (by this time I'm up to 1,000), and it froze! I loved the look, the sound, and its size, but the navigation buttons were too sensitive which frustrated me to no end! I thought the headphones were uncomfortable. Needless to say when it froze again, I didn't bother with technical support. I just packed it up and took it back as well. I now have a Zen Microphoto 8 GB by Creative (So far so good). It took no time to transfer my downloads and cd's, plus it was the same price as the Phillips! I did notice that the retail store I purchased the Phillips didn't have any on display, even when I got the "in box". They had it stored underneath their counter. It all makes me wonder about the number of complaints and defects they've received, not to mention Phillips themselves. In a nutshell, looks CAN be deceiving. It's plagued with too many problems.

<Content>I just got this today and it is AWESOME!!!  The battery life is amazing, color screen is flawless, and the design is amazing!! I love the touchscrolls even though they are sensitive. There are also tons of great features like an FM radio tuner that you can record from. Also the voice recorder is great! I got it at a great price at Wal-Mart: $155.00!!! Great hard drive space. It holds approximately 1500 songs. The sound quality is perfect, better than my computer!!!!!! There are way too many features to talk about here. If you're looking for an mp3 player with great everything, this is the player for you. Buy it !!!!!

<Content>This item is really on the cheaper end for mp3 players as far as how many songs it can hold (3,000 vs. the ipod's 1,000). I haven't had any problems with it at all and so far I am pleased. I purchased the device as a replacement for my creative zen micro, which just stopped working all together after a month of limited use. In comparision, this product is much better and more reliable. My only complaint is that the battery doesn't last as long as I'd hoped, but overall I am happy with it.
