<Title>Overall a Very Good MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>About six months ago I was bound and determined to buy and MP3 player.  Before I purchased this player, I had had an iPod.  The sound quality on the player is very good, though, of course, the ear buds are not of the best quality; they're just your average free-with-your-purchase ear buds.  It doesn't take long to charge, but I find that sometimes it doesn't quite last as long as the twelve hours it's supposed to.  Other than that, the performance of it is very good.  The H10 is also very durable; I've taken it with me everywhere without the case on and there still isn't a scratch on it.  It synchs easily with Windows Media Player 10, and had the added feature of storing text files and pictures.  My only small complaints are that a) It isn't an audibleready device, and b) It doesn't come with any amusing little games like iPod does.  All in all, it's a great MP3 player, and I'd buy it again in a second!

<Title>Awesome Player, works well with Yahoo music,and Rhapsody 
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I Brought Player about 6 Months ago. I had the apple ipod 40 gig player Before. I got tired of seeing everyone with the same Player. Player Works like a Charm ! People who were saying it freezes and it trouble transfering songs, have not done the firewire update. Only reason I know is because I was about to throw the player in trash. I called IRIVER to complain and tell them I want a new player, and they explained I needed upgrade. I did this and WOW 1000!!! Difference.   Pro's  Color Screen  Works with Yahoo Music unlimted "Reason Why I brought it"  Battery Life is Good  Gell cover keeps it looking nice.  Speed of transfers  Am/FM  Put photos on it   Cons  Not all that thin, but fits very easily in pocket  Photo Quailty  20 Gig of space !!   Jubril  www.Jubril.com

<Title>A glitch
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The IRiver is great, however there is on glitch.  All of a sudden out of nowhere, it turn on and you can't press any button to turn off the lcd screen.  You can't play anything. It's frozen.  It stays frozen until, until you manually reset. It works fine despite this.  But your battery could pay a toll on this random bizarre event.  I think I'll keep it despite this defect.

<Title>Great player at a great price
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did all of my research in advance and am glad that I did.  This player is great. 1.  Simple interface did not require reading a manual. 2.  Uses Windows Media Player (where I had already been ripping my music). 3.  Very easy to create playlists and rate songs. 4.  Includes an FM tuner. 5.  Includes plug in charge cord. 6.  Good battery life. 7.  Adding on the iRiver FM tuner to use the car stereo works great. 8.  Simple to use with various sites for downloading songs.  My only complaint is that there is not an auto scan or recognition method to see when I have updated or changed my play lists.  You will need to add the playlist to your sync to get it updated.  Not a big deal but I did need to figure it out.  This is a great unit.

<Title>How  bout sending me one that works!!!
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received one from Amazon and it was defective out of the box. Would not charge. Returned it through Amazon's return process and received another one. Had that one for a little over a month and that was defective as well. Was no table to return it through Amazon's site because it was over the 30 day period. I called Amazon and they said they'd mail me a return slip so I could sent it back in. Two weeks went by and no slip. I called Amazon again and they gentleman said he had no record of them sending me a return slip. He said he's send one again. That was last week and still no slip. Right now I'm not happy with Iriver's product or Amazon's customer service.

<Title>Sync problems, CS good on phone, bad online.
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my H10 on Friday and couldn't get the unit to finish its boot sequence.  Using the emergency sync I was able to reformat and install the latest firmware, but the unit still would not boot.  iRiver online customer service didn't help much so I sent them an e-mail (via their system) and on Monday I called.  There was little wait for a phone rep. but he said I'd already done everything I could and that it needed to be returned.  Amazon had a new unit in my hands three days latter.  Way to go Amazon.  35 days after sending my e-mail to iRiver I finally got a response saying they were sorry for the delay and that if my problem persisted to please contact them.  Bottom line, if you have a problem, call, don't wait for online CS to get back to you.  The new unit works well and I'm very pleased with it.  The only problem, as others have mentioned, is the sync function.  I made changes to Windows Media Player library a few times to get things the way I wanted them.  The sync would add the "new" order as new selections and pretty soon I had 4-5 copies of the same songs/albums on the player.  The sync function does not seem to delete or rearrange items on the player, it only adds items to the player.  The only way around this was to delete all the files from the player and sync again. Now things are sync'd between player and WMP as long as I don't delete or move items in WMP. I'm very satisfied with the battery life on this unit.

<Title>I LOVE THIS PLAYER!
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great first time mp3 player. The price is well worth it considering other 20GB players cost far more. The music is easy to download and takes virtually no time at all. PLUS you it holds pictures.  Make sure you have all the latest software and the players works like a charm.  There are quite a few snags but nothing too bad (it freezes up). The resest button clears it up with no loss to memory. Plus my experince with their customer service was really pleasant. I called them with a problem and had an answer and my problem fixed in under 5 minutes. I thought it would be a more tedious process because of what I read from other reviewers but I had a great experience.  Again I would recommend this to any first time MP3 owner or second or third time owner.

<Title>Choose your use carefully
<Date>Fri Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The H10 iriver is a very convienent product to have and it has served me well. If you intend to use it for taping lectures an want to be able to scan to specific points inthe lecture, though, this may not be for you. The Fast forward scanning is slow, it is made mainly for music. If you intend to label your recordings also you need a computer so if you don't hae access this can be irratating. So if you plan to use it for music and downloading this is a very good option for its price. For anything else I think other MP3 players have better options.

<Title>Mixed Bag
<Date>Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 player last year to hold all my awesome punk music. I had no trouble using Windows Media Player to upload songs. The interface is easy to use and has several other features besides just being an mp3 player. My friends and I used it to record our band's music. There's tons of memory so its pretty cool. However its not perfect. Besides the record feature I've never used any of the other special non-mp3 player features. Also its diesed. My friends call it "the brick" because its so big. The smaller models have detachable batteries but this one doesn't which sucks because tt has to be sent back when the battery completely dies (supposedly 2 years). Once in a blue moon it freezes up but its not very often. Bottom Line: It works pretty well and serves its purpose.

<Title>Save your money
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing looks good and sounds good --- everything else about it is poor. So far I've had two (the second was a factory swap out).  The second was only slightly better than the first. Battery life is short and the DC cable needed to power it in the car is not available and, (according to their official web site) won't be until October 2006. That is the top of the list then there is the issue of turning it self on without being touched.  I would sell mine in a heartbeat except I would feel guilty about ripping someone else off knowing what this thing really is... My feeling is that this is a fly by night outfit... My advise is to look elsewhere for a more reliable and better engineered product.

<Content>I had this a total of five days before it broke. I sent it in to be fixed. They sent it back a month later. It still didn't work and I have to send it back again. I think they are trying to outlast the three month warranty. You are better off paying a few more dollars for a more reliable player. This has been a total headache and a waste of money.

<Title>It's not bad, considering I only paid 130 for it...
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I bought mine for 130 bucks. It was factory refurbished with 90 day warranty. I'm going to outline all of my issues with it:  PROBLEMS  - When I first received it, I was amazed at how awesome it looked and felt. But, this player is suppose to be plug and play. My computer system is custom built, and did not pick up the mp3 player. On my mothers Dell, it picked it up immediately. I contacted Support, and they were useless. Worked all week trying to figure it out, then just bought a usb2.0 hub, and now it works fine. I researched this problem a little more and found that it's a common problem with this player. - It is kind of bulky... would have liked it to be smaller - I really don't like the programming on it. You have to go into settings to change shuffle, repeat... eq's... and so forth. Kind of annoying. - Scrolling for songs on this is completely annoying. It is touch-type scrolling, but not as simple and easy as an Ipod. Ipod's is circular while this just up and down. I have over 2,000 songs and it takes forever to get to middle tracks, even when I increase the scroll speed in the settings.  THE GOOD  - It is fairly cheap... - Works with napster, yahoo unlimited... windows media player playforsure... - The sound is pretty good, earphones are okay... - Comes with a rubber case/skin to protect it

<Title>Who needs an iPod??
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So after a year of owning one, my iRiver H10 was stolen from me a week ago from my workplace. Currently I am in the market of looking for a new mp3 player, so I thought while I was at it I'd give a review of my 'ol grey  The Good:   Comes with tons of extra excessories that you cant get with the iPod. Built in FM tuner, voice recorder, text viewer, and a browser that easily lets you access any of these in a second.  Colorful screen and sleek look make it a very attractive player. The size never once bothered me, in fact it was perfect  Personal preference I know, but I way prefer the up-down scroll over the circle. It's way easier to go from track to track. As well the buttons on the side make it easy to go from track to track even if its in your pocket.    The Bad:  Viewing the mp3's through windows was excruciatingly slow, but mainly because I almost had mine completely full. Still though, if other people have said the same thing, then I guess it wasn't only mine...  After a while of having all my albums on my mp3 player, I one day turned it on to find that it had reversed all the track orders. I took off all the songs and put them back on, which temporarily fixed it, but after a while it did the same thing. I soon realized that it was in fact listing the songs in order of most recently played. I tried to find a solution to the problem, but with no luck. And don't let other people fool you. I checked the ID3 tags a million times and they were numbered correctly, and should've been in correct order. I just don't know why it did that!  I also found that the random fuction was a bit weird. I kept on hearing the same songs over and over again. After a long time I realized that it was randomizing only within a few letters. So if I had started off with a song that started with an A, then it only would've played the songs with the letters A, B, or C in the beginning. If I got tired of the ABC songs, I'd have to scroll down to F or G, or wayyy down to M or N. This got pretty frustrating, but I don't know if this was only my player, and I'm  fairly certain there was no feature on the player that made it this way.    So all in all, it was a great player for me. It got me through some boring lectures and lengthy bus rides. I'll miss the hell out of it, but I don't think I'll buy it again. The random function pissed me off too much, and I'm big into music, so I like to know what album a song is off of when I'm listening to it, which the iRiver does not do. The wrong album order didn't bother me too much after a while, but mainly cause I listen to it on random pretty much all the time. Even though I wouldn't buy it again doesn't mean I would not reccommend it though. However I do realize that I am biased against iPods, but why would you want to run out a buy something that everybody else has? There are better alternatives, and I do believe this is one of them!

<Title>Eh....Aviod and look for a player thats better
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will say that I do love this player dearly. It's done everything a player should do. I can listen to music, and the quality sounds fantastic, however, now that I have had this player for a year, there have been more than a few bugs in the gadget. I've called Customer Service a thousand times, and if you haven't read it here already you know by now that they are indeed lousy, (they usually try to get you off the phone if you call about this gadget, I should warn you). The main problem is when you try to put music in the player, The player itself freezes in the process of sycnhronization! The LCD in my opnion is beautiful, and although now it's a bit bulky, it's function is a little out of wack. Another problem that happens to me is that recently when I add a song to my playlist, and try to download it or sync as we call it to the player, the player will freeze in the process and I could lose almost half of my playlist thats already in the player! What I have discovered is that after it reaches 1 GB the player begins to defunct and act slowly, which defeats the purpose of making it a 20GB( I only have 6.5 gb of music anyway)! Look for a player that can withstand the capacity of 20gb, and aviod this one. Although it is a good first time player, it's just not really worth the hassle. For now I'll learn to love and deal and accept the problems my player brings, but once the battery dies, I'm getting a new one that works better...

<Title>do not buy this product
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sure this product worked well the first time i used it, i uploaded 1300 or so songs in a half an hour i was very impressed by it. Fast forward to the next time i try to sync music onto it. Im on day 2 of trying now and everytime i plug it into the usb port almost instantly the player freezes. The memory is about 1/4 of the way full and to say that im p.o.ed would be an understatement. Im never going to buy an iriver product again and if customer support cant provide me with an answer i will be returning this product very soon. For almost 200 dollars the quality of the product should be a little bit higher. Take pride in the products you make and dont expect the public to handle you providing faulty devices in mass quantity

<Title>Get an ipod instead
<Date>Fri Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased the iRiver H10 but I was terribly WRONG!!!  I bought my wife and ipod for her birthday (which is awesome) after I bought the iRiver. I will be getting an ipod very soon.  Problems - The battery life is only about 2 days.  Which would not be a problem if the battery indicator actually indicated when the battery is getting low...nope, the display shows full bars and then with no warning it just shuts off and displays a battery dead sign.  - Downloading music is a hassle.  On several occasions I have had to wait while the music is uploaded and re-uploaded before I can add more music.  - Sometimes (actually a lot of times) it just doesn't work.  I will turn it on and it will just freeze up.  At this point you have to take the battery out and wait for it to initialize and hope that it works right.  - The charging system as a whole is sloppy and akward.  There is a 3 headed beast that should have been made into a simple input/output.  - There are several more issue about not being user friendly and other ways it will freeze up on you, while your in the middle of your workout but you get the point.  Get an ipod and be happy with life

<Title>The Pros and Cons
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, lets just get to it:  CONS: 1. For some odd reason that I've tried to fix many times, it wont let me load all my pictures. 2. Froze on me tons of times, and the reset button is really small so I have to bring a paper clip or an earing with me if I want to be able to un-freeze it. 3. The adapter/ charger is a bit clunky to carry around, and for charging you have to connect the two and it gets to be a nusance. 4. The colour choices are kind of limited. 5. Dosent work with itunes. 6. The headphones sometimes freeze up when I change the volume or something else. 7. You cant see the album cover art.  PROS:  1. Superb sound quality. You can costumize your own, or choose one of the many already preset types. 2. Nice size, not huge, but fits in your hand nicely. 3. Tells time, alarm, date etc... 4. Has a great radio tuner and you can have your favorite stations set as preset stations. 5. I found the touch pad pretty easy to get used to (though some people said that it was really difficlt, I guess it just deoends on what your used to using.) 6. The head phones deliver great sound quality. 7. Has a great quiality microphone built in so you can record conversations or make your own memos with it.  All in all a good product with some awsome features, but I'm probably going to be returning this one.

I have been trying to contact the customer service phone number and the IVR doesn't even work it-is-a fake IVR there is nobody in there!!!! Can you beleieve?? Unfortunately this unit was bought directly from the iRiver online store and not using Amazon. I assume that amazon might have been able to help with this bad supplier. I feel so bad for trusting this kind of company and now I will have to buy an iPod and spend much more money.

<Title>Don't waste your money!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am the unhappy owner of several H10's and initially there were minor problems, but the closer they got to the end of the warranty period, the more problems they started having.  Problems include freezing up for no apparent reason, scrolling in Chinese, and the most irritating is when the "system files are missing" and you have to reinstall the firmware and redownload ALL of your music (does this alot).  The company doesn't believe in customer service - you can't get through on the phone and they take days to respond to email.  I have returned two because the hard drives crashed and it took 3-4 weeks to get them back, and then one of them crashed again as soon as I got all the music redownloaded and I had to return it and wait another 3 weeks.  I have a problem with one that has now gone out of warranty and iRiver told me they won't touch it and to look for a repair shop online.  So save yourself alot of headaches and time, not to mention money, and don't buy an H10 player.

<Title>Too many problems
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for several months.  I was able to deal with the the machine freezing (by keeping a paper clip handy and pressing the reset button).  I also had a lot of patience when entire cd's were mysteriously disappearing and I had to upload the cd's again.  Now, the scroll pad/volume bar is not working at all rendering this player practically useless.  (If I select "All" I can hear each song on every CD in alphabetical order but that's about it.)    I'm trying to figure out if I can send this in for repair or just consider it useless and go for the Toshiba Gigabeat (30 GB) which seems to be pretty reliable.  I received the Iriver as a gift but wouldn't dare buy any of their products and would strongly advise anyone else against throwing their money away on Iriver.

The player uploads new songs quickly. It's easy to create your own listening libraries. The player is fast and reliable. Also, I am glad I made this purchase through Amazon.

<Content>This little gadget never leaves my side.  So easy to set up, easy to use and great sound quality.  There is no SW, it seamlessly integrates with WMP, I at first thought the CD they gave me was corrupt because it ejected itself immediately and told me I was ready to go.  I bought this intentionally because it support Windows Media and MP3's.  Going forward this will be far more compatible and semi-future proof compared to IPod or the crummy Sony devices and service.  In the meantime, I LOVE my iRiver.... and for $50 more got the 20GB instead of the 6GB..... iRiver needs to rethink the extreme cost of the 6 Giger!  CHEERS!

<Title>A Solid MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got exactly what I expected in buying this iRiver over its trendy rival, the iPod: having additional features at the expense of design. Song organization, music playback, and menu interface are all superb. A very neat feature is the player's ability to record from the radio. I have found this very handy. And of course, the text compatability is great and easy to navigate.  However, there are some annoyances here and there. Navigating menus isn't smooth, especially when compared to the iPod photo. There are occasional load times and the scroll speed could be a bit faster. Also, loading playlists onto the player can be tricky. The learning curve on this player is definitely steeper than the iPod.  Overall, the player is worth its cost. I would only recommend this player if you are buying it for the extra features, such as FM radio, text compatability, and voice recording. Otherwise, you should go for the iPod photo's smoother menus, elegant design, and ease of use.

<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think anyone considering purchasing this product should also consider waiting until they upgrade the firmware and offer software to organize the music. The player takes forever to organize using WMP 10 and is buggy to say the least. The pictures you load on it are going to look like blocky messes unless you supposedly resize them ( I never tried it). It kept causing Rhapsody to lock up and corrupted the licenses for music that I had already purchased that were on my computer. Also for people that are thinking of buying the H10 for the $100 rebate for Rhapsody, you should know that you can't sign up for Rhapsody To Go for a year, you can sign up for Rhapsody Unlimited for a year but not the service that allows you to load subscription music to your player which is supposedly what the rebate requires. I don't know if this is because I already had a membership but it wouldn't let me sign up for the "To Go" service for a year. I will say this though, Napster To Go worked pretty good with the player but it wasn't enough to keep it, there were just too many problems. After about eight hours of trying to get it to work correctly, I decided to return it and buy and Ipod. I really wanted something that would work with a subscription service but this isn't the one and Rhapsody definitely isn't the service.

<Title>not compatible with my brand new dell laptop
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i've found similar problems in the bulletin boards i've searched through, and some computers, even new ones that meet all the iriver's requirements, just don't recognize the player when you plug it in. i was on the phone with customer service for hours a day over the course of a week, and no one was able to tell me why my brand new dell laptop running windows xp service pack 2 could not recognize the player. they then gave me a "workaround," which i thought had worked...i spent hours copying cds, and downloading from napster to go, only to find that everything i had copied was in the player - but wouldn't play. so i guess it's a crapshoot...make sure your computer likes the player before you buy. i'm going to try the toshiba gigabeat next...

<Title>For the win!

<Content>This is more 4.9 stars - great and almost perfect. I have been with iRiver since their previous 20GB model (the one ere this one.) It is a DEFINITE improvement. This model allows automatic category set-ups with Artist, Album, Genre and the likes; and also, one is able to create Playlists via Windows Media Player. The battery life has definitely been extended; and unlike the previous model, does not diminish every time you upload or delete songs from the player. (This was what always killed me on the older model.)   The difficulty, though, is in the set-up. When one uploads, it automatically categorises the songs via available information. The problem with this is that you won't be able to view songs that don't have an Artist or Album in those categories. A separate folder will be created for "Unknown Artist," "Unknown Album," etc. (Although, this issue can be dismissed with the built-in "Browser" feature.) Another issue is with Playlist creating. Unless you have it checked and the songs still on your computer (via Windows Media), it will automatically delete the songs you are not syncronizing.  Here is a run-down list of Plus/Minus of the new player. This is set-up in comparison (though not included) of the older models.  PLUS - 1. New, sleeker look. 2. A bit smaller. 3. New, classier backgrounds in the player. 4. Better Radio sets. 5. Extended battery life. 6. Easier (and about 10x faster) uploads/downloads (as in returning the songs to your computer). 7. New playlist feature. 8. Greater sound enhancements that are more versatile (SRS WOW, User, Rock, iriver Rock, etc.) and easier to change. 9. Automatic categorizations. 10. Great new Browser feature. 11. Ability to save and read Text files and Photos. 12. Works wonderfully in a car stereo system. (Imagine a mini theater in your car without the use of sub-woofers or extra speakers. Yes, it's THAT good.)  MINUS - 1. A bit confusing at first with finding your music. 2. Plugs to charge are annoying to figure out.  I do believe that the plus definitely out-weigh the minus. This is a MUST for any fan of MP3's and general music. This makes a great storage device if not used for music. Trust me, for the price, it has more features than an iPod AND works better. iRiver is the next generation of MP3's.

<Title>Almost Excellent Device
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have found what I've expected and beyond. Iriver have excellent sound and features. When I synchronize with the computer, it organizes all of the images and music automatically. But unfortunately, when it is connected to computer it is not possible to listen to it.

<Title>OK, but I'd probably buy something else
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for about three months now so I can safely write a review.    First the good: I got this primarily to use with Rhapsody To Go (there was a $100 rebate if you purchased this player and got a subscription), after a few initial hiccups everything worked fine.  The unit has frozen up on me several times but I just let the battery go dead or reboot attached via USB to my computer and everything works again.  The FM radio feature is nice to have and works fine as well.  Now the ugly: There are some features in here that are simply unnecessary, such as the picture viewer (who wants to look at pictures in a 1.5 x 1.5 inch screen?), the text reader (see previous comment), and the digital recorder.  AM radio and or Satellite radio capability would be better than any of this stuff.  It's also annoying that there is no way to play one song by itself - that is, if you browse your way to a particular song, it automatically plays the next song on the album or playlist it is a part of.  Many times you just want to hear one song, so it is really annoying that they didn't think of this.  Finally, you cannot hook up to a computer via a standard USB cable but rather only through their proprietary cable, same for hooking up to a power source.  Ergo, if your cord is lost or busted your are up the creek without a paddle unless you order another one.  What worries me is the prospect of iRiver going out of business and then I will be unable to order a new cord and will be stuck with a $200 purchase that does me absolutely no good.  All said, it's not a bad player but if I had to do it over again I probably would have purchased something else.
