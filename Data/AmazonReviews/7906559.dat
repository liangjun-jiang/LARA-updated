<Title>Excellent product!
<Date>Sun Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my Muvo 4GB player for 3 weeks now and have been extremely pleased with it.  This player fit my very specific needs.  I have a large number of files that are MP3 and WMA (the latter purchased online), so I felt it was best to NOT get an iPod.  <p>My previous mp3 player was a MagicStar 256MB, but wanted to upgrade because I found my commute to be longer, spent a lot of time in the car or metro, and became bored with listening to only the same 60 some songs over and over again.  Plus, I go to the gym, and specifically wanted something durable and not have to worry about a huge spinning hard-drive.  I wanted a player that was light, small, unnoticeable, but could deliver big on functionality.  The Muvo definitely hit the spot with its 4GB Toshiba Micro-drive (v compact, durable, and high capacity).<p>First, this thing is SMALL and LIGHT... it fits perfectly in the closed unused ashtray of my car, keeping it out of site from prying eyes. I compared side-by-side with the new iPod 4GB, and the muvo is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller, lighter and compact. It probably weighs as much as my Siemens C56 cellphone.  I currently have 500 songs loaded on there with 3 different playlists, and have used less than 2GB so far.<p>On the metro and in the gym, I use the included belt holster.  Its very well structured and shock-proof, but the only drawback is that the buttons are inaccessible.  I can overlook that drawback since I tend to use playlists or continually shuffle my music.<p>The buttons are small, and people with large fingers may have some difficulty.  I have not had any problems manipulating the directional button (vol up/down, prev/next track), nor accessing the menu (push button straight down).  A slightly annoying factor is that you need to hold the PLAY/PAUSE button down for 5 seconds straight in order to power on/off.<p>The menu is small but readable, but I don't really read it all the time since I'm always on the go.  The backlight is blue, and ID3 tags for the songs scroll across when playing.  The menu includes tools, playlist, playmode (shuffle, repeat, etc), EQ, delete, radio, and microphone.  You navigate using the directional button. For my basic needs, I use playlist and shuffle.  I delete files using Windows Explorer.<p>I ditched the included earbuds and use my own Koss Plugs.  I did use the included earbuds for the first couple of days and found it to be sub-standard in sound and uncomfortable.<p>The sound from this unit is great... many different equalizer settings, but I set mine to Rock and don't use the other ones.  With the right set of earplugs, the bass is nice and heavy, and the sound is very crisp.  I use a cassette adapter in the car with the Muvo, and it sounds just as good.  I've noticed a little hissing or distortion, but that's either because of the cassette adapter, not having the player set at the proper volume, or your unit needs is almost out of juice.  Just play around with the unit to find the right balance.<p>The unit comes with a rechargable lithium ion battery.  I was spoiled before because my last player was able to recharge via USB port.  This battery gets a full charge in about 3 hrs with the included AC-adapter.  I haven't really pushed (nor paid attention) to the full claimed 10 hour charge.  Let's just say, I recharge every 2-3 days of my everyday activities.  I recommend plugging in your unit to the charger when doing large song transfers; those tend to eat a lot of juice. Oh, and the battery COMES OUT, meaning that you can replace or buy an extra one if needed.  The iPod batteries are non-removeable.<p>I use MusicMatch and am able to do file/playlist transfers using the &quot;import to portable&quot; function in MMJB. It takes some getting used to... I initially would set up playlist folders on the Muvo using Windows Explorer, and import my playlists into each discrete folder with the proper m3u file.  If I did not set up playlist folders with the m3u files, the unit would randomly read any existing mp3s in its memory regardless of playlist.  I've toyed with the included Creative MediaSource software, and it is a little clumsy with too many frames and windows going on.  Stick with what you're comfortable with because everything is drag and drop. You could just use Windows Explorer to drag and drop your files and m3u's directly to the Muvo, but if you do a straight drag-and-drop of your music files only, the player will play them alphabetically according to ID3 tag. File transfer by USB 2.0 is SUPER FAST. I was able to transfer my current 2GB of files on there in about 10 mins or so. I wasn't paying attention to exact duration because I was getting ready to leave and needed to do this on the fly before I left!  It did the job superbly.<p>I ran a recovery once on the unit because it froze during a transfer and the drive became undetectable to my notebook. When in doubt, there is a small pinhole in the back of the unit that will reset your unit to original state.<p>I do recommend that you upgrade to the the firmware: http://www.nomadworld.com/downloads/firmware/ <br>User manuals, support, etc are available on this website.<p>PROS:<br>- extremely small and light (moreso than the iPod)<br>- Great sound<br>- Huge capacity with a very durable and dependable microdrive (I've dropped this thing a few times with no probs at all)<br>- Long battery life<br>- Works with MMJB<br>- Inexpensive compared to other comparable players<br>- its not an iPod! Be different!<p>CONS:<br>- Small buttons take some getting used to<br>- Small screen<br>- does not support AAC files (for iTunes users out there)<br>- Playlist transfer (.m3u files) is not intuitive unless you play around with it and properly set up the folders just right<br>- Does not charge via USB (there aren't many out there that do that to begin with, and I was spoiled by my MagicStar)<p>I am extremely happy with this item and highly recommend it to people always on the go (commuters, gym, school, driving) and for people who are tough on their toys (toss in the bag, car, drop, etc).  Great value. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars for minor quirks.

<Title>Hacking the Muvo for the 4gb Microdrive
<Date>Mon Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The really interesting thing about this MP3 player is that it uses a Hitachi Microdrive for it's storage.  This same drive at 4gb sells for over $400.  <br>If you are in the market for a large capacity micridrive your best bet is to purchase the Muvo and &quot;harvest&quot; the drive.  Takes a little work but you save yourself some cash.

<Title>Good MP3 Player + Portable Storage
<Date>Fri Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I seriously considered both the Muvo2 4GB and the iPod Mini before making my buying decision. My needs are that I listen to a smallish music collections (about 4GB or ~800 songs), I wanted a small MP3 player that can serve as a portable storage device, and my budget was under two hundred dollars (Feb. 2004). The Muvo2 4GB fits the bill as a small MP3 player and it is recognized by Windows XP as an external drive once connected via USB (1.1 and 2.0 compatible). I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars and here's why:<p>The Muvo2 4GB isn't smaller than the iPod Mini as one reviewer mentioned. Volumetrically, it's 1.5 times as large the Mini. The Muvo2 measures 2.6" x 2.6" x 0.8" or 5.4 cubic-in. The Mini measures 2.0" x 3.6" x 0.5" or 3.6 cubic-in. However, the difference is minute because they both easily fit in any shirt pocket. Both weigh (light!!!) about the same: 3.2-oz (Muvo2), 3.6-oz (Mini).<p>The Muvo2 comes with the Hitachi (not Toshiba) internal CompactFlash II compatible harddrive. For a new unit, battery duration is as rated: 14 hours. I've tested the claim to hold true as I use the unit through out the day and it hasn't once run out of juice on me. I do charge it at the end of the day. You can charge the unit via the supplied AC adapter or via any self-powered USB port (not PCMCIA card). You do need to right-click on the device under My Computer (XP) and select "Eject" in order to charge it via USB. Otherwise, XP just treats it as an external drive. The Muvo's rechargeable battery is user replaceable and costs less than the Mini's. <p>I can drag-and-drop music and other data files to the Muvo2 from my computer with ease without the use of any additional software (simply plug and play). This is one of the reasons I chose the Muvo2. However, you can still use the included MediaSource software to manage your music collections. For the iPod, I believe you need to use the iTunes software to transfer music files.<p>If you compare the Muvo2 against the iPod Mini, the look of the Muvo2 feels a little cheap because of the plastic enclosure but it feels sturdy nonetheless (if you don't drop it). The Muvo's ergonomics can stand some improvement. The two smallish navigation buttons don't feel right. The larger joystick type button has imprecise navigation. The 3-second-hold-and-release in turning on/off the unit is annoying. After holding the smaller on/off button for 3 seconds, you MUST release the button before it turns on/off (meaning you MUST visually pay FULL attention to it when turning it on/off). Counter-intuitive comes to mind. Hence the 4 out of 5 stars.<p>As one reviewer suggested, you should download the latest firmware to make the unit function a bit more intuitive (the root folder and playlist are now the two first choices under the menu). The latest firmware also adds support for the optional (must purchase separately) external remote/FM tuner/recorder.<p>Why I selected the Muvo2 over the iPod Mini was entirely based on my own needs:<p>1.) very small, very portable MP3 player<br>2.) 4GB (800 songs) of music collections<br>3.) portable external storage device w/o need for additional software (just plug and play)<br>4.) two hundred dollar budget<br>5.) user-replaceable battery<p>Suggestions for improvement:<p>- need to mimic iPod Mini ergonomics (better navigation, better buttons)<br>- need to incorporate more software functions like the iPod (song rating, time(date), calendar, contacts, games :D)<br>- need sexy aluminum (real) enclosure<p>Overall, the Muvo2 sounds great, feels very small, priced right, and meets my needs. Nothing fancy or sexy, however.<p>March 2004

<Title>How much music do you listen to?
<Date>Wed Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This MP3 Players works well where all MP3 players work well--it is compact, cheap, and sounds great.  There is really nothing about this device though that puts it ahead of the crowd.  The biggest drawback of this device is its very small hard drive (only 4 GB), this is okay for someone who either only likes one type of song and doesn't need space for any variety or for someone who likes to erase music off of their MP3 player in order to put new songs on it.  Now, these limitations are the same as those of the new Mini iPods, so I wouldn't suggest getting those either.<p>The regualr small iPods with 40 GB or space are the way to go.  You can quickly and easily download your entire music library onto this device and take every song you own with you everywhere you go!  No other company I have every seen has come with as many peripherals as Apple has for the iPod.  Paired with iTunes 4 (or GarageBand if you are creating your own music to take with you) is the best way to go.  If you don't believe me--check out Apple.com before you buy any MP3 player and let them work their magic on you.<p>The iPod is more ergonomic, the buttons are exactly where you need them, it is attractive (either in your hand, on your arm, or in your car), comes with great features such as song ratings, date and time, and a contacts list (it even has games for when you need to occupy the kids on short notice).<p>If you are looking for a little handheld device that can suit your needs as a casual music listener, then this MP3 will work just as well for you as any other without any problems.

<Title>Perfect
<Date>Sat Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This unit is all you need out of a portable mp3 player. What truly sets this unit apart from the rest of the high-storage market is the battery. The shelf life of an average ipod is two years -- integrated non-replaceable battery. With the muvo you can buy extra batteries; if you take care of the device it should last a a few years. I don't have proof of course, I just bought mine two months ago, but I have been enjoying high-end sound quality and a good variety of tunes everywhere I go for that entire period. Great price, great design, great software, et al. I can't thank the wizards at creative enough for giving me a viable option to a flash mp3 or &lt;shudder&gt; an ipod which would have cost and extra $200 (!). For those fetishists who freakishly need 20 to 40 GB of space for their music - and need to have it everywhere with them - go ahead and spend the extra couple hundred, for the rest of the population I recommend this product both for yourself or as a gift etc. Cheers.

<Content>The Nomad player adds nothing new to the table and as one of the previous reviews points out if you buy this device with harddrvie seperatly the price goes way up.  Overall I guess this could be a good deal if you planned on selling it on Ebay, but as for the player I would just move onto the IPod.<br>Everything this device does well the IPod does better sorry Nomad...

<Title>The good plus the bad
<Date>Wed Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got this player a few days ago so hopefully my review isn't too premature.  I am overall very happy with this player, though it's a real devil to find at the moment.  Anyway, on to the review.<p>The bad:<p>* The design, feel and interface is far inferior to the Ipods.  There's no comparison.  It feels pretty cheapy and the controls are way small.<br>* You can't get to the buttons through the case.  Instead you have to buy the FM remote, which is rather expensive (and you have to do the firmware to get that to work).<br>* You need to get USB 2 to get the files transfered quickly, if you don't already have it.<br>* You'll probably want new headphones too.<p>The good:<p>&gt; It sounds fantastic.  I'm not kidding.  It really does sound amazing.<br>&gt; The microdrive seems sturdier than the larger mp3 hard drives.<br>&gt; It's really small.<br>&gt; It can do wma's which is a great benefit.<br>&gt; With USB 2, it's fast as hell.<br>&gt; I have XP and the installation/setup couldn't be easier.<br>&gt; The removable battery is great (I got a cheap one on Ebay).<p>All in all, I'd say it beats the Ipod mini, which is the chief competitor.  To me, it came down to WMAs, the battery and sound quality over the interface.  If you care more about the interface, you should get the Ipod.

<Title>Pretty good, but not perfect.
<Date>Thu Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My first impression of this unit was WOW, it's LITTLE!<p>That's a good thing; the Muvo is small enough to fit (very comfortably) in your front jeans pocket; it's about the size of half of a bar of soap, and thinner, too.<p>Volume is pretty good, and so is sound quality, though a simpler &quot;bass boost&quot; without having to fudge about with an equalizer would have been nice. Battery life also appears to be pretty good. The unit is as silent as can be in operation, even though there's a hard drive inside.<p>Kudos: uses compactflash storage (even though you have to open the unit and void the warranty to get at it), so theoretically if 8GB or 16GB compactflash cards ever become available, the unit should be easy to upgrade. The USB 2.0 is a nice touch, as is the fact that the unit works just like a USB hard drive; plug it in and copy files as fast as you can.<p>Complaints: the navigation system isn't terribly convenient, and the screen and controls are almost painfully small. No remote is included; it's optional. Given the size, I suppose it couldn't be any other way, but the unit doesn't feel altogether very &quot;robust&quot; -- if you accidentally sat on it, it would definitely need replacing.<p>All in all, a solid four stars out of five.

<Title>Great product, but cost to storage ratio gets exploited.
<Date>Mon Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this recently without a microdrive in it for very cheap - since I cannot get an unvoided, new in the box version without paying more than retail.  Creative sold it for 199, but people felt the need to open the damn things up and sell the Microdrives for a quick buck.  This drove up the price from more than retail and people are paying 250+ for this unit!<p>Moral of the story = people are greedy.<p>However, the unit itself is teriffic.  I had a Nomad IIMG LE player before this one, and it reminds me of the RCA Kazoo, only made by a better company.

<Title>4.5 Stars For Value and Flexibility
<Date>Tue Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Muvo2 is not my first &amp;quot;compactflash&amp;quot; mp3 player. My NEX IIe with 512mb compactflash still function perfectionly after 2 years of daily usage after numerous drops. So with such background here is my review on the Muvo2.    PROS:    *Under $200 ... got it for $188 shipping included  *Very light ... light   *High Volume Sound..you can damage your hearing with this player  *USB2 Connection ...fast data transfer  *Charging Without Adaptor ...just use the mini USB2 connection   *External Drive ...can store any type of data  *Long-life Replaceable Battery ...that's the way it should  *Sound Quality ...excellent.   *4Gig Microdrive Extraction ...it will come in handy      CONS:    *Carrying Case ...nothing to brag about...velcro cover for this small player...very dumb.  *Buttons ...poor designed especially the On/Off.   *Playlist Management and Navigation ...primitive.      So why is the Muvo2 for me? Well it all comes to value, flexibility, and personality. Got it at a deal for way under $200 shipping included. I have a iPAQ H2215 and the NEX IIe so if I do get bore with this I can alway use the 4gig Microdrive.   I will never buy an Ipod...it's over priced and why getting something where everyone has it.       Conclusion: If you're a white-tanktop-constantly-looking-at-yourself- in-the-mirror type of a guy then go with the iPOD Mini but if you're a I-come-to-the-gym-to-lift-and-not-looking-pre tty type of a guy then go with the Muvo2.

<Title>Perfect for my task-at-hand
<Date>Fri Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I already own a 40 gig Creative Nomad Jukebox (the original Jukebox, which came with a 6 gig drive, but was quite hackable).<p>That player is perfect for listening when I'm relatively stationary -- in the car, on a plane -- but isn't so good for grabbing and walking around with.  I've been considering a flash memory-based player for a while for those situations, but they're TOO limited in capacity and/or price.  I also considered just getting a new large-capacity MP3 player, like a Zen, but didn't want to spend that much money and lose the advantages of the Jukebox (yes, they exist).<p>Enter the perfect compromise -- the Muvo2 4GB.  Tiny, good battery life, reasonable price.  Not as much capacity as my Jukebox, but plenty of space for a day's worth of music (and then some).  The fast USB2.0 interface makes changing the content a snap (I have all 2000+ CDs I own encoded on a media server at home).<p>Battery life is MUCH better than the Jukebox on a single charge, but the Jukebox takes AA batteries making it very easy to find replacements on long trips.  I find the controls perfectly intuitive, although I was helped by having a very well-structured system for folders and filenames on my media server -- one that meshes very well with the Muvo.<p>When in the car or on the road, my Jukebox contains most of my CDs, and uses standard easy-to-find batteries if I can't conveniently charge the player.  When tooling around town for the day, the Muvo contains enough music to keep me entertained while not weighing me down.  So each player has its niche role in my life, and each does the job well.

<Title>Definitely lacking in some respects, but still  useful
<Date>Wed Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I rate this product 3.5 stars, and I'll tell you why.  When I attempted to use the brand new player after charging it to capacity, kept getting recovery mode and &quot;media error&quot; whenever I pressed any of the buttons.  The computer wouldn't recognize the player either.  I shook it and hit it a few times with my palm, and after the seventh time of turning the thing on, the screen, instead of recovery mode, went to &quot;loading music&quot;!!!  Amazing.  So, now that my player was FINALLY working right, I could begin transferring music - if I could figure out how to.<p>The Creative Media Organizer is SOO confusing.  Very strange, because you'd think if the Rio Nitrus/Karma has such a great Music Manager program, the Creative one would be just as easy to use.  Wrong.  It took me forever to figure out how to transfer music in a way that I could group songs by Album (because you can't choose to play by track, artist, etc. on the player which is VERY annoying b/c Rio gives you all those options).  But that aside, dragging and dropping folders from My Computer wasn't good b/c the ripped albums show up as &quot;copy protected.&quot; Copying from WinMedia Player wasn't good either b/c the tracks show up on the player as separate &quot;albums&quot; if you will-not grouped like it should.  So the only choice I had was to use the Creative program.  I finally solved the problem by importing every single music file I have in the various folders of My Computer into the Creative PC Music Library.  Then, naming new folders the albums' names, I dragged and dropped each group of files into their respective folders.  A supposedly simple problem made difficult by the bad organization of the Muvo and features (for example, you also can't play &quot;all files&quot; at one time, only a folder at a time; the 4-band equalizer isn't sufficient, the screen is seriously small, as are the buttons).  Otherwise, this player is really cute (cheap-feeling though) and the case is really helpful.  The headphones are really cheap though.  Also, if you want maximum use of this player, get the fm wired remote.  I bought one and it works great.  I can use the microphone to tape lectures (in fact that's what I did today), listen to the radio, record from radio, and control the player too.  And a great thing about the microphone is that even though you can only record 10 hours of the .wav files, you can just copy the files into the PC Music Library and delete ones in the player so you won't lose the recording but clear the space for more recordings, you know what I mean?<p>Now I'm used to the Creative Music Organizer and it works well enough for me.  So, to sum it up, by itself the player is good with a few very annoying aspects (as I've explained what they are).  But put it with the fm wired remote and you've got a tiny player that does almost everything it should.  Just use caution and buy extended warranty b/c you may not be as lucky as I was.  Oh, and I don't suggest you buy Rio hard drive mp3 products because lots of other ppl had the same hard drive problems with it (Nitrus - Karma, I understand, has similar probs too) as I had at about the same time frame I had it, so be aware.  Hope this helped.

<Content>First, yes, I am an iPod user. That's important for me to admit because users of the Apple iPod never like other MP3 players since the iPod is such a high quality, attractive, easy to use device.<p>I bought one of these MuVo^2 devices to use at work where I'm afraid my $400 iPod will get stolen. I just got the MuVo^2 today but I've used it enough to give a simple review. Simply put, it's a decent MP3 player with great storage capacity for its size.<p>Pros: High capacity 4GB Hitachi MicroDrive inside a small player (2.5 inches square); removable LiIon battery; lightweight; excellent sound quality for an MP3 player; very simple to copy music onto it in Windows -- You don't need any special software, just Windows Explorer!<p>Cons: The included protective nylon case is about useless since it's so rigid and doesn't give you access to the buttons; the buttons on the unit are difficult to press with big man fingers; the interface feels chunky making it hard to find songs and do other functions like lock the unit's keys; it's relatively ugly and made of cheap-feeling plastic when compared to the new iPod Mini (its direct competitor); its LCD screen is backlit but poorly making it difficult to read in the dark; the LCD screen is tiny (about two or three lines of text at most).<p>All in all, I say it's a decent MP3 player. If you just want a really cheap Hitachi MicroDrive, it's easy to open this up and remove the drive from inside for use in your digital camera. As an MP3 player, though, it's definitely just &quot;so-so&quot;. I would never EVER recommend you pay the full $200 for it. If you're already preparing to pay $200, pay $50 more to get an iPod Mini and you'll have no regrets.

<Title>This product sucks as MP3 player but love the Hitachi 4gig
<Date>Fri May 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>For another $50 you can get a mini-iPod. Don't waste your money on this for an mp3 player. It's butt-UGLY, software sucks and it's got the cheapest case. There is no style to it, and you could do a lot better for just a little more money with an Apple mini iPod where you can download your music off the iTunes store, and look cool to boot.<p>The look and feel of this product next to the iPod is just not even comparable, let alone the packaging and the black cable madness you have to deal with when you get the product out of the undestructible plastic case. The tiny lcd screen that you can hardly read what song you are playing is awful. The buttons to control the thing suck.<p>Do what I did and harvest the hard drive and use it in a good digital camera (like a Canon 10D, or 1D) and be done with it.<p>5***'s for the Hitachi removable compact flash drive though.  Works great!

<Content>This isn't a bad MP3 player. It's small (not as small as the iPod mini, but small enough to fit in your pocket comfortably). The sound quality is extremely good if you supply your own headphones (the ones that come with it are mediocre; same thing applies to basically every other portable music player including the iPod). Navigation is OK...The ergonomics of Creative MP3 players are hardly their strong point, and this one is no exception...<p>All in all, this is a decent enough player.<p>But here's my beef: For only a small bit more money, you can get a Creative Zen player. It's a little bigger, but STILL fits comfortably in your pocket. The ergonomics of the Zen are arguably SLIGHTLY worse than this player, but that's almost splitting hairs. And with the Zen, you get 30-40Gb of storage, instead of the 4GB that this player offers...<p>A lot of people are buying this player to remove the 4Gb compactflash drive (to use in a digital camera), and I can understand that given the current prices of 4Gb compactflash drives relative to the price of this player (i.e. you save money buying the player and removing the drive!) But beyond that, I can't really understand why anyone would choose this player over the MUCH larger capacity Nomad Zen. The Zen has everything this puppy does: Good sound quality, good (replacable) batter life, mediocre ergonomics. <p>If ergonomics are your primary consideration, get the iPod. If value and sound quality is your primary consideration, get a Nomad Zen. If you need a compactflash card for your camera, get this one :-)

<Title>Good player for the price
<Date>Wed May 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I ordered the product in February, a few days after it became available. After doing some research, and considering the fact I don't need all my music on the go, I had 3 options: The iPod Mini, Nitrus 4GB (hmm... lucky I didn't wait:-P) and the Muvo^2.<br>The iPod Mini has loads of features, but I wanted to buy an MP3 Player.<br>The Creative has a replaceable battery, which I consider a big plus , and it has a good battery life.<br>The Muvo^2 doesn't look as cool as the others, but I liked its look , and I don't think the iPod Mini's look is a reason for the price difference.<br>A good thing about the iPod Mini is its one year warranty (the Muvo^2 has 3 months).<p>So far I haven't had any problems. A couple of times, after a bad disconnection from the computer, I had to check it for errors (takes less than 30 secs), but overall it works great.<br>I didn't get much chance to use the software, since I've already got the songs in mp3 format, and I just shuffle the songs so I don't really need the playlist, but it seems fine.<br>The drag-and-drop is really convenient, and I also use it to transfer data files if neccessary.<br>The transfer speed is very good too. <br>The sound quality is really good, like all Creative's products.<br>There's an optional remote with an FM tuner, but I haven't tried it so can't comment about it.<p>About the person who wrote the hard-drive isn't in, that's because you bought it used, and the person you bought it from took the hard-drive off. The &quot;real&quot; unit comes with the HD inside:-P<p>So basically, the player is for people who need a good mp3 player  with good battery life and great sound, in a really good price, and don't want to pay extra for (in my opinion useless) additions.

<Title>For serious audio lovers, the sound quality
<Date>Sun May 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Everything in this player is magnificent. You probably know all the goods of this player and are looking for some demerit of it. The only thing I found that is not very satisfactory is the Equalizer and the sound quality. There isn't much bass in the sound. Sure you can turn up the bass in the equalizer, but that doesn't make much improvement. Plus if you turn the 100Hz all the way up, audible distortion  can be heard in the bass. The mids and highs are clear and crisp though. I am using a Sony MDR-EX71SL headset instead of the one that comes with the player.

<Title>a worthy alternative to the ipod
<Date>Thu May 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>pros:<br>-sound quality<br>-battery life<br>-DRIVERLESS operation!<br>-when you want to replace it you can sell the drive inside and get your money back<br>-size and weight<br>-good alternative to the ipod if you don't want to be like everybody else. it's also $50 cheaper than the ipod mini.<br>-price<p>cons:<br>-small screen (in my opinion this is a very minor problem as an mp3 player is designed for listening and not looking at the lcd)<br>-small controls may be difficult for some<br>-carrying case provides a lot of protection but blocks off access to all of the controls!<br>-this player is very rare i ordered it from walmart.com and it was on backorder for a month.<p>Overall this player is very good and is a good alternative if you're not willing to get an ipod mini for any reason. My main complaint is that the protective case that comes with the player does not have any openings to allow access to the controls.

<Title>Don't be fooled!!
<Date>Mon May 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Don't be fooled by the product name &quot;MuVo2 4.0GB&quot; or the product details and spotlight reviews.  The MP3 players being sold here do not have the 4 GB hard drive installed!  Come on, did you really think you could get a 4 GB MP3 player for $50?  The hard drives are being removed for use in cameras leaving only the 128 MB flash card.  Ask your seller about the hard drive before you buy.

<Title>First MP3 player and it's great
<Date>Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Been trying to get this at amazon for a while since it comes in and out of stock very quickly. Lucky this time I was able to get it in mid-May and was delivered within 6 days via super saver shipping.<p>I bought this MP3 for myself not to resell it. Since this is my first MP3 player I have nothing to compare it to, but from using it the past two weeks I can say I'm very satisfied with it. I have about a Gig of music and audio books on it already.<p>Getting the Mp3s to the Muvo are so easy, just drag and drop and there you have it, you don't need their software if you WinXP as your OS. The battery life is awsome I have yet to see it drop even one bar during the time I have used it. I would have liked the case to have been aluminum instead of the cheap plastic.<p>Pros:<br>- long battery life<br>- small form factor<br>- 4GB memory<br>- great sound from the supplied headphones<p>Cons:<br>- small screen, they could have made it a little bigger<br>- carrying case covers the controls for the player, must take out the Muvo to use them <br>- out of stock often<br>- buyers that mistakenly buy this for $50 then complain they got ripped off because the 4GB drive is missing. READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT YOU'RE BUYING!<p>Nice product and get it while you can before it goes out of stock again.

<Title>128MB, not 4GB!
<Date>Thu Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>WARNING: If you read the comments of the new/used/refurbished listings, you will notice that they have ALL removed the 4GB drive and you will only have 128MB RAM...  That means you can only get like 20 songs on it.  Ask the seller about the hard drive before you buy it.

<Title>This isn't Ebay.  Review the OEM product, not used rip-offs!
<Date>Fri Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>.<br>Do we really need any more reviews about the used MuVos containing something other than the 4GB microdrive?  The warning has already been made.  There is no reason to repeat it every week or every time somebody gets scammed into thinking they're getting the retail MuVo with the 4GB drive for $65.  Did you really think somebody was dumb enough to sell a 4GB MuVo for $65?<p>I like to use these reviews to learn about the success or struggle others have had with a particular product and the customer support/software/etc...  I also like to use the customer ratings to compare similar products.  Every time somebody complains about getting a MuVo with a 128MB flash drive and gives it a 1-star rating it skews the whole thing, hence my 5-star rating (to try to bring it back into balance a bit).  <p>We know people are taking the microdrive out and re-selling the MuVo.  No more reviews about this are necessary.  <p>Sorry for the rant, but this is getting old.

<Title>Compelling capacity outweighs fumbling and bundling.
<Date>Fri Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The four stars are strictly for the following:<br>    -4Gb hard drive, which alone is a $300 item in bulk;<br>    -WMA and MP3 playback;<br>    -nice LCD interface;<br>    -USB 2.0 speeds for really fast xfer rates;<br>    -instantaneous recognition by WinXP/2k machines.<p>Those features above make this an outstanding player, and should make this a 5-star item.  However:<br>    -the enclosed headphones are earbuds, I don't like 'em;<br>    -it isn't armored enough for decent shock-resistance (would like to see it rubber-skinned like its cousin the Rio Cali);<br>    -no belt-loop holster or anything like an armband, so exercising with it might be a little challenging;<br>    -FM headphone function is extra (boo!);<br>    -controls are dexterity-building exercises in themselves.<p>This thing has an LCD screen, so why not use a thumb-wheel with pushbutton ability to handle on/off and playback?  Granted, it has a four-way pad and a separate button which should be sufficient, but my banana-sized fingers keep jumping selections to &quot;Menu&quot; instead of scrolling left or right through the playlist.<p>Here's why this is so critical: this player can hold 500-1000 songs, depending on how dense the encoding is.  Navigating through a straight list of 500 or 1000 songs takes awhile.  Folders become paramount to organizing songs or artists, just so you can find something you like inside of a minute.<p>But does it play well?  Does it do what it should?  Oh yes, most definitely.  And having a Li-On battery in it that recharges off the USB port is *exactly* what every player should have (if it used my Nokia 3650's battery I'd have given it the fifth star for the serendipitous convergence).<p>&quot;Would I buy it again?&quot;  Sure, if I could find another one.<br>&quot;Is it better than the Rio Cali?&quot;<p>Hmmm... the Cali is definitely nice, armored with an armband I really like, better UI (LCD presents info much faster, is square and shows more at a glance), has FM built-in.  But 4Gb makes up a lot of ground on 256Mb, even 768Mb if you pony up some cash for a 512Mb SD Card.  Nah, the Muvo2 isn't perfect, but it's capacious, and sometimes that's more important.<p>Fred

<Title>Excellent Player
<Date>Tue Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Recently I was in the market for an mp3 player, and was deciding between an iPod mini, or this muvo2. After much research, I decided on the muvo2 for a few reasons. Firstly, after hearing so many complaints about the iPod's lack of a removable battery, I liked the removable one on this player. Just ask anyone who has owned an iPod for more than a year how much their battery life has diminished. In addition, my friends have both of these players. After comparing the sound quality, I would definitely recommend the muvo2. However, it does not come with this out of the box, and you need to adjust the equalizer. After doing this, the muvo2 sounds far greater than the iPod mini. The only complaint I have, is that at first, its two line screen can make it hard to organize 4 gigabytes of music. Ease of organization is where the iPod excels. However, I've found that after downloading the beta version of Windows Media Player 10, it is much easier to organize music because of the new file system it creates on the player through the synchronization feature. It is still no iPod, but it is definitely adequate. I would suggest ditching the included Media Source software. The bundled earbuds aren't great, but they never are on any player. In all, I love my muvo2 and and am completely satisfied with my decision. And in the end, I especially love how it is about half the size of the iPod mini and comes with a belt clip.

<Title>Warning - if you're only buying for the 4GB Drive
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this product based on advice to raid the 4GB drive at half the price for my Sony F828 camera. It didn't work, giving a CF card error.  Then I found that I'm not the first sucker to fall for that trick - I found several bulletin boards with messages from similarly disappointed people who tried the same thing. As far as I can see there's not a solution in sight.  The same appears to apply to some other cameras.

<Title>THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER SEEN
<Date>Mon Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the 4GB Creative mp3 player and it was delivered within 2 days: good start. I installed the software, transferred the songs, everything worked okay. I played it for 10 minutes (LITERALLY TEN MINUTES) sitting in my living room, and after 5 songs, it stopped playing. none of the buttons worked, it was frozen. I followed the directions on rebooting it 500 times, but nothing worked.  I sat for two hours with the piece of junk trying EVERYTHING to fix it, and nothing worked. I should have known, you buy cheaper, you get cheaper. I should have gone with an ipod mini.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY HAVE TO SEND IT BACK.  I didn't heed the warnings from the reviews I read... I wish I had. what a disappointment.

<Title>Difficult to use
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My problem with this device, that I have just bought, is getting tracks into the correct order. The player plays tracks in alphabetical order, unless you manually adjust tags. One minute I'm listening to Bach, then to Red hot chilli peppers. Playlists are played in order, but the supplied software reorders tracks within artists alphabetically, meaning that without intervention it is impossible to keep albums in the correct order. This is crazy. Generally the operation of transferring and organizing content is poor to awful

<Title>Creative Muvo2 Mp3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned this player for over a year and so far I havent had any problems that most others have mentioned about, unit freezing up and trouble shutting down. Overall a simple straighforward easy to use device that suprisingly is durable and when 4gb is not sufficent space for you, the drive is removable (version 1.0 only) for your other compatible digital devices. The audio quality is excellent, especially when paired with good headphones (I use the Creative HN-505 noise cancelling headphones and recommend them) Another recommendation is to buy Notmad Explorer (Universal Edition if you own more than one Creative Labs Mp3 players)from Red Chair Software and you can avoid all the gripes about the software on reviews.  The gripes I have with this player are as follows: 1. The Lcd is small and hard to read 2. No built in Tuner or recorder (Must purchase seperately) 3. The buttons are too small and cant be accessed efficiently (easy workaround is to buy the wired remote) 4. The Creative case for this unit has no window to view the lcd or access the buttons without taking the player out of it. 5. The way the player stores the files on the harddrive is inefficient and is a bit of a chore to find (workaround is to create playlists)  Some of those points are minor to me but may be the ultimate difference to many. The main thing would be to buy the wired remote to gain fm radio and voice recording capability. Another plus is you wont need to fumble with the tiny buttons on the player and you can have the lcd on the remote within view that can be clipped on anywhere. Make sure that you download and install the latest firmware and drivers for Windows XP. Additional always check the Creative Labs website for the latest accessories such as the armband case, extended run time battery and car charger.   Overall there is nothing too big to fault in this player, It has substance, capacity, small form factor, doubles as a removable disk with drag and drop functionality, microdrive is removable, and the sound quality is excellent with more than adequate volume levels.  This is not the player for those of you that value style, if you want that buy an IPOD Mini. If you want something that is cheaper, better sounding and has a removable/user replacable battery then this is the player for you.
