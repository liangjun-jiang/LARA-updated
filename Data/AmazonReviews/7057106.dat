<Title>Amazing player! Buy it!
<Date>Wed Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first MP3 was an IRIVER 128mb player (still use it) and was amazed how you could download and listen to music on such a small device.  But I decided that maybe it was time to get a new player since the 128mb was a bit small in storage.  I researched till I was numb. The wealth of info is so staggering that it would choke a horse. I wanted to convert my entire collection to (lossless) digital and wanted a player that could support all the formats. It was down to the Iriver Clix and the Cowan D2. In the end I decided to get the Cowan D2. Mainly because it supported all the formats like Flac, Ogg, Wav, etc...Clix doesn't support Flac. Also the monumental reviews on the D2 raved about its sound quality. So I purchased it and all I can say is "WOW". It definitely lives up to the hype! What a phenomenal player. I am by no means an audiophile. I have a descent ear and buy the best that I can afford but damn... this D2 is amazing! The SQ is unbelievable.  I listen to it with a pair of Senn px100 (ditch the buds that come with it). I am now in the process of ripping my entire collection to digital. I bought an Audio Technica USB turntable to convert my LP's (a monumental task) and can't wait to hear my old LP's again. The Jet Audio software that comes with the D2 is very good and very easy to use. I ripped some classical CD's in seconds and couldn't believe the SQ with the D2. And the kicker is, I HATE classical music. But with the BBE sound enhancements and different Equalizer settings it is a real pleasure to listen to. Also, most people say that on a portable system, you cannot hear a difference between different formats such as .wav and MP3, but I can; and I do NOT have a great "ear" for music as most but I can definitely hear a difference in SQ between them. But this player. I really can't imagine any other player sounding as good as this one!

<Title>Quantity AND quality :)
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first, i had doubts about the media player because i have never heard the name "Cowon" before(And it was a present for my boyfriend, so i wanted it to, well, not allow it to be a load of "garbage" as one might say.) After reading the other reviews, i decided to take my chances...And i must say, that i am proud that i got it :D The sound was amazing, although the F.M. radio can have a bit of a static, ( but everything would be fine under the right connections) The only thing that i disliked about this media player is that it does not have speakers, and the pen was put out badly (The pen was the size of approximately the size of a dollar coin, and triangular in size, with no slot to store it in) On the other hand, it IS touchscreen so the pen was optional to use. Overall the media player was a great buy, and my boyfriend loved it.He said that he was about to get something similar from SAMSUNG before.The Samsung cost more, and had less features.After getting it for him, i have to admit i got a bit jealous, and am considering on getting one myself =] Another BIG PRO would be the battery life... 50 HOURS?!?! lols that is great for people that forget to charge their electronics once every few times.The visuals on the screen is also amazing, along with everything else. Long story short, i baught the Cowon D2 4 GB Portable media player (Black) for my boyfriend, and it was a great buy :)

<Title>Absoulutely the finest PMP for the money.
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cowon has significantly raised the bar in the PMP (Portable Media Player) market with the D2. The sound is amazing, and the 16 million (24 bit) color screen simply has to be seen to be believed.   The 74mw amplifier in the Cowon D2 provides enough power to drive even the most demanding headphones. Likewise the 5-band EQ section with each band featuring adjustable frequencies to 12db and the inner 3 bands featuring adjustable Q widths will allow music lovers to tailor their listening preferences. Most MP3/PMP players would stop there, but the D2 also offers sound shaping through technology licensed from BBE, a company that has been providing recording studios, musicians, and sound system engineers professional sound reinforcement for several years. The combination of bass enhancement, MP enhancement, stereo field enhancement, and 3D surround enhancement allow you to tailor the sound to your particular tastes. Having 10 user-assignable slots allows you to easily store these combinations that can be used with music, movies, different headphones, or even different users.   One would think that a 2.5 inch screen is just too small to watch, and I was one of those detractors, but not anymore. The 16.7 million color screen faithfully reproduces images with a crisp and clear viewing area that you quickly grow very accustomed to watching. Although you have to convert your videos to the specific size of the screen, the provided software does this with ease in a variety of formats.   Probably the best feature of the D2 is the touch-screen interface, which is well thought-out and intuitive. The interface is activated by touching the screen, and virtual buttons appear which are surprisingly easy to navigate, even for people with large fingers. However, those who want a tactile interface aren't left behind, as the three-button pad can be set to skip, pause, or rewind when placed in lock mode. MP3s tagged with embedded images will be displayed as songs are playing, which I found to be a very cool feature; I've spent several hours re-tagging my media collection with these images for the coolness factor.   The battery life on this device is amazing, almost insanely so. Cowon claims 52 hours of battery in music mode, or 10 hours in video mode. While I have not tested these to the extreme, I did watch two movies and listened to several hours of music with my battery meter only dropping one (of four) 'bars'. A note on the battery -- Cowon devotes nearly half the volume of the D2 to the internal lithium-polymer battery, which results in a "thicker" device than some others, just over 5/8 inch. This battery can be charged over USB, or using the provided A/C adaptor, which charges the batter much faster.  The Cowon D2 is expandable with an SDHC compliant slot, meaning that any SD card you have will work in this, as well as the newer high-capacity SDHC cards, which currently are available in capacities up to 8GB, with cards in 16 and 32 GB being announced. Connectivity is through a standard min-USB cable. You can operate the D2 in standard "mass storage" mode where you just drag and drop files into the folders, or you can operate this in MTP mode which is supposedly compatible with Microsoft's "Plays For Sure" program and other subscription based services. I cannot vouch for this, but I have no reason to doubt it.    I've waited for about three years to upgrade my MP3 player, waiting for the perfect player to come along; the Cowon D2 nicely fits that bill. I was looking for a player that had the following qualities (in order of importance):  1) Awesome sound 2) Standard USB interface (no specialized USB connectors) 3) Drag and Drop (no special sync software required) 4) Expandable memory using standard media (SD/CF) 5) Firmware upgradeable 6) Replaceable/standard batteries  Unfortunately this device doesn't exist, but the Cowon D2 comes pretty close; 5 out of 6 ain't bad. It will be interesting to see what products Cowon comes up with in the future.  I've spent a good deal of time telling you what I like about the D2, now I need to tell you what I don't like about it:   For such a large player, it would be nice to have the ability to create playlists. I have yet to see a truly functional set of playlists work on this player. Sure, you can browse through music by artist, album, genre, folder, etc... But since I have such an eclectic collection of audio, it would be nice to organize it in the way I want.   The included stylus/kickstand is pretty much worthless. Sure, you can navigate with your fingers, but that makes for a smudgy screen. A normal stylus makes this a bit easier, but there's no way to attach it to the device.   On a rating of 10 stars, I'd have to give this 9.5. It's not perfect, but it's as close to it as anything I've ever heard of.

<Title>Amazing product
<Date>Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I got tired of my Creative Zen Vision M freezing up on me I decided to get a flash based player rather than a hard drive one.  I'd have to give up a lot of space (going from 30 to 8 in this case, including the SD card) but it was definitely worth it.  At first I had to decide between the new iRiver clix 2 and this player, I picked the iRiver and within a week felt like it wasn't living up to what I expected, it was nice but it lacked too much compared to the Cowon D2 (I knew this because my friend has this player).  I was disappointed that it was only 4 gigs and not loud enough for me.  With the D2 I have 4 gigs and a slot for an SD card, another 4 gigs, so it's double the space.  As soon as you install the newest firmware you'll be on your way and ready to listen to music from the SD card as well as the player.  The battery life is great, very small and compact, touchscreen works wonderfully, and again the sound is just amazing!  And it's even better with the right pair of headphones (in my case I got the Westone UM2's, also on my friends recommendation).

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had high expectations about the D2 but got extremely disappointed with it. I used to have a clix that I lost and after reading about the D2 I felt attracted to the 2.5in screen, which is very nice, the SD slot, and battery life. Once I received the D2 I got very annoyed with its unintuitive interface. I eventually got it going and was able to transfer video and audio, both played with great quality.  So, why didn't I like the D2? It has some great features, but the interface requires a lot of taping to get it going. The stylus pen can't be put away, it just hangs from an elastic band, not the most elegant function. It felt bulky compared to the clix and I missed the flash games, I am a Sudoku addicted! I saw that flash is now supported by the D2 with the latest firmware but you have to go looking around for games. Maybe I got too used to the simplicity of the clix. I also realized that battery life was never an issue with my old clix and read that the new screen, though smaller than the D2's, is beautiful with its AMOLED technology. The  D2 does work with napster to go.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I haven't purchased a music player since my 128MB Rio more than 5 years ago, so I don't know what the competition is like, so keep that in mind.  Having said that, the D2 did not meet my expectations.  I have no interest in images, text or videos.  All I wanted to do was load some albums on and be able to easily navigate to them and play.  I also wanted to be able to see the album art, especially when navigating.  I guess this was all too much to ask.  I got the D2 and attached it to my PC running Windows Media Player.  WMP detected it right away and started syncing (whatever that means - it copied my entire library onto the D2). So far so good.  I turned on the D2 and tried to navigate.  First of all, no album art, just gray squares where the album art could be.  Second, navigating consists of scrolling through an alphabetical list of every track on the device.  This stinks.  Well, it turns out that getting album art is a generally painful thing, that WMP makes look easy.  You cannot get it seamlessly, you have to work for it.  The art needs to be embedded in the MP3 file, and WMP won't do it for you.  Other nerd oriented programs like Media Monkey will do it, but with extensive hand labor (manually click every album and select/confirm the album art).  I went through this procedure, only screwing up about a dozen tracks in the process (tagged and renamed with incorrect information).  I have not yet gotten Media Monkey to work with the D2 itself, so I'm back to using explorer to drag and drop music files onto the D2.  So much for "syncing".  Then back to the D2.  Still gray squares!  The album art comes up, but only when the album is playing, you can't use album art to navigate.  Major disappointment.  Now it becomes painfully clear that there is approximately zero documentation with the D2.  The CD has a user guide, but it hardly scrapes the surface (half a page devoted to the music player).  After trial and error I found my way to a screen that lets you sort by album or artist.  It literally takes about seven screen taps to get to it, and if you stop clicking for more than 5 seconds, it reverts back to the player screen, forcing you to start over.  Very annoying.  Incidentally, the default is also for the whole screen to go black in 10 seconds, which is also highly irritating when you are trying to figure stuff out.  Bottom line is that I didn't get what I wanted from the D2.  I don't know if any other players out there are better though.  The interface is just plain annoying, compounded by the lack of a manual, so everything is either trial and error, or beg for help on the on-line forum.  The album art thing is probably a fairly global problem, though if the D2 could read the album art from the album folder, it could be kind-of compatible with WMP - you'd still have to drag and drop the music instead of syncing.

<Title>Great media player, lousy radio
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cons: radio useless unless you have a strong signal, pointer/stand is useless as stand, video files need to be massaged with Cowon's utilities, some problems registering on www.cowon.com site, usual earbuds, case is extra  That having been said, I love this little unit. It is software standards based (uses UMC, so it appears as two disks on my Linux system [internal memory and SD card memory]), hardware standards based (no proprietary cables for data upload and download), seems to support every media format on Earth, and is expandable with SD memory. I use the SD chips as my library, keeping only  my most listened to music in internal memory. I do wish that there were some way to move files around without use of a computer, but oh well. I did buy the suggested leather case for it, but had to cut a slit so that I could swap memory cards without taking the D2 out of the case. Their latest firmware (2.50) supports Flash, but I have not seen any Flash applications for it yet. Their user community seems to be quite active. I previously used a Gen 1 iriver clix and hated the proprietary file transfer and cables. Would I buy this unit again, knowing what I do now? You bet.

<Title>Pick a side and the choice is made
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are two kinds of people.  Team 1 are people like me, who use laptops for work and never have their notebooks out of sight for more than a couple of days.  Team 2 are those lucky people who have laptops or desktops and have not turned them on in 6 months.  If you are a member of Team 2, stop reading right now, this product is not for you.  Save the money you don't spend on internet access and blow it on a four hundred dollar I-Pod, cause that's what you need.  BUT, if you are member of Team 1, this is the product for you.  I keep my library on my laptop, video, audio or otherwise.  My player does not need capacity, it needs performance and that's exactly what this product provides.  It has great audio quality, stunning video and an unbeatable battery life (50hrs+!).  It quickly an easily interfaces with my PC and my laptop, transferring files quickly and with a minimum of fuss.  Use wise, it is well engineered.  Small and light enough to fit in a pocket unnoticed, yet not so small or light I forget it is there and sit on it or send it to the cleaners.   It is easy to use without the stylus and supports every file format imaginable.  For the price, it is unbeatable so long as you do not need the 80 gigs.  Drawbacks would be that the screen will scratch if you are not careful with the device (put it in your pocket with your keys etc.) and it does not work with MAC OS.  If you are on Team 1, stop thinking and just buy it, you will not be sorry.  Team 2, I have no idea what you do with your lives that you do not need a computer all the time,but good luck affording your 1st, 2nd and 3rd I-Pods because they will all break.

<Title>Best MP3 player
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third Cowen/iAudio mp3 player to buy.  I love this D2.  Great battery life.  Charging takes about 4 hours and even though it says it will last 50 hours, I've found it last around 30 to 40+ hours and that's real life useage - using the radio, mp3 and video player.  Comes with Wall charger or you can charge it with the usb cable.  Video Screen is very bright and movies play great on it.  You have to convert videos using their software to play. The Software is easy to use, but if the movie you want to convert is an hour long, then it will take at least an hour to convert it.      The Mic is very strong, so you can't hold the unit in your hand and record or it will pick up too much scratching noice, but it you lay it on a table and don't hold it while you record, it's very good.  I've had the unit for about 2 months and they've made 2 firmware updates since then that you can download.  Example - one firmware update gave the unit the ablitiy to be used as a notepade and draw on the screan with different colors, sort of like the old paint program.       Positives =   Battery, Screen clearity, sound, video size, you don't have to use any software - just drag and drop songs onto the player.  It acts as a hard drive if you want to put other files on it for storage.      Negatives =     You have to buy the special line input cable from a resellers website for about $10 and also the video output cable, also around $10.  There are no games and no calculator on the unit, but hopefully a new firmware change will add those soon. It does not play audio books from audible ( even though a sales person said it does ).

Earphones supplied with it are very average, dosen't have  builtin speakers, Video out cable sould seperatly so no TV out, Dosen't play DivX, XVid movies so u need to convert them before u can watch them. Its primarly a Audio product and not multimedia player.

<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have used I river H10 and Zen V plus and the sound is far superior for the cowon d2. This is especially so when the custom equalizer option is used. The custom equalizer seams to distort the sound for I river H10 and Zen V plus. The cowon is also superior because it can connect to the computer with mtp or generic external protocol.

<Content>In terms of audio, Cowon in general and particularly the Cowon D2 is one of the three best audio players in 2007, with the Sony and the iRiver. Far ahead compared to the iPods.

<Title>Best player for audiobooks
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use the D2 primarily for listening to audiobooks from Netlibrary and Audible.  The D2 has great bookmarking, a reliable resume feature ( that has to be enabled by checking it.)The tap on the screen interface is a breeze to use and hard to screw up. Best of all, it is the only player that has a time elapsed bar that can be tapped at any point to move immediately to that part of the file. So if you are using a 20 hour single file Netlibrary book, you do not have to hold the fastforward down for ten minutes to get back to your place if you accidentally lose it.

<Content>I bought the Cowon D2 not thru Amazon, but I have to say I read all the reviews on Amazon and they influenced my purchase. After a little help from my vendor's tech support I was able to transfer video files( my lack of tech ability, not the D2's). I am thrilled with the level of audioand video fidelity. Of course the screen is small, but for long air journeys with the entire "Police Academy" series as your alternative,it becomes quite acceptable. I am an opera devotee, and I have a number of live concerts on this device and I am satisfied. I would recomend it to anyone.
