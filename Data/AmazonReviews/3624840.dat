<Title>Another Winner from Apple
<Date>Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased my iPod Mini two days after it was released and I must admit, I am blown away by the functionality and style of Apple's newest creation.  Just as a background, I also own a 20 GB third generation iPod, so my comparisons and observations are from a first hand perspective.<p>So, why on earth did I buy a Mini?  Quite simply, I was so impressed with this device that I had to have one.  First off, the scroll wheel is vastly improved over the standard iPod.  The wheel is still touch sensitive for scrolling, but the functionality of the four buttons has been placed around the wheel and can be clicked.  This makes for much easier one handed operation.  The screen is razor sharp and the backlighting is awesome.  The exterior shell is all aluminum and the screen is recessed in the front of the case.  This ipod feels much more durable and resisitant to scratching than my standard iPod.  The battery life is also improved.  This mini played for nearly 8 hours on the first charge.  I typically never get more than 4.5-6 out of my standard iPod.  The biggest difference is the form factor of the device (size and the weight).  At only 3.6 ounces this iPod can be carried in the pocket without noticing it is there.  As small as my standard iPod is, somehow, you always know it is there.  The Mini solves this problem.  After all, what good is an iPod that holds all of my music, if it is not quite small enough to have with me all the time.<p>Perhaps one of the coolest parts is the interaction with iTunes.  My Library is 7.4 GB, which exceeds the capacity of the Mini.  However, when you connect it for the first time, it automatically knows this and creates an &quot;iPod Mini Playlist&quot; that serves as a second library just for my Mini.  Just drag and drop from your main library and the songs transfer to the Mini in a snap.<p>Now, I know what you are all thinking . . . why pay $249 for 4 GB, when you can have 15 GB for only $50 more?  The answer is quite simple.  In life, purchasing decisions are made with emotion and justified with logic.  On paper, there is no disputing the fact that you get far more GB per dollar by going with the standard iPod; and the standard iPod is a terrific piece of equipment.  But beyond the logical considerations lies the iPod Mini.  The way it feels in your hand, the enhanced functionality of the scroll wheel, the great form factor, and the cool aluminum finish.  All of these intangibles create a product that transcends a strict price per GB comparison and makes this iPod worth every penny of its $249 price tag.<p>The bottom line . . . I have 1050 songs on my Mini with room to spare.  I bought the Mini because it puts a smile on my face every time I use it and it is just too darn cool to pass up.  I highly recommend this device.

<Title>The best player on the market
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Its amazing. I love it. I have the 40 GB Gen 3 and I want my wife's mini. The case is very well constructed, it feels solid. The whole thing is made of anondized aluminum and it feels super sturdy. The screen is crystal clear and the perfect size. The clickwheel is WAY better than the current Ipod configuration of 4 buttons above the scroll wheel. The clickwheel feels solid and the clicking is crisp. The wheel doesnt rotate but Im sure you coulda figured that out already. Its touch sensitive for scrolling with the select button still in the middle. And yes you can scroll thru songs super fast like a normal Ipod The color is vibrant and the mini is just the right size. <p>This thing fits in your pocket and you dont even know its there. I put my big ipod in my pocket and it feels like im smuggling a pack of cards. If you got the means, get this player. It doesnt disappoint.   Its like the Prada of the electronics world.<p>And dont let the nonsense you hear about battery life sway you.  The battery is fine, I regularly get 8 hours of play out of it.  Of course in a few years you will have to replace the battery for $59 but thats the nature of ALL rechargeable batteries.  They eventually die over their lifetime.  Its just a scientific fact.  <p>Get the ipod mini now...A++ would buy another one . This thing has COOL dripping off it

<Title>Way Cooler Than Expected
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After all the anti-hype surrounding Apple's &quot;overpriced&quot; low-end iPod, I expected to be very disappointed by this, especially since we already on a full 40G current-generation model; but I was very pleasantly surprised. <p>The mini's smaller size is far more of an advantage than I had expected, making it the first truly pocketable iPod, and one of the nicest pocketable MP3 players ever. The smaller display (which omits album name) is crisp and clear, and the new control, which combines the wheel and select control of the current generation iPods with the four function buttons, is actually an improvement over the full-sized version's controls.<p>In every other respect the mini is indistinguishable from its (surprisingly much) larger cousins, except for two: (1) it is still a bit overpriced (but those who must have one need not hesitate) and (2) it's much smaller capacity may not work for many users.

<Title>Great.. when it works
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my mini the first day it came out at my local store.  I've waited 3 years to buy a player of this caliber, and thought this finally was the one I wanted.<p>It's been 5 days, and its broken!!  It stopped in the middle of a song and froze.  There is no re-set button on this, and the battery is not one that can be removed.   Translation:  needs to be taken back.  This is the problem I feared when I saw that the battery was built in, and my fear was realized not even 1 week into it.<p>When it worked, it did sound great.  I had it hooked up with my Bose headphones and the sound was equal of that to my home stereo system, which is impressive.  <p>My gut feeling here is that it's new and the software probably has some bugs.  I'm going to exchange it and get a new one, and see if this problem recurs.  <p>My only other knock is itunes.  I just don't care for the s/w.. it's not very user friendly.

<Title>WOW.....thats a lot of money
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am not reviewing how this works b/c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but......i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player.  I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player (non-ipod) for about the same price, maybe a little more.  It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style.  I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion.  I just want to listen to music!!!!!

<Title>HERE IS THE SKINNY ON MY MINI
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been waiting for this to arrive and now I have it so let me share with you what I know. This is my first ipod and I am glad I waited. To start with I love the look of it. Pink is the color that I have it is sooooo cute. It dose not hold as many songs as the other ipods so that is something you should know right off. For the price I do think it should hold more. If you are using this with a PC you must have Windows 2000 or XP. It works smoothly and great sound so far, I am very pleased with it.<p>PROS:<p>1. The size, it is easy to carry or put in your pocket and you can wear it around your neck also.<p>2. If you buy this from the Mac store online you can get it personalized free. Wayyyyy cool<p>3.  Ease of operation and good customer help if you need it.<p>4.  You can download books as well as music from MAC.COM<p>CONS:<p>1.  It is pricey for something that can only hold 1000 songs.<p>2.   Would have liked to have  seen a color screen, something I am sure they can do.<p>3.   Headphones could be better. I don't like earplugs.<p>4.   Battery life is only 8 hours.

<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Either I got a defective one, but after 4 hours with 7 different techs on the phone and calls to Apple Corporate, someone has agreed to exhange my unit for another one.<p>My i-Tunes would load all the songs on to the i-pod, and you could pick a song, but it would never play, just go blank.<br>Waited a month, had it engraved, now I have to wait for a box to return it, and then wait for another one and start over.  I think it may be advisable to wait to they get the bugs worked out.  7 different techs could not figure it out.  Or, maybe I got a bad one.

<Title>P.O.S.
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman.

<Title>Great except when it sucks
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved it when it was working right, but 6 months after I first got it, Itunes crashed while updating the ipod and the hard drive got corrupted.  Luckily, you can still buy the AppleCare protection if it's been less than a year so I got it and they sent me a new Ipod.    That worked great for almost a year but then my battery life got really short (1 hour or so).  I sent it back again, since I was still covered by AppleCare, but they told me they wouldnt cover it because it was caused by abuse!  I never did anything "abusive" to it, I dropped it maybe once or twice, and I dont see how that would cause it to work fine except for the reduced battery life.  I realize they dont make this model anymore, but I'm definitely goign to look around at the other makers before I get my next MP3 player.  And apparently it's barely worth getting applecare for the battery issue alone.

<Title>The First Colorful iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Mini was the first iPod that came in colors. So, it was the first iPod I bought--It was pink. I could not resist.  When I first got the iPod, it was flawless performance and exactly what I wanted. The earphones work fabulously, I had all my favorite music, it was small and durable. Some people talk about glitches in it, and yes, mine had some. But my Applecare free warranty was still intact, so I sent it back and was sent a brand-new iPod in 2 days. That works for me!  The screen is old-fashioned nowadays, yes, but its low-key and still fabulous. Sadly my Mini got stolen, so now I'll be needing a pink Nano.   In conclusion, an amazing machine with plenty of memory and good looks to go with it.

<Title>Great....if you don't mind glitches
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first got this pink iPod mini for my birthday last year I was thrilled. The battery life was never ending, it was easy to use, and it looked cute and withstanded constant torture. However, a year later I am deeply dissapointed in this Apple product. I started noticing during the summer it downloaded songs very slowly and constantly froze on itunes. After disconnecting it from the USB it would freeze, just simply switching from song to song froze it. I noticed that the batter was much less than the promised hours and after a full charge the battery would go down after about 5 minutes of use. If I was to leave it alone a couple of days after a full charge when I would turn it back on the battery would be half gone. The earphones that are included with the iPod, just forget them, they are comeplete crap, they crack and break open, and the sound comes through all fuzzy. If the battery was to be completey gone and I would plug it into the computer to charge it would freeze right there and not chrage at all. I would suggest moving on to the more new and improved iPod's that work better and last longer. iPod mini's last a year, two at the most.

<Title>Not Happy with it
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a Green iPod mini for my birthday in July 2005. I loved the easy to use clickwheel, and the shiny green color. But around October of that year, it started to have glitches and it would freeze up after being on for only 2 minutes! I took it to Apple and they gave me a new one because of a problem. Then in February 2006, the replacement mini died. It wasn't recognized on iTunes, and it finally showed the sad iPod icon. I put it in Diagnostic Mode (Press Select and Previous) and I did a HDD scan. The scan failed and when I reset it, it turned on to the sad iPod again and the hard drive started clicking and it sounded like it was abour to explode. I went to Apple again and they gave me another one. When I got home (thankfully Apple store only 15 minutes away from me) I charged it, and it worked fine. Now it's February 2007, and the warranty expired today. When I turned it on when I woke up, it wouldn't turn on.   What a waste of time. This is the most UNRELIABLE iPod out there. And Apple says they can only repair it for a fee of $[...]. That's how much I paid for it in the beginning! I'm just going to buy a new iPod nano.

<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is a good basic unit.  The controls are a bit touchy.  You have to get the hang of skimming you finger around the touch circle.  You also have to remeber to lock the controls while you are listening, or a slight brush on the control surface will change settings.  The iTunes software is nice.  The autosynch feature is easy to use.  Overall, a good unit for the price.

<Content>This was the worst electronics puchase I've ever made.  When I first got the mini it was great, looked nice and sounded great.  Within about 6 months battery life started to go way down, after a year it was down to nothing, didn't work properly, would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes.  If you're going to take a chance on an iPod, definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one.

It is very easy to use and unbelievably cool.  I use the firewire and the I-tunes software that came supplied with the player. For a first-timer in digital audio, this product makes it quite easy to rip a cd to your computer or download a song, and then put it on the I-pod (which is automatically done for you). Product design is flawless.  This is my first Apple product, and I am very impressed.  I've had no trouble using it with Windows XP home ed..  This product is well worth the price.  If you are considering one, buy it if you can.(I was lucky enough to pick one up the first day they went on sale)  You will certainly not be disappointed

<Title>Small in Size not in Functionality
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod mini is built from the ground up as a portable device for people with fast-paced lives.  It's small and lightweight physical dimensions are perfectly suited to be being placed in a pants or shirt pocket without being a burden.<p>But don't let its light weight fool you into thinking the iPod mini is a pushover.  The 4GB hard drive (3.7 GB actual) can hold about 1,000 songs - enough to last almost three full days.  The installed software includes four games; calendar; notepad; contact database; clock; backlight with timer; alarm clock; and the abilities to customize the main menu; create playlists; and rate songs.  All this is in addition to being able to be used as an external hard drive.<p>However, the most revolutionary aspect of the iPod mini (aside from it's size and weight) is its control interface.  Incorporating the `Menu', `Pause/Play', `Forward' and `Back' buttons directly to the touch sensitive scroll wheel not only creates simplicity from a design standpoint, but form a user one as well.  Accessing these controls is a breeze.  Thankfully the touch wheel is designed well enough that accidental pressing of a control is unlikely to occur since you have to press down a bit to activate the button.  I'd actually like to see the entire iPod line adopt this interface.<p>Some people complain that the iPod mini is only slightly cheaper than the 20 GB iPod and offers a lot less storage space.  But what you loose in storage space you gain in portability.  It is also important to consider that compared to other players of its size and weight, the iPod mini offers much more storage space, many more features, and a better music jukebox in iTunes 4.0.<p>I want to carry the most music I can in the smallest possible device that offers the best interface and features.  For me, that device is unquestionably the iPod mini.  If you have similar demands of a portable music device, the iPod mini is sure to become a permanent accessory to your lifestyle.

<Title>Apple has hit another home run!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had been reading about the iPod Mini for months, and with each passing week wanted one more and more.  I was lucky enough to live near an Apple store, and bought mine the second day they came out -- 2/21/04.  While I've only had my Mini a week, it looks to be a tremendous product.  The price may be a little higher than you'd like, but for an extra $50 or so compared to smaller MP3 players, you get more capacity than you really need -- I have over 750 songs on mine (about 36 hours worth!), a beautiful design (I got the blue one and it gets a lot of compliments), a small size that easily fits in a pocket unlike the bigger iPod's, and good battery life (I haven't really checked the 8 hour claim, but I got over 5 hours of continuous playing on just the quick charge which takes about an hour).  I installed iTunes 4.2 and the download from there to the Mini was done in about 10 minutes.  No problems with the download and no software/hardware problems either.  I have a Dell 4600, and iTunes and the Mini work perfectly with it.  RECOMMENDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY!!

<Title>iPod Mini in PINK!
<Date>Sat Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought one of these for my wife and she loves it.  I find it terribly over-rated.<p>I especially hate the software under Windows - it was probably the worst installation procedure I have ever seen - not allowing you to customize what or where it is installed. Its like they thought we all want to be Mac users and just automatically do everything for us even though we would like control!<p>It's also real buggy under Windows - always appearing to hang. And it is not ergonomic to update the iPod with new songs - it has to plugged in and out again constantly.  It will not recognize new CDs unless you restart the software. My advise is to have the iPod unplugged all the time until you are ready to update the songs.<p>There is a long way Apple has to go with this before it is as good as some of the other brands designed for Windows.

<Title>Ipod Mini
<Date>Sat Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>[The Ipod Mini]- The image and design of the Ipod mini is everything that it is hyped up to be. Once you buy it, and hold it in your hands, the design will send a chill through your body. The software is easy to install on the PC and the MAC and navigation of songs and other features are simple to use in both Itunes and in the Ipod mini.<p>[The main concern]- if you buy the Ipod would be the battery life. 8 Hours for the Ipod mini is a little short. If you play games, use the backlight or other functions, the battery life will wear out even faster. Leaving the Ipod mini off for a period of time will also drain the battery. In addition, the Ipod mini is slow to charge up. Although it takes 1 hour to charge it up to about 80%, it will take 4 hours to fully charge the mini. If you use your computer's firewire or usb cable to charge up the mini, it will take even longer, although I have not really been patient enough to see how long that takes, but whatever it is, its too long. The only way that your songs can be uploaded is through Itunes, and the Ipod mini does not play wma music files although you can easy convert those yourself with third party software.<p>[A little tip]- Keep in mind that by default Itunes will automatically update your Ipod mini. It will be important to know that if you delete songs in your library, the next time you connect the Ipod mini to Itunes, the songs in your Ipod will be deleted automatically. If you don't want that to happen, you should definitely turn that feature off. There are also a lot of awesome accessories for the Ipod mini and you should definitely go check it out in Amazon's recommendations

<Title>Mini iPOD is perfect in my eyes!
<Date>Sun Feb 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After spending hours searching for a mini iPod in stock, I finally located one at a local CompUSA and ran down to purchase it in my favorite color, blue.  After owning a 3G 20GB iPod for only about 2 months (after discovering the beauty of the iTunes Music Store), I wasn't really planning on buying the mini.  But after seeing them at an Apple Store a few days back, I was in love.  The sound quality is the same, amazing, syncing is easy as all things Apple, the design is gorgeous, the screen is beautiful (and I prefer it to the 3G because it's smaller and SHARPER, as well as brighter).  4GB of music is more than enough for me, and the style, quality (build is excellent), ITMS, and Apple name all justify the $250 price tag.  Worthy of being in anyone's pocket.

<Title>Joy to my ears
<Date>Mon Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great little device.  I should start by saying that I never owned the original iPod, so the only comparison I can make to the bigger one is the size, since I held both in a local store.  The iPod mini just feels great in your hand--the design engineers for Apple deserve an award for this thing.  Its a good bit smaller than the original, and oh yes, that clickwheel.  That is another design marvel, and one that I'm sure will eventually be on all iPods.  Setup was easy as well, just hooked up the Firewire cable to my Win XP machine (USB 2.0 is included as well), installed the software, and transferred my music.  Sound is very good, though I'm not a fan of the included earbud headphones (I much prefer my Grado ones instead).  As for people who complain about it being too expensive for its capacity, well they just haven't used it, plain and simple.  Apple has hit a home run, and its sure to strengthen their market share for MP3 devices.  Worth every penny.

<Title>i-pod mini is the best
<Date>Mon Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The i-pod mini is compact, and easy to use.  The software is also very easy to use.  I can download an entire album in under 30 seconds.  It is awesome!  The only bad thing is that the earbud headphones sometimes come out of my ears. In my mind, the problem is a small price to pay for the excellent sound that comes out of them.  Overall, this is a very good product.  Well worth the cost.

<Title>As much art as it is science!
<Date>Tue Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been an iPod evangalist since I first turned on the 5GB.  As you may know from my reviews of the 5, 15, 20, and 40GB models, I've owned (or given as gifts) just about every incarnation of this glorious device.  So, when Apple announced that it was releasing a dramatically redesigned version of the iPod, I knew right away it would at least be a hit, perhaps even enjoy the almost &quot;cult-like&quot; status of its larger parent.<p>So I pre-ordered 3 of them; one for each of my sisters and myself.  They arrived about a week ago and I'm happy to report that Apple has done it again with the release of the iPod Mini.  It totally ROCKS!  <p>There are allot of things I like about this model, but before I get into them A VERY IMPORTANT WARNING TO THOSE THAT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT:<p>YOU MUST CHARGE AT LEAST 4 HOURS BEFORE USE!<p>I, like so many I'm sure, was very eager to &quot;plug and play&quot;.  I did, without fully charging them, and they experienced all kinds of impossible to resolve errors.  <p>Now, in the event you've already bought one, or simply can't help yourself, there is a little known &quot;reset feature&quot; on the mini that will come in handy whenever you have an issue.<p>TO RESET THE MINI, PRESS AND HOLD THE MENU AND SELECT BUTTON (the middle round button) FOR SIX SECONDS.  <p>That'll bring your baby back to life.<p>The colors are awesome (I have the blue, silver, and pink), look very stylish, and will likely show less wear.  If you have the patience, consider having Apple engrave them for you (looks very cool).<p>The sound is excellent.  I don't have a testing lab, but I could swear that the sound quality is better; and I'm almost certain that they can play at a higher volume.<p>Another important improvement is the fact that when skipping forward more than a handful of songs the mini doesn't stall (for a second or two) like it's predecessors.<p>So, in conclusion, this is a wonderful new player that'll be sure to WOW everyone that owns it, and create envious spectators out of those that don't.<p>Hope this was helpful.<p>Christian Hunter<br>Santa Barbara, CA.

<Content>This iPod holds an average amount of songs.It is a decent size.Not to big like the regular iPod,not to small like the nano(which can brake easily).So it is balanced basically.But it would be a lot better if it can hold more songs.

<Title>The ipod mini is awesome, but must be handled with care
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The ipods definitely outrank any other mp3 player in quality. I know because I have had 3 mp3 players before this one. But the fact of the mattter is that the ipod mini is a hard drive player, meaning it has parts that move inside of the thing. Therefore, significant force will cause the hard drive to work improperly. But the ipod mini is incredibly strudy, so if you get one, don't TOSS it in your purse, or run 1o miles with it like these other idiots and you should be fine in the event of minor tremors. They wonder, "oh why is my ipod not working," well that's because you treat the thing like a frickin' baseball. If you want an mp3 to accompany you in an activity that will require a LOT of movement, then get the flash based ipod nano or shuffle, where there are no moving parts, but a smaller storage. But if you have a huge assortment of songs, then hard drives will sure as hell be able to hold all those songs. And that's the difference between flash based mp3s and hard drive mp3s. So, if you are willing to buy the mini, you have to understand that difference and the fact that the mini, despite how sturdy, will crash if you disrupt the hard drive inside by slamming it, trhowing it, dropping it every ten minutes, etc. And the batery, just get the third gen. minis that have an 18 hour battery life, and if it dies for good, buy a battery pack for about 30 dollars. That's all there is to it. Just treat your mini like you would a child and distrust these people who say their's doesn't work. That is only because they make it not work, not Apple.

<Title>Nice MP3 player, but it has some cons
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had my ipod mini for almost a year. I got it on my 18th b-day, I have a pink one. I love my ipod mini, but it has some cons. Ipod mini is very easy to mess up, so if your a clumsy person you might want to get another mp3, another thing it freezes or cuts off every now and then and the battery life isn't all that good. I love that the ipod mini can hold a lot of music, it comes in nice colors, and has many accessories for it, you can put numbers in it, used it as a organizer, and play games on it, etc. Overall I give it 3 stars cause I just adore it and a lot of people are jealous of me cause I have one,and plus it's pink.

<Title>It;s my baby!
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple's part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It's smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.  It holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it's still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother's mp3 player, needing to press "next" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it's job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.  Another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod "family" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods. I've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that's how much I love it!  For having so many great features, this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200, I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW!!!! it's amazing!

<Title>Better than competitors
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>IPod quality and design is unbeatable. Just a few cons, the sound quality of the included headphones is regular to bad, battery life is very short, the surface of the body is easy to scratch so you better get and IPod skin. I bought the Sennheiser PX 100 Headphones, the sound quality now is superb. Go for it !

<Title>How did I live without it?
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It was nearly one year ago when I first recieved a Green Ipod Mini for my birthday. Since then I am rarely without it. I'd been warned by a number of people that the batteries broke easily and that they got scratched like anything, but even so I decided it was the gadget for me. The risk payed off.  Holding 1,000 songs makes for a great deal of hours listening to music or podcasts. I am absolutely addicted to music and this li'l gem changed my life forever. The sound has stayed crips and clear, the volume is great and I haven't needed to replace the earphones. For me, this is absolute perfection.   The battery lasts for a LONG time and charging is simple and quick. Scratch wise, I invested in a good quality cover which stays on it all the time, so I have had no problems with scratches. The iPod is sturdy, (I admit to dropping it a couple of times) and the buttons and menus are easy and quick.  Downloading songs is also a piece of cake. Just plug your iPod into your computer or laptop and with iTunes I have been able to simply change around my songs, delete, add more, to my hearts content.  If you want something cute, colourful, stylish, easy-to-use and very VERY reliable, then go for an iPod mini. And with music downloading being so easy, it's more than likely that it will replace your CD's forever! So buy one, you will not regret it.
