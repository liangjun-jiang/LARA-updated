<Content>I got 2 of these for my two oldest, 9 and 12, and I'd say that for a first mp3 player it's good enough.  They both love it.

<Title>Okay if it worked longer
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player Sunday and it's Tuesday and it's no longer working--I tried new batteries and everything so tomorrow I'm taking it back for another one to see if it will work--When it was working though it did play good--Well hope to have better luck on the next one....

<Title>Wow, that didn't last long
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While I enjoyed this little light weight gizmo while it lasted, it didn't last very long.  Within the span of a month it was pushing up daisies, not playing, not responding, not acessable through any computer (pc or mac.)  I used it mostly during my mile walks to and from work and trips to the grocery store, neither could be considered extream environments.

<Title>It's okay...
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Alright, first off this piece of crap will randomly stop playing. It started off when I'd just walk around that it would turn off, but now sometimes I barely TOUCH IT and tilt it to the side to look at the song and it turns off.  It is NOT easy to use if you're a HOLD button person... if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer, it will not let you delete or add music, which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist. Also, the headphones that come with it are REALLY not worth it, they are really really bad, so go buy some nice Sony ones. AND, the song switcher thinger is a little defective... it's neat, but you can push it down and it'll hit something inside of the MP3 player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy... so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my MP3 player whenever its in my pocket or something. I think thats about it... I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want a cheap piece of s***.

<Title>Great for four months
<Date>Sun Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item was great for the few months that it worked.  I liked how I could just plug it straight into a USB port to transfer music.  I had just started using its voice recording function when it stopped working.  I was able to record a lecture and do an interview with it.  It seemed to me to have a good range and playback.  I typically didn't use the earphones, but rather plugged it into my tape player in my vehicle.  A drawback perhaps is that songs are listed sequentially, so it is not possible to select a menu, choose your favorite artist, and then choose a specific song from that artist.  But, I didn't mind that so much.  The major flaw was that it stopped working.  The COBY screen flashes on and off, never getting to the point where I can play any music.  I can still use it as a thumb drive to store media if I want, but it's a bit bulkier than my other ones.  When I contacted COBY about doing a reboot, I was told how to reboot it, but that it was out of the short warranty period.  I know that no device is going to last forever, but I think that I'd like an MP3 player to last longer than 4 months.

<Title>Don't waste Your time
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only possible attraction to this gizmo is the price.  With that said it is still over priced.  I purchased my Coby player from a local sporting goods store because I didn't want to pay a lot for a new mp3 player.  I just had a really good one that I spent maybe $49 dollars for, stolen.  And when I went to buy a new one they were priced around $80, $90 and up.  I went with this cheapo item and paid about $36 hoping that if I lose it or get it stolen again it wouldn't be a big deal.  Now I'm begging someone, please take it.  I used it for a few days and did not like the difficult screen menus. You have to scroll with a toggle switch several times just to get to a menu that enables you to play music.  The toggling is not intuitive and you have to jar it several times before it actually moves once.  The view is less that an inch tall and so you really can't see what your playing.  Long story short before anyone got a chance to steal this one it stopped working completely in a couple of weeks.  I just took it back to the store for a refund of my money.  It is well worth it to spend another 10 or 20 dollars and get a decent MP3 player.

<Title>so far so good
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this product for about 8 mos with no problems.  I bought it for 19.99 at a local save-a-lot store.  The pros, other than being inexpensive,  is its ease of use and transferring music.  my pc immediatly recognized it with no disc needed. There are a few cons but for the price they are negligable.

<Title>Not worth the money!  
<Date>Sat Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had it for less than two weeks and the player no longer works. The player would shut off for no reason occasionally and then finally it had a total malfunction.  Customer service only had one solution and that was to reformat it on my computer but the computer would not recognize it being there.  Had trouble with switching between songs with the toggle switch.  the headphones are bad to use, sound quality is ugly to say the least.  You get what you pay for!!

<Title>Not worth wasting your money on...
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This device has one primary purpose...to display the name COBY when you turn it on, and then to immediately shut down.  Oh, it may play your files for a week or two as a bonus when it's new, but then it resorts to it's true calling.  I purchased one of these some time ago and for my purposes, it did the job just fine.  For a while.  Then it just stopped and started the behavior mentioned above. Coby tech support was an annoyed-sounding person who suggested a fix that didn't work and another that did: Return it to the place where I purchased it.  So I did.  It was very new so they agreed to exchange it for another.  I thought I just had a defective player the first time, so that was fine by me.  The new player worked fine, until it eventually developed the same problems as the first one.  I tried downloading firmware from the website. No luck.    A quick search of the web found that my player had a very common problem, but to date the problem is not acknowledged on the Coby website nor is there a fix listed for it.  So I'm assuming that customer service is not a high priority from Coby.    I used their submission form to write them about the problem, and when I tried to submit the description I just received a bunch of error messages.    I'm done with Coby.
