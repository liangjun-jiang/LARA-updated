<Content>This little gadget delivers a big punch for very little money.  The sound is great and it is easy to load directly from your computer.  I am quite pleased with it.  It is very lightweight and easily carried around my neck (or anywhere).

<Content>Cute, reliable, compact and easy to use.  The only thing I did not like is that it is not compatable with Napster.

<Content>honestly I expected for the player to be below par for the price, but was delighted to discover I was incorrect. Definately one for the working class, otherwise I couldn't afford it.

<Title>Nextar MP3 player, don't buy it!
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The unit wouldn't support DRM, so any songs downloaded from the internet were not usable on the player.  Once we got some CD's burned and songs copied on it crashed and was never recoverable.  The voice recording feature also never worked like it said it would.

<Title>It Worked...At First...
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When i first got the MP3 player it was great, it worked fine and i was very pleased with its battery life. But then only 3 weeks after i bought the product it broke and unfortunately for me i threw away the box and everything that came with it once i thought it was working satisfactorily. Oh well. All i have to say is if given the chance i would NOT have bought the product in the first place, and regret doing so now.

<Content>First one didn't work, got a replacement - both easy to put music on the device but the music will not play ... very clugy button setup and even the neighborhood tekky kid couldn't get the songs downloaded to play - don't buy this item!

<Title>What a piece of crap
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over.  We thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery didn't help.  Don't buy this item.  I am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here.

<Title>Great for the money. Easy to use
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He uses it at the gym. Great for the money.  Easy to download songs. Sound quality from ear buds is not great, but he swapped out the headphones from his CD player. I have "borrowed" it so many times for walks, that I am finally breaking down and buying one for myself.

<Title>Hard to Use
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It took me weeks to figure out how to use it.  I downloaded the disk that came with it, but it was of no help.  And I scoured the instructions that came with it with a fine tooth comb, but I still did not get directions for how to use it or how to get songs onto it.

<Title>Great MP3 Player For The Price
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am giving this little player five stars because of its value to cost ratio. This unit 1) Supports ALL MP formats plus WMA and WAV 2) Has multiple equalizer settings (seven band) 3) Has multiple playback modes 4) Can serve as a voice recorder 5) Has visual picture menu 6) Has ID3 tagging (which displays as the song is being played) 7) Displays song lyrics if the LRC file is downloaded. Plus other features - all for $16. The first thing that you need to do when you receive this player is throw away the "ear bud" headphones - they are worthless. With a nice pair of bass/digital headphones, this unit has a startling beautiful sound. The volume is adequate, but not exceptional loud. That's probably because if the amplification was louder, you would have to put a new battery in every thirty minutes. Plus, they probably do not want to get sued for damaging your hearing. If you want it loud, plug it into a set of powered computer speakers - yes, that works. I'm already happy with this thing. If it lasts for a year, I'll be REALLY happy. Check out the other colors that this player comes in. The red one is very attractive.

<Title>Just perfect for us
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's a great unit for the price. I own and iPod and it's no comparison. But I will tell you it's great for people who don't need more than a simple, easy to use MP3 player. It certainly does all the basic functions my iPod does, plays music, fast forward, skip, replay, shuffle, etc. It has a lock to prevent bumping and shut-offs. It's light, small and lasts LONG time with one AAA battery. The LCD is difficult to read in sunlight.
