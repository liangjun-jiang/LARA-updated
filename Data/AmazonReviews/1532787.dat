<Content>Finally received the nano after a month of tracking and mis communications. That's when I found out that it was a refurbished unit, not NEW, as indicated when I ordered it!

<Content>I bought this ipod 6 months ago, and it works great! It is skinny and small, which is really nice to carry around. I got excellent service and fast shipping from a seller that was selling it used. All in all, this is a great gift for anyone and is a great ipod.
