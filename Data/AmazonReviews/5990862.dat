<Content>YES HELEN, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO!!! This little unit is slick and neat and is the size of a pack of Trident Chewing Gum, only partially thicker. RUNNERS, it fits nicely into that little pocket they put on your shorts and is it slick and beautiful.. So-o much for the esthetics's, it is easy to learn to use, and boy does it have the features you want in an mp3 player. The sound is spectacular as you can adjust the EQ to any desired sound you might like and Its easy to make play lists for your music and play only the play list or all music..Great for making a workout music play list.  DO NOT use the headphones that it comes with but get yourself a  good pair of headphones (I know, another investment). You can view pics and videos and easily turn the screen horizontal and play music while showing Aunt Helen or grandma those pics you took on vacation.. THE RADIO, with ease it scans and finds all the stations in your local area and you can delete the ones you don't care for and has wonderful reception and sound. All of the buttons are easy to use and logically placed. Software, you may not want to use Windows Media 11, but that's up to you. I use WinAmp and found it easier to find and adjust my directory targets..Oh, and the battery life is spectacular, my iPod went dead in a few hours BUT this one is like that ever ready battery guy, going and going and going. NOW for the downside.. Few to no accessories, I'm still waiting on a belt clip for $19.95, so don't expect any extras.. Must be connected to delete music.. So now you know why it gets so many 5 stars out there. Do your homework.

<Title>a great little Mp3 and video player
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought a Red one for myself, liked it so much I bought my wife a Pink one as a gift. Very easy to use just drag and drop music, picture or video files. The FM receiver is very good also, better at tuning in frequencies than the boom box I have at work, a good add-in feature. I also like that you can play sound tracks from a variety of ways, play list, folders, albums, or artist. The equillizer is another useful feature. The buttons compared to other Mp3 players I've used, have a very positive feel to them, unlike the Creative players I also own which tend to jump all over trying to select a item on the menu.  I found some great and free video converter software (Twin Video to iPod-Zune-PSP-3GP) from Cnet downloads that allow me to easily convert video files from my Sony camera to the format that this little cute uses.  If I have one complaint, its that this item is so new that accessories are very few or non-existent in number, things like AC DC chargers, cases etc, even from eBay. But I expect that they will become available in due time. I wish the Red came in a 8gb model I would buy that too.

<Content>Loaded it up with music easily and off we go.  I use it with regular over-the-ears headphones just because it's more convenient for me, and the sound quality of this little jewell is phenomenal.  Good battery life.

<Title>Loving it!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I researched high and low before settling on this model.  I wanted an FM radio option, so iPod was out.  The Sony MP3 models had the lowest number of negative user reviews, and even these tended to be minor.  Also they featured consistently positive reviews across the board from all major online sites, including Amazon.  I just received it today, and it worked flawlessly.  No installation (I already had Windows Media 11), and the menu was easy to follow.  Very happy with my choice.

<Title>Excellent value, solid player.
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is an all around solid MP3 player.   Initially I had some difficulty using Windows Media Player to transfer my files, but I downloaded the MediaManager from Sony.com and that worked very well it getting my iTunes music onto this unit (I have a 3rd gen iPod classic, and an iPhone (which I love).  Converting my iTunes purchased music is time consuming (the DRM tracks that is), but still workable and I'm sure with continued searching I'll find a tool that works easily (as opposed to buring a CD then importing into iTunes using MP3 encoder).  I was also concerned before I bought it about the controls.  I've become accustomed to the iPod click wheel and the touch screen on my iPhone, but once I got the unit it was really a non-issue.  The interface is clean and easy and the front controls work well.  Battery life is awesome.   Sound quality is excellent (not sure it's better than iPod as many reviewers have commented, but it is certainly as good, and likely better to most given the audio enhancement options available).  The display is crisp and video works surprisingly well.  I can't imagine watching much on it, but the occasional video podcast might be nice.  The display is much better than the Creative Zen V Plus I bought for the wife a year ago or so.  I would definitely recommend this unit for anyone looking for a inexpensive MP3 player with FM radio.
