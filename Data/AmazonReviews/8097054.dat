<Title>Don't waist your time or money!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The player is small and lightweight. It looks good, and the blue LCD is cool, but this isn't a cool MP3 player! The case is cheap and would probably explode if dropped. The sound is noisy during quite songs, and a weird static can be heard fluctuating in the background. At times, the player will not even recognize songs after you have spent a loooooong time uploading them to this slow player. And even at times the player would recognize all of the tracks uploaded, but would merge them all together when played, creating a very bad experience when wearing headphones! Spend your money elsewhere. This is not one to try.

<Title>GREAT MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Sat Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a great mp3 player for its price. You can download about 70 songs to it. The music software is easy to use. You can also record songs with the voice recorder or use the voice recorder for lecture in school.Plus the LCD screen displays the title of the song, and the artist. GREAT PRODUCT!!!

<Title>Pretty, nice features, and it sounds great
<Date>Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The picture above is wrong, for some reason.  It's very nice-looking (red and silver/grey) in reality, and has a backlit screen and convenient controls.  It also sounds great-- I am very pleasantly surprised.  It sounds much better than my Roxio cd/mp3 player, and I think maybe even my computer.  It's a nice size, and feels well-made.  I like the menu system, controls, and the USB interface (includes short extension cable).

<Date>Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have to say i have bought 3 of these.  How could you go wrong for 2x the memory of everyone else at the same price.<p>Pros:  Small, Lightweight, Good (up 20 hours) battery life, nice backlit screen, good features including data code lockout.  Nice look, cap locks securely, 5 second on feature prevents turning on by accident, built in equalizer, Really a pretty well designed product -<p>Cons:  NO RANDOM!!!<br>VERY poor customer service (I had one that locked up at Musicdrive screen.  Called 30-40 min hold - not 800#, and was told send it back and they don't do cross ships -  however I called a week after to get an RMA and someone named Mike told me - oh all you have to do is reformat the drive you corrupted it when you removed it.... YOU MUST click the remove safetly icon in 2000/xp/98 when you remove to prevent data corruption.  I never did this before and so it happened 1/100 times but that would suck if I were on the road...)

<Title>Won't work under Mac OS X 10.3!
<Date>Fri Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought one of these things because it said it was Mac OS X compatible, but it's not compatible with the latest version: 10.3.  I called Buslink and talked to their Mac guy there (who was very kind and apologetic, by the way) and he said to send it back.  It works really well under OS 9 (I believe it even works under 10.2 though I didn't test it), and it's a nice little player, but as of right now it won't work in 10.3.  I asked if there was any possibility of a firmware update or anything that would fix this problem and he said no.  He said it's possible that future generations of these will work in 10.3, but it's probably best to give Buslink a call to check before buying one!

<Title>Nice little MP3 player-also can be used to transfer files
<Date>Wed Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I justified my purchase of this gizmo because I needed a voice recorder.  It works fine but I found out that you need to press a series of buttons to record.  I needed something more convenient.<p>My real desire was to have a small lightweight MP3 player.  This accomplishes that in spades.  Very easy to use-plug into your USB port and transfer MP3s to it.  Plug in your earphones and away you go.<p>256 megs is about 3-4 hours of music total.  I've never loaded it that much.  It has the most amount of memory that I've seen in a MP3 player this small.  This things not much bigger than a flash drive unit.  By the time you add space for the extra electronics to play MP3s, battery and a LCD screen, it's amazing that they could keep it this small.<p>Controls are limited.  Basically you have volume and skip forward, backward.  There are some equalizer presets to change the sound but no actual bass or treble control.  Random would be nice but not available.<p>Also, it doesn't come with an armband-only a cord to hang around your neck.  Not too convenient if you are going to exercise or do something that requires a lot of movement.  In fact, the small size of this unit caused me to make a mistake.  But it also shows that Buslink has good customer service.<p>I was using it when I would do yardwork, etc.  Instead of using the neck cord I put it in my pocket.  My body movement caused too much pressure on the earphone jack.  It caused the connection to become unstable.  However, I emailed Buslink with this problem and they sent me a RMA number within 1-2 days.  I need to send it back but was able to jury rig it to keep working.  I hate to be without it for 3-4 weeks to send it back.<p>In a nutshell, it's a great little MP3 player, very small, lightweight.  Also functions as a voice recorder and flash drive.  If you want more storage or more audio features, look elsewhere.  But if you want an MP3 player that is practically unnoticeable, get this one.

<Title>Good little MP3 player - good value for the  memory
<Date>Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had intended to purchase the iPod until I saw the price &lt;yikes&gt; and also read several reviews that left me doubting whether that was the right player for me.  This is my first MP3 player - I wanted something small I could take to the gym.  My biggest concern was NOT that it hold hour after hour of music because I knew I could delete files and replace as I wanted.  After reading the reviews on this player I decided to go for it.  I'm not disappointed.  I'm running Windows XP and the device was recognized immediately - all necessary drivers were automatically installed.  Within 5 minutes I had transferred 20 MP3's into the unit and was playing with the various functions. Nice size - 256MB which is more than enough for me  :) I'm glad I didn't spend the money on the iPod....this one suits me just fine.  The ear buds actually stay in my ears, although I still find them annoying and will probably invest in a small set of headphones to replace them.

<Title>Not bad at all..
<Date>Fri Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got this little mp3 player, and it was like nothing I've seen before. I just drag and drop the mp3 songs into the player and bam, im finish. If you're planning to buy an mp3 player, try to get this one first, since all of the other 256MB player cost over 150. Oh yeah, dont get the 128MB version, i think it would be better if you just put in 30 more dollars and get double the memory.

<Title>Nice little mp3 player
<Date>Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recently bought one of these mp3 players and have enjoyed it. The 256mb size holds enough music to fill all the boring spots in school, with enough space left over to transfer a few files. The sound quality out of this thing is great. While it doesn't have a random button, it does play songs in order of insertion so grouping by sound works. <br>The voice recorder works great, but only records at 64k quality, compared to the mp3s at minimum 128k quality. Also, while it is enough mic range to record little notes to yourself, it can not record lectures done by teachers. <br>My only real gripe with this product is the trouble I have had in making it transfer files in Mac OS 9.1. Every time I try, the whole computer hangs on the copying message. Other than that, it is a handy little thing to have.

Anyhting at a distance Does not record well, very quite and with pops hisses but would work great for personal notes.  I still use it to record lectures you can record hours of voice estimate upto 6 hours.  It looks nice, the display is nice and easy to use It connects well on both Win XP and SuSE linux.

<Title>DON'T BUY IT!
<Date>Thu Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the Buslink 256MB MP3 player because I thought I'd found a bargain since it was far cheaper than all the other 256MB MP3 players. Don't be fooled! Mine completely broke in less than three months. Right after I bought it the plastic &quot;shell&quot; on the outside popped off. Then later the entire player broke. The screen would freeze anytime I tried to turn it on. All in all, it is very cheaply made and the Buslink customer support is virtually nonexistant, so I would shell out an extra $20 or $30 to get a name brand Mp3 player that will last!

<Title>Very good player for the price
<Date>Wed Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>As most other reviews have stated, the price of this unit is what sets its appeal.  While there are smaller units on the market, this one is easily small enough and can hold more than enough songs/data.  I use it everyday as an mp3 player and also as a thumbdrive.  You can go ahead and read all the other reviews for the pros of this product, but what I want to discuss are a few cons that have yet to be mentioned in any other review.  My main complaint about the player is that it has no rewind or fast forward capabilities what-so-ever.  Maybe this isn't a big deal to you, but I personally like going through songs at my own pace.  This is especially true for songs like Art of Life by X Japan; it is a 29 minuite long song and sometimes I would just like to hear a certain movement of the piece without having to sit through 13 minuits to get there.  <p>The other complaint I have has to do with how you place music on the player.  The first time I put songs on it, everything was fine and it worked like a charm.  Then i started messing with it and seeing if i could organize my songs into seperate folders and access them on the player that way (since it doesn't support playlists to my knowlage) and this also worked great.  You could just start listening to songs and the player will automatically start playing songs from the next folder after the preceding one has finished playing.  Now, since this had worked so well, I decided that i would place ALL my songs into folders for organizational purposes.  Bad idea.  If you do this the player will come up with a no music found error msg on the screen.  Basically, this is how it works.  In order for the player to play any mp3s (in or out of folders), the FIRST file copied to the player MUST be an MP3 and MUST not be in a folder.  I use a 30 second song as my first song just so I can get everything else to work properly.  Also, if you do not use the navigation feature, the player will play the songs in this order:  Songs not in folders, songs in first folder, songs in second folder, etc.  Keep in mind that when selecting which folders or songs to play, the player will automatically play them in the order that they were copied onto the player.  <p>say you were given this senario:  <p>you place song A, B, and C on the player in that order.  That will be the order it is played back.  <p>so if you place them as C, B, A that is the order they will be played in.  now, if you did A, B(in folder), C(in folder), you will get the same A, B, C order as before.  <p>If you place A, B(in folder), C, you would think you would still get the A, B, C order, but in reality you get A, C, B because the B was in the folder and C wasn't, even though it was added after B.  <p>Lastly, given this order A(in folder), B(in folder), C(in folder) nothing will play at all because the player must have the first file as a mp3 file to play any others.  <p>Anyway, like I said this is a good player.  Unfortunetly my necklace thing broke and sent my player tumbling to the ground while i was riding my bike, but it still works fine, which is somewhat amazing concidering the height of the fall causing decent vertical velocity on impact, and the fact that it was also traveling about 22 mph when it struck.  I say if you don't mind the rewind/fast forward options being non-existant, then go for this player.  just keep in mind the order you add songs to this so you arent surprised when you cant find the song you want!

<Title>It's great
<Date>Sat Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a really nice little machine, if hard to find in stores.  Mine's 8 months old now, and I've had no problems with it at all.  It's well-made, has good battery life, and it sounds really good.  The USB connection is very convenient, and lets me plug it into my computer at work to listen without using battery power.  The controls are clever and easy to use.  I wish it had a shuffle feature, but that's my only complaint.  256MB is enough for around 70 songs, which is more than enough for me.  I've even dropped it on the ground a few times, literally without even a scratch.  I don't know what these other people are doing to their players-- throwing them off buildings, running over them with their cars?-- but I think it's a good value and a good choice, too.

<Title>poor quality design and manufacture
<Date>Sun Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>While in the package this player looks fairly cool and small in size, there are definitive drawbacks to it.  The construction is not very robust. The control 'stick' is wimpy and hard to control.  Design drawbacks include, among others: if you're recording something with the built-in microphone, and you pause the recording, this doesn't count for the auto-off circuitry, so the entire unit shuts off if you don't un-pause it with 5 minutes.  Wouldn't be so bad, except --- the entire recording you've made up to that point is erased back to 0 bytes.  How stupid is that?!  Customer service stinks -- when described to them, they were "we don't control the units, we just sell them". Well, guess what? I don't use the player any longer, because I returned it.  Buy something else.

<Title>Buyer beware! 
<Date>Thu Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The first day I started using my Buslink MP3 player, it served me wonderfully. Despite the shoddy quality of its construction, the sound quality was fine, all of the buttons and functions worked, and changing the playlist by simply dragging and dropping files from my iBook could not have been any simpler. What a great value, I thought.  DAY TWO ROLLS AROUND. . .  The problems that showed up on this player are unbelievable! Problems first arose when the player would jump to different songs in the middle of playing a song. It then began to freeze up whenever I tried to play a song, and at that point the only way to turn the player off was by removing the batteries. I thought that perhaps by emptying all of the data from the player and starting anew, the player's problems would be resolved. When I added the new songs to the player, the player's screen flashed that no songs were on it. The player then began to freeze when more songs were added to it from my computer. To add insult to injury, the player would then cause my computer to freeze up.   What was initially a "good deal" ended up as a waste of money and a great deal of frustration. I highly recommend  shoppers look to Creative, Samsung, Apple, or any other reputable brand for their MP3 player.
