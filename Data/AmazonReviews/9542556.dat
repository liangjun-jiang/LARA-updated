<Content>Do not buy the iPod Classic!! While this iPod offers the basic benefits of the iPod family, Apple has made one, Microsoft-worthy, change.  The only component cables that will work (especially the video/AV/component cables) are the $50 (or more) Apple brand cables.  They have inserted an "authentication chip" requirement into the firmware.    If you notice, the 5th and 5.5 generation iPods (not the newest 6th gen. Classic) are more expensive for a reason: They're LESS RESTRICTIVE.   After-market cables (such as Belkin/Griffin/Etc) will not allow video output from the Classic to TVs.   If Apple introduces a firmware change to allow ALL video cables to be used, then you should consider this one...otherwise, stay with the 5th/5.5 generation units.

<Title>Decisions, decisions..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had my 3rd gen ipod for 4 years, holding out on a video ipod until for a larger screen.  I was torn when Apple released the full-screen flash memory based 'touch' with 16gig max (less than my old 20gig full with music files), and the small-screen hard-drive 'classic' with up to 160gig. Maybe the full-screen and hard-drive together would wear too much on a battery?   I decided I would be annoyed with 16gig, managing which files to load.  I have a Blackberry, and get enough internet, without being limited to wi-fi, plus all my work mail and calendar are tied to that. The bigger touch screen was not worth it for me, and I could not wait for another upgrade.   Because of an Amazon delivery est. 4-7 weeks out, I canceled my order for an 80gig, went to Apple instead(free shipping), and ordered the 160gig.  160gig does not seem extreme.  There is always something new to fill space.  Higher quality music and videos, backups, games etc..  Plus the apple-site shows the 160gig battery has about an extra 30% play-time than the 80gig (apple site Classic tech specs).   Had to pay sales tax, but got free engraving.  Used that to add 'return to' with my name and email on the device.  That gives the honest majority of our population the chance to get it back to me, and the less classy folks will need to scratch up or hide the back side.  **update** I now have it in hand and stick with my 4-star pre-review.   I got it loaded fine, including new videos I had in anticipation, and many photos from my pc -all of which barely made a dent in the space.  The options are very easy to manage in iTunes.  I like you can choose full-photo vs. ipod-veiwing-photo file sizes. Old news to many of you though. Of course I went full-sized, I have 160gig now, and this is a great way to back up those pics. Actually I have 148.79 available space.  Everything looks good and runs smoothly, so I'm not griping about the space the os/software used up.   I like the album art display on the menu and songs.  Things like that don't matter in the big picture to most people, but those types of touches make Apple products seem a little more friendly. I am jumping from a monochrome music-only ipod, so for me this is a major upgrade.   It does have the search option, but typing in a word by scrolling around a click wheel is not much faster than working through the menu. It also has a few games loaded, clock/alarm, a lock code setting, notes and calendar you can load from your pc/mac.  I like the stopwatch, which dispays an old analog version.  Using a stopwatch makes even boring activities seem more like an event. The only real rub with this is the 'TV-out' (video output)option is locked to 'off'.  I had seen a 50buck cable for sale from Apple so I knew I could do it(cnet claimed video-out had been removed), but I read on a rumor-site that you will now be forced to use the Apple licensed component-cable in order to enable the video out.  Fine, it comes with some other adapter stuff, so I'll do it, but their availability is 3-4 weeks.  I do love this device, and appreciate how far we've come since reel-to-reel and projectors, but not getting a hard-drive in the the 'touch', and not having the video cable (and many games) ready for launch takes a star off. *** Update 2 *** Well, I had it stolen already.  Hope the engraving somehow causes the perps some pain.  Smashed my car window at church and grabbed my bag.  I was dumbfounded.  I did an on-line police report and tried to get my serial number from the Apple registration.  Could find no way to veiw previous registrations, and the email confirming the registration didn't have it.  Without the ipod connected to iTunes there appears to be no way to see it there either.  I easily signed on to Garmin and got my gps s/n (they got that too), so I don't know why apple would make it so difficult.  My wife found it printed on the box.  Good old printed ink.  Writing it down may be a good idea.  Maybe this is gods way of telling me to get the touch?

<Title>Prefer Touchscreen
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I prefer the touchscreen, at least over the scrollwheel, simply because the scrollwheel is too imprecise, and it's hard to get to deeply nested items.  I've been happily using a 1 gig (yes, that's one gig) device for almost 2 years now, and have been anticipating moving up to an 8 gig device, so moving to a 16 gig device seems downight exciting.  16 gigs holds 192 CD's at 196 kbps, mp3. Does anyone realize this? I don't have that many CD's, and a lot I don't listen to anymore anyway, and even when you include some converted mixed-tapes and long podcasts, which I need to "recycle" anyway, 16 gigs is, quite frankly, great. I can't imagine having to manage 160 gigs of music, what with al the tagging and converting of files - sounds like a nightmare, and intrudes on the listening experience.  The touch is definitely a breakthrough.

<Title>IPOD 30G + Video Problem
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received an iPod for Christmas 2006, and lately it has been cutting out about 1/2 second, I estimate, randomly. I emailed Apple on their incredibly confusing website, saying let me know how to get this fixed under the one-year warranty. I actually did get a response, but: get this: they'll cover it under warranty, but the shipping and handling would be $31.65!!! I emailed them back complaining, saying it's too much, and that I'll just live with it and buy a Zune next time. I never got a response other than the usual offers to buy more Apple stuff, now that they have my email address!!! BE CAREFUL with this company!!

<Title>Don't buy a special offer from Apple
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Foolish me, I just followed Apple's invitation a few weeks ago to buy their 80 GB iPod classic in flashy, greasy, view-all-fingerprints black finish. What I paid for that meager package (not even including a decent power supply for the wall outlet included, not colormatching white USB cable and white earphones!), was way much than their new classic models. And now this! Apple is fooling us with dumping prices of iPhones and iPods much lower than they offered just a few weeks as "special offer". Yes, their offers are special, but in a manner that I will probably never ever buy an Apple product again. Foul Apple.   BTW: Guess, the new iPod 160GB features a bigger, more power-consuming hard disk drive. So: more memory, less running time (about 8 hours less compared to the 80 GB model), and of course no way to replace the battery yourself?

<Content>I like almost everything about iPods, but I can not STAND having to use iTunes...it is a total pain in the behind...If Apple would allow the iPod to just look like a hard drive to my computer I would be all over this thing. I started with a 30 gig iRiver which I loved but out grew. Now I have an 80 gig Archos 504 which is good but a bit large.  When I first got my iRiver I used iTunes software and it drove me batty...Come on Apple!! Free up...let folks use iPods as little HD and you will lose your competitors but until then....

<Title>a "fascinating" device
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This small, portable music player is quite fascinating. It is composed of a synthetic byproduct of petroleum, known by most as plastic, though the exterior shell seems to be composed of a thin sheet of brushed aluminium (Ai, atomic number 13). The "plastic" from which this device is constructed appears to be of the highest quality, however, when closely observed, I found it to be softer than desired, thus, it scratches easily. It plays music that is downloaded to it via a computer, either Macintosh or PC. This may be a deterrent to those of you who do not own a computer. When playing the music, it uses small phonic devices inserted into the ears. These are called "headphones". Due to the nature of these "headphones," dogs cannot listen to your music. When listening to the music, I found it to be of satisfactory quality. This device has a large storage capacity which is its primary selling point. If you buy this device, you should be sure to have music to download to it, otherwise, there will be nothing to listen to. The music that I recommend is Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and Puccini. I find this music to be of superior quality, and worthy of listening to.

<Title>I've got one!!! Size matters..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok guys, I just picked up my silver iPod classic 160gb from the Apple store on Regent Street in London so I can give an actual review on it.  I've had an 80GB video iPod for a year and it's already full, so I was really hoping Apple would make an iPod big enough for me. Presently I've got 110GB (and counting) of music, so this iPod is for people like me who have a large music collection, and who like to be able to take it anyplace.  The 160GB iPod is the same size as the 80gb, but costs less than the 80GB did when it first came out.  With a brushed aluminium front finish (similar to the 2 and 3G Nanos), it should be less prone to scratching, though the back is the same smudge magnet, and I don't know how resilient the screen is. The front is curvier than that of the last 2 video iPods, with the screen slightly depressed from the rest of the casing.  Additional features are extra long battery life (40 hours for music, 7 hours for video; I've tested this and playing music non stop without much fast forwarding, etc, it's about right), and cover flow (a fun way of scrolling through for music using album cover art, though it is a bit sluggish).   The new split-screen interface lists functions to the left half of the screen, and symbols (or previews of content such as cover art, videos or photos shown as a slide show) to the right as you scroll through the functions. Neat!!  During music playback, after being idle for about 80 seconds, the screen goes gray and displays a clock, and battery power. Viewing tracks in an album also gives you, at a glance, the track times. Same for video. A nice touch. To my hearing, the sound quality (without equalizers, mind you) is improved; more bass and a bit more treble. The iPod turns off in about 2 seconds, much faster than previous models.  It's still got the other regular features; album track lyrics (new, nicer text font, and it also shows the album art), can play video and games, store photos, contacts, calendar, notes, stopwatch, and screen lock (which allows you to lock the screen with a password), and it can be used as an external hard drive. It shows up in windows explorer as an external drive. The search feature allowing one to type in album/song/artist titles (introduced in the last video iPod) is still there, but relocated to the "music" menu. I didn't spot it at first. In fact, the menu has been reshuffled to make it better, and (under settings) one can now view number of songs, videos, photos, etc graphically just like in iTunes.  If you need loads of space for your music collection, you can't go wrong getting this. Judging from the crowds in the store, Apple's got another hit here. Now if only the iPod touch had this much memory...

<Title>Finally, more than 80GB!
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>20 years worth of CD purchases filled my current 60GB iPod long ago, with another 25GB still waiting to go onto the first iPod that would break at least 100GB.  Glad it finally arrived with some room to spare, but hope it does a better job of navigating that quantity of artists/songs/etc than the 60GB did.  Hope it sounds better, too.  After all, that's what it's for.  I'm not ready to give up the click wheel for on-screen nav, but was impressed with the responsiveness of an iPhone I tried (and I'm brutally critical).  Still, you can feel and control the click wheel when you're not looking at the device (in your backpack, in the car) and you can't do that with a glossy screen on the iTouch.

<Title>Absolutely stunning (I own this product)
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>UPDATE after 2 weeks use:  One feature that makes it all worth it for me: switching the shuffle mode between albums/songs/off while in shuffle mode. Let's say I have 10,000 songs on shuffle, and I hear a song by Nirvana that gets me in the mood to listen to more Nirvana...I click the middle button 3X and switch random to "Album". Now I'm going to listen to the rest of the album. Before, I had to go to Menu, scroll to Music -> Albums, scroll 500 album names to letter N, then choose album. Can't believe reviewers overlooked this feature.  I insist the sound quality is very good. The new DAC is different than the previous gen iPods, but by no means worse. Sound quality is subjective and depends on many factors including genre, encoding, headphones, hearing loss etc. In my isolated case, I noticed a slight improvement in treble and a huge improvement in bass. The 5.5 gen 80gb used to wash out the bass. Mids and overall dynamic range is just about the same.  ------------------------------  Pros:  - For MP3's encoded in 192kbps, you can fit roughly 27,000 on here - about .08 inches thinner than 5.5 gen 80gb iPod - sweet finish on the front - center button is a little concave and feels better - coverflow is great eyecandy, let's leave it at that =) - new interface for every menu is very intuitive and stylish - battery life is AMAZING - 10000 songs and 6 movies later it's not even half full - sound quality is great, no need for eq imo(using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGLZUE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-8782139-7500665">Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones</a> ) - when music is playing and the screen in dim, you see the battery charge and clock in large numbers  Cons:  - Coverlow only organized by artist, can't do by album (or at least can't figure this out yet) - Great theft potential - Back still scratches easily - iTunes is not exactly the best software ever written for windows  Notes:  No, this mp3 player is not perfect, but it's way up there when compared to other players overall. Obviously you won't get $100 headphones included. Yes, iTunes is clunky and there are better ways to organize your music, and you have to convert all your movies...at the end of the day: it's small, it's easy, it's cool and it will play you media really really well.

<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Pros: I had the first generation IPOD Nano 4GB before I bought this one. My music collection has grown so large that I need an mp3 player with a bigger storage capacity, which this IPOD delivers. I can now play all my music video on this IPOD too, and the video quality is great (provided that you start with a good quality music video in the first place). I also like the new IPOD surface too since now I don't see my fingerprints all over the place.  The Cons: The downside to this IPOD is it often freezes on me. I don't mean once or twice, but almost every time I connect it to my laptop. So it becomes an annoyance to me. Sure I can unfreeze it but why do I have to do this often? I've never had this problem with my old Nano and it seems like this problem is faced by newer generations IPOD (I have a friend who just bought the new Nano and it freezes on her several times already).

<Title>Good and Bad
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok The Ipod Classic's are a step forward and a step back. First Apple purposely disabled the video out feature unless you use their cables. This is all for more Dollars which for how much these things cost and the money they make off them is just ridiculous. I have had several problems with this new Ipod from syncing errors to general data issue's I bought one of the first released so I believe it had to do with that since I got that unit replaced it has been fine. The Cover Flow is neat I don't know why people complain about it if you don't like it don't use it. So the good with the new Ipod models would have to be the space and then the cover flow feature which I like. The Negative points are as always - apple, their customer service, and the disabling of the video out for third party devices - just underhanded. It is still a great device so if you are not to upset about having to spend 50 dollars on cables than it will be a good bet for you.

<Content>This is iPod #2 for me.  I'm one of those people who likes to have *way* too much music at hand at all times.  I filled up my 60Gig iPod, so I gave it to my wife, who has about 3 CDs she likes, and moved up to this thing.  I use the video function very rarely, but it *is* nice to take a movie along for long layovers in the airport or to have instead of renting a movie in a hotel.  I mainly listen to the iPod when I walk to work, or in the gym.  I hate going to the gym, so an audiobook on iPod makes that experience much better.  I'm very pleased with this iPod.  I use Sony ELP828 earbuds rather than the ones that came with it because a)I don't want advertise to the world that I've got an iPod, and b)They're really good and not terribly expensive (I have a cat that thinks they're food).  Be sure to buy a good case with a belt clip.

<Title>Lots of Problems
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I will go straight to the details as to why this unit sucks:  The software called iTunes will frequently duplicate songs and waste space.  The unit itself is prone to not being recognized by Windows XP, so there is frequently no sync available, so....when sync is not available, you cannot upload new songs into your ipod.  When plugging in your ipod, iTunes will tell you that the ipod needs to either re-enter all the songs, or reformat the whole ipod.  When you "restore" your ipod (according to the will of iTunes), nothing happens afterwards except an ipod with no songs in it....and trying to put the songs back into the ipod...i'm still trying. Help!  Getting help (help!) from iTunes is impossible, but I'm still trying.  Managing more than one ipod's music in your pc is problematic and prone to glitches. I heard it's easy to manage multiple ipods if you have a Mac.  If you are still thinking of getting an mp3 player, the most trouble-free is the Creative Zen Microphoto (8gb), and the Sandisk Sansa Clip (2gb) that holds 1000 songs.    If you do decide on getting an ipod, make sure you save the music on cd's (burn them to cd).

<Title>What went wrong???
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have a 40GB iPod Classic.  It's a breeze to use, an excellent product, and I love it.  It's full, so I wanted to upgrade to the 160GB.  What a disaster!  Apple was in a hurry to get this one out.  It shipped with a bad software version, so the first thing you're stuck with is updating the software, but there's a glitch:  You can't download the new software without jumping through a bunch of hoops to disable firewalls and other stuff on your computer.  That required a lengthy tech call.  After downloading the software, I tried to sync it up.  It would load a few MB and then freeze.  Several more tech calls and hours of wasted time (including reimporting my library and reformatting the iPod)and it still kept freezing.  Bottom line:  This piece of junk doesn't work with its own software and is nothing but a headache.  Apple should be ashamed.  They had a corner on the market and a reputation for excellence, and they blew it.  Keep your money until they remove their heads from their posteriors.

I'm music centric and don't care about the video or game functions. All I was expecting was the same device, albeit with more storage capacity.  The cover flow is superflous to me: nice but unneccesary.  This device is virtually the same size as my 80, but feels smaller and a bit heavier in the hand. So far I like it.  Too early to say I love it in the way that I love my 80.  The five stars are for IPOD itself.

<Title>CONSUMER ALERT
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item last week to upgrade my ipod 80gb (great item!!!). I found the sound on the classic VASTLY INFERIOR to the old ipod.  I thought it might have been my imagination but after cruising some websites, I discovered that APPLE is using another chip that deteriorates the sound in  significant way.  I found the sound of the Classic to be thin and shrill compared to the older one and not nearly as warm and "clean." (I mostly listen to Jazz and classical) Again, I thought this might be my imagination but apparently other purchasers have had a similar experience. I'll be returning mine.

<Title>Excellent sound quality, and the 160GB are a treat
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had the previous 60GB video iPod, and the additional 100GB comes very handy as I only use Apple lossless compression. What I did not expect is the much better sound quality on the new iPod. I did A-B comparison and the classic's sound quality is first rate and much more musical. I guess the DAC must have been improved. For info, I use the excellent Shure ES500 headphone. Most of my music is apple lossless compression. I never use MP3, as it throws away too much information, even at the highest setting (320kbps).  The interface is very intuitive, as usual, and fast. The screen is much brighter. The search option is very handy to locate album or song. A big plus too.

<Title>  Re: Ipod classic TV out problem 
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple has intentionally disabled the Video Out button on the Classic models.  Spend more, get less features.  I am shocked to hear that Apple will treat so poorly those who shell out $349 for a 160 GB Classic. I contacted the Geek Squad none of the salespeople or support team had a clue that Apple had disabled the video out feature. They pushed every available button before contacting Apple to find out that Apple has disabled a basic feature available on all prior video Ipods. I had stopped at Circuit City first and had the same experience there.  I would not have bought this so quickly had I known that Apple disabled the video out capability. The video settings menu is still there, but all the clicking in the world will not change OFF to Ask or On. Apple will soon be selling a $49 accessory to allow some limited output of video. I already own the Icuiti IWear. Memorex and Virtual Reality Ipod video accessories, all now rendered useless by this greedy move on Apple's part. We all expect value-added from Apple, not elimination of a basic feature. Shame on you, Apple and Steve Jobs.

<Title>Great size and hard drive capacity
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is pretty much the best iPod based on it's value. I did notice that they didn't include the soft slip case this time, like they did with the 5th generation iPods. They also took out the video out feature, which I think was a bad move on them. I do like the new interface though, they also added the cover flow feature. They include a nice shiny metal case when you get the iPod. I did end up buying a case for mine. I didn't mind buying one since I didn't pay for my iPod. And BTW for those wondering how I got my iPod classic go here: flingk.com/n21v9v1  I was amazed how thin the iPod Classic is considering how much space it holds. I do think it is better than the other iPods based on how much you end up paying.

<Content>Apple is pulling a clasiic Microsoft tactic here by making the 6th gen ipods NOT backward compatible for no apparent reason other than to force you to pay more to upgrade your OS and docking stations / cables.  Plus, the 5.5 gen is faster, and better assembled.  From what I am reading here, alot of others are saying the same thing.  Don't buy this item.  Buy a 5.5 gen instead.

<Title>Severely disappointed
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I thought long and hard before purchasing this iPod. Before, I had always used a Creative Zen Micro and was quite fond of it until I ran out of space. Then, I was torn between the iPod classic and the Zen W. I decided to give Steve Jobs a chance and shelled out $350 for the iPod.  Within about a week of purchasing it, it had a problem. It froze up for no apparent reason but maybe 12 hours later, it decided it wanted to work again. Then, I was quite pleased with it. The sound quality seemed good, the graphics on the screen were crisp and clear, it scrolled quickly, and overall, it worked very well.  One day when I plugged it into the computer, however, and downloaded and installed the required update, the screen suddenly went black. The iPod would not turn on and didn't respond to being plugged into the computer. I had not dropped it or mishandled it in any way. The support section of the Apple website was very unhelpful, and nothing I tried had any effect. Defeated, I called Apple. Apparently, spending $350 on one of Apple's products does not mean I am important enough to talk to a living, breathing person. After attempting to explain my problem to a computerized recording which basically told me to repeat all the steps I had already tried, I was told to send my iPod back to Apple so they can repair it--a process that will take, in total, about two weeks.  The iPod is wonderful when it works, but as soon as it has a problem there is no help for it. Do yourself a favor--avoid Apple and buy a Zen.

<Title>What's the point of upgrading to an inferior version?
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the 160GB version as an upgrade to my 5th generation Ipod Video with 60Gb of storage.  Sounded reasonable at the time.  I purchased a $340 Harman Kardon Go & Play to use as not only a sound system, but to use in the classroom when showing videos I purchased from Itunes and other educational sources.  It was very nice having my library of videos for class on my Ipod.  I figured the additional storage on the new unit would be extra nice.  So, imagine my surprise when the 6th generation Ipod is no longer compatible with the HK Go&Play because they've disabled the Video Out feature.  Now mind you, Apple is still advertising the Go & Play on their website as being compatible.  Ipod compitable logos are misleading.  Don't assume. . .  I contacted Harman Kardon and had an opportunity to speak to one of their techs who indicated that Apple decided to share the design changes just before releasing the new 6th Generation Ipods, leaving their engineers absolutely no time to process or adjust to the changes.  Intentional?  I guess if it boosts Apples sales of proprietary cables and docks, then probably.  I also noticed the sound on the 6th generation wasn't quite as refined as my 5th generation Ipod playing through the Go&Play.  More research online talks about sound compression modifications.  For anyone who has the Go&Play, you know what an amazing sound system it is.  It picked up the changes in the 6th Generation very clearly.  What a disappointment.  I also need to mention that having the video capability on the very costly Go&Play helped me justify the steep price and sold me on it. . .not much good now though. . .    I've owned every generation of Ipod that has come out and I'm amazed they would do this to their line.  What makes things worst is they've kept things very quiet to the point that their own technical suppport people are unaware of the changes and handle people like you and me who think the unit is broken, as just that. . .a defective unit.  You'll spend a fair amount of time on the phone with their people trying to figure out what's wrong with your unit when it basically amounts to Apple's irresponsible design change.  Until you do the research online, you won't know any better.  They released the 6th Generation sometime around early Fall. It's now almost February and it's amazing how few staffers know how to deal with the issues when customers start to complain.  There stores continue to sell you items that don't work with the 6th Generation Ipod because they haven't a clue. . .One additional note, if you've enjoyed the ability to fix minor things with your Ipod, like battery replacement or hard drive replacement, those days are also gone.  It wasn't so much an issue of getting rid of the white color of the Ipod, but designing a case that would have to be destroyed before it could be openned by someone like you or me.  Rumor has it that when it does need something as minor as a battery replacement, you'll need to take it to an Apple store where they'll exchange it for a "refurbished" unit.  My loyalty to Apple ends as of now.  I've taken back the Ipod and will continue to do what I can to maintain my 5th generation. . .which will be a very sad day when it finally goes to rest.  In the meantime, I hope that people initiate a class action lawsuit or the open source community makes it a mission to put Apple in it's place.  I'll be first in line to contribute to the cause.

<Title>Apple nailed it
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my 7th Ipod purchase.  Kept needing more and more storage space.  I've sold or given some of the others away and never had a real problem with any of them.  The Ipods all scratch way too easily.  You need to put it into a protective case as soon as you take it out of the factory packaging.  Otter Box makes some secure, sturdy, albeit bulky cases that have the added feature of waterproofing yor Ipod.  Now let's recognize that there are militant Apple people out there as well as Apple Haters.  I'm neither and will be as objective as possible.    The 160 GB Ipod does everything it is supposed to, and does it pretty well.  If you listen with ear bud headphones, I don't know that the sonic quality of this generation is any worse (or even different) than the prior ones.  If you connect your Ipod to a serious stereo system, well, I guess "you pays yo' money and yo' take yo' chances."  In my opinion, the Ipod was not designed for that task.  The fact that it is even possible to do that is more a function of aftermarket opportunism than because of anything Apple ever intended or did.  A lot of Apple Hating is probably directed at iTunes and not the Ipod per se (and probably rightfully so).  At any rate, Apple has done some consumer unfriendly things in the name of copyright infringement protection, and so on.  Many of the things iTunes prevents the Ipod user from doing are perfectly legal and sometimes absolutely necessary, like if your computer or HDD crashes, you get a new computer, etc.  A program called MediaWidget, widely available for under $20 obviates most of these Apple imposed undue restrictions and should provide you much happier Ipodding.  Anyway, Ipod 160 GB is the best product of its type available.  You will definitely need a protective case of some type, and the purchase of MediaWidget will greatly decrease the amount of Ipod related profanity. There are also many alternative sites for legally and safely purchasing music other than the Apple Store.  Frostwire is the first to come to mind, but there are many more.  These sites also do not restrict your ability to use the songs you purchase as you wish to, like Apple does.  Add these 3 tips to your Ipod purchase and you can thank me later.

Zune has video out - video remote - is faster than the IPOD - has a bigger and better screen - etc.. Wish I could get my money back for the IPOD. DO NOT BUY the IPOD 160, it is a waste of money.

<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After trying  some cheap MP3 players and discovering that 70% of the accessories are for Apple, I plopped down $350 for n iPod Classic 160GB.  It would hold ll the music I could ever want plus hold movies and play them back at will for the kiddies.  WRONG.  Boy was I wrong.  I had been seriously considering an Archos 605 160GB before this disaster and am now sorry I didn't go that route.   APPLE HAS PURPOSELY CRIPPLED THE VIDEO OUT ON THE 6G CLASSIC IPOD AND ITOUCH UNITS.  THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS WORK IS TO PURCHASE A $50 CABLE FROM APPLE.    They have incorporated a chip in this cable which will enable the video out to function.  This pretty much renders ALL THIRD PARTY ACCESSORIES USELESS (save the $600 B&W Zeppelin) that have a video out port...like my new Athens iVoice speakers, and my highly portable and handy retractable AV cable.  Apple did this quietly and did not even release suitable accessories until months after the iPods were released.  Now I have to spend another $50 on a friggin cable.  Forget about any other accessories.  Who knows what will work and what won't.  If you are considering purchasing an Apple product, I would seriously consider any other brand.

<Title>This is Everything I wanted!
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Apple Ipod Classic is exactly what I wanted in a multimedia player. I wanted to able to listen to music, audiobooks, podcasts, and movies in a compact, portable package. I wanted to be able to carry a large collection of media all at once. I think the 160 gig Ipod Classic is perfect for me. I don't have any plans on using this as a VCR to play movies on the tv. So, I'm not going to buy a $50.00 cable for that. I knew that before I bought this unit. I bought my Ipod the day the Classic was released. I bought a clock radio that works perfectly with it. I read about compatibility in the description of the product. No problems. It docked and it charged up perfectly. When I received my Ipod, I hooked the cord to my laptop and my beautiful silver Classic. It synced just fine, it even added my digital photos to the Ipod. I have added well over 80 gig of music, podcasts, audiobooks, and movies, so I'm glad I decided to purchase the larger Ipod. I still have a lot of space for more. One pleasant surprise for me was the ability to play games. I have bought 5 new ones, so I have a total of 8 now. I really like the game "Phase." I haven't had the problems other people have experienced. I use my Vmoda Red Roxx instead of the earbuds that came with the Ipod. Other than the bad earbuds, my Ipod has been a joy to own. I love my Ipod! I wouldn't trade it for a Zune, or an Archos!

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well, first off, it's my first iPod, so I have no previous experience with iPods hence I can't compare the new to the old. Here's my personal experience.  Pros: I can however say, that my iPod does just what I want it to do. iTunes works fine (a tad sluggish at times, but I guess that's understandable, seeing that there's over 70GB in the library...), I've never had any problems with the player itsself, the battery life is great the capacity leaves nothing to be desired. It's very robust, I dropped it more than 5 times and nothing happened! It's still as good as new. (Well, there's scratches at the back, but that happens to all iPods if you don't buy a cover for them, and even if you do!..)  Furthermore I don't understand people bitching about the slightly laggy coverflow feature... hey... didn't Apple give us a firmware update less than a month after the new iPods first hit stores that completely fixed the problems? There've been several updates since, and I can't say I notice anything being sluggish, or not working as it's supposed to work. Do those people never update their firmware?   The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that I hate the vendor lock... I'd have liked to install Rockbox on it instead of Apple's software, but this is NOT possible on the 6th generation iPods. Thumbs down at that move.  The second reason I've only given it 4 stars is that Apple haven't improved the sound quality yet, customers asking for this for a long, long time. The quality does me, I think it would do most customers, but another thumbs down at Apple for that.  Plus sometimes it takes the iPod a couple of seconds to start playing a track, probably because it has to look for it on the HD, since my music collection is so big.  Otherwise I love the iPod. Plus I like the stickers that come with it.

<Title>Great Battery Life- Poorer Sound Quality Then The 5G iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked one of these up about a week ago.  Battery Life is DOUBLE what my 5G 60 GB unit has.  Unfortunately in a side by side comparison sound quality has degraded significantly compared to my wonderful 2 year old fifth generation unit.  I did some research and found out Apple has completely redesigned the Logic Board and is no longer using the old Wolfson Microelectronics chip.  The new iPod has a dynamically compressed, tinny, metallic sound that can even be heard thru the cheap earphones provided.  There is almost ZERO 3D sense of depth and imaging.  The sound is so horrible compared to 5G that you can tell the difference thru every headphone tested except for Bose which has almost zero high frequency response.  If someone is new to iPod and never owned a fifth generation audiophile quality unit they will probably not have a problem with the sound though.  When I first got the unit it had firmware 1.00 installed and I experienced extremely sluggish menu response.  I updated to 1.01 and response is now much quicker though still not as fast as my 2 year old iPod.  Update:   The latest firmware 1.03 solves the sluggish menu response problem pretty well.   Too bad nothing has been done about the sound quality.

<Title>Avoid if you have an older computer!
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you have an older PC or Mac, avoid the iPod Classic and go for a previous generation of iPod.   The new iPod Classics are serious CPU hogs when they sync with iTunes. On my 1.8ghz iMac G5, for example, syncing my iPod Classic 160gb takes 7 minutes, even when there is nothing new to sync. Throughout that time, my CPU is over 95%, according to Activity Monitor. This is in stark contrast to syncing my other iPods (gen5.5, gen4), where syncing never uses more than 30% of the CPU.  Windows users report similar behavior (Google for "ipod classic sync crash").  So unless you have an Intel-based Mac (or similar post-2006 PC), stick with the earlier iPods.

My total digital content has been increasing exponentially with music, audiobooks, photos, movies, TV shows, podcasts and music videos. This 160 GB model is not really 160GB, in fact it is only 148GB when taken out of the box brand new? It seems sluggish when compared to the 60GB and 80GB 5th gene models.

<Title>Quality but certainly not perfection
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod, but I also understand it's not going to be for everyone. My primary reason for purchasing this product was to store lots of movies and music for travel. If you don't mind the tiny screen, it's great for a personalized flick on the airplane. And my entire music collection fits on the hard drive with a lifetime's growth that could still be added.  I've noticed people complaining about crashes, rebooting and the redesigned thumbwheel. I have no issues with these items. I have no issues with the music quality.  I do not like DRM or the fact that this iPod requires a special $50 cable to activate TV out features. That's a load, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me since I don't really plan on using mine for watching movies on a larger screen. For a man who can remember paying $400 for 4MB of RAM about a decade ago, I feel like I got a decent deal. I'm a fairly satisfied iPod owner.  This iPod will scratch up immediately. It does not come with a protective shell of any kind. I got mine laser etched with "ad vitam paramus" and I like scratches - they add personality like scars do.  Several other notes - at the time of this review many of the old accessories for iPods are NOT COMPATIBLE with the "Classic" - it's particularly important to note that your old docking station isn't going to work with this new iPod. The included headphones for the black model are white. If that's the sort of thing that bothers you, be prepared. I don't use these included headphones because I think they are crappy. I upgraded to black Shure e2c headphones.

<Content>Yes.....iPod created the wave with its beautiful mp3 player line. People loved it and placed complete trust in Apple. What ever comes out of Apple, must be the best and costs reasonably......The business strategy is to take people there before the corporations drop them down and make a helluva lot of money for lesser and lesser. I remember iPods used to come with chargers et. al. which has to be bought seperately now. Now with this jukebox what is called as a 'Classic', No TV out, poorer quality of audio. They brought in a newer and a cheaper chip that is not only a poorer performer but also a feature chopper!! Apple has disabled the TV out in an effort to sell another of their $50 product. AV cables work no more. Tell me something.....why will somebody watch a movie on a 2.5inch screen, unless they are waiting in a stinking airport? I also think their menu-ing system has slowed down a bit. Definitely they have been infected with Microsoft's monopolizing disease.   Here I am one of the first sheep to buy this product.....It is a shame. If you find a 30 or an 80 gb 5.5Gen iPod.....Simply buy it. Run for it since people are drying up this product from the market. I am sure this is an opportunity for other manufacturers to get ahead.

<Title>sluggish UI but larger storage space
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Today I had a chance to play with the new Nano, Classic and the iPhone. Being the techno geek, I have been keeping up to speed on the iPods and after going thru the various functions I have found out the following...  - the iPod classic has a sluggish response UI compared to the previous iPods. Very disappointing. It was more difficult to scroll through the albums and songs compared to the previous iPods. But you have to give Apple credit for the amazing 160GB capacity. - the iPod Nano was as responsive as the previous ones. Very pleasing to the eye and very well designed. But I read about the video out issue where you need to buy a $50 cable to make use of the video-out feature. Is Apple trying to milk the customer up as much as possible before something comes up to take over the iPod market share? - As most of us knows, the iPhone will not work at ALL unless you activate it with the AT&T service (unless you hack it...which turned out to be troublesome after today's Apple software update). The problem with the Touch is that there will be no scheduler feature for the Touch and there are some talks of how the Touch suffers from a "darker" screen compared to the iPhone. I asked about this and the Apple person told me that they heard about the problem but was not sure whether or not Apple would refund/replace the Touch because this was all very "subjective."  How nice of them to screw us.  The iPod is a very very attractive mp3 player to buy, but it seems like it's starting it's descent into ho-hum land.   ** Update: The dark screen issue for the Touch has been fixed with the new update.  It would have been nice for the Apple store person to tell me this when I was asking about this issue on Sept 27th.

<Title>Former Gigabeat owner - converted to iPod, a review
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>majority of negative reviews are based on what the iPod is not, ie - a camera, a tivo replacement, a toaster, a scooter...  Let's focus on what it is - the best digital music SYSTEM on the market.  I was one of the first people to line up and buy a Toshiba Gigabeat MES60.  Great product, great interface, had it for a year.  So whay the switch?  lets focus on the IPod's attributes:  Storage - blows everything out of the water Interface - slight edge to the Windows Mobile, but overall very clean, and easy to use Accesories - when buying a HDD based player - it becomes not just something you take on the road, but an integral part of any home audio system, and lets face it the iPod is miles ahead of anyone here.  it was near impossible to find accessories for my gigabeat. Support - nonexistent for the Gigabeat.  I mean completely nonexistent from day 1.  so even crappy support (which i have not had to use with the iPod yet) is better than none iTunes vs WMP - i think WMP is easier to use and has more features to manage your collection - but this is where Apple really got it right.  While iTunes needs some help - they nailed it when it comes to how you can interface with other content.  it was just simple to subscribe to a podcast, upload a video from my tivo onto the player, and so far i have had no problems interfacing between the systems, not sometihng that i can say was seamless with WMP - definately some panic moments.  overall - 1 week into this - it was the right call.

<Title>Incompatible with Mac OS 10.3, when update is not a sensible choice
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, the iPod itself is a lovely piece of equipment, the functionality I was looking for in a pretty package, at an acceptable price. It could be a nice replacement for the old iPod that I wore out.   But (as of late September 07), buyer beware: it does not work with Mac OS 10.3. Granted, that is not the latest OS, but a reasonable version to run on a home machine. And, updating the OS at the time the iPod Classic is released is not a sensible option, given that 10.5 will be available very soon.   Apple could have done better than that - leaving their loyal, long-time customers hanging like that is a terrible business strategy. A 1-star rating not strictly for the product itself, but for the overall experience. (And one would think they would have learned from the iPhone debacle.)   So, loyal Apple users with OS 10.3 - it is a wise choice to wait until OS 10.5 is out.

<Title>GETS BETTER EVERY YEAR
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple once again scores high, this is my fourth ipod, first I got the U2 20 GB special edition, then 60 GB Photo Ipod, then the 5th gen 60 GB video Ipod and now this beauty, I has great sound, great video cuality, love the new interface and what I love the best is the space. The interface is not as slow as some people claim, it just takes between 10 to 14 seconds to change menus. So if you are thinking of buying a new ipod, get this one.

<Title>The best iPod yet!
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 160gb iPod Classic 3 weeks ago to replace my two 40gb 5th gen iPod. I was continually running out of space and I needed more. What I got was more than just space. The new Classic features video capability, games, contact list and more.   I love the new CoverFlow feature which lets you flip through your albums by the covers. For this you need to have a perfect iTunes database complete with album cover images for each album. Fortunately, Apple iTunes provides automatic downloading of album art work to your MP3's. ITunes automatically located and attached about 80% of my CD collection art work. The rest I either scanned or found on the Internet and dragged right into iTunes. This process is very easy, I could find the image in my browser and click & drag it directly onto the album in iTunes and it would attach the art work to each song in the album. One click & drag, period.   I had to do a lot of work to clean up my iTunes database to get the whole package to work properly. My database was a mish-mash of ripped CD's and downloaded songs with only about 40% of the ID3v2 basic tag information populated. At first try I also got a lot of my albums showing an album cover for each song in the album, this was particularly a problem with compilations where a separate album was listed in CoverFlow for each artist in the compilation, for example, with the Rolling Stones Magazine top 500 Songs of all time I got like 400 albums listed in CoverFlow. Needless to say, this is plain old annoying. After much experimentation   I found that by selecting all the songs of one album together and checking the box marked "Compilations" to "yes" that it then correctly listed the album one time in CoverFlow. I now can breeze through my entire CD collection with one album cover per CD. This is a great feature when you get it working correctly.  When I first attached the iPod Classic to my iTunes I found it to be a bit slow to react to my commands, but when I cleaned up my iTunes database and properly linked all my albums via ID3v2 tags and got the first sync done I found the performance to be quite acceptable while working in iTunes and during future sync's. My previous database was a mess with a lot of songs missing from the database (I manage my folders manually as I have yet to trust this to itunes). I use CDeX to rip my CD collection. It uses the phenomenal LAME CoDec which produces the best MP3's and it does a great job of filling out the ID3v2 tags automatically for you. All the albums I ripped this way imported flawlessly into iTunes.  The battery life is amazing. I ran it for two days all day and the battery meter barely moved. It still had 90% full indicated. I read a review that tested the new classic and claimed 56 hours of audio playback and 14 hours of video playback. I believe it. It is far better than my older iPod 5th gen.  I love playing the iQuiz game on it. It quizzes you in a great variety of ways, even including album art to challenge your knowledge of your own music collection. Fun stuff.  On the negative side, my add-ons that I used on my original 5th gen iPod no longer work on the new Classic. I have an iTrip FM broadcaster and an iTalk voice recording attachment, both made by Griffin Technologies that do not work on the Classic. I did find a new iTalk at Best buy for $10 that creates amazing CD quality stereo recordings on the Classic. I will have to fork out another $60-70 to replace the FM broadcaster.  The sound quality on this ipod is noticeably cleaner than my original 5th gen iPod. I have a good ear and $250 pair of Shure E3c ear buds that clearly like the new Classic over the older model. There is no noise or distortion even at maximum volume. Every nuance of the music is faithfully reproduced. If you have anything less than a good $100+ set of headphones you won't notice the difference, but if you do, you will like what you hear and what you do not hear.  I am through importing my CD collection into iTunes at 320kbps. I have already filled 138GB of it including 50gb of Coast to Coast podcast's and 6 feature length movies at 500mb each. There is not much space left, I can't wait for the one Terrabyte iPod to come out.  My first attempt to sync the new iPod Classic to my old database netted me a lot of errors and failed sync's, and also way too many album covers in CoverFlow. This turned out to be all due to the mess of a database I had thrown together over the years. Once I cleaned it up it has worked flawlessly every time. Even with 30,000 songs and being nearly full it now sync's in about 2-3 minutes with just 4 or 5 songs being added each time I sync. This is very good.  This iPod is a definite winner, but to make the most of it you have to have a squared away iTunes database.

<Title>Don't rush to upgrade
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my iPod classic as a gift.  This is my 5th iPod and I had high hopes.  After a few days my reaction is mixed.  Sound Quality -) My 60 GB iPod with Video had much better sound quality than this version.  I listened to both with my Bose QC-3 headphones, a pair of Bose earbuds and a pair of regular earbuds.  I had someone hold the iPods out of sight so I coudln't tell which I was listening to during my "blind" test.  The sound quality on the new iPod Classic is a bit muddy.  That's the best description I can come up with for the sound.  It wasn't so bad the new iPod should be returned but there was a difference that I couldn't describe as a good thing.    I could hear less of a difference in quality between the two devices on the standard iPod headphones.  Since my other headphones are both mady by Bose, it is possible that there is some problem with the Classic and those headphones.  I listened to both in my car, which also has Bose speakers.  The sound was different but not as different as it seemed via the headphones.  Nevertheless, try it (with your headphones) before you buy it.  Sound quality is very subjective and you may prefer the classic.  Interface +) Cover Flow is really a nice feature.  It makes me stop and listen to albums that I had forgotten about over the years as they get burried among all of the newer music.  I have had no problems with freezing.  +) The ability to search is a wonderful improvement.  I am not one of those people that knows every artist name, album name, or song name.  It's nice to search on one word.  The more ways the iPod can allow you to find what you want to hear the happier I am.  -) The click wheel on this version seems less sensitive.  While it may give you more control, it isn't as smooth and easy-to-use as previous iPods.  +) The finish on this iPod (silver) doesn't show every finger print the way my 60 GB black video did.  You'll still see every print on the back, but at least the front of the device isn't a mess the moment you pick it up.  Display +) The display on this iPod is better than every other iPod I've owned.  It's beautiful to look at and movies and music videos look great!!  All in all, I'm happy with the new iPod.  However, if it wasn't a gift I would return it.  There aren't enough improvements versus drawbacks for me to part with my 5th generation iPod.  If you need something new because of a break or this is your first iPod, it's fine.  If you have a working device that you love, don't rush out to buy this.

<Content> Who would not want to convert hundreds of CDs to a lossless format on an iPod? Playback on the home sound system would be a piece of cake.   Sadly, Apple's notion of lossless recording/playback apparently does not include the mid-range. In other words, no trouble with the treble - it's gone!  Tomorrow my iPod will be also be gone.  Tom

<Content>I've had this 160GB iPod for about 3 months. I love it and would buy it again in a heartbeat if anything bad ever happens to it. Mine works perfectly and the ability to carry around well over a thousand albums with near CD quality is quite incredible. Most of the time, I use it with my home stereo system and the sound quality is outstanding.   I haven't had the problems some other users complain of. I can quickly navigate the menu, the cover-flow works just fine, it plays movies with no problems...  I'm not saying it can't be improved since that would be totally foolish. But I am saying that I think it is by far the best product of it's kind in today's market!

<Title>Huge dissapointment Shame on Apple and Steve Jobs 
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought it so that I could archive all my old CD's and AVI videos I had filed. But I was dissapointed by the fatcs that:  - Ipod won't run AVI videos and previously copied MP3s or MP4s that were not created to its taste. Thers is 3rd party software available on the net, but its not affiliated to apple, costs extra and who knows if its reliable, besides whatever happened to 'plug and play' ?  - When I want to rip my old CD's Ipod will force me to convert them to its special format AAC, which can not be played by any other MP3 player. So that means If were to buy into this, I would be stuck with Ipod forever or lose all my audio/video files.   - Ipod won't let you manually drag audio/video files onto the device, it first has to go over itunes and even that doesn't work all the time, as some albums I was not able to copy after several attempts until I finally gave up because - listen up apple people: I have a life beyond my PMP. - Why on earth do I need to download and install a software (itunes) that plays 'nanny' for me, takes over my computer and manages my media files, I'm a PC user and potty trained and can take care of my needs for myself.  - The things has no 'on and off' button. Talk about the design - utility trade-off !  - That wheel with which it is operated, maybe works for kids accustomed to video game consoles, but as an older find it confusing an user-unfriendly. - No A/C adapter, so I can't charge the batteries on the go in the office (where itunes is -u guessed it- not installed) ? - I'm disgusted how the big consumer electronics conglomerates are imposing their standards to the exclusions of their competitors proving once and for all that they care more about their competition than about the consumer. Microsoft and Apple should fight it out to the death until a third player comes along who will finally make life easier for the consumer by simply offering to play ALL standards available -yes,its technically possible.

<Title>iPod 160 GB gets a perfect score from me!
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got an iPod 160 Gb to replace my 30 GB video iPod, since I needed more room. I was concerned after reading the negative reviews but am glad I listened to the "happy" reviews instead. I absolutely love my new iPod. The lag issues have been addressed in the latest apple software updates and I haven't noticed any problems with lag since I got the iPod. And the capacity on this beast is phenomenal. There is a "search" function that is helpful in locating specific items quickly. The video is crystal clear and runs very smoothly. I have over 90 GB of stuff on there already and have never had to browse for more than a few seconds to find any particular item, which is pretty good I think.   Overall I highly recommend the 160 GB iPod, especially if you  have a lot of video content. It is barely wider than the 30 Gb iPod I had previously so fits most of my previous docking stations (all but my InMotion portable speaker set by Altec Lansing, in which it just barely fits). Recommended Speakers to go with it (the ones I picked) are the Klipsch iGroove SXT (for work) and the Klipsch iFi (for home), which I just purchased.

<Title>So, tell me why this isn't five stars again?
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm just not seeing the flaws reported here or elsewhere.  I have 160Gb -- effectively 154Gb but I'm okay with that -- and I can watch videos, listen to music, see my photo albums, all without much incident.  The iTunes interface isn't perfect but you know what?  It syncs everything I check or uncheck, and it's very easy to get the iPod to just work right out of the box.  My anecdote cancels out yours.  Coverflow.  I love it.  Do I like having to give my credit card over to Apple so I can get cover art?  No, so I didn't.  I can get cover art for free using Tag/Rename.  And since I don't browse by album cover -- with about 60k songs, I'd never find anything, and there are no album covers for some of my Brazilian music -- I really don't suffer from this.  Granted, if you offer 160Gb of space, you have to engineer the software to handle potentially thousands of albums, but I feel they will fix this in time.  It's not the hardest problem in the world.  The same jog dial from my Wife's 3G iPod, only a little more tactile feel, works just as well, probably better for someone like me with caffeine-induced twitchiness.  Volume is very good, but the EQ is largely annoying so I tend to output with no EQ and let the amplifier handle it, e.g. my car stereo or my PC.  And let me say something about the iPod with respect to the Zune.  The Zune, for its WiFiness and video abilities and whatever, cannot function as a hard drive.  I can skip the whole iTunes scenario, plug it into my work laptop, fire up Winamp, set the library scan onto my iPod, and the same 11k songs I'm listening to in the car come with me inside.  Plus, I get Winamp's control over playlists, etc.  The ideal solution for me.  Finally, I checked out video on it, and it looks really, really good.  Since video conversion is almost a necessity for most people, just grab a conversion program and let it worry about getting video files in the right format for your iPod.  Stop letting the tail wag the dog, and make your files compliant with your devices, not the other way around.  In the end, your PC can play anything, so if you've adopted an iPod, then convert to an iPod friendly format and move on.  Sheesh.  It holds 60,000 songs and can play all day, in color.  What else do you really need?  Five stars.  -C

<Title>Hold everything
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Finally, after holding out for years, my dream has come true: an iPod with storage capacity exceeding 100GBs.  At last I can store every note of my music collection into this MP3 player with ample room for videos and photos.  Although this is marketed as 160 GB, the capacity is really 148 once you activate it, so be warned.    I agree with some of the other reviews: the iPod classic is slow when responding to the click wheel.  Plus, it doesn't always load the album artwork quickly.  Even so, I can live with these two minor flaws. I'm just happy to have an iPod that not only can carry 148 GB of music, but also has extended battery life.  Plus, the 160 GB is thinner than the 60 GB iPod I previously had.  In addition, I have Vista on my PC, and I was able to plug it in and set it up with no glitches whatsoever.    I notice that the iPods are no longer packaged with a power adapter.  What's up with that?  Has Apple gone cheap on its consumers?  For the amount of money we consumers are paying, we should have ALL the equipment we need to use our iPod with no hassle or inconvenience.    Still, I'm glad I made this investment.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it's good enough to make this consumer happy for years to come.

<Title>Good, not excellent
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will compare this product with 4G IPod 40GB that I have owned, loved  and heavily used for almost 3 years. I have owned the product being reviewed for 3 weeks now.  1. What is about the same:  - the sound quality. I did side-by-side comparison by playing the same songs through powerful sound system. The difference in sound was marginal; - available equalizer settings; - the look.  2. What's become worse. - the clickwheel used to be better in 4th generation - bigger, more sensitive and smoother; - the screen could be seen without backlight. I could conserve battery by keeping the backlight off and still clearly see the titles of tracks being played. In the new IPod, once the backlight is off (say, 10 seconds after the last touch to the clickwheel), you can't see anything on the screen. When the next song begins, you don't see the title - the response when navigating through menus became slower. - there are bugs in the software that handles the contacts. In my case I was able to import contacts from Windows Vista, but on many occasions the  fields are mixes up (work phone shows as home one e.t.c.). Nice feature of showing contacts with pictures doesn't work well too. Photos are displayed too small to be recognizable, many pictures are shown damaged.  3. What's become better. - the disk space (this is an obvious point) - the new model has gapless playback - huge improvement for my taste. - color screen nicely shows artwork, the fonts are very good. - battery life is much longer.  4. What's new (note: comparing to 4th generation!) - photo playback. The feature is fun, but is not really useful. The reason is that IPod can store photos in a directory tree of 1 level of nesting. If your directory tree is deeper, all pictures from 2nd and consequent levels will be collapsed in one folder under the 1st level directory name. In my case it makes it next to impossible to find the right pictures among 4 or 5 thousand of photos.  - video playback - I don't care for this feature and haven't tested it.  The bottom line is: upgrade if you are running out of disk space (as I did) or if your current model doesn't have gapless playback which is important for you (as it is for me). If I had 5th gen Ipod with sufficient disk size, I would not upgrade right now.

<Title>Not worthy of the Apple or iPod name
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod Classic is a profound disappointment. For some reason, Apple has locked down the iPod to eliminate third-party video output, so don't expect it to work with your old cables, video docks, etc. Secondly, the audio output is reportedly inferior to the previous generation; however, I can't speak to that directly, because the firmware is so buggy, I can't even load my iTunes library on it. The latest firmware (1.0.1 as of this writing) supposedly fixed a bunch of bugs, but you wouldn't know it from where I'm standing. Apple support claims it's my library, but my library worked fine on my 5.5gen iPod. I was able to get the music on it in manual mode, but that's not an acceptable solution.   Apple has remained typically silent on the issue, so there's no telling when (or if) these MAJOR flaws will be fixed. I can't think of a decent reason to cripple the video output that was present on the previous generations, and Apple hasn't deigned to give us a reason. I'd expect such shoddy engineering and treatment from Microsoft, but coming from Apple, it's a tremendous disappointment. It's clear that Steve is more infatuated with the flash-based players, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's quite a while before the iPod Classic becomes a worthy successor to its ancestors. Until then, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

<Title>5 stars...for now(ipod noob)
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the 160g since the second week after they came out,didn't actually open the box till 2 weeks ago.I've been busy.So far I've been pleased with the ipod;all I've had before this for portable music were a few tape walkmans,then a basic discman,then a sony sport discman,and then the sony sport minidisc player.I've been using my minidisc player since at least '02,and wanted to wait till the ipods had enough capacity to let me have all my songs on it at once.Having to sit around re-recording minidiscs every 6 months to keep things fresh was a weekend-long chore,and I wasn't about to get an mp3 player that I'd have to do the same with.So I just went out and got the new big one so that I wouldn't have to worry about wasted time.Good thing I didn't fall for apple's sale involving getting rid of all the old 80g vids for practically the same price as the new,bigger one;apple's weak in that respect.That shouldn't be news to most.  It took me 5 hours to synch 92.87 gigs of music onto it,which was tedious,but I waited and it got done.Then the ipod screen pops up and says that I only have 148 gigs total."Kinda weak" I thought,but whatever--it's still a s___ ton of space.Then I tried throwing a few videos I had sitting around in a folder onto itunes and find out that it has to be in apple's format.The run-around begins.I had some buddies on a message board help me out,found a program,and was able to change the vids after dinking around with it.It takes a long time to convert an hours worth of video to mpeg4 or whatever it is.After a few days I put a handful of vids on it.  So far it's gone about 10 hours off the first charge(1 hour of watching vids included)and the batt icon looks to be 1/4 down,so the 40 hour charge factor seems to be truth so far.  I think the sound's darn good,considering I've upgraded from a player that had songs in sony's atrac3 format.I haven't tinkered with the equalizer because I want the battery to last,but I might check it out at least.  The video surprised me on it.the colors are awesome and the sound from the vid source is great too.too bad it sounds like apple is scalping people on that "special" $50 peice of plastic cable that should be $5,though.one reason I got this thing was so that I wouldn't have to lug around my stupid dvd case to parties;I just wanna plug it in and have 10 or so movies at my disposal.Guess I'll be lugging it around until apple gets the idea and lowers the price.what were they thinking?!allowing any cable to work with the video feature's gonna cause a massive NEW wave of dvd piracy--nah,not a chance.they'd have to ban the internet for that.another capitalist,bold-faced lie that fills their pockets,eh?I wonder if legal action could take place if they didn't advertise the "cable issue"?eh,apple stinks.  it sometimes takes 3-4 tries with the usb to get the ipod to take a synch,but it's no biggie.  in a nutshell:while apple as a capitalist-pig company continues to hunger for ways to screw their loyal,but mostly blind,customers,the ipod has been awesome so far in my experience.the set-backs are few,and except for the cable issue I'm happy with my purchase.

<Title>Could have been SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Could have been SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!  2 be honest i brought this for the memory space. I have tons of DVDs that i copied onto my iPod so i already at this point exceeded the 80GB threshold. So i decided to sell my 80GB and shell out an extra 100.00 for the 160GB. I brought the black model & was soooo disappointed. The quality has really GONE DONE HILL!! Apple cuts corners in the WORST way. The black looks so CHEAP & POORLY made. The silver looks nice & that's what i should have gone with. I didn't encounter iTunes issues like everyone else did, i had a breeze with mine. But selecting a song can take 2 seconds longer then it normally does. Fast forwarding a movie can take a few seconds longer then it normally does compared with the previous iPod video. Just feels like a step down. The funny thing is this isn't Apple's 1st iPod. When you make a device, you learn its flaws & fix it for the newer model. That isn't the case here. Overall it is a good device but it hasn't EVOLVED. If they had created an iPod Touch with 160GB memory that would have been nice & i wouldn't be as disappointed as i am. That's the evolution i was looking for, but it didn't happen here. So I'm cutting back on memory and moving onto the Zune 80GB with a bigger LCD screen. The iPod screen is getting so OLD & small looking. The sound quality is also a bit on the LOW SIDE. Why have a volume setting feature when it doesn't even work. Apple READ & EVOLVE properly. For now goodbye from me (Former iPod Nation Member)

<Title>iPod Classic Review
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod Classic is a mobile music player. The objective of the iPod is to offer reasonable sound and video at a reasonable price. That said, Apple has taken steps to make as many features available as possible while still keeping the price-point low. Many negative reviews are from techs who look at the new iPod Classic and see an inferior audio chip and a few other things compared to previous versions. This is true, but ask how many of the techs actually used the chips to the fullest capacity and I bet the answer will be very few. If you are one of the few people who listen to the iPod with a pair of 150 dollar headphones and rip your compact disks at 320 kbps, you will notice an unnatural bass and treble response with the "new" chip. If you buy iTunes store music at the 128-192 kbps compression rate, or rip your compact disks without changing anything in iTunes, then your music will sound almost identical to the 5.5 gen iPod Video even with expensive headphones. Apple has looked at this reality of so few people ripping to 320 kbps, at least for the time being, and has decided to invest your 349.99 in the iPod on a new graphical experience and bigger hard drive rather than a really nice audio chip (Think BMW vs. Ford on the audio chip). A complaint from techs is that the iPod Classic also has no TV out. The iPod Classic has TV out if you have the right cords: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300233 . The iPod Classic still smudges with fingerprints very easily, and still has no power adapter in the box (you must charge the iPod from your computer). Why Apple still has little support for open source video like an XVID codec onboard the iPod, or an easy converter in iTunes is beyond me. I would love to take some family videos with me sometimes, but I just grab my laptop so I do not have to wait on a two hour video conversion process to put the videos on my iPod. iTunes is still proprietary, and I would love to see the iPod have a hard disk indexing system like spotlight that would allow dragging and dropping so I could use Finder or Windows Explorer to move files around and put them in the folders I thought made since (Think external hard drive with an interface on the go). If you have no idea what these last two comments are, that is okay. The iPod Classic is still an iPod. Better alternatives do exist. You pay more for these alternatives and they are not as pretty or light as the iPod Classic. You should check out such companies like Archos and Creative before you purchase this though. Creative has years and years of audio experience, and Archos is doing some pretty neat stuff. Four stars for a product that does what the majority wants. Minus one star because Apple has yet to give the iPod the computer based support needed to allow consumers to use the iPod to its fullest potential, and because a wall charger is no longer included.

<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm thoroughly happy with my purchase.  The new cover flow browsing technique is great.  The battery life has been tremendous.  I don't recall seeing the battery appear anything less than full.  My only complaint is that sometimes the processor seems a little - around a second or so - slow at times.  This is hardly noticeable though.

<Title>More space U got it!!
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This version of the Ipod comes in with a whopping 160GB of capacity for your music, videos, tv shows or movies whatever suites your fancy.  I am happy because i will be able to get a good deal more of my cd library on my Ipod.    I also enjoy the new cover flow feature that allows you to go through your music by cover and see what is available on the other side.  Also with the overall interface of the Ipod and how your able to view not only your cd cover, but the song and album title along with the track number and what if any rating that you've given the specific song.  It just feels a lot better this time around with everything this time.  I'm not saying its perfect because nothing is.  But with this version of the Apple 160 GB iPod Classic it comes very close..a great buy.  I didnt have an issue with shipping since i ordered straight from Apple instead with the engraving all that.  I've had no issues with this Ipod being compatible with my Laptop...i just went and sync'd all my songs and videos to be downloaded to my laptop and it did so without issues at all.  Love it so far and i dont expect that attitude to change anytime in the future.  Excellent!!

<Title>A remarkable player with some serious flaws
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Creative Zen Nomad packed up after 4 years of loyal service. I love classical music and I wanted an MP3 player in which I could store a large number of classical CDs. I found Creative's latest offerings inadequate - for starters none matched the 60 GB of my earlier model, so I decided to take the dip and purchased this ipod with its gigantic 160GB memory. First impressions were very good. An excellent screen and infinitely better controls than my old Nomad. Moreover, iTunes converted without hitches my earlier files from MP3 format to iPod format and installed them on the iPod which played them well.   Then I started noticing some irritating features. First, the whole process of plugging the iPod on my Sony Vaio is SLOOOOOW. The computer takes a full minute to 'recognize' the iPod. Thereafter, everything slows down remarkably. Copying a CD onto the iPod takes far longer than it did onto my old MP3 player. What is worse, the computer freezes from time to time while I am doing this, which means that working on something else while downloading from a CD is slowed down considerably.   Secondly, the manufacturers assume that you automatically want to download everything from your computer to the iPod. Given, however, that few computers these days can match the 160GB of the iPod, I quickly found my laptop reaching the limits of its 80GB memory. The solution - not to synchronize the iPod with the laptop; this, however, requires quite elaborate manoeuvres every time you link the iPod on the computer. WHat is even worse, if you ONCE press the wrong button and agree to synchornize the two, the iPod LOSES all its existing content and acquires the computer's lesser content.   Third - playback facility lacks the Nomad's useful capacity to keep adding CDs ('albums') on your current playlist - hence you can only choose to play one album at a time. And while on the subject on playlists, creating them seems to me very very time consuming. Adding an album to an existing playlist seems to take the best part of a minute - this was something the Nomad did instantaneously.   Some simple operations are remarkably tricky. Deleting a single picture or track ('song') from your iPod is virtually impossible without first deleting it from your coputer iTunes library and then synchronizing the iPod to the library - a ridiculously time-consuming routine, which in my old Nomad could be performed by simply pointing at the item and pressing the delete button on the computer. It could even be performed on the MP3 player itself by simply pressing a sequence of two buttons.   The simplest feature that would remove most of these frustrations would be if iTunes (like virtually every other software I know) simply had two lists of items, those on the iPod and those on the computer, and allowed free movement of items from the one to the other. I don't know if this is not done due to some attempt to limit copyright infringements, but the Creative software and all Camera softwares provide it.   Final complaint. You can only charge the iPod while it is connected on the computer (slowing everything else down) and while it is connected on the computer you CANNOT use it as an MP3 player, e.g. looking at the pictures on its own screen or listening to music through the headphones.   I have now had the iPod for 3 weeks and I appreciate some of the frustrations may gradually subside as one gets used to its idiosyncracies and limitations.

<Title>Great upgrade from older iPod
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the iPod classic to replace my 4-year-old iPod because its battery would no longer hold a decent charge.  I really like the smaller size and the sharp, colorful LCD display.  My only complaint is that Apple no longer supplies the remote control cable that came with my old iPod.  I ended up finding one for less than $10 from a Taiwan company.

<Title>Ipod 160 Gig Review
<Date>Sat Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>No complaints once you get this device dialed in to your liking.  After graduating from a 40 Gig Photo Classic to the 160, my only gripes after owning this device 1 month is the retarded "Volume Locking" portion and the Outlook Email syncing contacts (poorly written as syncing protocol - too long to explain why).  Re;  Volume Locking:  suggestion is to put that Volume Lock on Maximum and control the volume from the wheel as normal.  It is terribly annoying and frustrating to have to constantly enter a pass key to manipulate that locking feature when you are dissatisfied with your choice.  No amplifier, car radio or any other music related device has a volume locking feature.  We are now faced with two volume sections on a single device.  On the upside, as far as some of the other complaints I have seen and read here, I have not experienced any of them such as the slowness in scrolling or the Ditigal/Analog converter.  In Itunes, just be sure and rip at a higher sampling rate such as 256k/Stereo or 320kbps vs. the low res 128kpbs which may help.  A big plus is the large alphabetical letters when scrolling through your library, a clock that lights up the front screen while playing music and several other goodies such as a larger screen.  After paying $425 for the 40 gig Photo, the $344 was a welcoming price for a drive that is 4x larger.  Overall, I am quite satisfied with this choice especially after almost running out of space on the previous 40 gig...whew...just in time. Anthony G.

<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've tried every mp3 player on the from the zune to the zen and the iPod offers the best feature set and quality.  Plus, if something goes wrong which will eventually happen with hard drive based mp3 players you can go to any apple store for service.  If your Zune fails it has to be shipped back to MS for service which will takes weeks.  Hard drives are much like the breaks on your car the more you use them the faster they wear-out.  I'd rather spend a few hours at the Apple store getting my iPod fixed then the several weeks it'll take MS to get around to doing somthing.

<Title>A Cadillac-- but you may like a Chevy just as well
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, when you get this player out of the box, stop with the player and the USB cable. Leave the headphones in the box, or better yet, throw them away. Don't kid yourself about those things. The phones that come with iPods have always been junk. They don't have enough volume output, they last about 5 minutes, and they sound terrible-- and I have a slight hearing loss. Invest in a nice pair of Sony phones; it's totally worth it. I know, as expensive as the iPod 160 is, it should come with decent phones, but it doesn't.  That said about the hearing loss, I don't know what other reviewers mean when they complain about inferior sound quality. (If they're listening with the iPod phones, it's no wonder.) If anything, using my Sony headphones, I think the sound is clearer, with dialogue in movie and TV files easier to understand. Playing it through my computer, and on an iPod dock with speakers, it sounds the same as my iPod 60 did. I'm actually playing it now at half volume, and that's something I never do. Other reviewers have talked about skipping, but I haven't heard a single skip. I did buy mine this month-- I may have gotten a different batch or something.  Video is clear, and it's probably my imagination, but I think the screen looks slightly bigger. The cover flow option is a nice idea, but it's absurdly slow, and I can't imagine using it at all. Looking at the main menus, half the screen shows your menu options, and the other half shows random album covers. It's a nice touch for screen space that was otherwise wasted in menu browsing on the older iPods. I have no idea how it affects battery life, if at all. The menu is easy to navigate, with few changes from previous devices. The battery seems to last quite a bit longer than my iPod 60, and I get a LOT more video time out of it. I like the screen showing a clock and battery life while playing music (without backlight, in case you were wondering)-- that was a nice touch.  The player does not come with an iTunes CD. I already had iTunes loaded, but if you don't, you'll need to download this from the Apple site. If they put an installation file on the player itself, I don't have anyway of knowing it. At any rate, I've always found iTunes incredibly easy to use to rip my CDs and create playlists. The software does a lot of it for you, and most of the rest is just drag and drop. (Always back up your iTunes purchases to CD or DVD.)  Whatever player you choose, be sure to invest in a sturdy case for it that gives good coverage and cushioning, especially for the corners. Choose something that encloses the whole player, with a hole for the headphones. One uncushioned corner impact on hard tile can be enough to do it in. This iPod is basically a little hard drive with a battery. It may feel like nothing in your pocket, but it can reach "terminal velocity" so to speak on its way to the hard ground from waist level. It will **probably** endure a couple of drops, but don't throw this into your purse, backpack or pocket unprotected, toss it around and expect it to keep working.   Get a clear plastic panel to stick on the front as well. I've used PDA screen protectors for this, just cutting them to size, and for some reason they work a lot better than the plastic sheets made specifically for iPods & the touch wheel. (Your mileage may vary.) Don't worry about bubbles because they will press out eventually & you won't notice them anyway, even with video. Apple would do well to include at least a plastic screen cover rather than grossly inadequate earphones and paper documentation in a slick little folder that people will probably just toss in the trash.  If you're shopping for your first MP3 player, I think you'll be very happy with an iPod, though you may want to consider one of the newer Nanos for less money & less memory if you're not sure how you will like carrying a player. This is the Cadillac of MP3 players; you may find that a Chevy will serve you just as well.  160 gigs is probably ridiculously large for the casual user. I use mine as a secondary hard drive and desperately needed the extra space for travel. I was thrilled to be able to load my entire library, and have tons of space left over for my work. Amazon's overnight shipping went without a hitch, and was SO much better than fighting the holiday crowds to get it. I am very happy with my new player, and I think you will be as well.

<Title>Big Disappointment
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>From what everybody had said about past ipods I thought I would love this thing. Apple has a great reputation for putting out high quality products. This product, unfortunately, falls short. First off is the bugs. Even after downloading the third firmware for this product there are many of them. If you are on the "now playing" screen when you try to sync your ipod with your computer, it invariably freezes up. Also, some files which are on the ipod (and will play in Itunes) somehow do not play on the ipod. The ipod just sits there as if it is going to play it but it never starts up. Sound quality is also a big issue. I'm certainly no audiophile but the headphones put out horrible sound quality, much worse than the cheap Sandisk MP3 player I have. Mids and lows are very distorted. I happen to have had a pair of Sony MDR-XD200 and these seemed to have solved the problem. Most likely, you will want to invest in some decent headphones if you buy this player. I ended up buying a pair of Sennheisers and a pair of V-Modas. As for positives, I've never had any problems with video playback. I have about 20 or so full length movies on this thing. I like the cover flow feature even though some have commented on how slow it is. Storage is also a big plus and if you have a large music collection, this is the only game in town. Right now, Zune only makes an 80 gig which is just not big enough for my collection. Buy this product if your collection is huge but look elsewhere if you can go with something with a smaller capacity.

<Title>Apple why did you do this to me?
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>"Apple why did you do this to me?" might sound like a harsh name for a review, so I should start by saying this iPod is an amazing device that may satisfy some customers. Building on tradition this iPod features the largest capacity yet: 160GB! When I heard this unit was out I immediately wanted it. After all who wouldn't want the king of all iPods? 160 GB is enough to hold many entire albums even without using compression--and have them playback gap free! So, here's why the unit had to be returned to the store, and why I have no interest in a 6G iPod.  Apple managed to do what appears to be a typical move for successful manufacturers. They have discontinued the use of a key piece of technology used in previous iPods: the Wolfson DAC. A "DAC", or digital to analog converter, is the chip that is responsible for turning numbers into sound (which is essentially what an iPod does). On the 6G iPod Apple has chosen a new DAC made by Cirrus Logic. This new chip apparently fails the taste test to an important community: people who care about the quality of their audio listening products. These are the same folks who throw away the headphones that come with the iPod and buy headphones that actually sound good.  Unfortunately this has me halting any iPod "classic" recommendations and purchases. I'm happy with my 5.5G iPod which uses the faithful Wolfson DAC and sounds like what a "classic" iPod should sound like. There are even folks who swear by the fidelity of even earlier iPods. Apple, please get it together.

Do not buy apple products they only work with other apple products and since apple has about 5% of the market.... Oh yes for you, NBC cut it over to their website and opened it up to the rest of the 95% of the market. So they have not lost anything, they have made more money That is what you get for buying worthless ipods and Apple products. Apple is proprietary and that is why the Amazon Unbox does NOT support it. The .wmv files can be played on a lot of software, such as Toshiba, Creative, iRiver, Archos, Zune, and any player that is playsforsure. As with the ipods and apple files, .m4p's, can ONLY be played on Apple software. It has not gotten old hearing people just like you complain about spending a lot of money for nothing! LOL LOL LOL

<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was hesistant about this product, for good reason. I was replacing my 5.5g ipod that was stolen... turns out that nothing apple cranks out would compare.  The sound quality on this IS IN FACT worse. I thought the audiophiles reviewing the sound quality online were just being picky, but the sound really hurts my ears because of the intense treble and the mids that are missing.  The symbols sound so fake and piercing. By no means is this always a "clean" sound that people justify it as, it is just pronounced and distorted. I listened to an acoustic piece first, it sounded alright, and crisp. But then I listened to Dragonforce & Sonata Arctica... I couldn't concentrate on the music because of the highs resonating in my ears. Jazz sounded a little better on my ears, but you have to like it crisp and not warm sounding...  I want to take it back, but I don't want to more on a restocking fee...  If you can get your hands on a Zune or a 5.5 generation, please go for it, I spent 15% restocking fee to learn this lesson. Listen to the majority of reviews!!!   edit... ************  ok so you can kinda resolve this in the EQ.. but because its preset.. you have to deal with it being muddy or something else.  also.... GAMES ARENT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE... WHAT THE HELL APPLE  the fifth generation ipod is compatible with everything though?  apple messed up... i have not been a fan of apple since OS 9 (horrible btw)

<Title>Great Concept... Seriously Flawed
<Date>Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok. I have not read any other comments on this product on the Amazon webpage because I want it be about my experience and not influenced by anybody else's experience. I'll go back and read the other reviews after I post this and see where I fit in.  I purchased my 160GB iPod Classic 2 weeks ago because I was getting very limited on my previous 60G iPod (my 4th iPod) and I thought the extra 100 Gigs of space would last me for the next years with no problems. That aspect of the product has proved to be true.  That's when the problems began.  First, after uploading my entire 60 Gigs of songs and videos (6 hours to do that) the menus were so sluggish they were unusable.   The coverflow view provided the album cover for every artist on every album as a different album cover so it literally took 5 minutes to scroll from the first album to the last which made this "selling point" totally unusable. If the coverflow view just provided a view of each album cover by the name of the album, like I do when I view CD's on my bookshelf I would be happy, but what they have done makes no sense at all. After installing the 1.0.2 firmware update things improved slightly because they removed artists from compilation albums from the sort order and moved them to the end of the list, but seriously, nobody at Apple seems to have even looked at how someone picks up a CD from a bookshelf... by the single CD case which is a single title, not arranged by who sang each track on each CD!   OK, we'll get around that coverflow problem by just ignoring it and not using it. Check.  So, I put the thing in the dock on my PC. Hours later after the first synch all is good. But then, each successive time when you put it in the dock you get into a repeating connected, synching, connected, synching, connected, syching mode, and you cannot stop it. iTunes says synching once, but then if you try to eject the thing you can't. iTunes locks up for minutes at a time.  What do I do next? I go to the Apple Support discussions. I realize that there are many, many comments about this. Hmm! So I post some questions and I make a point of saying I have bought 4 other iPods and none of them do this. They all get deleted from the discussion groups.   Then I start monitoring the discussion groups by downloading the entire website several times a day and I realize that Apple is literally deleting many, many posts about these same problems.   The message you get from them is that you are violating their guidelines which I guess means that if you complain that your product flat out doesn't work you aren't allowed on the "support group".  Then if you start to examine the discussion groups and realize that Apple has intentionally disabled many of the video functions of the previous iPod models which breaks EVERY non-Apple video device out there you have to start wondering if Apple has not become the Anti-Apple!  What ever happened to "Think Different"?  Seriously, this is the most flawed product Apple has ever produced and as a fifth time Apple iPod buyer I have to say it's the last iPod I will ever own. Apple seems to be much worse than any other company now that they have a monopoly on MP3 players.   My vote is to buy anything BUT Apple from no on because they just screwed me, and thousands of other people, over on this iPod Classic.

<Content>Eventhough it may look pretty, if you plan on watching videos not from itunes then you will notice an extra set of black bars for 16:9 movies, a very dark set halfway to the picture, and another lighter set the other halfway, which changes in brightness with the picture. My 5th gen doesn't do this. Also when you load video into the TV Show section and it's not from itunes then it will mess up the order of all the other TV Shows, even the one's from itunes. If you really don't need 160GB, and you plan on watching videos not from itunes, then I suggest the 5th gen model for the 80GB, which you might be able to pick up at a cheap price with the new models. The only "improvements" would be the album covers that are now displayed throughout the menus, that I feel isn't worth the change.

<Title>Sufficient disc space, iTunes is poor
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently upgraded from the "old" 80 Gbyte iPOD to the new Classic 160 Gbyte iPOD (my old one couldn't hold all of my ripped CDs). Before I synced the new iPOD, I upgraded iTunes from version 6.9.something to the latest ones. In this process, a *large* fraction of the cover art that I had spent some 100 hours to scan and insert into iTunes, mysteriously disappeared. That is, they disappeared from iTunes, but if I watch the same Mp3 files in Windows Media Player, the cover art is still there.  At this time, I decided to download cover art from the iTunes Store. This recreated most of the cover art (but in a lower quality than I had used). Still, the cover art for nearly all of my Van Morrison records were missing, and half of those of my Paul Simon records + some more. As neither Van Morrison nor Paul Simon are obscure artists, I find this rather annoying.   Being systematic, I use family name before first name in my artist information, thus "Morrison, Van". However, I then found that if I change the artist name to "Van Morrison", iTunes finds some of the cover art. For some reason, it inserts the cover art of some "Darren Morrison" on the Greatest Hits album of Van Morrison. This only serves to confirm my impression of iTunes.  Another problem: I have several albums named "Anthology" (e.g. by Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles). iTunes screws up this completely: when I scroll through the Album list on my iPOD, the software has *merged* all files named "Anthology", so when I go in on the album, the songs of Marvin Gaye and those of the Miracles both show up. The same is the case in iTunes. Another problem on the iPOD: the album cover of "Anthology" and that of "The Anthology" (Bobby 'Blues' Bland) are repeated some 40-50 times, apparently for no reason at all.  iTunes holds a lot of useful information about albums that I rip; this information is automatically put into the fields of the MP3 file. Overall -- having ripped some 1000 CDs -- my impression is that there are inaccuracies and/or gross errors in at least 10% of this information.  In summary: I'm not very impressed with iTunes; these are irritating glitches. (Of course, Windows Media Player has its own flaws...).  Ok. So my review so far has dealt with iTunes. I'm quite happy with the iPOD itself. I haven't had time yet to check if it handles playlists better than my old iPOD. (I have carefully created my own playlists in a previous version of iTunes, where obviously also the sequence of songs were important). When I imported the playlists to my previous iPOD, the song sequence was screwed up on the iPOD.  In summary: a mixed impression of the iPOD + iTunes.  Finally: another stupidity with iTunes. A few years ago, I bought an extended version of Quicktimes because i wanted to be able to convert Quicktimes movies to the Microsoft format. I then updated iTunes on my machine. And without notifying me, a new version of Quicktimess was also installed, overwriting the one I had paid for.

<Title>Another amazing version of the iPod!
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this iPod to replace my 20GB 4th generation iPod. I was so amazed when it arrived and was actually slightly smaller despite the 8x larger capacity! I love the new menu designs and cover flow. This is my first ipod with video capability and I love the way movies and music videos look on it.  My one complaint is that Apple has disabled the ability to turn on TV out to play iPod videos on a TV. And I didn't find this out until AFTER I had bought a cord specifically for this purpose.

<Title>Classic Ipod is really buggy.
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this Ipod classic 160gb for roughly a month and although it looks pretty and has massive storage space I have had problems with it. The following problems are not isolated, infact there are many owners experiencing the same problems and Apple doesn't know whats wrong.   First, the new coverflow feature, which works just like itunes and lets you flip through your albums, has a lag time for the covers to show. This causes the ipod to cease up much like a overloaded computer in need of ram.  Secondly, when viewing a video/movie and you're scanning fwd or rev. the software gets stuck and fwds/rew through the whole thing. The only way to stop this is to reboot the ipod.  Thirdly, the T.V. Out option is disabled on these new ipods. I actually used the option frequently on my 5th gen ipod but now I don't have a choice. Its a "locked" feature.   I was really excited about my new ipod and wanted to really give it a chance before speaking negativley about it but it proved to be too big of a problem for me. I contacted Apple about the issues but they are not acknowledging any problems yet. So after 28 days am returning it to Amazon. Even though I haven't given up on Apple, I strongly suggest for consumers to wait for the revision of this ipod classic. :)

<Content>I expected it better. I have already two of 60 Gb and one of 80 Gb. A first negative comment, it does not work with iPOD2iPOD and it is not possible to transfer the content of the 80 Gb to the new one. A second one I have the feeling that the battery lasts less than the 80 Gb. They could have include FM radio and Recording. On the other side, the positive thing, is the big disk space, nothing else.

<Title>Sound not good enough
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had been looking forward for some time to an iPod with enough storage to hold a large number of high quality Apple lossless files. So it was a real disappointment that the sound quality of this new model was actually worse than before.  Many people were willing to put up with substandard sound quality from compressed audio files because of the convenience. Now that the newest music players have enough capacity to store high quality audio, there is really no excuse for the poor digital-analog converters that Apple is apparently putting in the new iPod Classic. When playing exactly the same uncompressed WAV data, $100 CD players from Sony sound a lot better when plugged into a good stereo than the iPod.  The irony is that the fix should really be pretty simple: a decent digital-analog converter (perhaps the problems with the new chip can be fixed via a firmware upgrade), and a better equalizer with the ability to save user-defined settings would probably be enough for all but the most demanding listeners.

<Title>Poor Audio AND Video Playback
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am presently owning the 5.5 gen. Ipod 80GB and the new iPod Classic 160 GB, which should replace the old one. I am using the iPod mostly as a Video Player, when I am away from home.  The pros for the 160GB Classic are the better case top, the prettier design and I like the new clickweel over the old one. It also does not freeze on Video playback, like the predecessor did too often! It has the double space, which has been the major reason, why I have purchased it.  But there are serious negative points: The Audio playback is significantly worse than on the old Video iPod. Just listen 1:1 with a good headphone and EVERYONE will hear the difference. Additionally, the picture on Video playback is not fluent, it seems to judder. You especially see this with a white background and some people moving from left to right or opposite. And I am not talking about the sluggish response, when you are trying to browse your lists.  Worse Audio AND Video playback compared to the predecessor is a knockout criteria, I will return the iPod until Apple fixes this major problem.

<Title>Be careful, there are many well known bugs in the iPod classic
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 160GB because I wanted another iPod for my car that could fit all my music.  I eventually returned it to the Apple store and demanded a full refund, including the restocking fee.  You can find lots of information about the iPod classic being extremely slow by googling "iPod Classic Slow".  There are many threads on Apple's own support site discussing this as well, although people are claiming that Apple is not listening or trying to hide the problem by deleting posts.    Supposedly there have been some firmware updates that address some of these issues, but I have not seen the latest firmware in action because the Apple store near me has not updated the display models.  My experience with version 1.01 was extremely disappointing.  Very sluggish response time, and unbearable wait times/delays when plugging in and ejecting from iTunes - on the order of 8-9 minutes.  For reference, my music collection is about 80GB.   I have had pretty much every generation of iPod and I can honestly say that this one does not live up to the high quality standards of the previous versions.  I am not even talking about the Cover Flow feature, which is indeed sluggish, but not particularly useful so I don't care about its performance.  Apple seems to have forsaken a bit of their minimalist principles with this version, adding lots of superfluous album art and silly Ken Burns effects everywhere.  If you think it's cool, fine - but if you think you might be distracted by it, you will.  There is unfortunately no way to turn off all the random floating album art.  If you are at all particular about these kind of issues, do yourself a favor and wait till they iron out all the problems.  The sluggishness will annoy you - both in the iPod and with iTunes.  If you are not bothered by such things (and I wish that I was one of those people) go ahead and purchase it - the disk space is definitely worth it.

<Title>Average...Great screen and capacity though
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just upgraded from a 60GB iPod photo to the 160GB classic for extra space and video capability. Overall I am very impressed with the size (smaller than the 60GB!) and solid feel of this unit, and like the aluminum face (much less likely to scratch). The screen is very bright, and the picture clear. I am very impressed with video playback - image is good and frame rate is excellent.  I had to send my first unit back as the hard drive audibly squeaked when accessing the drive (as in someone else could hear it from across the room) although that unit seemed to work OK. My second unit does not have this problem and is completely quiet - so if you have a squeaky iPod (there are several reports I found out there) this is NOT normal.  Software version is 1.0.2. I have 12,000 songs on it now. I do not experience the menu lagging problem when scrolling through my music in the list views that others have reported here - so I think that the newer software version has tamed that a bit. Cover flow seems to work very well - of course if you zip through it as quickly as you can the unit can't keep up, but at moderate viewable speeds I've had no problems with lagging or having to wait for the ipod to load covers. The click wheel is more sensitive than prior versions though and I do find it a bit difficult to land on the exact setting I want to the first time - usually skip down 1 song lower than I wanted to go then when going back it goes up 2 songs - I can see how this can be a bit frustrating and wasn't a problem with the last iPod - if there was a sensitivity option on the click wheel I would definitely tone it down. Also, there are regular times when I just start a song and go to adjust the volume immediately but there is a 1-2 second delay while the drive is still buffering that the click wheel is inactive and doesn't work - this is quite annoying but guess I will adapt to it.  The short of this paragraph is I can NOT tell a difference in sound quality between the new 160Gb classic and my old 60GB iPod photo (4th generation) using headphones. I found NO difference between the two on Bose headphones, sony headphones, or my Rotel surround system at home other than the volume...The audible max volume on the 160 is actually a bit louder than my 60GB model and when you turn the volume up to a point louder than the 60 GB it makes the clipped portions of the recording (usually on the base end of the spectrum) more pronounced/hummy/distorted - but the sound artifacts are there on the 60GB, but less noticeable because I can't turn the volume up anymore.  As for the menu system I find the new graphical interface a nice upgrade from the iPod photo, and this is just a matter of preference for me. It would have been nice if Apple gave the user more control over how the menus appear so we could all customize to taste but it is what it it.  Overall I'm happy with the upgrade, the interface, the sound quality, the screen, and the size. The only cons for me are the very sensitive click wheel that does make it difficult to land exactly on the option you want to highlight (but may just be a matter of time to learn).

<Title>Wait for 6 - 8 Months Then Buy
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Be careful. I returned three of the silver 160 GB iPod classics to the Apple store for the same apparent defect. All three of the iPods I took home seized up when I began to put large amounts of music on it. The problem happened when I hit about 10 GB of music. The iPod would go to the boot up screen and freeze. It would then make this loud clicking noise while the screen light turned on and off. It continued doing this until the battery ran out of power. When I took the last one back and demanded a refund the Apple store clerk suggested that it was a faulty USB port on my lousy Windows based PC. The problem is that one of my three iPods seized up on my work laptop and the others did it on my home PC. The final clincher was when the third one seized up and I read on the Apple website similar problems from other users. I believe Apple turned out this product too soon and either there are a high percentage that are very defective or there is an inherant design flaw in the system. I love my 60 GB iPod but it is nearly full and it has never had a problem. I will probably wait for 6 to 8 months and give Apple the chance to fix the problem before trying again. I recommend if you have problems demanding a refund from Apple and returning their poorly designed product to force them to address the issues.

<Title>Apple 160 it is big on size but not on performance
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like many others decided that I wanted to get the 160 because I had filled up the 60 I had and wanted the convenience of being able to have all of my music in one place. I like the size of the 160 but it is very slow to get started and especially slow on transition between menus.  If I had a chance to do it again, I think I would have stuck with the 60 and the inconvenience of choosing songs to put on it rather than deal with the slow 160 just my opinion.

<Title>Needs Work
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am normally not an ipod basher.  I upgraded to this model from my 5G 60gb because I needed more space in my portable music player for all my media.  However, the ipod's laggy menus, spinning hard drive that eats up battery juice at a moment's notice, the fact that the cover flow is annoyingly moody all contribute to a not so good device.  Also, the sound quality has decreased dramatically.  Hopefully a firmware update can help out.  Maybe I just need a new sound system in my car.  All my previous ipods have been "get up and go", but this one I constantly have to stop and make sure the hard drive's stopped spinning, the music is definitely off, etc.  Annoying for someone like me who is always on the go.  Also disappointed that my car chargers are no longer working on my ipod. I knew Apple stopped 3rd party devices so they could make more money, but this is ridiculous.  This combined with the quick eating of the battery due to the spinning hard drive and the classic will not be traveling on any of my road trips.   This ipod might end up going back, but I will continue to give it more chances.  We need the newest update to 1.0.3.  Hopefully Apple will have learned from their horrendous mistakes.

<Title>Ease of use has never been better
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was resisting myself in buying an Ipod for years. I was always having a PDA phone which I thought could do everything, why would I need an Ipod if I have an MP3 player in the same device which works as a small computer, and a phone. Then I needed an external storage, and I decided what the heck, if I buy a 160 GB which works as a USB storage, and in the same time an IPOD. Waiting to receive the Ipod, I installed Itunes 7. The Ipod arrived finally, I got it out of the box, and WOW, it looked sleek, and neat. Worked out of the box. It cam with a USB connection and small headphone. I connected it to the PC and it started synchronized the library. When I started using the itunes, I understood what Steve jobs meant by his words"the ipod is all about software" The itunes SW is really powerful. It arranged all of my music collection with the smart playlists in a wonderful way. I tried to navigate through the menus, failed for a while, then I discovered the secret ! the navigation wheel which is just a touch pad like what's available in most noteboks. I know that this review might sound as if someone from the stone age is writing it, but hey, this is my first Ipod, and I never had a mac pc. I started synchronizing 7 years of digital imaging. The SW is really powerful. The IPOD shows 32 thumbnails per screen, while scrolling with the touchpad. No need to arrange photos, as it sorts them by the date of photo, and folder.Really powerful Then I started transferring the documents from my pc's and notebook for backup. Works very fast. The device seemed a little bit fragile, but fortunately, I bought from Amazon a leather bag which came with a screen protector, and a belt clip. I bought also an AV cable which plugs into the headphone jack, and connects to any TV where it can display the vidoes and photos.   Pros, 1- Huge storage 2- Easy to use Software, and really powerful 3- Battery charges fast, and lasts for 40 hours ! 4- Fast performance, stable OS  cons 1- little bit bulky, and seems fragile 2- Does not come with an AV out cable 3- Internal speakers do not work for stored contents, only clicks and beeps. Alarms are useless. 4- File and folder security are not available on the device, just a pin for operating the whole device. 5- Itunes is not available in all countries to purchase content 6- Not all formats can be converted, however, I use total video converter to do conversion, faster and better.

I have determined that this is probaby not the player as it happens to me only with one movie I have downloaded. All my TV shows appear fine on the IPOD 160 GB and other movies appear fine. I have not had any other player from Apple to judge against, but I am a little slow to figure out how to manipulate the scroll wheel and features. I wish ITunes had a broader movie selection, but I can watch tons of TV shows so I am happy. It is so much nicer to travel with a small, compact IPOD rather than large books, portable DVD player, or laptop for entertainment.

There was no way to reset the Ipod manually and it was not recognize through the USB cable neither through Itunes. After rebooting itself for 10 minutes, it just started working properly and it was recognized through Itunes. I had it to restore it 5 times and it took me 2 software updates to solve this problem.

<Content>Actually 3 1/2 stars. This review will deal only with music as that is my sole use. I bought the 60gb 4th g(?) ipod just before the 80 came out (my loss) Love it. I travel 4-5 times a year to Asia and bring it to work all the time I use it with Bose Headphones and Logitech mm50. I have never experienced a problem and the battery is still fine. My music listening is a little different than most. I have my library lined up artists/albums chronilogicaly. I can leave Bejing and press Frank Zappa and still be listening to him in order when I land in SFO. Now the new Ipod. No doubt about it the size is great but I've noticed a couple small glitches that weren't in my 60. 1) It freezes up in the middle of an album. The other day at work I was listening to George Clinton Live and it got to the end of track 4 and just stopped I had to reboot it to get going 2)It skips in the middle of a song (and not necessarily a long one) 3) The Itunes library for some reason put a at the end . For me this is important since to line up albums in order you have to preface them with a #1 b#2 c#3 and so on so now I have to go back in and reorder the album a pain. And while I haven't given it a real a/b test is what is being said about audio quality is true you can drop a star More later

<Content>I have not owned an Ipod before and was excited to get my 160GB Ipod Classic.  I quickly was surprised to find out that you can't manage playlists or delete files using the Ipod alone.  If you have a lot of music you have to sit in front of your computer to do those things.  I am fairly happy with the sound as I haven't been using it yet with my stereo but I was planning to.  Now I understand I am probably going to be dissapointed when I get around to connecting it to my stereo based on other reviews.  Now I bought a bunch of accesories to utilize the video out.  I didn't realize Apple has dissabled this feature unless you purchase Ipod authorized accesories.  I am very loyal if treated right but now I will probably never buy an Apple product again.  Check out your options before buying from Apple.    Years ago they made these same mistakes with the Apple computers when and the PC trounced them because it was an open format, not because they were better computers.  I can only hope Apple falls on their face again.

<Title>Who ate all the pies?
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say I was a little concerned when I ordered the 160gb Ipod Classic.  Reading the reviews the classic seemed to be suffering a variety of problems ranging from from being slower than a speeding snail to the battery draining faster than George Bush can start a war. Fortunately my Ipod has shown none of these tendencies.  I have noticed some slowness sometimes in accessing the menus but it is not consistent.  I have now loaded most of my 400 odd compact discs and have used less than a quarter of it's capacity.  Where I have noticed some differences from the 5th generation 30gb Ipod I  replaced is in the sound quality. I use V-Moda earbuds with both Ipods and the 5th generation had much more punch and more control than the classic. I would suspect that the power configuration has been altered in the classic to provide the 40 hour battery life which has robbed the unit of some of its control of the speakers at the sharp end of the earbuds.  I cannot actually comment on whether this Ipod delivers the claimed 40 hour battery life (audio) as I have not had the battery fail on me. What I can say is that I took the Ipod to England and used it fairly heavily over 18 hours and according the pictogram used less than 25% of the charge.  Of course we have the new Coverflow system" which looks very nice but is fatally flawed. I tend to listen to a variety of music, most of which is older and a little more obscure. Often Itunes cannot find the album artwork for the albums I have loaded which leaves big gaps in the parade of album covers. How bad is this? I recently loaded 5 Ac-Dc albums and Itunes couldn't find covers for any of them! I cannot believe that "Back in Black" could be considered "obscure." So while I can understand not finding a cover for "Ashton/Lord - The First of the Big Bands," not finding "The Eagles - Hotel California" is reprehensible!  No doubt Apple will offer an excuse about licensing etc. but if they are going to use "Coverflow" as a feature then most would expect them to have their "ducks in a row."  Apart from the difference in sound quality (hey it's an Mp3 player.... right?) and the flaws in the "Coverflow system" the Ipod Classic has generally been what I expected, except for one thing.....   Apple boasted that this unit was thinner so I have to ask; than what?  The Ipod Classic is at least twice as thick as my 5th generation which has resulted in me having to discard my Belkin car charger and F.M. transmitter. The Ipod will no longer fit in the cradle, it is just too fat! At first I thought; "No problem, I'll just replace it" except..... I can't.  A quick call to my local Apple store quickly established that there is no immediate replacement for the Belkin (or any other manufacture.) Nice planning Apple!  Overall, despite these niggles I am very happy with the 160gb Ipod Classic. It does what I need it to do.

<Title>Apple MUST fix the sub-par sound quality!
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Wanting a player with gobs of storage, I bought this (1st iPod). I've been reluctant to get one after hearing about the short-lived battery life. When I learned that that had been addressed, I went ahead and made the purchase. The player has some stability issues (menus don't always load quickly, it froze on me within an hour of first using it). When the screen isn't lit up, it is quite dark and almost impossible to read in low light. But the main problem I have with this player is the sound quality. I haven't heard previous iPods to compare it to, but my previous player (a Sony NW-HD5) was absolutely SUPERIOR to this. The presets just don't quite cut it on the iPod. The best one is probably "Electronic" - although if treble settings could be raised on that, it would be a huge improvement. Apple needs to FIX this by working a customized equalizer with individual settings! As it is, the quality just isn't very good. Video quality is good - many of the vid podcasts I've viewed look just fine. Cover flow is a pretty cool feature, but it does take a few seconds for them to load; many albums I've transferred will not post any album artwork, which may be available only if they happen to be available through iTunes for sale (none of my Beatles albums artwork appears). FIX THE SOUND QUALITY, APPLE!

<Title>Not Perfect, But Pretty Darned Good
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I traded up from my 2-year old iPod Photo 60GB model to the 160GB "Classic." The new one is even thinner than the old one, though slightly wider, and has a larger and sharper screen.  I got the black one and it is, quite simply, elegant! The interface is perhaps the biggest selling point, though: Apple just makes it simple.  I plugged in the dock, dropped in the new iPod and bingo! it started the process of syncing up with my "old" music library.  Since I had just over 50GB of music, it took a couple of hours to transfer everything onto the Classic.  Now, I wish there was an easier way to find what you want faster...as I add more and more music this will become more and more of a problem.  Still, I dumped another MP3 player to get my original iPod because, although the other, Korean-made player had far more features, its user interface was far more complex than the iPod's and thus it was much more of a chore to use.  Apple keeps improving these puppies by shrinking them and yet giving you more storage capacity; next, I hope they focus on make usability improvements.  If they do that, we should end up with the perfect personal music player!

<Title>Q: Bigger hard drive, but at what cost?  A: No ipod camera connector
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'd only get this if you must have 160gb. This has several disadvantages when compared to the earlier 5.5 gen ipod: The ipod camera connector is not compatible. Navigation is slow and clunky, even when not using cover flow. Makes the click wheel feel unresponsive.  I'm using version 1.0.2 of the firmware

<Title>iPod Classic Skips
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>All iPod Classics Skip  I have two iPods: * The iPod Classic Model A1238 - MB150LL, Firmware V1.0.2 PC, 6th generation and  * The older iPod 80G Model A1136 - MA450LL, Firmware V1.2.1, , 5th generation (the one with the glossy front face).    The new iPod Classic skips when playing WAV and other lossless file formats loaded via iTunes...but its predecessor does not.    I synced about 20G of the exact same lossless and MP3 music on both iPods (5G & 6G).    The older 80G iPod does not skip.   The iPod Classic 160G skips on all of the songs...  It skips on every song in exactly the same place every time I play the song.  By skipping, I mean, the song plays and then suddenly stops and the iPod goes on to the next song.    In iTunes, I can select the song in the iPod Classic library and it plays through the whole song on the PC.    I finally took the iPod classic back to Apple and they gave me a new one.  The replacement iPod Classic does exactly the same thing.  The songs skip in exactly the same place they did on the one I took back.    I've read on a bunch of web sites where a lot of other people have been having the same problem.  Technically it could be a parity problem, a certain bit configuration or something to do with the gapless feature of the iPod.    Apple suggested that I can fix the problem by take the original CD and rip it using iTunes and then syncing the iPod.  But if the CD has a tiny bad spot in it, the song will still skip.   Apple's stated solution for the skipping problem is to run (sync) the song through the MP3 compression using iTunes.    But, the reason for the 160G was to be able to load and play lossless files.    This has been a challenge since I bought the iPod Classic.  There are a bunch of us waiting for these problems with the iPod Classic to be fixed.    If you are considering purchasing an iPod for this purpose, save your money.   Apple has in essence said they have no intention of fixing this problem.

<Title>Objective review from a non apple fan
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, I have to say that I'm not an apple fan. In fact, while most of my programmer and designer friends and professors are picking up their fav. apple gadget, I was still faithful to my zen player and blackberry curve(no iphone for me). Although I've been using many apple products for years(design/programming labs, using/fixing up my friends mbp, etc), this is the first apple product that I actually OWN.   I was surprised that I actually love this ipod. Size is my first priority. I have a huge collection of podcast, video, and music and have to store it in a movable storage and at the same time use in on the go. My 12" ultraportable can't keep up running around with me and storing in the ever growing collection and I have to get another solution. I have zen player for the past 2 years and it doesn't have enough space. After debating between this and ipod touch with its wifi capability, I decided this is the best deal.   There is nothing fancy in the box and no sleeves like the prev. generation. But I'm getting a case anyway. After few days of use there are certain things I noticed:  1. the back metal enclosure is very easily scratched. No matter how you tried to protect it , like putting it down on a soft fabric while waiting for your case to arrive, it will get fine scratches. you can't tell it at first, but look long enough under bright lights. between your prints (yes you will have your prints all over the metallic back, it doesn't look good), you will see fine lines.  2. ITunes is not the best software out there. The interface is very unintuitive. For example, it won't automatically recognize the song I have so I have to manually move them to itunes. Podcast download is horrible. When you click "get tracks" that means you won't be subscribed, but when you click "subscribed" you won't get all of the tracks. so it's double work. you have to click subscribe on the itunes store, then go back to your podcast and click get all tracks. once you are downloading your tracks, you can't just pause it, close itunes, and expect you can resume your downloads later (and mind you about the size of a video downloads). Podcasts downloads (but not subscription)will go under music not podcast if you only download the tracks without subscribing (which is a big problem in you download your university courses, the ITunesU). you have to subscribe for it to show in the podcast section. This cause confusion when you sync it with the ipod. you have to go through music playlist,not podcast to listen to your PODCAST.  3. must buy wall charger separately. I guess everyone can deal with this since the battery is pretty decent.  4. awful earphone. get a cheap earphone to replace apple earphone. I got a cheap sony sport earphone and it sounds much better. soon I'll get shure's noise canceling earphone.   5. just good enough music quality. solution? look at number 4.   6. Intuitive player interface. I must say this is one of the best player interface I've seen yet.   7. totally superficial side: no matching connector and apple earphone. I was expecting to get black apple earphone and black connector (now I realize it's an empty hope).   8. thin body for the storage size.  bottom line:  I would buy this again anytime. this is a good player for the price. it isn't that expensive either.

<Title>Great storage space
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I was waiting for a long time for Apple to design a product with enough storage space for my entire music collection. This is my first Ipod and third MP3 player.  I'm very happy with the storage capacity because I could load all my music plus all my data, using the "Use as hard drive" feature.  I already said it's my first Ipod, so I wasn't used to the operating system and commands.  About it I can say it's very easy to use and I learned it quickly.  The only downside to this equipment is that, now that all my music is loaded, sometimes it's a little difficult to find a specific song.  I have to say that I haven't finished updating all the tags of my music collection (Title, Artist, Genre, etc.), so this can be contributing a little to the search process, but even if I had all my collection updated, the clickwheel by itself isn't handy enough to help me find a specific song. I think Apple should think about updating the clickwheel with a different tool to navigate. Some people may say, the Ipod touch has the solution..., but it doesn't have enough storage to me.  So, summarizing, I'm happy with my Ipod.

<Title>Great Storage Capacity
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine about a month ago and I can not complaint. The only thing I do not like so far is how fast the battery is spent when watching videos. The great thing about the 160 G model is how much you can add there and still the free space is great. I already have 7 movies, 8.000 songs and something close to 150 music videos and still I have 106 gigas of free space. The only reason why I do not have more media storaged in the IPod is because I need to buy an external drive to back up everything before I run out of space on my Laptop. Cover flow is great , games are great, including Phase and also the quality of the videos are stunning if you buy the proper software to create your I pod videos. Regarding I tunes, I siwh they had a bigger library of music videos. I guess sometime soon there will be more TV shows episodes, movies and music videos available on the store.
