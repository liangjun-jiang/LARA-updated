<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product worked well for 5 workouts.  Then the buttons stopped working.  New batteries didn't help. Still, it was cheap and I understand the whole MP3 thing now.  I'll buy something better next.

<Title>perfect for what i wanted
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is the perfect product for what i needed. i wanted an inexpensive "i-pod" for my younger children ages 10, 8, and 7. they liked listening the the older kids music, but aren't responsible enough to keep up as well with something so small.  this holds plenty songs, easy to put music on, and simple to use.

<Title>Don't buy this!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased 5 of these as gifts for my family members for Christmas. I spent a great deal of time trying to download songs on them. There were no detailed instructions in the package explaining the download. I had to contact the company for instructions and when they were followed I still could not download songs on them. I own an IPod and a Dell MP3. I had no problems with them at all. Also, when I tried to return the product to the company I purchased them from, I had to get an RA number before returning them. I called the company several times before I actually got a person to get an RA number from.

<Title>Proper instructions would have been nice
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item had a very good price and my expectations were based on what information I read about it, but on receiving the item and attempting to use it, I found the instructions were not at all helpful.  I was unable to make it work.  So it sits in a drawer for now.  I feel my money was wasted on this item..not because the item was not a good piece of technology, but because I did not recieve instructions on it's use that made sense.

<Title>nice basic MP3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While overall I think this is a great MP3 player for its price, I'm giving it only three stars because of these two complaints:  1. The included neck strap speakers are crap.  At first I thought the player itself was outputting a lousy signal, but then I tried it with the headphones I use with my computer and it sounded just fine.  Just throw away the included ear buds.  If you don't already have a set of headphones, you'll need to get some to use with this player if you ever want to play music on it.  Factor that into the cost.  2. The volume control buttons are reversed.  The button on the left increases volume while the one on the right decreases it.  This takes some time to get used to.  On the plus side, interfacing it with my computer couldn't have been easier.  It's a standard USB mass storage device, so it will work with most systems even without the driver disc.  It's USB 2.0, so file transfers are quick if your computer also has USB 2.0.  While you can plug the device directly into a USB port, it also includes an extension cable.  There is no LCD display, but I consider this a plus since it would just cut down the battery life for this simple player.  Get this player if you're on a budget and all you need is a basic portable MP3 player that can hold a few hours of music.  It's perfect for taking walks in the park.

<Title>good MP3 player  for the kids
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It has a decent memory, is not difficult to figure out and fairly small in size.  You also don't have to worry about losing it because a new one definitely won't break the bank.  The ear buds are all but useless, but there are hundreds of aftermarket buds that are likewise rather inexpensive and far better.  I bought 3 for my kids aged 6, 6, and 4.  They love them and have no problem using them.

<Title>Great little gizmo
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 7 of these to give as gifts for the male coworkers of my husband.  I always have a harder time choosing gifts for young men than I do for women.  Anyways, they were thrilled with this item (beats a crappy coffee mug anyday!).  I ordered one too many and thus it went to my daughter...so I got to use it, too. I liked it so much I am here to buy 2 more for myself and my son. I agree that the instructions are pretty much useless.  I just plugged it in an pasted mp3 files into it from my files in windows explorer. Windows recognized it right away and automatically installed it (there is also a cd for drivers on win 98).  No biggie.  I am certainly not whatcha call a techie.  I guess if you have no program at all to change .wav files from your cds into mp3s then you would have a problem, but you can get these free shareware type programs on the internet.  I did notice it "skipped" a tiny bit here and there.  I am not sure if that was from my files, from the flash based media, or this player in particular.    It is about 3 inches long and one inch wide.  It is a little thick for only 128 mb, but that is likely because of the battery compartment (it takes one AAA) The big button on the front of the thing is fake, it doesn't do anything.  The 3 "real" buttons are on top.  The first is a step back/volume up button, second is a step forward/volume down button, and the third is a pause/stop button.  Click the button to do the first thing (e.g., step back, step forward, pause) and push and hold the button to do the other function. Hold the stop button to turn it off. It plugs directly into your usb port.  They also include a wire, too if you want, and some little in-your-ear earphones.  That's it.    No, it doesn't display titles/artists, have any bass/treble stuff, bookmarks, etc.  I realize it only holds about 30 songs, but it is cheap and simple.  We old people used to make cassette tapes of our favorite songs so we could take them on the fly. This is the same sort of thing.  It is simple to plug in and put on a few songs for the car ride to work (you'll of course need some device to plug it into your car..corded cassette, fm transmitter, you know the items) or for a workout, walk, take to the beach, or keep your kids occupied for a little while.  Simple to change songs when you want..it is just like putting them in a file on your computer.  Then if you drop it in the ocean or your kid drops it in his milkshake or whatever, you wont go crazy that they ruined it.  I don't even like carrying my ipod too many places, scared I might drop it or get sand in it. The battery is a regular old battery, no waiting for recharges.  This is no 300 dollar item, but it is a great little take along you won't be afraid to actually bang around.

<Title>Used at the Gym
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to use at the gym.  I'm glad I bought it.  The most important thing is to use good headphones.  I used it with some cheap headphones at first and it was nails on a chalkboard, then I plugged in my Audio Technica ATH-M30's into it and it was a completely different story.  If you put songs on it for the gym and can hit play and just let them go this player will work well for you.  If you need to adjust the volume or change the song every 4 minutes this probably isn't the best thing to get.  Overall I think it's a really good value.

<Title>So Far, So Good
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 1st MP3 player. It was the cheapest one with the best ratings I could find. I didn't want to pay for features I didn't need. I had an initial problem getting it to work...turned out to be my mistake...I hadn't noticed that the battery came in a shrink-wrapped sleeve that had to removed(duh). But after that, it was fine. I use it primarily for quick&easy data file transfer between our two PC's, but the sound is fine through my Etymotic head phones for music, too. It did freeze up once (couldn't get the buttons to respond). I removed the battery, put it right back and then everything worked fine again. If not for that, I would have given it 5 stars. I'm a little nervous about the few reviewers who say the thing broke down quickly, but if this thing lasts a year, it will be worth it.

<Title>Totally Fair for the Price
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine over a year ago.  I've changed out the music three times, run through several battery changes and even dropped it once. It still works perfectly.  I did throw away the really crappy earphones that come with it, replaced them with a better quality set, about $20, which I can always use in other ways if this gadget finally does die.  The buttons all work, just the basic stuff: skip forward, skip back, +vol, -vol and off. What else do I really need? The sound is fine, too. Like someone else, I took away one star for a temporary freeze-up, but like him, it started up again just fine with a battery change.  (Strange, though, because the first battery was new, and had plenty of juice.) Overall it sounds like they have some quality control issues, as a lot of people are getting units that just plain don't work, BUT if you dodge that bullet, you get a very decent little mp3 player for an amazingly good price.

<Content>I bought two of these and never could get music downloaded to them.  The directions were incomplete and the company was of no help.  They would not answer questions except by sending e-mail instructions that never worked.  One of their employees told us our problems were because this was a "low end" product.  Low end or not, I espect it to work.  I have two disappointed grandchildren and these are going back immediately.

<Title>Adequate MP3 Player perfect for young kid
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player for my 7 year old because I wanted a player that didn't cost too much so I wouldn't feel too bad about if/when it got lost or broken. As 7 year olds aren't the best at taking care of things.   One caveat is that many songs off newer cd's or purchased online are in the mp4 format. This player won't play them unless they are converted to the MP3 format. However, Apples iTunes can convert them to MP3, but if you use a different software on your computer you should make sure it can do this.   The player holds about 30 songs, which is fine for a young child's attention span but if I were buying this for an adult or teen I would buy a larger capacity (&lt;512mb) player.  It doesn't have the "coolness" of an ipod but it's a third of the price, so it's a good value for what I wanted.

<Title>Easy to use but cord a little short
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Actually this is the first MP3 player I have owned and it seems to work fairly well. I download music from my laptop to the drive and saved about 30 songs and it still hasn't used up all the memory. I mainly will be using it during workouts since the music at the local gym is terrible. Probably the only real negative about it is the earpieces it comes with do not seem to be all that comfortable and the length of the cord could stand to be a little longer. I will probably end up buying some other ear pieces. It also works well in the car with a cassette adapter.

<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is small and quite cheap. It was exactly what I needed for my gym work outs. I can afford to break or lose this one. Transferring songs are simple- click, drag, and drop- with Windows Media Player.A few bad things about it: 1)there is no display screen to tell you which song is playing and 2) if you want to increase/decrease the volume you have to hold one of two buttons a few seconds longer or else you'll skip or go back to another song. Other than that, this MP3 is good for what it's worth.

<Title>Surprisingly good... I.E. don't expect much and you will be surprised...
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a good basic player. It's strengths are in it's simplicity, it's price, and the fact that it uses a single "AAA" battery.  I have some strange requirements. I wanted to use this for work, and it can't have a voice-recorder and it can't take so long to download songs that I have to spend more than a minute to try figure out what songs I want to listen to. With this thing, you don't have a voice recorder. Also, the 128 MB of memory ensures a fast and speedy decision-making process of which songs you want to listen to. The other benefit of 128MB is that the download is super-fast. Finally, I wanted one without a display so that it wouldn't distract me. How good can a display be in a $20 mp3 player? Keeping in line with the simple-is-beautiful concept, I opted not for a display.  I find the controls fairly easy to use. You have to press the fast-forward control for a second to increase the volume and the fast-reverse control for a second to decrease the volume. The player sounds good to me. Of course, I am using Sony headphones and admittedly I am not the best at distinguishing sound quality. However, I did notice that when I change the volume, an artifact is introduced into the song.   If I were really particular, I wouldn't waste my time and go with the iPod Shuffle - it is much prettier. The only thing that really held me back from getting the Shuffle was the fact that it took such a weird, proprietary battery and also the fact that the Shuffle can hold 512 MB of memory. As far as style though, the Shuffle beats the Coby hands down.  Whatever player you decide on, make sure to keep the volume at a low-enough volume... you can't feel hearing loss and once it is gone, it is gone forever.

<Title>This is crap
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The whole epitaph "you get what you pay for" really applies to this piece of junk "MP3 player".  I loaded the music on it just fine - my computer had no problem finding it, etc; but the first time I tried to use it, I couldn't get the stupid thing to turn on for about 10 mins, and when I finally got that to happen, I couldn't turn it off!  I had to remove the batteries to turn it off.  The buttons only worked that one time too -- I can't get any of the buttons to work anymore, and it won't turn on at all.  I switched out the batteries a few times, read the instructions, all that good stuff, but it's just crap.  Don't buy this one -- unfortunately, the "cheap" MP3 players these days are pretty "cheap" in quality too.

<Date>Wed Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This isn't my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick, cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don't underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can't tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.  An unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heart-attack. Its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway.   The best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3's and wma. It won't play AAC but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod.  This would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles.   I'm giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do without any hassle.

<Content>If you are a person who goes to the gym for an hour a day, then this is the MP3 player for you. Small, compact, very simple and easy to operate, and gets you around 2 hours of music so you can keep a beat while working up a sweat.   Advantages:  Small (size of a pen/flash drive)              Sound good, adequate volume              Cheap!!!! Got mine for under 15 bucks Disadvantages:  No song title/preview                 No Fast Forward                 Only plays MP3 format, some WMA files, not that bad if                     you are used to Ipod ownership (MP4 only)  You should not pay more than 15-20 bucks for this, and in some places, this comes with a small set of 2 watt stereo speakers for $20, awsome deal.  Get this use this, abuse it.  This is my second little unit I have bought, my wife stole my other one cause she likes it so much.  Good value

<Title>nice sound...nice size

<Content>I was pleasantly surprised by the sound which was pretty good. The sound was almost exactly like my laptop and was clear and crisp. For the most part it is a good deal although the headphones are pretty ''different'' allowing the mp3 player do disconnect from the headphones. Its a poor design so be ready with new headphones.

<Title>NOT FOR MAC USERS!!!
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you have a mac computer.  It says it is compatible, but it's NOT.  I tried 3 different ways to load music on this item and it would take maybe 3 out of 25.  I called Coby and they told me to download in one format, change songs to another format, it was way to much work to try to figure out for a 20.00 item.  SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND JUST SPEND THE EXTRA $ FOR AN IPOD SHUFFLE!!

<Title>Good for audio books, radio plays
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>One of the other reviewers had noted that this player will start back up right where you stopped it.  So I bought it, since other players will back up to the beginning of the track, which is useless for an audio book, unless you enjoy hearing the beginning of a chapter again.  Instructions are vague, only 3 buttons to work with. So you'll have to experiment to learn it.   1.  Hit the play/pause/stop (pps) button TWICE to start. 2. Hold the pps button for 3 seconds to stop. 3. Hold the volume/skip track buttons to change volume. 4. Hit the buttons to skip tracks.  I wish it had a display, that's why only 4 stars.  No EQ, so I wouldn't recommend for audiophiles.  But great for audio books.    Oh, Coby also includes a CD rom for the driver, so you can use this with Windows 98.
