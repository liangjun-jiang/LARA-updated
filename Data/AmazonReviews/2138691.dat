<Title>not worth the money
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>it holds a lot of information/books etc, and therefore makes a great reference if you are a professional, travel, etc.  Also, it is quite good at finding access to the internet.  Unfortunately, I didn't heed the warnings of others.  It's hard drive has broken after 6 months of use.  Now its a great paper weight!

<Title>great little machine
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have heard a lot about these things freezing up and dying, but thats only because something was installed wrong on it.  i have had mine for 3 years now, and it only died once, because i downloaded free solitaire games off the internet.  i reset it, and it works fine.  so convenient to be able to edit all of my microsoft office applications on the go.  i went to hawaii and took this with me, and was able to use the moblie manager feature to upload my digital cameras sd card onto it, so i could continue to take pictures.  the mp3 player has always worked perfectly for me.  the interent applications are fantastic.

<Title>Died and will not reset
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After a year, the Lifedrive froze while starting up.  I tried resetting, including several hard resets, which the unit would never complete.  A call to Palm Tech Support did no good - they want me to send it back for repair (at my own expense, since it's past the warranty period).

<Title>Mine also died and will not reset
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Lifedrive died after a year and will not reset.  I've tried the soft reset, hard reset and hard reset with the Lifedrive charging in its cradle.  Palm support is non-existent.  They gave a lame suggestion (the hard reset in the cradle) when I first contacted them and now they have not responded to my follow up message.  In addition the form on their website to request support has stopped working.  I have to say the address book was really handy and it was useful to be able to read e-books on the PDA.  However, I can't possibly recommend getting a Lifedrive because of the poor support and the danger of losing important data which cannot readily be transferred to a non-Palm PDA even if you have been doing regular synchronizations with a desktop computer.

<Title>Great product.  About robust as a 3 week old apple !
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Loved everything about this product, until I paid out my cash for it.  After only using it for a few weeks it must have took some sort of knock in my coat pocket (yeah, yeah, my own fault, yada, yada).  It's not like I was rough with it or anything but the device developed the "Click of death".  So it is no longer "bootable".  To be honest if the fundamental drive aspect of this device is that it is so vulnerable to shocks then I see no reason to trust my "Life" to it.  Yet another gadget in the Gadget Drawer Of History.

<Title>Skip this one...buy Palm TX instead
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I gave the LifeDrive a chance for a year.   It was my 2nd Palm device.   The old Tungsten E was more reliable.  Even though the Tungsten E would lose data once the battery drain, I knew how to work around it...use backup software and charge it every other day.  Once I knew how to work around the Tungten E's quirks then it became a reliable hardware for me.  I do not know how to work around LifeDrive's quirks.  The LifeDrive worked most of the time, but you always had a sense that it may not work one day and you are not clear how to fix it or prevent some issues from happening again.   Sometimes it would not come on even though the day before it was fully charged.   I had to charge it again for some reason.   My current problem is that when I turn it on I can only see my contacts and the WiFi screen seems to be in loop (keeps flashing on and off).   It will not let me use any other applications.  I reset it and nothing has changed.  I should have went with the Palm TX instead.  Palm owes buyers an apology for creating such an expensive item that is not reliable.

<Title>skip it
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When it works, it works beautifully, unfortunately the older it gets the less it works, at least that's what happened to me.  Mine lasted one year.  It was incredibly buggy and crashed out frequently from day one  (preinstalled Versamail was the biggest culprit).  It takes about two to three minutes to reboot every time it crashes out on you, and after a while I just hoped that it would turn on after a crash.  I installed Iambic's Agendus, which I've used various versions of since my Newton and the Lifedrive didn't like it at all.  It crashed and rebooted left and right because of it.  The internet browser has a bug that doesn't allow you to download anything like patches.  You'll get an error message saying that your harddisk or card is full.  The last I heard the Lifedrive has been discontinued and there are no plans of a v.o 2.0.  Which is a shame really, as they had the makings of a nice piece of equipment had they worked on it a little more.

<Title>The first steps towards real convergence.
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Good or bad, this marks the beginning of the microDrive convergence into PDAs and cellphones.  Yes, South Korea, China, and Japan have had microDrive PDAs for awhile now, but this is the US debut of real storage, and a definitive shift away from HotSync to a more-generic external drive model.  Think about that for a moment.  Even Microsoft PowerPCs don't support a pure external drive model of synchronizing.  This allows you to just connect to a central data store (via Bluetooth, WiFi, or USB) and bring your MP3 files over.  Or Word documents.  Whatever.  It's not the data storage that's most impressive here, it's the final surrender of Palm's HotSync methodology.  That's the big news here.  Of course, this device represents a compelling upgrade for older PDA users.  Storage at near 4Gb means the iPod mini or Zen Micro are less attractive electronics, by virtue of their single-function purpose.  The OS has been ramped up, and it still runs most of the legacy Palm apps (you will find that more and more apps are not migrating, though).  The extra treat of Bluetooth and WiFi radios means you can use a Bluetooth keyboard, connect to a BlueTooth cellphone, maybe stream music to your Bluetooth BMW.. or use WiFi to stream to a WiFi stereo system, receive that stream and playback, grab MP3s from your basement machine, and so forth.  I can see this being used as a web pad in most homes, allowing for some web browsing, some MP3 playback, and more importantly, remotely viewing another PC on a home network (maybe to shuffle music playback or check email).  Of course, having WiFi or Bluietooth in a PDA is not groundbreaking; having both isn't either, but it's impressive and long overdue.  The sum of features makes this a worthy addition if you're looking for a new PDA, or if you want something much more than an iPod mini or Creative Zen Micro.  However, if you hang on a few months, maybe to Q4 2005, Nokia will have a cellphone with a 4Gb (maybe 6Gb by that time) microDrive, and then the electronics landscape changes forever, because no one will want "just an MP3 player" ever again (unless they really don't want a cellphone or handheld computer).

<Title>Wrong product..  wrong time.
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wrong product..  wrong time.  	Consumers of US have been offered new electronics products almost everyday. But how many times we look at them and say, "I want that!" PalmOne's LifeDrive is not going to make you say that, either.  Major features of the product: * Palm OS 5.4 * Intel Processor * 4G HD * Wi-Fi 802.11b * Bluetooth 1.1 * USB 2.0 * Big color display * Support for Microsoft Documents * Voice Recorder * Camera Companion Software * MP3 Player  This is not impressive.If PalmOne wants to be ahead of the curve, they should have added Wi-Fi 802.11g. Bluetooth and USB 2.0 are pretty much necessary and they are good there. 	 Lets do a quick comparison of this product,  PalmOne Treo 650: $400 (And lot cheaper with cell phone service annual contract) Features: Cell, PDA, Camera, MP3 Player, SpeakerPhone, Bluetooth, 23MB Nokia 6620: $350 (less than $100 with annual plan)  Features: Cell, PDA, Camera, MP3 Player, Speakerphone, Bluetooth 12MB  Why am I comparing with cell phones? Because we have to have one and what is missing in them is the big hard-drive. For that, I am not going to buy LifeDrive. I will rather just a get a USB drive/firewire drive for 50 bucks which I don't need to upgrade or something, or better yet, an iPod which is an excellent USB Hard-Drive (iPod Photo fo 30G $349) 	If PalmOne is thinking that this device is going to fill the gap between your office computer, home computer, camera, I think they are wrong. We need little more integration like combination of a Nokia Cell,  PDA, Apple MP3 player, small Sony camera, Big Hitachi Hard drive. And all of this still should be bigger than the Palm Treo.  Bottom Line: I wouldn't waste my money on this. I am sure something more worthwhile will come before end of this year.

<Title>On the mark
<Date>Thu May 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This PDA is exactly what the Tungsten T5 should have been (integrated Wi-Fi, voice recorder), and will probably drive the latter out of existence.  One cool feature that the other reviews haven't noted is that the LifeDrive can be used as a photo-dump, enabling direct transfer of data from a camera's SD card--something that the iPod Photo (unbelievably) can't do without additional hardware.  True the 4GB can't compare with dedicated photo-dumps (the Epson P-2000 has ten times the storage), but it's still more than enough for a photo-intense vacation.

<Title>An honest look at it all...
<Date>Mon May 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me preface this review by saying that I did in fact order mine - it should be arriving any day and I look forward to posting a very honest review of this palm handheld.    I just had to post this review to combat those many bad reviews on this item.  It technically is not available yet and will not be released until the 30th of May.  To all those WinCE users out there - stop complaining about items you don't even use!    Now I have a long history of having palm handhelds - from my first Palm V to my current Palm Tungsten T3, I have a good viewpoint on their company's evolution (albeit slow).  I recently left Palm for Sony's CLIE TH-55 which I thought was the best all-around PDA available at the time.  It had everything I could ever want, and more!  I decided to stick with Palm since Sony was leaving the market and purchased a Tungsten E which I was sorely dissapointed by.  Long gone was the metal for PDAs from this company, as seen by their recent trend with the Tungsten T5 (plastic, plastic), and their new E2 (plastic again).    I sold my Tungsten E and purchased a T3 the moment the T5 was available because that perhaps was one of the larger dissapointments in Palm's history.  Well, here were are with them satisfying our needs with 4 GB of storage space, Wi-fi, bluetooth, and USB 2.0 (yes, it has USB 2.0 unlike other's reviews).    So why did I order this item?  I plan to have it replace my USB flash drives, I look forward to checking my email wherever I am at work or in my house with the wireless networks.  Heck - even when I'm waiting for food at Starbucks or Panera I can leech onto their free Wi-fi.  Battery life?  I'm hoping its better than what I get with my current T3 - though nothing beats that Sony CLIE I had thus far in the battery life comparison.  I'll post an addendum to this review once I've used my new LifeDrive for a month or so.  Keep an eye open for my updates!

<Title>Good start, but not perfect yet.
<Date>Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Lifedrive one week ago to replace a sony Clie.  The following comments are based on one week experience. Pros: 1.  New lifedrive manager software which in most cases obviate the need for hotsync.  This is truly revolutionary. 2.  Larger hard drive.  Finally we are catching up with the rest of the world.  You may be able to replace your iPod mini with this more versatile handheld. 3.  Good voice recorder.  I just got back from a meeting and recorded one whole days worth of talks from the back of a room with 60 people and record quality was quite good and no software bugs were noticed.  In addition to the time allocated under your voice memo section, you can directly record to your hard drive allowing you to record more stuff. 4.  This machine can store an enormous number of powerpoint presentations.  This is a big plus for if you do any teaching e.g. quick review of a topic with a med student before a surgery. 5.  Nice metallic finish.  Looks better than cheap looking T5.  Cons: 1.  Poor battery life.  After a whole day of heavy use, the battery dies without warning. 2.  Repeated powering down of the hard drive causing a few second delay in opening new applications.  Annoying as hell!!! 3.  No way to customize turning off the screen after a short period of inactivity.  If you play chess on this machine, it becomes annoying.  By the way, Hiarcs chess engine runs quite well on this machine(Downloadable for 39.99). 4.  Adobe reader formats most documents well, but some with complex formatting turn into incomprehensible amorphous text. 5.  Price.  I don't understand why a piece of cheap looking electronics made in china should cost this much money. 6.  No integrated cell phone or camera. 7.  Some applications don't run on this device.  I signed up for audible.com membership to get a $100 rebate.  But so far I have been unable to make the audible manager recognize this device and download audiobooks to this device. 8.  It is very disappointing palm decided to put the cheaper and slower WiFi.  I suspect their next device will have the faster version. 9.  Size.  More bulky than other palm handhelds.  Not a true shirt pocket device. 10.  No headphone provided.  Why can't they throw in a $10 headphone for this $499 device.  I am using my old sony clie headphones which works fine.   Overall, 4 stars.  I am sure I will find a lot more annoying problems as I use it more.

<Title>Nice try, but...
<Date>Sun Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Palm is on the right track here with the LifeDrive, but they don't quite pull it off, and when you spend five hundred smackers, you want a convergence product that solves all of the little nagging issues.  Like an iPod mini, the LifeDrive has a 4GB hard drive, but attaches a fully-featured PDA to it that includes WiFi but no phone as yet (maybe in LifeDrive 2 or Treo 1000?). You can do all the classic Palm functions, plus for the first time decent video (other Palms just don't have enough memory).   The device has a beautiful, large enough screen, and finally somebody has figured out how to automatically download camera memory, turning the LifeDrive into an effective memory bank. (Too bad they figured this out AFTER flash memory prices cratered.)  But if you want real video or even significant photo storage, the 4GB just isn't enough. Battery life is weak, at under 10 hours. And the size is large, significantly bigger than an iPod maxi. Overall, it's not bad for a first try, like the original 5GB iPod. But before this becomes a killer, must-have device, Palm is going to have to:  1) Up the GB level.  2) Up the battery power (new batteries being developed by Toshiba hold much promise).  3) Upgrade the sleekness of the machine. 4) Improve the software package so it will better sync with your pics and movies. That is the beauty of iPod photo -- the syncing with iPhoto and iTunes is a joy, versus a cumbersome loading process. 5) Consider adding a wireless TV dock so that LifeDrive (or more likely, LifeDrive2) can double as a DVR. How cool would it be to be able to record the Sopranos, take it to a friend's house on your LifeDrive and play it? There are ways to do this now through your computer, but it's a bit cumbersome. 6) Cut the price so regular folks can afford it, not just doctors and lawyers and techno geeks looking for the latest toy.  Overall, first adopters will ignore the glitches and glow over the best attempt at a video/photo/PDA yet created, but savvy regular shoppers will wait a year for LifeDrive 2, or, more likely, for a video iPod, which could be headed your way by Christmas.

<Title>Very Glitchy
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I recieved this LifeDrive, the first thing it required me to do was to reset it. I did, reluctantly, and when it began to start up again, it would "No notice" reset itself again. I was forced to hard-reset it in order to begin using it. This happened to me many times, including when I was in a meeting. Now, it won't even boot up. However, when it was not glitching, I found it very satisfying. It had an endless supply of memory, and I could store whatever I wanted-even if it wasn't compatible with the Palm OS-via the "Life Drive Manager", or "Drive mode". The graphics were superb, but many times I was not able to experience it fully because of the noticable lag. Another thing I noticed was that soft resetting it took longer than a Windows machine to boot up. There are many superlatives about this product, but wait a while for the firmware to be upgraded, because the OS included with this program is very glitchy.

<Title>Nice first take
<Date>Wed Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the LifeDrive for a few weeks now and I absoulutely love it.  The complaints about load delays are way overblown.  It's not as snappy as the t5 but we are talking seconds here to swap between apps and as they get cached, there is no delay.    Pros Beautiful screen.  Not quite as bright as the 650 but much  brighter than the t3.  The color is better too.  Built in Wifi is easy to configure and along with the browser is very fast.  PocketTunes works really well as an mp3 player.  Much better than the Real one from the t3  Versamail is a good email app.  I do wish it would load office docs into docs to go though instead of using its viewer.  Drive mode makes it easy to walk up to any pc and transfer files at USB2 speeds.  Hardware button to toggle between landscape and portrait modes.  Battery life seems good.  It's not as good as a dedicated media player but this unit does a heck of a lot more.  I like the power slider where you can lock the unit to "Off".  i cant tell you how many times i've taken my t3 out of the bag and it was on.  Cons The mp3 player skips in the background when loading off the hard drive.  I hope that PalmOne can fix this with a patch.  The video player should play a wider variety of formats and palm should provide software to convert a DVD to mpeg at the lifedrive screen size.  I wish pocketTunes would play unproteted AAC files.  It's a nice codec and much leaner than mp3.  for ~500 they shoulkd have just put 64mb of NVRAM in the unit instead of reserving a portion of the hd for storage.  Would have made the battery last a lot longer.  There are a few minor warts but overall i'd say it's a terrific first attempt.  Five stars for breaking new ground with a convergent device and getting it mostly right.

<Content>This product is not at all what I had hoped for.  After using the Palm Tungsten T5 and being a loyal follower of all of the Palm line, I was excited to receive this product.  That excitement went south in a hurry.  Initially, the product is about half again as bulky as the Tungsten, but that wasn't a big deal.  The synchronization process was slower than the Tungsten's, but again I could deal with that.  The sticking point when the thing locked up 4 times in one morning.  After that I returned it immediately and bought a Palm Tungsten TX from another supplier.

<Content>I purchased a Life Drive just over a year ago.  Tried to hot sync when I got it home with no success.  Returned it to place of purchase, and they couldn't get it to hot sync either, so they replaced it.  Took it home and successfully hot synced the device.  Loaded contacts, calendar events, an Excel spreadsheet, and an outside software program that I had successfully used on my last handheld.  Within six months, the device was not hot syncing.  Device started freezing up, and having to be reset, then jumblimg information, ending in a complete lock-up of the device.  At this point, I can get to the home page, and nowhere else.  Doesn't bode well for me when I go onto the Palm website and no longer see the Life Drive available for purchase.

<Title>What happened to Palm?
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only reason I gave this product 3 stars is partly due to the fact that I paid only $250 for mine (which is a bargain compared to what I would have paid for a TX) and it "at least" does what it advertises it will do out of the box. Beyond that this LifeDrive is insanely unstable and will crash at least 3 times a day.  Flipping the device over will proudly reveal "made in China" stamped on the back and no offense to anyone reading this, but the performance of this device aptly shows it. The LifeDrive features are nice and I appreciate being able to carry a vast amount of media around with me and have the luxury of previewing it on my device. But I am offended that back in the day Palm charged $500+ for a buggy device like this. That isn't even considering the fact that there are many customer complaints stating that the device is lucky to last beyond a year's use. Using this device made me yearn for my Blackberry in that it has yet to crash given the tasks I throw at it. What happened Palm?

<Title>Palm Quality Control & Customer Service is below Sub Par
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>BUYER BEWARE!  Read the reviews before considering buying this.  The screws keep falling out on my palm pilot, and I've found that this is a problem that many people have had (just google "Palm Replacement Screws").  If you buy this, there's a good chance that you'll be the next person having the exact same issue - so be warned.  It may not seem serious, but screws coming out basically means your unit casing will come off and that leaves the memory and all the important things you write down in your schedule UNPROTECTED.     When I contacted them about the issue, I found out what the Palm company was really all about.  That is, getting your money and not looking back.  Instead of admitting that their is a serious design flaw with their product, and doing what they could to rememdy the situation....they figure this is another way they ought to try and add to their profit margin.  Not very smart.  I'm not even asking them to apologize for their imcompitant case designs (which would help them save face imho).  What really gets me is that theres enough people that have this problem for it to be clearly visible to the higher ups, and some executives at the company actually made the decision that they would trade 75 cents in screws for the loss of their company name.  And If the guys running the PALM company are idiots, then it's time to look elsewhere.  I can't believe they wouldn't just ship out replacements and try to fix the product designs.  But as I reseacrch the net to try and find some decent replacement screws for my own unit in the meantime, I just keep finding more and more stories of good people (who don't have problems with screws coming out of other small electronics btw) who are in the same pathetic PALM ownership boat as me.  Am I ever sorry I bought the unit.  Besides the screws, it has reset on me on a number of occasions and luckily I'm religious about backing up data.  Still, you lose some entries and its a major pain.  In fact, I did miss a meeting once because I missed  reentering it after the unit reset and lost data.  Well Palm won't be fattening their margins on me anymore, and I hope you heed the warning I give.  I am in the market for a new Handheld, but I'll NEVER allow myself to get swindled by them again.  They could've used the problem as an opportunity to show their customers that they do value us and score some points.  Unfortunately for them and for us customers, the cold response I've gotten from them tells me that they really could care less and do not have a long term outlook on what it means to sell a business product as important as a scheduling device.  It's best to stay away from them.  I'm through giving PALM any more business.  If you find a better company, please do share.

<Title>not worth it!
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product and quickly learned the reason as to why it's been discontinued. It is HORRIBLY slow. It freezes up when trying to simply search for wireless networks, or when switching between screens. Then I installed some medical programs on it and it was even slower. Finally I uploaded one photograph to it......ONE!! And the thing got stuck in a reset loop. It just kept resetting itself, and no matter what buttons i pushed or for how long it just kept turning on and off and on and off. When I taped it back up in the box to return, it was still resetting itself. I think the battery died not long after I shipped it back.

<Title>Fun and Frustration
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If, like me, you were looking to upgrade from an earlier palm device such as a Zire, then forget this unit as you will quickly become extremely frustrated.  The simplicity of a Palm device has been replaced with a daily process of slow performance, soft resets, hard resets, and eventual failure.  In the space of owning this for two weeks, I have had at least two crashes per day, and been forced to perform three hard resets. In each hard reset you lose everything that is on the hard drive. It is not simply a matter of hard reseting the memory, you get a complete erase. Why? Because some idiot at Palm decided it would be amusing to use the hard drive as active memory. This not only slows down the units XScale processor, but opens you up to a hard drive corruption everytime it crashes.  When the unit is working, it is fun to use. I liked the large hard drive and Wifi, but do not ever ever use it as your main storage solution for pictures from your camera because the unit is unreliable and if you cannot get it started, then you have lost everything on the drive, unless you pull the drive out and access it manually.  Mine died after two weeks and I am trying to return it for a refund. I'll wait for the next generation unit to be released.

<Title>Waiting for the LD2...
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really, REALLY, wanted to like and keep this PDA.   + great screen + bluetooth + lots of storage space + tablet-like form factor + leather case + voice recorder + headphone jack (a bit loose though) + palm OS with encryption for personal data  +/- included software are usable "lite" versions of originals +/- there is no cradle +/- "lag time" issue when accessing HD   - unit randomly resets itself - wi-fi and blazer set unit into a loop - alarm hangs sometimes - sometimes unit wont turn on without soft reset - sometimes unit wont turn off without soft reset - PalmOne customer support needs to be improved  I'm sure that there will be patches coming up and that most of the issues are software related. But for $499, why should the customer be the BETA tester? I like the LifeDrive, but feel that until the bugs are worked, it might be better to wait for an update or new model. (Remember the T, T2, and T3?)  UPDATE: I returned the unit and bought a TX instead. With a cheap 4GB sd card, the TX is everything the LD should have been (minus the voice recorder). With the money I saved, I was able to buy a nice metal case and still have change left over.

<Title>I have a love hate relationship with the Lifedrive
<Date>Thu Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>(Bear in mind that I'm writing this in June of 2005.  It's possible PalmOne will release software fixes for the Lifedrive that could take care of these issues.  I should note too that I'm on my second Lifedrive, and both have the same issues, so I'm fairly confident that these are issues with the unit in general, not specific to my unit.)  In many respects the Lifedrive is a great handheld.  Having 4GB of contiguous storage space available is wonderful.  The unit handles full screen video playback with ease, and browsing the web works as well as on any handheld available.  Palm's basic PIM (Personal Information Management) apps are wonderful-easy to use and powerful.  They finally got all the features right-built-in Wi-Fi, tons of storage space, a voice recorder, etc.  The unit's also great physically.  I thought it looked big from the pictures, but it doesn't seem large in real life, and it feels good to hold.  It's almost exactly the same size as the old Palm III or Visor Handspring series, which was a form factor I really loved.  The buttons and directional control are EXCELLENT.  Easily the best of any modern PDA.  On top of that is the great screen, which is large, high resolution, bright, and easy to read.  (It does have SOME "screen whine" that's present on most PalmOne units, but it's not as bad as many older units.)  Unfortunately I've had too many issues with the Lifedrive (and the Tungsten T5 prior to it's ROM update) to recommend it.  Documents to Go 7 included with the unit is buggy.  Installing the latest free update from DataViz doesn't fix all the issues.  Mainly, it frequently won't sync spreadsheets stored in Docs to Go format, as it thinks the file is still being edited when it isn't.  A temporary work around is to keep spreadsheets in Excel format on the Lifedrive.  From what I can gather from DataViz, there's some issue with both the Lifedrive and T5-possibly related to the fact that both the LD and T5 have extra storage permanently built-in that the PalmOS sees as a memory card.  (Around 160MB for the T5, and 3.7GB for the Lifedrive.)  They claim they're working on a fix.    There's a bug in the audio system.  Whenever a media file of any sort is playing and the audio portion gets quiet there's some nasty static.  It's not that the audio is covering up the static, it's only present when the audio gets quiet.  It also manifests itself between tracks in Pocket Tunes for the same reason.  The audio hardware is engaged, but there's nothing playing for a split second, so the Lifedrive fills the silence with weird static.  If PalmOne fixes this aspect of the LD, it'll be an exceptional media player.  (But use the excellent free TCPMP media player instead of the included "Media" app for video.)  I certainly prefer the flexibility of media formats and better controls to my iPod.  I've found a bug in the version of Palm Desktop that ships with the Lifedrive.  (The LD can sync with Outlook too, but I vastly prefer Palm Desktop for it's superior interface and ease of use).  If I edit or create a task that doesn't have a due date in Palm Desktop, when I finish editing it, the date gets set to "12/31/2031", which I have to manually change back to "No Date".   At least PalmOne did fix the "find" bug present in the T5 and E2 which prevented those units from returning more than 8 results in a system-wide search.  The LD frequently won't sync on my first press of the Hotsync button after connecting it to my computer.  It will try to connect, and time out.  A second press usually seems to work, but sometimes I have to unplug the USB cable from my computer before it will sync again.  I also bought a cradle for the LD, which I do recommend (the cradle that says it's for the T5 is the same as the newer cradle that specifically mentions the T5, E2, and Lifedrive).  The Lifedrive does have some "lag" compared with other PalmOS handhelds, but it's not really that bad.  Usually it adds less than 2 seconds to the load time of an app, if it hasn't been used recently and the hard drive is off (the hard drive takes about 1.8 seconds to start working when it's off). The real issue is just that there are so many weird bugs I've come across.  Just today I started getting a 15 second+ pause between loading many of my apps for no apparent reason.  Doing a soft reset (which preserves everything on the Lifedrive) fixed it, but I have no idea what caused it.  I've had tons of little things like that in the last three weeks, so I just can't recommend the unit.  Like the Tungsten T5, the Lifedrive's first button can only load the "home"/launcher/favorites application.  Thankfully that's easy to fix.  The free program "ButtonsEX" allows you to assign any program to the first button, making it just like the other three.  If PalmOne can fix the audio bug, and get the general wonkiness under control, the Lifedrive may be a wonderful unit.  As of June 2005 however, it's just too buggy to recommend.  It's a far cry from the "it just works" spirit of the PalmOS.

<Title>BAD, VERY BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT, REFURBISHING QUALITY
<Date>Mon Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my first PalmOne product. In three month Wireless chip gone dead and then my palm started to buzzing. Then I called them three times, and they gave me a service number and they told me to sent them. I paid the mail cost with insurance and sent them. In two and half weeks later I got the palm back. In the firts shot I saw that two keys, key 6 and key 7 were damaged. Moreover, LCD had scratch. It was not my new palm, it was the older one refurbished. I called them again. They offered me to give another service number. We started the process again... I am not using palm I am communicating them... Sometimes I thought I paid all money to talk them not to use a handheld in my daily activities. More important, they claimed that my palm has record sold in 2003. I registrered this Palm just on the purchase day March 26, 2005. Probably they have a record of new refurbished Palm and they are messing up.... They couldn't find my track in their database... So, is this good customer service??

<Title>Great idea, but . . . . 
<Date>Tue Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like many of the other reviewers, I found the LiveDrive not quite as perfect as it sounds.   I love that I can play videos, Audible books, and MP3s, and that it has a big screen for eReader and Mobipocket books plus lots of storage for office files.   Now for the bad news. The device ALWAYS freezes at the end of a hotsync. The FAQ on Palm's website recommends deleating all third-party software (the same third-party software that worked just fine on my Tungsten C!) and adding it back in one at a time until you find the one causing the problem. Did that. Still freezes, with or without the third-party software. I emailed customer support but never received a response, just an email asking if my problem had been solved. (If anyone at PalmOne is reading this, the answer is no.)    Also, my Mapopolis GPS runs sooooo slowly on the LifeDrive as to be useless. Again, it worked great on the Tungsten C.   Lesson learned: Always wait for the second generation. I can only hope that Palm will issue a software fix for all of these problems, soon. I plan of keeping the device, but will hang on to my old Palm to use as a GPS and backup for this one.

Then i found that windows dos not recognice the unit and now says that the internal disc of the Life Drive was reformatted and don't accept indormation. The product is so complicated to use. I erase the word to go function because when i wanted to see a document the Palm went off and reiniciates very slowly. Is there something i can do to reactivate the documents to go function?

<Title>ALMOST the best PDA ever
<Date>Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had been looking forward to buying the Lifedrive since it was reported as a rumor 6 months ago (or more).  It was basically a coin toss between a PSP and the LD. I really wanted a multimedia player and the PSP works very well as one. However, it doesn't have a hard drive, and stocking up on memory sticks would be inconvenient and expensive. Also, it only plays MPEG 4, while the LD plays pretty much anything.  The PSP is far cheaper, has wifi and a replaceable battery, but there's no browser (yet) and until the hackers get more into it, no useful 3rd party apps.  The LD, in theory, could be a mini laptop and ultimately it won.  But 24 hours after I bought it, I have decided to take it back.  The main reason: THE SCREEN. I am surprised I haven't heard more people talk about this, but it really, really sucks. Yes, it's bright and has wonderful resolution and graphics look great, but for video playback and pictures, it leaves much to be desired, mainly because of the poor viewing angle.  If you tilt the screen even a little, you begin to get the negative image/solarization that bad LCDs are infamous for. Ironically, the best viewing angle isn't even straight on - at least with my unit, I had to tilt it just a little off-axis to get the best possible image. The viewing angle uniformity is so bad, if you try closing one eye and then switch to the other, you'll see a slightly different picture (mainly in landscape mode, which is what anyone would use to watch a movie).  I wanted to love this device. Depite my other issues, if the screen had been better I'd probably keep it. This is really a shame, since LCD screens have made so much progress over the years, there doesn't seem to be a good reason why the LD doesn't have a better screen. I compared it with a PSP screen today and there is just no comparison - the PSP's screen is king - and Palm should realize that the PSP is more direct competition than they think.  Other than that, the LD does feel rather sluggish. The pauses loading apps, saving data and switching around aren't very long, but after a few minutes of use you really miss the snappy response of RAM-based PDAs. Palm made a big mistake by not having at least SOME memory built-in... caching would really improve performance.  Web browsing was very cool, but very, very slow. It took me HALF AN HOUR to sign in to a web site I routinely visit, read a few messages, look at some pics, then log onto AOL and send an email. Between the slowness of the connection, the time it takes to load web pages, the time it takes to just go 'back' and reload a previous page (hello, caching) and to actually type and email with a PDA, I could only see myself doing this in the future if there was absolutely no other way to get online.  Oh, and I crashed twice. Once using TCPMP, the other using the 'search' feature.  The LD is a great idea. It has all the right bits and the layout, even most of the excecution, is well thought-out. The sound over headphones was great and for non-video apps, the screen looks very nice. The speaker was better than expected and the unit is light and attractive.  However, a bad screen in a device that can play back video and store photos is a serious blunder. Not having even 16 megs of RAM for cache, especially when RAM is so damn cheap, is a major oversight, especially when it would have REALLY sped up performance.  It makes me sad to bring it back, because now I am back at square one - there is basically no device out there that does what I want well.  If the PSP had a hard drive and a browser, it would be perfect (and at $200, the LD wouldn't stand a chance).

<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Another beautiful example that Palm DOES NOT LISTEN to consumers. I have owned MANY palm units in my career. I have 2 needs that are paramount. 1.User changable batteries and a long battery life. 2.Flash memory that doesen't loose data. Palm has a WONDERFUL OS. Seeing patients all day and not being near a charger made me trash this. I would settle for a grayscale screen if I could change the batteries myself and have flash memory. Palm all but completely lost the medical community with its new units.   Bottom line: All the bells and whistles of this machine are worthless if the battery doesent last.

<Title>nice as "laptop lite"
<Date>Sat Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Most of the reviews seem to be from people very familiar with Palm or with using PDAs, so I figured a review from someone who hasn't had a PDA since 2001 (and that an HP Jornada) may be useful if readers are intrigued by the LifeDrive and, like me, are not sure that they really need (or want) to lug around a laptop and are looking into PDAs.  I've had this for about a month now and have been very happy with it. There have been reviewer complaints of a lag time between changing screens and yes, it happens--but I haven't found it distracting. The fact is the PDA waits far longer for us to input information than we do for a PDA to display it. I have also had occasional unexplained shut downs and restarts, but they have been infrequent.  When I got it I was expecting something the size and bulk of the Jornada, but was pleasantly surprised to find that even inside the aluminum hard case (which I recommend getting) it fit inside most of my shirt front pockets. I was also pleasantly surprised with the clarity of the screen and ease of reading; I've had no problem reading documents and pdfs on it on the train without eye strain or having to hunch over like I used to do with the Jornada. Usability of the various functions is great.  I've been trying the LifeDrive as a laptop replacement to write reports and access the Web and email while outside the office and so far it has worked pretty well in that capacity. I use the ThinkOutside Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard for typing and it's worked well and in many ways feels better than some of the ultraportable laptop keyboards I tested in stores. The two items together are much lighter than what a laptop would be and take up much less room. If mostly what you need a laptop for are Word, Excel or Powerpoint documents and not doing design (or watching DVDs, which is what I see most businesspeople with laptops doing on planes), this could substitute as long as you don't need a large screen.  Battery life is better than a laptop (but not all that much greater), and it is stupid LifeDrive isn't also a phone and camera, which is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. As someone coming back into using PDAs after a few years away, I'm very happy with it.

<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a Palm Tungsten T and it serves my PDA needs well.  I've been looking seriously at a Sony PSP.  What I really want is an updated Apple Newton, here is my recipe:  One Tapwave Zodiac (gaming but Palm compatability)  One Sony PSP (screen aspect ratio and quality, build quality, 802.11g/USB (add WPA security), and a (soon) real game library)   One Zaurus SL-C3000 (modern CPU hardware, form factor with keyboard and touchscreen (twistable), open source OS (linux or xBSD), hard drive, CF slots), real I/O)  Add iPod mini functionality and storage >= 10Gb  Add Newton HWR(inkwell?) and general Newton goodness  Add replacable AA batteries that will last a FULL day so I'm never stuck  Vendor support of an active OSS development community  MS Outlook sync for PDA functions  (my job requires it, what can I say....)  Stir to make it all cool and integrated and still be work meeting/date/wife safe  I would pay $699 tomorrow for all of this and even pay $50 a year for a software subscription for the basics.  I'm going to wait to see what Palm has to offer with the LifeDrive.  I hope that it meets a lot of the above needs.

<Title>New Era
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The LifeDrive is the beginning of a new era in PDAs.  It is the first pda to have an integrated hard drive.  Thanks to this fact, pdas can now become true mobile media units.  If you are only going to listen to MP3 formated songs, there is no need to get an MP3 player in addition to this unit.  The integration of the PDA and the MP3 player is now beginning.  If you care about why this is took so long, read the following paragraph.  Otherwise, skip it.  Many are wondering why it took this so long to happen when the ipod has been out for years.  Well, almost the entire ipod is made up of the hard drive.  On PDAs, this space is needed for the processor, RAM, the screen, ect.  Recently, Toshiba and other companies have introduced a .85 in. 4 GB microdrive that has been small enough to fit in PDAs.  This has allowed the creation of the microdrive and will undoubtable filter down into other PDAs from both Microsoft and PalmOne.    In addition to the hard drive, PalmOne has included bluetooth, wi-fi, a  320x480 hi-resolution screen, and a 416MHz XScale processor.  Bassicly, this PDA has just about everything you could want or need.  Some may want am integrated keyboard or have other design complaints, but this is a mater of personal preference.  Now the only place left to go is to integrate a hard drive into a new design of the palmone treo.  We should probably expect to see this sometime in the 4 quarter of this year.  This would spell the integration of PDA, MP3 player, and phone, which is ultimatly where we are heading.  If you don't need an integrated phone, then this is a wonderful choice.  I however will wait on the hard drive to be brought to the PDA phones out there.

<Title>LifeDrive Should Be A Real Boost for palmOne

<Content>I think the LifeDrive is going to be a huge boost to palmOne's sales. Despite the price (which is less than an HP iPAQ 4700 series device, by the way), the power of the LifeDrive will certainly attract a lot of buyers. For instance, at $499.88 it will be less expensive than buying a Palm Tungsten device and an iPod mini, and can do pretty much the same function as both devices in one nice device.   I'm also thoroughly impressed with the built-in Bluetooth and WiFi. With the exception of the Tungsten C, palmOne's support of WiFi has been extremely weak. I sincerely look forward to seeing this device in a few weeks!

Let me comment on the main selling points I have read:  Wi fi and Bluetooth, sorry folks, HP got there first, the Ipaq 3715 has been offering this since last year.   An integrated hard drive, what is the point when you can buy 2GB SD cards (with 5GB coming soon)? Cheaper than the Ipaq 4700, yes but you do not get that gorgeous screen. Finally, as an ex-very loyal Palm user, I am sorry to say that the hardware produced by Palm in the last few years was (to put it politely) not impressive.  Just read the user comments on any of them. My advice, have a second look at the Ipaqs.

<Title>Not different enough
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a lifelong Palm user (ok, for a brief year I did own a Clie), I find this product nice but not nice enough. Why? Because a 4GB hard drive is simply not enough of a differentiator compared to the existing PDAs (Palm or otherwise). 2 GB Flash cards are already available and by middle of next year one will be able to add a 4 GB Flash card to any PDA. At that point this would become an oddity.  My T3 plays music and videos just fine. The only reason I carry an 15GB ipod is because of storage, and a Palm with 4GB is simply not enough reason to move particularly if I can wait for another year and just add flash to my PDA. Now if they can cram a 20-30 GB hard drive into this chassis, that becomes a whole new ballgame and palm would have an absolutely killer convergence product on their hands.

<Content>As a Palm owner since the original Pilot 1000 I have been somewhat confused by Palm's tentativeness of recent times. Probably a bit too much marketing mumbo jumbo going on back there. Feature sets are playing catch up but with tantalising possibilities. Eg I am waiting to see what eventuates from the BeOS acquistion.  The device needs a phone and camera with decent resolution, much more memory, a multitasking O/S - possibly even realtime, straight forward programability for third party apps and software to keep an event log if it really is to be a Life Partner. Great natural handwriting recognition and  voice recognition for dictation and commands would make this the world beater it should be.

<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Palm Life Driver is so easy, versatile (stores files, Music,photos,memos, addresses, etc, etc, etc) and lots of memory. Don't mess it up by adding a phone. You'll want this way longer than your next phone server.

<Title>piece of junk
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Lifedrive is an absolute ripe off.  It's no wonder it cannot be purchased on the Palmone web site.  It's like having a regular pda with 64MB of storage attached to an uncooperative 4GB SD card. Most third party software doesn't recognize this space, therefore it's difficult to download directly the this extra storage and the device space limits what you can transfer there.  The moblie manager allows you to drag and drop files directly into the Lifedrive area, but then you can't find them.  It crashes often, gets hot during use, and you have to buy the sync cradle separately.  It come with a "sync cord" that causes the unit to fall or get knocked off the work station.  The "hard case" is a piece of thin,flimsy. tin with rubber on the back. The unit is slow, and difficult to work with.  It's like having dial up in your palm.  I don't know when I've been more disappointed in a product.  I'm sending my lifedrive and that worthless tin case back for a refund.

<Title>Dead as a door nail
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Used infrequently while traveling, in lieu of a laptop. Dead as a door nail in 7 months. Thankfully it's in warranty, but unfortunately all data is lost. Will likely be replaced by a reconditioned product per Palm warranty ... and that reconditioned product will only be warrantied for up to 90 days, regardless of the warranty period left on the original.   I chose Palm because of its reputation, but I'm disappointed with this product and wish I chose the iPAQ instead. After all the Palm add-ons, etc., it would have cost about the same.   I won't be purchasing another Palm product again.

<Title>Enjoying learning about features
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This PDA had so much memory and so many features, I discover something new every day.  My previous (and first) PDA was the very basic Z22.  I had no idea that a PDA could have the capability of the Lifedrive.  This really is the closest thing to carrying around a laptop.  I am enjoying all of the bells and whistles of the Lifedrive and have hit no major snags yet.

<Title>It works...
<Date>Sat Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The lifedrive does everything my old 505c Palm did, and the one before that.  It also moves large files between office and home so that my briefcase is lighter.  Most of the "gee whiz" features don't set up or work as cleanly as the core Palm functions.  But I have computers that handle the gee whiz stuff on an ordinary basis.

<Content>With a huge capacity and an ability to open documents and adobe files, it enabled me to carry all my documents and some books, which are PDF, with me and made my life easier. As a doctor, resources are plentifull and the ability to have them in hand all the time is very helpfull. I tried the music player and discovered an excelent sound quality with headphones, bad with the speaker, but still better than cellphones. I waited a long time for it to be available and I am enjoying it.

<Title>like it, wouldn't give it up
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my lifedrive back in June just prior to going on a business trip. The thought of lugging around a laptop through airports was not attractive. Before I left, I ripped two DvD's to avi files after reading the the LD would play video. I hooked it up to my mac and began dropping files on the send to handheld icon. A couple hundred family and vacation photos, about a gig of mp3s, 2 movies, a couple spreadsheets, a half a dozen docs. I set up my work ldap mail and my home wireless network and experimented with browsing. Everything worked well, movies were vieweable but not shareable, After one movie on the plane I noticed the battery gauge dropping and shifted to mp3 listening, playing video poker or solitaire  for the rest of the flight. These seemed to use less battery power and when I landed I still had 25% battery left. For the rest of the trip I continued to check email through the wireless in the hotel, surf the net checking news sites, yahoo, and doing a few searches on google, I found it very handy when traveling and performed for the most part as advertised. It did lockup a couple times but I attributed that to my sloppy pointing. A simple push of the reset rebooted it and it gave me a error message detailing what happened. Also forget surfing and listening to music at the same time. The starts and stops are way to irritating.

<Title>Good all around tool
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this device about a month ago.  I've been playing around with it trying to figure it all out.  For the most part it works well.  As with any device it will lock up from time to time if I try to do to many things at once.  The quick buttons are not like the old palms so it takes some getting used to.  I'm happy with this product the only down side right now is it is too new so there aren't many useful accesories available.  for the most part it has tons of memory and can hold every file I've thrown at it.  The Documents to go program works well and any windows document can be trnsfered on to your palm so you can work on it on the road.  If you don't need all the things this on can do though go with the tungstun (sp?) series.  My girlfriend has it and is very happy with it, memory cards can make up the differance between the two.

<Title>big spectacular
<Date>Sat Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The handheld is stable, beautiful, not so slow as some people say (sometimes it takes 4 or 5 seconds to open an big aplication but in average, it takes 1 or 2 seconds). The memory is an absurd: You can put all your pictures and a lot of photos. It's perfect for health students (to put books and medical softwares), businesmen, etc.  The main problem is its size: If you put it in your pocket, your pocket will become stewed and it's a little unconfortable. Sorry for the bad English, I'm brazilian.

<Title>What happened to PalmOne?
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been using Palm devices for a long time. From the first 5000 to the T5 I've worked with almost every palmtop of theirs. I have no doubt when I say that this one is the worst palm ever. It's slow, way too complicated, freezes a lot and, the worst of all: it brings desktops problems to palm devices!!! No more smooth and fast navigation. Get ready to wait for windows and to pray for programs not to jam. The hotsync itself is outrageous. It always, and I mean ALWAYS jams the LifeDrive AND my desktop in the end of it. The online support can't explain what's happening. And I'm only using software that came with this thing. I'm sticking with my old Zire 71 with poors 16m of internal memory. My sugestion: Get the Tungsten C2 and lots of flash memory cards. You'll won't regret it.

<Title>Mega Storage but Slow...
<Date>Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a medical professional and to me, the primary use of a pda is to access medical information in a jiffy. The palm Lifedrive is a great product in terms of its storage capacity, but here are a few deficiencies that it has, particularly when it comes to its use in the healthcare industry:  1. Most medical software that are out there for the palm will run from the main memory OR, get this : from the memory card. I have been endlessly frustrated by trying to get the software that I have to run off the lifedrive. Now, if I have to buy an additional memory card for my Lifedrive, inspite of having a huge 4 Gig hard drive, that doesnt make sense.  2. The delay in accessing information stored on the hard disk is pretty evident. Although it is a barely palpable 2 seconds, it becomes irritating when, for instance, you have to run the same application again and again - like for instance, the software I use to check drug contraindications and medication side-effects.  3. The lack of a keyboard is a painful thing to me, particularly since I have been used to having one on my Tungsten C that I faithfully used for the past 2 1/2 years.  But overall, for a product innovation in the PDA field, taking into consideration that this is the first PDA on the market to incorporate a harddrive in the package, I would give it 4 stars. However, if you are a power-user, a business/medical professional, I would suggest you go back and reconsider the Tungsten C.

<Title>Innovative New PDA
<Date>Wed Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased the Lifedrive to replace my Clie. The things that attracted me to this product were the 4 gig harddrive, the Palm OS, and the large screen.  I also purchased a Treo 650 for my daughter.  After comparing the two I have to say that if the Treo were to add a 4 gig harddrive, it would probably be a far superior piece of convergence technology.  The setup and installation of software on the Treo was fast and trouble-free.  In fact, even though I had neglected to delete the old Clie software on my computer, I had no trouble with the Treo set-up, which simply replaced and updated files as needed, and then transferred user files onto the Treo.  I then downloaded a large number of e-books and a variety of software (games, utilities) onto the Treo also with no problem.  It was remarkable how fast the installation went.  It took only a couple of minutes to install about 76 e-books.  I had the whole thing set up within an hour.    By contrast, the Lifedrive setup and installation was very buggy.  First of all, it's not directly compatible with other Palm devices.  Before installing the Lifedrive software, it's essential that you uninstall Palm Desktop and HotSync from previous PDA's.  The Lifedrive version of these programs is different.  Installing it over the top of an already existing version renders it unusable.  The Lifedrive setup doesn't give you an option to install in a different directory either.  It automatically installs where it thinks it should be.  In fact, I couldn't get it to stop installing in the old Clie folder until I manually deleted everything having to do with Clie on my computer.  After deleting all old Palm and Clie files, I was still unable to reinstall Lifedrive until I replaced a couple dll's. I did finally get it running as it should, though I was disappointed that it hadn't been possible to automatically transfer user files from my old Palm Desktop to the Lifedrive because of the incompatibility issues.  After that I started adding utilities, games and e-books.  Unlike the Treo, installations were very sluggish on the Lifedrive.  I was able to speed it up by customizing the installation process so that it only added the specific things I wanted.  Even so, the process was significantly slower than the Treo partly because the Lifedrive had trouble handling multiple simultaneous installs.  Due to the number of glitches during set-up, it took a couple of days to complete it.    Over the past month, I have noticed that Lifedrive tends to shutdown and reboot at odd moments. The reboot is so interminably slow I thought at first the Lifedrive was freezing.  There are also significant lag times when switching between applications. Besides that, applications run very slowly compared to my daughter's Treo...they're even a little sluggish compared to my old Clie.  Part of the problem is that the Lifedrive has no actual RAM.  Instead it uses a part of the harddrive to simulate RAM.    Like other users, I'm a little disappointed as well that the Lifedrive has no keyboard or camera.  The Lifedrive does let you easily reassign buttons.  Still, I really miss the "back" button on my old Clie. The Lifedrive is also a little thicker than most PDA's making it too large to fit comfortably in a pocket, though I've had no trouble carrying it in a purse.  As for the price, I consider it a good deal considering the current cost of a 4 gig memory card.  In fact, it has so much internal memory, I haven't even bothered to purchase a separate memory card yet. As with most PDA's (including the Treo), the battery life is too short.  I fixed this by purchasing an external power accessory.    Despite some negative comments above, I do really like the Lifedrive and I use it extensively.  I think it's a significant step forward in convergence technology.  The fewer pieces of hardware I have to carry around the better.  Lifedrive would be vastly improved though if Palm were to give it some actual RAM, fixed some installation and compatibility issues, and added a keyboard and camera.  Better yet, add a 4 gig harddrive to the Treo!

<Title>Do not buy this unit - Many problems
<Date>Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like many others, I am profoundly disappointed with Palm's latest release, the Life Drive Mobile Manager. There are many positive reviews posted here, but the majority of them are from users who are relatively new to the Palm PDA line.  As a power user, and having owned nearly every model they released, I can say with confidence that if you are a power user, you will be returning this unit within two weeks. The majority of the third party apps that I used to use are not compatible with it and that causes fatal errors and random soft resets. When the app is uninstalled, the error stops, but because the unit boots off of the hard drive memory and not flash memory as all previous models did, a soft reset takes approximately TWO MINUTES 16 SECONDS from start to being ready to use again. It is unbelievable. You should really drive down to play with one to look at the lag time BEFORE you order it here at Amazon. I promise you - it will be time well spent.  The power switch on the top of it is a slider that is made of plastic, looks very cheap and I'm guessing will last maybe 3 or 4 months tops before it needs to be replaced.  If you are thinking of buying this for watching videos and playing MP3s or as a replacement for your iPOD, keep your iPOD. Sometimes I wish Apple would buy Palm. Maybe then we'd start seeing some quality.  No cradle - a flimsy breakaway  plugin to charge it. The hard case looks sexy and sleek, but you will soon tire of having to pry it open several times a day with your thumbnail. And if you don't have any thumbnails, you're out of luck. Don't get the hard case or you'll never be able to open it.  Overall a big disappointment for me. I made the mistake of selling my T3 and putting the proceeds toward the LifeDrive. I still have time to return it - and I likely will - but am having a huge problem trying to decide what to downgrade to from the LifeDrive.  T5 didn't get much better reviews and T3 is a few years old now...  If you absolutely MUST buy this unit, please wait until the LifeDrive 2 and LifeDrive 3 come out later this year or in early 2006. Remember the T, T2 and T3? My guess is the same thing is going to happen to this one. They would have saved themselves a lot of headaches if they waited until it was ready to be released as a quality product.  Now I don't know what the heck to buy to replace it. T5 maybe, but still nothing compares to the T3 thus far.  The only good thing the LifeDrive has going for it is a lot of storage and internal WiFi; HOWEVER, the version of wifi they chose to install is the slow version - it crawls; and I have no idea what all the fuss is about people being able to use this as a 4GB USB drive.  Yes, it works as an external drive. It's slow but it works. Big Hooey. Go down and get yourself a 1 GB USB flash RAM drive (tiny) if you want that level of portability. For me as a longtime Palm user, the ability to use this as an external drive is NOT a huge deal. I've been using USB flash drives for years to do what this does.  Perhaps the biggest annoyance - and primarily the reason why I am returning the unit - is the lag time switching between apps. You click the stylus on an app and since it is no longer booting from the flash drive, there is a two second noticable lag time before the app launches. It's ridiculous. They say that putting a hard drive in a PDA is an achievement that will allow for a great deal of things to come.  It would be. If they had left the unit booting to flash ram and used the 4 GB for storage only. Big mistake. Bad Developer. No cookie for you.  This crashes as often as a PocketPC, but it is much slower. That's the best way I can describe it.  Hope this helps!  Adam Boettiger  UPDATE: 22 AUG 2005 - Wanted to add a post script to this to let readers know that I did in fact return the LifeDrive to the store and purchased the Tungsten T5 and some accessories instead. While the T5 is not everything I want in a PDA, in my opinion it is the best unit Palm has on the market - primarily because it has fewer problems than the LifeDrive.  After setting it up last week, I've had no problems with the T5 since. As a longtime Palm user, it was nice to see the zippy flash drive again, with no two-second delays in switching between apps, no Fatal Exception errors, etc. It just worked.  If you must upgrade now, buy the T5. If you can wait 4-6 months, hold out for the OS 6 devices due out in Q1 or Q2 of 2006. You'll probably be glad you did.  Hope this was useful.  Adam Boettiger

<Content>If you are a "newbie" Palm user who never installs 3rd party software and who uses only basic stuff, you might like the LifeDrive [but then you might not need one].  If you are a "sophisticated" Palm user, then you will soon find out that the LifeDrive has way too many serious problems which interfere with using it.  I wish I could recommend a better Palm but the Tungsten C is the only one I like, and it no longer seems to be available.

<Title>Nice for a first harddrive PDA
<Date>Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Palmone LifeDrive is certainly the best PDA on the market right now.  I won't list the feature set.  Check above for that.  The features I really like in comparison to my previous PDA, a Palm T2, are:  - Web and Email via WiFi  - Web and Email via Bluetooth (to a supporting computer or mobile phone) - file transfer ability via either virual drive or LifeDrive manager  What I do not like about the LifeDrive: - weird connection cable, not nice like the dock of my T2 - weird power cable  I will venture that these cables do not have the durability of previous Palm docking stands.  They definitely do not have the elegance and leave loose cables on your desktop for synchronization and recharging.  However, you can sync via WiFi or Bluetooth to avoid part of the problem.  Lastly, the battery life is less than desirable.  My old T2 had way less functionality so I probably didn't use it as many hours in the day as my new LifeDrive.  However, I never remember having it run out of charge in use.  A couple of visits to the dock for sync in the day for several minutes was usually enough to keep it going.  I would leave it on for most of the day if I noticed the battery below half charged which was way less than once per week.  I have to plug in my LifeDrive and leave it there for a while a couple of times per day just to make it through the day.  An well-designed docking station would make this less painful.  Maybe one will come with time.
