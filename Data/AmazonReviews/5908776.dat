<Content>This product is a great idea and will be fabulous when the bugs are worked out. The first one I recieved worked very well for a couple of days and then started freezing up while playing content. Then my computers began not recognizing the drive(both windows XP and Vista). Credit goes to Amazon.com for replacing it in a timely fasion. The replacement works better but will not download content from the Fanfare website, which is not all that important to me as the content is not all that great.

<Content>I love this thing.  It's cool if I want to take my downloaded vids to a friends house to watch on TV.  Also, I don't have a media extender in my house, so this is a cheap alternative to watch vids in another room.  The Fanfare site kind of sucks.  It has limited content, but the idea is pretty cool.  If/When Fanfare gets better, this item could get a 5-star review.  For the price and ease-of-use, you can't beat this with a stick.

<Title>Simple and Amazing

<Content>I loved this little guy after the first time I used him. It's an extremely simple concept... put the files on the USB, plug the dock into your TV, and BAM! You're watching pirated movies faster than Universal Studios can catch you. In all seriousness, this thing is worth the money and then some. I bought the 4GB simply because I can't watch more than that amount of TV in one sitting but if you're hardcore and enjoy sitting for more than 5 hours at a time go for the 8GB. Maybe you should invest in a thigh-master while your at it.
