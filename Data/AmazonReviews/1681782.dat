<Title>Excellent video player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 604 30GB is fantastic. video quality is amazing, dvd quality, and it supports DIVX although this is not mentioned in the literature.  The audio quality is very good too, though the earpieces could be more comfortable.  It is a pity that it didnt have a USB input. Note however that recording can only be done if you buy the optional DVR station (which i did, for $100) Downloading movies and stuff is very quick. Synchronisation with Media Player is good but has a few quirks at times.  Battery life for audio is good, but video is just about 2 hours.  The player is rather bulky and not ideal for carrying in your pocket.  You also need to invest in a proper leather case. That which is supplied is pathetic.

<Title>The perfect multimedia viewer!
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm on my second Archos player and this is the one to beat. The wide-screen is huge compared to my old 2.2 inch screen, the controls are simple and intuitive, the KICKSTAND is a Great Improvement (it allows the unit to sit up at a 15 degree angle so you can watch movies hands free), user replacable battery (you can get extra ones too), Excellent photo viewer, NON-proprietary file formats (not locked down to one format for videos), built in speaker and microphone!  The not so great: Lets face it. Earbuds don't fit most peoples ears so great. The supplied ones are good but you should go out and buy a pair that fit into you ears. Sony makes a pretty good, inexpensive set. The supplied case is a dog. It's a nylon sack that offers no protection.  That's it. Go out and try one. You won't be sorry.

<Title>I love it. (repeat 3 times)
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very solid product. Very satisfied.  I did a lot of research (Internet) before purchasing. Was able to play with it in-store before purchase at a Sharper Image. Have not tried any other devices. What was important to me? Size, reputation of Archos, quality and feel of unit, options, many glowing reviews out there, and the ability to transfer photos from digital camera.  Experience so far: Easy to use, great screen, great performance, no skimping on construction - feels solid and looks really great. I bought both plug-ins, as well as the helmet cam.  All work flawlessly.  Tech Support great - I called them with questions about plug-ins before I purchased. Less than 5 min wait, very helpful.  For the money spent, my expectations, and the product delivered: No regrets.  Couldn't be more pleased.

<Title>It's a great little video player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 604 for recording video in odd places, like on a roller coaster for instance.  At first I was quite disappointed becasue it doesn't have any native way of inputing video, you have to buy a cam or adapter from Archos.  Well, when I first got this unit in September I got what I thought was the helmet cam to go with it but it turned out to be the helmet cam for the older av500 series.  Neither the adapter or camera were available at that time.  So after much waiting I ordered the newly available travel adapter in early December, it finally arrived yesterday, 1-3-07.  I am frustrated that it took so long to arrive.  But it works wonderfully, I hooked up an external camera to it (the camera needed it's own power) and it worked great.  I connected it to a TV video source and again it worked just great.   So, in the end, it took 4 months to get the parts together to use it as I wanted but it works very nicely. Yes, it plays other videos I've downloaded to it too and does a good job.  It works as an MP3 player too, but hey, that's what my Ipod's for.   My one big concern it that I live in fear of breaking that nice big screen while it's in my pocket, or fanny pack while using it in the field.  A hard case would be nice but it'd have to fit over the travel adapter too in order to be useful. Oh, one gripe, why o why couldn't they just have included an input jack on the unit for video thus eliminating the need for the travel adapter??? Finally, if you've got the money, and need it, buy it, it works great. Mike

<Title>Excellent Product
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading numerous reviews, and searching for at least a month, I finally decided on the Archos product line.  They have the absolute best bang for the buck, hands down. I won't say anything bad about the other devices that are in the same category as this device.. other than none of them can compare to the features, support, and quality of this product. Let's just say that the screen and menu system is the best that I've found, when it comes to the other ones out there in this models range.  I actually did have to contact support because of a small problem with downloading one of the additional plug-ins off of the web site. I received help, and had the plug-in installed no more than 5 minutes later. Very fast and helpful support team.  The best feature is price vs what you get. Sure, having a record feature might be nice to some, but I'm not one of those folks. Having the ability to buy it later if I change my mind is very nice. I bought it for my wife for her birthday, and she has enjoyed it immensely as well. This device has the absolute best picture viewing ability (zoomed thumbnails on roll over, etc.), which is mainly what she wanted it for.  If you buy this device, or any other Archos product that supports them, I highly recommend that you buy the additional plug-ins. Well worth the small change for the functionality on the device. It would have been nice to incorporate them into the device on purchase, but having them so cheap for what you get was fine by me.

<Title>Archos 604
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>From the moment you pick up the Archos 604 from its box, it has the look and feel of a quality product, and by many accounts, it is. The brilliant 4.3 inch screen puts it in a class by itself. This is why I bought this PMP over all the others. The 604 does connect easily to a PC and the transfer of videos, music and photos is quick and easy. I did have to spend a few moments going over the website instruction manual to figure out a couple of things - and it does take about a day to get use to the buttons - but all-in-all, this is a very good Personal Media Player. In a perfect world, I would like to see the screen a tad brighter and the audio output a little stronger. I am not crazy about having to go to the website to pay for a number of firmware updates, but conisdering all the little nice features about this PMP, you tend to overlook some of the short falls. The Archos 604 is a very nice piece of equipment - perfect for traveling or something to use around the home or office.

<Title>The best of the Best!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Buy this player if you are not sure. I spent a month looking at every review and every spec and this is by far the best PVP, or even mp3 player around. The ONLY thing that I was disappointed with is the charging through the USB cord. I bought a 30$ charger on amazon, and now can charge with any outlet.  The resolution is far beyond what you will ever need, and it stores more than enough video for vacation. Screw the wi-fi model, buy this one!

<Title>Good for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good device as a viewer for pictures, however movie downloads are a bit more complicated. We tried to click and drag, use Windows media syncro and it didn't see how to get files into the device (as the files come up separate and don't integrate). The easy way is to buy for $100. USD the Archos docking cradle and record off Dish, VCR, DVD or TV. It is slim and fits into your pocket in it's case, has good resolution for viewing and is fairly simple to learn to use. Picture files are easy to download and has a scrolling picture viewer in 3D or flip and fade. You can also use it to carry business files around if you so needed. Overall is it good technology and seems fairly substancial.     Jazzbebop7

<Content>Incredible device. I have been watching this courtesy of Maxmim PC and they reviewed the 604 recently I decided to get this item ($312). This blows every other Digatal LCD player away. 4.3" WS 16:9 LCD is truly amazing and it reads PDF's, plays music, holds photos, is a sports recorder, a dvr and plays DIVX/XVID avi out of the box. I paid 20 bux for mpeg 4 and VOB support and now it plays dectrypted dvds right out of folders. This is THE device to have ! Amazon was the cheapest by 30 bux and I was shipped fast and arrived perfect. Will shop again!

<Title>One serious little toy
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>From the moment I saw it online, I knew that this was my son's Christmas present.  We were not disappointed.  Battery life is good, operation is reasonably easy, good feature set, beautiful screen.  Perhaps most impressive of all is the obvious feeling of "fineness" and quality.  It's not light as a feather or tiny; you *do* have to pay extra for one or two video drivers; and the user interface isn't perfect.  But it gets the job done, and I anticipate that we'll be happy with the 604 for quite a long time.

<Title>Dude, Sweeet!
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This Product is absolutely fab darlings! I've just recently bought my Archos and have had it now for about a month and am enjoying every inch of it. All the great things about it have been mentioned in the other reviews, but the thing that I just went ga-ga for is not having to pay to put movies on this thing. Also, I'm not a big fan of the questionable things we view in movies; every now and then I'd just like to watch a wholesome movie not tainted with drugs, sex, profanity, and violence. So when I'm recording movies on my Archos I like to do what movie makers call, "jump cuts," where I pause the recording when a scene in a movie comes up that I don't care for viewing, and resume recording when its over. So when I finally watch the movie, any contents I didn't want in it won't be. How cool is that?! Works out great with the kiddies.   The Archos doesn't hurt your pockets either. Again, as was mentioned before, its reasonably priced for all the things you can do with it unlike the ipod. Its funny cause each time I buy a media player or MP3 player I compare them to those rinky dink iPods, but they can never measure up. You buy an iPod for this price you get music, videos, and pictures. You by the Archos you get movies, TV shows, music, photos, digital camera connection capability, PDF capability (my favorite), audio recording (also my favorite), TV playback with the DVR dock station, or all these tarveling with the DVR Travel Dock. Is that a Steal or what?   The only things I didn't like about the Archos 604, which wasn't enough to make me get rid of it or not purchase it, is the fact that the buttons don't light up(making it hard to navigate at night or if you just happen to be in a dark area; this can be remedied by buying the Archos' with the touch screens), and it didn't have an FM tunner(not that it really needs this feature, but it couldn't hurt.).   I Compared the Archos to the Zen that I have by Creative. And I must say, although they're both great buys, I use my Archos the most. I don't see why more people don't use these as opposed to the iPod. And if it appears right now that I'm abasing ipod, I'm not. They're just not the better buy.

<Title>Get the dock
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this unit from Amazon last May and use it primarily for travel.  Before a trip, I choose some interesting movies from Netflix, pop the movie in my DVD player and record it to the Archos.  The screen is so nice that people sitting by me on airplanes ask about it.    Since I have used it for several months, I have some observations:  1.  With the dock (which, in my opinion, should be included with it), you can record directly from a DVD player or DVR.  I have recorded programs on my Dish Network DVR and then just played them later, recording them to the Archos.  2.  On an airplane, the audio is really too low (even at full blast) unless you have noise canceling headphones.  I tried the earbuds and could hardly hear my movies.  My Bose noise-canceling headphones give me a great experience with the Archos on an airplane.  3.  I subscribed to Urge subscription music, which was dovetailed with Windows Media Player 11, and subscription music worked fine.  I downloaded lots of subscription music to the Archos and as long as you did a sync at least once a month, the DRM dates would be updated by WMP automatically.  Alas, Urge merged with Rhapsody a few weeks ago and guess what?  Rhapsody is not compatible with the Archos.  Neither is Napster.  So if you use subscription music, this player isn't much good.  Obviously, your purchased music and CD rips work fine on it.  4.  I would like to see a better way to manage files on it.  Deleting files from it to make room on the hard drive is easy enough, but I haven't found a way to delete whole folders.  For example, I can easily delete individual songs from an album, but there's nothing on the menu that lets you delete the album all at once.  Little quirks like that make using it take some getting used to.    5.  It is a little heaver than most similar devices, and I haven't found it very good if I am walking or running ... a smaller mp3 player would be better for that.  But for video during travel, it can't be beat.  Overall, I consider this a good purchase and love my unit.  I bought an extra battery (video sucks battery pretty good, but I can generally watch at least 2 full-length movies before the battery dies) and the dock, and would highly recommend both purchases if you want to use this unit.  Of course that adds to the overall price so keep that in mind when comparing, at least if you want to get full functionality from it.

<Title>Great for watching movies, not so much for audio on the go.
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Archos 604 30gb for about 2 months now, and I've been using it practically every day.  It's a fantastic PVP, and when it comes to watching videos on the go, I think the screen size is right in the sweet spot.  Any smaller (I used to have a Zen Vision: M) and you tend to get eye strain or motion sickness; any bigger and it becomes too heavy.  Anyway, here are my major pros and cons:  Pros *Great screen! The resolution is not the highest out there, but the size and contrast keep videos looking great. I Compared it with my friend's Zen Vision and his resolution was a bit sharper, but the Archos' viewing angle was far superior.  *Audio quality is great, and audio enhancements like an EQ and Bass Boost are included.  *Nice option between Mass Storage Device or Win. Media device.  *Fantastic base price. Mine was a steal at $180 refurbished.   Cons: *Silly button layout that takes some getting used to and requires two hands (one to support the device, one to push buttons) to operate. Very difficult to operate blindly.  *Blasdesign. Ok let me be honest... It's just plain ugly compared to the slick curves of the Zen or iPod product lines.  *Limited video format support out of the box. You can purchase an upgrade for $20.  and the most nagging con... *DELICATE!! I know it has a spinning physical hard drive in there, but this thing is touchy to the point of frustration. Just the slightest tap or bump to the device while it's reading the drive will cause it to lock up, at which point you have to remove the battery (!) and press a Reset button with a pointy object. You don't lose any data except the time and date, but I must admit I feel pretty darn silly dismantling my device and resetting it in the train, on the street, at work, walking around, etc etc. I can honestly say it's crashed 40 - 50 times already in the past 2 months. I'm sure these crashes will destroy the drive eventually as well.  The bottom line: If you are like me and like to listen to music on the go, make sure you stuff this thing into the included case (at which point it's the size of a small book), or be ready for lots of hard disk lockups. But load this baby up with some TV episodes or Movies, find a nice comfy place to sit, and the Archos 604 with its great screen and adequate battery life (about 4 hrs) really shines.
