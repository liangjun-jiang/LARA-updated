<Title>Not as good as the 2nd generation
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The wide body styling is awkward and the smaller click wheel is harder to manuever. I have the 2nd generation and like it much better. I love the tall thin slick styling on it. The only plus with the 3rd gen is more gigs for your money, but bottom line it's styling holds it back. I'll be returning.

<Content>This thing looks and feels way better in hands than on photo. You got to try it to really see.   About styling, it's very personal. No need to argue about it's better or worth than G2.

<Content>This is actually my first I-pod, so I thought it was perfect to try, especially if you don't want to spend alot of money on something that you might not like...But I have to say that I actually like it, especially with the added feature (Video) and the music advantages. Even though its a small gadget the video is great, at first it's kind of difficult to watch movies/tv shows, but if you stare at the screen for a couple of minutes, you forget how tiny it is. I have to say that I was impressed with the battery life also, I can play like 50 songs, watch 2 tv shows (42 min a piece), and watch movies (over an hour and a half each)...very impressive. With that said I am going to advance to the 80GB I-pod Classic with Video (very soon).

<Title>ELECTRONICALLY CHALLENGED
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Even though I'm a "senior citizen," I have craved an iPod for quite some time.  When the new 4 GB Nano recently became available, I decided to take the plunge.  For Amazon's part, the transaction couldn't have been smoother.  In fact, the iPod arrived much sooner than Amazon predicted.  No problem there.  However, for me -- someone who'd never even handled a music player -- initially I found the Nano confusing to use.  The directions that come with the device are minimal, at best, and you must go online for the complete user's manual (over 75 pages).  Also, it was a bit challenging when it came to learning how to download music, videos and other media into the Nano.  Now, after a few weeks, I'm glad to say that using the iPod has become "old hat" for me.  It's a great little "toy" at an affordable price.

<Title>Love it.
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I never owned an ipod before until last year when someone gave me a shuffle for a present. I use it primarily for listening to podcasts and audio books.  When the new ipod nano came out I knew I had to have one.   After using it for a few days, I thought about upgrading to an ipod with a larger screen, but decided against it until some of the inevitable kinks are worked out and prices decline (hopefully). I mean, it's a big jump going from $150 to $250 for the next size screen.  The main complaint I have is that the scrolling goes so fast that you sometimes miss the menu you want. It will just take some getting used to. Also, if you want to play an audio book on slow, it has a funny sound. For the price Apple charges, a little pouch should be included to protect the unit. It would be a lot more useful than an Apple sticker!  As I wait (and I WILL get an ipod in the future with a larger screen), I'm so enjoying this little thing of beauty, to which I've added family pix and video. Sure the screen is small, but the resolution and detail are quite amazing.   I'm very pleased and excited about my purchase. btw, I'd give it a 4.5 star but there isn't the option.

<Title>4GB iPod Nano
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This thing is amazing.  It is very easy to use and obtaining items from the iTunes store is easy and quick. One exception to its greatnesss is the design of the earphones.  I have a hard time keeping them in place and the audio quality suffers as a result.  I am fiddling around with a car device that works great in one vehicle and lousy in the other.  Overall the product is perfect for me.

<Title>I love my little nano
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the third MP3 player I've owned, and the first iPod.  It took some deciding to figure out which model I would buy.  I knew I wasn't going to be watching movies or TV episodes on a screen measuring a few square centimeters, so I didn't need 80 gigabytes or whatever of storage.  I also knew from past experience that my music player was going to get banged around, so I wanted a flash drive that wouldn't skip or jam.  That ruled out the full-size iPods.  I was torn between the 4 GB and the 8 GB iPod nano.  I went for the 4 GB, and I'm satisfied with my choice, though now I can see that the 8 GB would have been pretty sweet too. Pros & cons:  In favor of the 4 GB nano, I can say that all I want to carry around in my pocket are the highlights of my music collection -- the stuff I'll actually listen to when I'm commuting or working out.  And that's substantially less than 10 GB of music.  In favor of the 8 GB nano, you need half a gig of storage for the iPod software, so the 4 GB is really more like 3.5 GB.  So the 8 GB model would have given me more flexibility.  About the iPod nano generally: It's delightfully small & lightweight, it's easy to use, it has a high-quality screen despite its size, and the sound output seems good. However, the included earbuds are total crap -- they may be useful for strangling an attacking chihuahua, but that's about it.  Music lovers will want to replace them with something more substantial (I went for portable Sennheisers and they're great).  Also on the negative side, I don't find the iTunes interface very congenial.  I used to use MusicMatch and I found it far easier.  With MusicMatch, the user was in control.  With iTunes, it's Apple all the way.  But none of these negatives outweighs the fact that the iPod nano is an excellent little music machine.

<Content>I've had an ipod since they came out. I haven't enjoyed any of them as much as this handy nano. The size is great and it is easy to use. I listen to books and love the ease of finding my place from the last listen. Karen
