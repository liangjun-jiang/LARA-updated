<Title>This is righteous stuff!
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this for one reason, and one reason only: size. Many of the other mp3 players out there were larger and clunkier. I own a Handspring Visor Deluxe and was going to use that as an mp3 player because of the aforementioned clunky sizes of other players. &quot;Why spend money for something that's not much smaller?&quot; I thought. Then, I stumbled across this baby... I read the specs and was admittedly not too impressed. 32 megs is not much, especially if you're going for full stereophonic 128 kbps sound. At that rate you could only get about half an hour of music - enough to go to the store, but not much more. Of course, there was always the option of a memory card but those added to the cost. It looked like I was going to pass this player by until I saw one on sale at an un-named competitor of this fine site. At the price I saw it for, I had to take the chance... Twenty four hours later, I'm still in awe. To begin with, just seeing the darn thing gives you a swell feeling. It's tiny, I mean tiny. It made my wife proclaim it to be &quot;cute.&quot; In such a small package I was expecting so-so sound at best. Not true. It is super duper. The built-in equalizer is servicable enough, and it takes a quick press o' the button to change settings. So I was hooked on the sound and size, there was only the capacity issue to consider... Then I rememberd my good friend db PowerAmp Music Converter (search for it on the web). This sweet program lets you convert current mp3's to lame or blade mp3's with a smaller bit rate. Smaller bit rate means smaller size. Smaller size means less space on the 32 meg memory, which translates into more sound. Lovely. Some will decry encoding anything to less than cd (128 kbps) sound, but pah I say. I was born and raised on analog and a little less crispness in my music is actually preferred. The human ear can barely discern the difference between 80 and 128 kbps recordings anyway, so why bother? At 80 kbps I can squeeze about 50 minutes or so of music into that 32 megs. Not bad. Not bad at all. After I buy a 64 or 96 meg card, I'll be waltzing back and forth to work with only my tiny kazoo as my companion. Beautiful. If you are reading this and thinking either &quot;What in hades is he talking about?&quot; or &quot;That is way to much bother for listening to some music!&quot; please reconsider! It takes only a few minutes (even for you 56 k types) to download db PowerAmp and a few more to convert the mp3's to lower bitrates. Trouble? Nah. At least not for the payoff. Sweet music for a sweet price. Did I mention it's tiny and cute? Buy this mp3 player and be a happy camper. It's a wonder.

<Title>Not Universal
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Beware when considering this product!  Although it prominently displays the USB compatability, it does not state on the exterior package that it is only Window compatible.  When I found a friend foolish enough to be using Window's software I got some music loaded into it.  It is a remarkable device, small, easy to use, good sound quality, and expandable.  However, after about 1 month of use the screen died and it is currently in route to RCA for a repair/replace.  I complained to them that the word Universal in USB should mean Universal, i.e. both Mac and Windows compatible.

<Title>The smallest MP3 player; very well designed.
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>After about a week of researching about 25 mp3 players I finally settled on the RCA Kazoo. I wanted the smallest mp3 player possible, but didnt want to sacrifice great sound. My Kazoo delivers for only $... After much research I decided I needed a unit that had: lock (so buttons dont get pushed accidentally), bass boost/ equalizer, digital volume control, big clear display, & fast transfer rate (2.4Mb/sec). You'd be supprised many more expensive units dont have all of these features. I also didnt care about other formats since mp3 is the standard & all formats can be converted to mp3 via software. The included software Music Match & Real Jukebox are excellent. I just dragged & dropped my mp3 files from explorer into real Jukebox. Real Jukebox lets you set the bit rate you would like and automatically lowers bitrate on files to bitrate you choose to save memory/size. This brigs me to the 1 of 2 drawbacks. ALthough 32 mb is common w/ mp3 players it isnt enough (at 128k bit rate). I plan on ordering a 64 MB MM card (dont pay more than $1/mb if you decide to buy memory). I did find out that at 56k the sound was still awesome & I can hold about 75 minutes of music w/o extra memory. The second drawback doesnt apply to me but I read in one review that this doesnt support Mac. If you are a windows user you will be very satisfied!! I can't see why anyone could buy a player w/ a slower transfer rate; USB is the way to go. <br>One last note: The display is large & easy to read. It shows track, time, bit rate, volume, battery, & dsp.  It does not show the name of the current song that is playing the way larger mp3 players do.<br>Hope this helps & good luck in your search.

<Title>RCA K@ZOO
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This mp3 player is awesome. It's go great sound and is so small. It's lightweight and portable. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it doesn't have that much memory. I can fit up to 10 songs on it. If it had more memory I would give it a five star. But great for beginners who want a mp3 player because it's so inexpensive and it's easy to use.

<Title>DO NOT DEAL WITH RCA/THOMPSON!
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this player and was fairly happy with it.  It is very small and sounds fine.  Unfortuneately, I lost the cd containing the drivers for it.  I called customer service to get a replacement cd.  My first call to RCA/Thompson technical support directed me to a page where I could download software for the RCA Lyra.  After telling the representative that I had the K@zoo, and not the Lyra, he said &quot;sorry, that's all the information I have.&quot;  <p>Today, I figured I'd try again - maybe there'd be more information.  This time I was told, in fact, that the software is not available online, but that the cd could be shipped to me.  However, it would cost $12.95 for a cd containing one driver, and 2 free to download software programs.  I was about to order, when I was then informed of the $9.95 SHIPPING FEE.  TO MAIL ME ONE COMPACT DISK.  <p>Needless to say, I am far from pleased, and I urge anyone considering buying an RCA product to stay far, far away.  If you ever need customer service (and judging by the reviews of many mp3 players, you will), you will greatly regret the purchase.

<Title>Great Product!
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this today and I'm very pleased.  The size is great (very small), the sound quality is excellent, and the behind-the-ear headphones that it came packaged with are also very nice.  The price is very low and the USB feature makes transfer easy.  The software included is relatively simple to use and allows you to insert cds, and create MP3 files.  <br>The only drawback is that the 3 ways they made for you to wear it are pretty bad.  It comes with a pendant (who wants to have it swinging around their neck?) a little plastic pouch that is very hard to put on your belt, and a wrist strap.  I found a good way to wear it, though.  Buy one of those little sticky things with the belt clip that you use for a cell phone and then just clip it on your belt with that.  Once you get that, it's perfect.

<Title>DOESN'T WORK ON MY WINDOWS XP MACHINE
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Even thought I got this thing FREE after rebates with the purchase of Windows XP, even though the Install disk says Windows XP, Windows XP tells you when you try to install it that it is NOT CERTIFIED to run on Windows XP.  I figured it must run OK nonetheless, since the Install disk says XP and it came free with Windows XP, but it doesn't on my machine.<p>In fact, even though the player shows up when you plug it in on the taskbar, the software doesn't recognize it.  Windows Media Player doesn't see it either.  <p>The USB cable is too short if you have a tower machine.  It doesn't even reach to the counter.

<Title>Nice size but need more memory
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>While this unit best feature is it's small light weight size, without a memory card you can only get 6-8 MP3's on the built in 32 meg of flash ram. Also I've heard that the software won't work with Windows XP, I had planed on upgrading soon? The headphones are pretty good although they start to hurt the ears after 30-40 mins. This MP3 player sure blows away those old clunky walkman CD players, it's 1/10th of the size and weight! Smaller is indeed better!

<Title>Good Player but some faults
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Simply put, I have enjoyed this player. I have had problems finding a variety of software to support loading the player, so I've been stuck with the plugin for Real Jukebox. Not too bad, but not the one I use on a regular basis.<p>Loading time was slow with Real J. but the player holds ample songs if you are willing to reduce quality to roughly FM quality. Which is fine for me for the money.<p>The little plastic back it shoves in to attach to the armband is pressed plastic and is sharp on the edges. It's also a little touchy -- I ripped the snaps off within the first week. Ug.<p>THERE IS ONE MAJOR WEEKNESS OF THIS PRODUCT:<p>I upgraded to XP and could no longer load the player. After contacting RCA their response was: &quot;we are not sure we are going to support XP&quot;. What a bad answer. I will NOT buy another PC related item from RCA after this. If they attribute so little importance to driver management, this can only be indicative of what they will do across the board.<p>BE CAREFULL.<p>I'm now shopping for another player because I can't load the Kazoo anymore. I suppose I'll ebay this Kazoo so go there and see if you can get one for 1/2 price first!

<Content>Run don't walk from this product.  It was heavily hyped this Christmas but despite it's strong features it does not work with XP.  Imagine getting a new computer loaded with XP and a cool MP3 player only to find that it doesn't even work with the O/S loaded on your machine.<p>RCA drops the ball by saying it's not sure if it will support XP.  What a cop-out.  Run don't walk from RCA PC related products.  They just don't get it...

<Title>For non-XPers, this little bugger is awesome.
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>As I'm sure by now, you've heard that the k@zoo isn't XP compatible, so I'm not going to get into it. For those of us who don't have XP... it's great. <p>It met all my requirements. It's small, small's not the word, it's tiny. Its memory is upgradable with equally small MMC's which are relatively cheap and available, unlike the Rio &quot;backpacks&quot; I just wish they came in 132MB. It uses commonly available AAA's. The battery life is pretty good. I haven't clocked it, but I can get about 6 hours out of a pair of AAA's. Best of all, you can have one for under a hundred bucks and batteries are even included.<p>So, if you're not running XP, I say snap one up. Especially if you're looking for your first unit. Who knows, maybe RCA will get on the stick and come up with drivers for it.

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I recently bought the Kazoo and I am thrilled with it. I bought a 32mb mmc and it doubled the amount of songs i was able to put on it. The software was very easy to use as well as the player itself. By reducing the kbps of each song to 64kbps I was able to put a little over 2 hours (30 songs) onto the player. It reduced the quality but it still sounds amazing. The only fault I can find is that it drains the batteries kind of quickly. I reccomend this player to any first time user.

<Title>THIS PRODUCT NOW SUPPORTS XP!!!
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>A lot of the reviews here knock this player because at the time it did not work on XP.  There is now a plugin for musicmatch.  ... .<p>Anyway, I like the player a lot.  It's size is very nice.  My main reason for getting it is to have about 8 or 9 songs (at 128 bit rate) while jogging plus it is small enough to either slip into your pocket or put on the included neckstrap.  <p>The only reason I am writing this review is because so many people gave it a bad score because it didn't work on XP for them.  The packaging does not say it supports XP!

<Title>Love it!!!!!
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was given this MP3 player by my teenage son for my birthday last week after hinting around that I wanted a walkman.  When I first got it, I thought "how can anything this tiny be any good????".  Well, I was quite pleasantly surprised!  The software loaded swiftly and smoothly into our Windows 98 SE operating system, and it even came with MusicMatch 6.1.  I immediately tried it out by popping a couple of cd's into the cd-rom drive, transferring what I wanted to MusicMatch's library and then selecting the tracks I wanted to download to the kazoo and...VOILA!...I had cd-quality music that sounded GREAT in no time!!  With something this small, I can download all my favorite sounds and take it to work and keep it conspicuously out of sight of the boss!  This is a powerful little gadget and I thank my son a hundred times over for giving one to me!

<Title>xp drivers
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>We purchased a Kazoo for our daughter at Christmas because of it's size and memory size. The price was good as well. We are running xp and like other people foud out, the drivers were not compatible. I spent many days searching the internet for drivers and e-mailed rca. The response was that they are in the process of making/building drivers but did not know when they would be available. I then had a friend search for the drivers and he did find them. So, I am happy to say that we can run the Kazoo with windows xp. The only other comment I have is that the batteries do not seem to last long.

<Content>I don't think there's anything I can say about the player that hasn't been said already - it's great!<br>My only beef is that they include MusicMatch on the CD for uploading music to the player. As soon as I installed MM, it started nagging me for my personal info .. WTF? Not only that, but everytime I'd shut down the program, it would constantly nag me to update to the ... version which had a bunch of extras that I didn't need or want. I finally went and downloaded ... for the program just so it would leave me alone.

<Content>I have been considering getting an mp3 player for a while, except i was never really impressed by the size of all of them out there. i think the first small ones I saw were the panasonic ones, but they were around 300 dollars. the size and the price impressed me as well as the ability to expand with mmc cards. <p>The controls are simple but what else do i need besides play, stop, forward, back? it sounds great but I recommend getting different headphones, i found the ones it came with uncomfortable. <p>The little plastic case could be better. I would prefer a leather one.<p>There is support for windows xp, but everyone looks in the wrong place. Don't look at the RCA site but the MusicMatch site. <p>This would be even better if I could download mp3 to the computer form the player itself.<p>I would recommend this player to anyone who wants a small basic mp3 player for a small price.

<Content>I wanted an MP3 Player for running and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  Also, I know the ones with the built-in FM will get cheaper as time goes by, so after reading many user ratings and since there was a [$$$] rebate, ... I decided to get this one.  It is sooooo awesome! The sound and size of this player are great! It blew me away from what I was expecting at this price.  The thing with Windows XP - The MusicMatch software (ver 7.1) from the CD it came with did not work.  Instead ... download the newer version 7.5 for free.  Also, it is a 32mb, but you can buy a card and pop in more memory.  I am very happy with this player and highly highly recommend getting it, it is definitely more bang for your buck! ...

<Title>pretty good
<Date>Sun Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>this player is very well worth the price.  it sounds very nice if you buy better headphones.  i had no problems at all installing the software and drivers.  i think all in all, i was able to begin listening to my player with 10 songs (@ 96 kbps) in it within 5-10 minutes.  although the player is truly small, i think the picture here is slightly deceiving.  the part where the batteries are inserted in the back potrudes slightly outwards such that the player isn't flat.  if you look very carefully at the picture, you'll see that it curves in the back.  also, besides the not so hot headphones, the case that they give you is pretty ugly.  it's all clear with two buttons (like metal buttons on a jacket).  but since the case is all clear and the player so small, the buttons are comparably big, obvious, and ugly.  that's why i don't even bother using it.  the player has all the basic features and the following:<br>dsp (flat, bass, pop, rock, jazz)<br>mode (shuffle, repeat, both)<br>lock<br>expansion slot (up to 128 mb = 128 + 32 internal = 160 mb)<p>there is no resume feature nor a backlit lcd (just a regular one).  i use this player for running, walking to class, and when i'm doing chores around the house.  the battery life is very good.  with 2 AAA batteries, i usually get about 8-10 hours of life.  i haven't really dropped it much, except in the house where there's carpet, but so far no problems whatsoever.  for the price, this player is a pretty good buy.  i would recommend getting a cooler case if you want to go running and strap it to your arm.  else, just slip it in your pocket and you barely feel that it's there.

Suggestion....convert your file from mp3 to mp3pro, it uses less memory but the quality of the sound is just as great.
