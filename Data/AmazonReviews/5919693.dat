<Content>I have never owned an Ipod Nano, which would be a comparable product. However, I can say that the Sansa e250 seems to be a better option for the price. It has FM stereo radio, a voice recorder (you can also record FM programs), and has a slot for a micro SDcard to expand the capacity. It is extremely easy to use and has a battery that can last around 15 hours (specs say up to 20 hours). The sound quality is excellent. It's only drawback is that loading songs from a CD to the MP3 player is not as friendly as I would like. In order to be able to keep your songs grouped into folders, you have manipulate the songs in the folder through the Windows Media player to insure that all the songs have the same album title. This is somewhat cumbersome when you are mixing songs into a folder from different CD's. The on-line support given by Sandisk when you have a problem, is very good. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.
