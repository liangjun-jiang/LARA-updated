<Content>There are some great features on this item! I was happy to find a nicely packaged unit with the manual and quick start guide handy. Pocket Studio arrived with a fully charged battery for immediate usage. The screen has great quality and color. After learning how to navigate through the drop down menus I was recording video straight from my DVD with the software and cables provided. I saved all the movie files on a 4 GB SD memory card. I was able to transfer 9 1-hour movies and play them back at 24 to 30FBS! DV camera DV Recorder feature are Cool. Great for taking that just in time shot or video.

<Title>BEST DEVICE

<Content>I REALLY ENJOY THE DEVICE.  I LIKE THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES, THE UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE PROTECTION OF THE FLASH.  I ALSO LIKE THE SOUND QUALITY.  THE SIZE IS VERY COMFORTABLE, THEREFORE, MAKING THE DEVICE EASY TO HANDLE.  I THINK THE PRODUCT IS BETTER THAN THE IPOD, BECAUSE YOU GET MORE FEATURES AND VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY.  I HAVE ALREADY RECOMMENDED THE PRODUCT TO SEVERAL OF MY CO-WORKERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED AND WILL BE PURCHASING.  I HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS:  A LITTLE MORE ZOOM IN THE CAMERA WOULD BE EXCELLENT, ALONG WITH A LONGER BATTERY LIFE.
