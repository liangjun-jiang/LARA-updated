<Content>This player is very user friendly. It is feather light, and holds days worth of music, I think I maxed it out with 20 full albums. It will play for a day or two on a little AAA battery. Records about 50 hours of voice or radio shows. I love the radio feature. Comes with a very functional leather carrying case and the best sounding ear buds I've ever heard. Not that I'm an expert on these things, but this is one cool little player!
