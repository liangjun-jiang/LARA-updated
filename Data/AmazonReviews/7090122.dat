<Title>great sound for the money
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>sound is surprisingly good for the investment.  However - I sure wish I could find some sort of case/ accessory so I could clip it to my belt.. It's kind of awkward that way..

<Title>Affordable and easy to use!
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this little thing.  Granted, I'm new to the MP3 thing, so I'm probably pretty easily impressed.  The price is great, it holds a lot of music, and it couldn't be easier to use.  It's about the size of a traditional pack of gum.  This is so much easier to use then lugging around a personal CD player w/ an assortment of CD's (see I told you I was new to MP3s).  As another reviewer said, I also wish that it came with some kind of clip or something so you could secure it to your waistband or something, but it's small enough to fit in your hand or pocket.  I plan to buy more to give as Christmas presents!

<Title>Stopped Working in a month

<Content>I loved this for the month it worked. Then it wouldn't boot up past the PEARL screen. Now I just have a $40.00 Flash storage device, because it will still allow storage on it.

<Title>Great little MP3 at a great price!
<Date>Sat Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I agree with the other reviews...this is the first music device we've purchased and it's really easy to use and upload music.  We bought it for my 9 year old daughter because she kept destroying her CD's!  I was afraid she'd have a hard time figuring out the menus, but true to tradition...electronics are always easier for those young brains.  She has no problem chosing her songs, repeating and shutting down.  Now she gives me her CD's and I upload them to the MP3 and guard the originals.  I too would like to find some sort of case for it as I'm sure she's going to drop it and break it.  I love the AAA battery, we buy NiMH rechargables and it lasts her about a week.  Overall, it's a great buy! Enjoy!

<Title>Pretty bad
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is bad overall. The menu navigation is slow and the headphone jack is in the way of the record and menu buttons. Mine STOPPED WORKING AFTER ABOUT 20 DAYS which was 5 days to late to get my money back. My friend also bought an RCA product and it broke too. When it RARELY turns on the songs DO NOT play right and skip every second. It will turn off seemingly at random and now the computer says it is a currpted file and cannot even be used for storage (it use to work on my computer). HORRIBLE PRODUCT!

<Content>I love it. It is easy to use. In addition to playing music I also store some backup files on it. I use it just like you would a memory stick.

<Title>Blows iPod Shuffle and Nano out of the water
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the 512MB version of this player and it served me well over the last 9 months.  The Micro SD slot basically gives you infinite song capacity and the addition of a recorder is nice for note taking (the quality may not be up to par for podcasting or prosumer production work but maybe it sounded bad because I was holding it while I recorded).  My only complaint about this is that I can't seem to find any way to bookmark a part of an mp3 file (like lengthy podcasts) to resume later and it cannot play iTunes music store files (and that's to be expected with any non-Apple player).  I still use my 5th gen iPod for the car, but you cannot beat this in a situation where your mp3 player could be damaged or broken.  If you need a music player for the gym or blue collar type work, this is a highly affordable and durable device that you can afford to have damaged or broken.  The 512MB model only runs for $32.  Another strong selling point is you don't need any proprietary software to transfer songs to your player.  In other words, throw out the CD that comes with it if you already have a great piece of mp3 playing software.  Lastly three words: user replaceable AAA battery.  Take that, Apple.  I would have bought this for my mother instead of an iPod Shuffle had I known about it.  It was less than half the price.
