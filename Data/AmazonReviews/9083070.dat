<Title>Good all in one player
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player, because this is a device that you can use it as a digital wallet, video player, music player, and pdf viewer.  I bought it at amazon with the price of $367, now is even lower....=(  Those of you likes to have one should get it now!  The speaker is not very good, but if you listen it from a headphone it is pretty good.  Fast download speed with the USB 2.  Battery life is not as long as it said on the techsheet.  My 504 freeze a few time...I think it is because I am pressing my buttons' too fast, you do need to wait for the HDD to run.  But overall I still love this machine...I've already get all the accessories.  You can get the DVR station at Walmart for $79 includ tax.  =D

<Title>Good for Recording DVDs and Television Shows for Later Viewing
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm going to keep this simple. I just wanted something that would allow me to EASILY record television shows (I have direct TV) and DVD's onto a portable video player.    I purchased the optional DVR station.    Within a few minutes, I had figured out how to record from my Direct TV satellite box, or from a DVD.  Screen quality is great.  Plus, right before you start recording the television show or DVD, you can adjust the brightness, color, contrast, hue, etc. to suit your tastes.  That is, your're not stuck with whatever the television show or DVD gives you if that's not how you want to view it on the Archos 504.  That's it.  I'm not using it for photos or music, so I can't comment on that.  What I can say is that I'm glad I didn't buy the 80gb iPod, as I didn't want to be limited to what they had for sale on iTunes.  The only way I was going to purchase the iPod was if recording shows was horribly complicated or difficult with the Archos 504.  Just the opposite. It was easy.  You just need to remember to connect from the audio and video OUT on your satellite or cable box or DVD player to the DVR station.  Intially, I connected the DVR station to the front inputs on my DVD player, but that produced nothing as those inputs were audio and video IN.  I had to connect to the BACK of the DVD player and the BACK of the satellite box in order to find the OUT connectors.  And there was no format conversion necessary.  Just recorded it straight off the tv and off the DVD and then watched it on the 504.  I love this thing.  I need to find out more about it, such as battery life, etc.  But for now, I couldn't be more pleased.  I like iPod, but I love Archos.

<Title>NO RAW SUPPORT
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>No RAW file support.  I was told by a coworker that these are great storage devices for a DSLR but if you shoot in RAW you are out of luck.  Now I'm looking in to Epson P-3000, P-4000, P-5000 units because they have RAW support as well all the other functions of this unit (as I can tell).  Perhaps these devices just serve different purposes.  This seems to be marketed as a portable media player whereas the Epson units will play video, audio/mp3, and store photos but aren't marketed as mobile DVRs.

<Title>Besides the unimpressive volume, this thing is great
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a mp3 player from Archos about a year or two ago (I think it was the Gmini 200) and I sadly dropped it and broke it pretty bad so it was time to get a new player.  I was really struggling between getting the Archos 504, Archos AV500, or the Cowon A2.  I ended up picking the 504 because of the extra 10GB of hard drive space and the sex appeal of it :).  I've been using it for about a week so far and these are my impressions:  Pro's: - The player have a very attractive design - hard drive size (40GB for me, but goes up to 160GB) was perfect for me, as I have PLENTY of music and videos to put on it. - The screen is very big, bright and crisp for playing videos or viewing pictures. - The GUI is slightly customizable, allowing you to pick your background picture from whatever pictures you put on the device, changing the color of the text, and the color of the theme. - Plays all my .avi files perfectly (90% of the vids on my comp are .avi) - The battery is a MONSTER! Tested it for audio and lasted 11 hrs.  haven't tested it for video yet. - One minor feature I like is when you're listening to music, it will show the usual info of the song your listening to, while showing what song will be playing next if you pressed the next/fast forward button. It also picks up on album art very well (looks like all that hard working collecting the album art worked out) - Like the fact that you can rate songs, and then play songs based on their ratings. The rating is from 1-5 and you can play all the songs that you rated 5 like a playlist. - can be connected as an external hard drive for drag and drop functionality, or you can connect it in windows media mode, using windows media player to transfer your files. The choice is yours. - and of course, one of the main reasons I liked this player, the removable battery feature  Now for the few things that stops this player from getting a perfect rating.  Cons: - its kinda big.  My old mp3 player could fit into the palm of my hand. to navigate this thing, you definitely need two hands, unless you have some skills i dont know about lol.  If you wear baggy pants, it shouldn't be too much of a problem to fit this in there, but otherwise you might have a hard time.  - there are 3 buttons you use to navigate up, down, left, and right which slows down how fast you can navigate the interface compared to a joystick that my old mp3 player had.   - The volume is not very impressive on this thing.  Granted I'm listening to it with some headphones I've had for two years and it might be time for me to get some new ones, the volume doesn't go as high as I would like.  Wouldn't recommend this for people who plan to listen to audio books as well as music.   - the built in speaker is useless.  You have the option to have it turn on automatically (whenever headphones aren't plugged in) or just turn it off.  I turned it off cuz the volume on it is horrible. it gets distorted at the highest volume, and you can bearly hear anything with the volume turned down below the highest setting.  At the end of the day, this player is pretty good. The low volume on it is VERY disappointing to me because i like to listen to my music loud, but i bought some noise cancelling headphones recently so maybe that will help.

<Title>NO RAW format Support!
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The following review is only interesting for photographer:  The main reason for me to buy the product was to backup and store photos from my Canon to a harddisk and have a fast viewer for the photos. I shoot the photos in .jpg and .raw format.  I upgraded my Archos 504 from the former AV 420 which did support .jpg and .raw backup from my Canon, but the photo viewer was incredible slow.  You don't find any Information about storing the .raw format on your Archos... I bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really DONT support .raw ... I asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was NO, they decided against raw format.  Nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...  Thanks Archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like Creative.

<Title>The 504 160 Gb is great
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered the optional DVR with this and I think everything works great and is easy to use.  I can set all the shows I watch in yahoo and load them right to the 504 set it in the DVR cradle and it records all of my programs on its own. I just grab it as I run out the door and I can watch all of my shows on the run.  The case it comes with is worthless but I just went out and got a cheap $5.00 camra case and that works just fine.  With 160gb I'm able to carry all of my music and all of the movies I own in my pocket.  with the dvr I can play them on any tv.  So far I'm impressed with the quality of this device.

<Title>IT'S OK BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ZEN!!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product after Christmas and waited with eager anticipation. I also own a Creative Zen Vision W 30gb. I wanted this device because not only am i a music and photo junkie, i'm a video junkie, so i was mesmerized by the idea of all those movies on my portable device and being able to directly record video. I was eager to give this a try with 80gb and a video recorder how could you go wrong!? Out of the box the Archos is a well built attractive device. The navigation is a little tricky (it's not intuitive at all), but for 80gb, a recorder and the price, I was willing to sacrifice. Sound quality is pretty good, but i was shocked at the video quality considering the Archos is first and foremost a video device. I probably wouldn't have been so critical if i didn't own a zen, but the zen has spoiled me, because in comparison the archos lacked color, crispness and depth in both videos and photos. It was just unacceptable in comparison. I don't know what the actual difference in technology is, but they both have the same resolutions so that's not it. If you've never seen a zen vision upclose and personal, you should! But don't do it if you're looking to buy something else, because everything else will pale in comparison. I also purchased the dvd station. The archos is feature rich, so that's not the problem. Well after playing with it for a few days, i returned it. I'm going to purchase the creative zen v 60gb. I would rather do the conversions to put video on it than to sacrifice the picture quality, and the creative does have a compact flash drive allowing it to accept almost anything, the archos is strictly usb. But overall if you need a portable media device that records inline ausio and video, then the archos will fit the bill.

<Title>great PMP
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the PMP at a quite low price. it reads divx and xvid (but not quarter pixel), audio ... drawbacks: as stated on other reviews: the speaker is useless and it seems that the volume can be limited (but it's not greatly unconvenient). you have to buy an adapter for charging the battery (usb is quite slow and you have to rely on a nearby computer) ... seems that archos has learned from apple and the merchandising on ipod. Apart from that, it's a step ahead of other PMPs (great screen!). I'm considering buying the DVR station for recording tv or watching divx on tv.

<Title>best PMP ever
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>of all the PMP i have used this one is defianetly the best allows you to plug straight into DVD DVR VCR or if you really wanted to a console. plays music beautiful picture PFD viewer it prety much does every thing you could ever want.  the only gripes i have is that there is already a dead pixel and i have only hade it for a week i might send it back in but its no bigh deal.  if you want an ipod replacement this will defiantly be sufficeit plays music and just fits in your pocket fine if you are willing to sacrifice power for comfort of course great product a must buy for any geek disatisfied with the ipod.  another note that if you are transfering from an ipod ou will need to change your music files from MP4, M4A, and WMA but its not much of a hassle with DB power amp on download.com.
