<Title>NO RESUME!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The title says it all.  If you bought this player for listening to audiobooks, which is what I did, you'll be extremely disappointed that you'll have to fast forward through the book every time you start it up since there is no resume feature.  Considering audiobooks are anywhere from 3 to 8 hours long in most cases, or at least the pieces you get from audible are, it's totally inconvenient to start playing from the beginning each time you turn it on.  Get used to the fast forward button and remembering exactly what time you were at because you're going to be doing a lot of it.  Lame.

<Title>Progressively Worse
<Date>Mon Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I thought it was a pretty nice little MP3 player, although the 60 songs it holds has always been a thorn in my side. I didn't mind converting everthing over to real player since it doesn't play itunes, however, after about three months I had to change the battery...After changing the battery, the mp3 player would randomly shut off, which became a constant problem after every battery change, though eventually the problem would solve itself. Approximately a year later, the battery cover was also constantly falling off for no apparent reason. Now, about a year and a half since purchase, it has completely died, only playing about two minutes worth before shutting off on its own and refusing to reboot for several minutes. It's a great player for the price, but I would have liked something a little more dependable with a larger memory.

<Content>electrical short kills cheap-med quality head phones!  i lost four before i figure out the problem. and no, it was not just one player. i returned it and got a new one, and it did the same thing. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 because it records radio very well.DO NOT BUY!

<Content>As most who bought this one knows the battery door did indeed break on my sons. It skips and freezes really bad. He still uses it but I do not think it would hurt his feelings if it got stolen at school! lol

<Title>bad investment
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wished I had read all of the reviews for this when I bought mine two years ago. It is worse than a piece of junk because I paid too much money for it and it is useless. The buttons are not easy to use, when I think I am turning it up, I have somehow skipped to the FM radio and cannot seem to get back, other times it seems to cycle through the same 5 songs for no apparent reason. I am still very bitter about spending so much money for a worthless piece of junk - not to mention all the time I have spent trying to make it work.

<Title>Great Fun....but.........
<Date>Mon May 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you have big hands-or fingers..look elsewhere. You need to have some nails to get the nubs of the controls to move. Soundwise, It's great! Looks are ok..orange backlite..blue would have been better I think. Comes with armband,battery,over the ear individual headphones. I know this is key, but read the manual! I didn't. Kinda of jumped in. I did not install any software that came with this item. Not a big fan of music match. Drag and drop. The player has a shuffle button--in the settings. Cool factor of 10 with the fm player AND recorder! It saves files as mp3 that you can upload anytime. comes with a free month of audible.com also. Very cool.

<Title>A great sports mp3 player
<Date>Fri Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this MP3 player to use while running and lifting weights, and it is perfect. Like most good players, it has great sound; you can change the mode (Jazz, Bass, Rock, etc.) while the music's still playing; and battery life is pretty good, too. The device comes with a sturdy removeable belt clip, and a great armband as well. In addition, the player has a very clever control/navigation design that allows you to quickly & easily play the music you want (by title, folder, genre, or artist). Finally, this device even has a finger sensor that measures your pulse (although I haven't read the manual yet on how to use this feature). For the price, this is a solid sport MP3 player that's worth getting.

<Title>A piece of junk
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was very happy with this item when I first purchased it except for the battery compartment.  The screw has never held it shut and it would come off continuously if the belt clip did not hold it on.  Now, 2 months later it will only play the one song that came preloaded or 1 preset station.  I cannot get it to display any of the other screen options so am unable to access the audio book loaded on it, add more music or listen to any other radio station.  I would not recommend this item to anyone.  The manual suggests if you have a programming problem to remove the battery and start over.  This seems to suggest they expect you to have problems.  My battery has been disconnected MANY times and this now no longer solves the problem.

<Title>Over time....
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first three months I had this player it was great.  It did everything I needed it to do...play music while I ran for anywhere between 30-45 minutes.  However, now that I've had it about 6 months things are starting to go wrong.  The shuffle doesn't shuffle nor does the repeat repeat.  The button to move forward through tracks also refuses to work.  Its a nice little player for the money and for the first 3-5 months you have it...but beware of its functionality over time.

<Title>I concur, a piece of junk
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought an RCA Lyra 2 years ago, and use it for jogging. It has been through sweat, rain, freezing conditions, and the only problem I had with it is the headphone jack sometimes loses sound in one ear. My wife decides that she wants an MP3 player, so I talked her into getting the RCA Lyra because of the price and the sucess of the older model. What a mistake that was.   I put a few songs on it for my wife, and she was only able to use it once before everything on it got corrupted and wouldn't play. I wiped everything clean, reloaded it, and two days later the same thing happens. Reloading songs every couple of days is no big deal, and I wouldn't give it a 1 review if the problems stopped there.   The joystick is horrible. Up and down to change the volume works OK, but it is very dificult to move right and left. If you can press it hard enough using only one hand, most of the time it acts as if you pressed straight down, which adds to a preset while on radio.   If you only listen to one radio station or if you never want to skip through your playlist, buy this MP3 player. If you want a device that is functional, keep on looking.

<Title>Awful, Awful, Awful
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In the end, this "rugged" device only lasted about 4 months before it broke (its demise coming after falling on carpeted floor at the gym).  Prior to breaking, it was greatly disappointing.  First, it was unable to keep the music files properly sorted - it always placed them in the wrong folder.  Second, it never picked up where I left off - it always started from the beginning of the play list.  This was particularly problematic because third, the joystick (used to maneuver through the play list among other functions) was often inoperable, and then would suddenly over-react by four songs (or volume levels, etc).  Compounding that problem, fourth, the player's display would only list about 1/3 of the songs actually loaded.  Fifth, changing the battery practically requires a blow torch.  Six, the headphones malfunctioned about two weeks before the device broke.  There's probably a seven and eight too - I've just forgotten them.  About the only good thing I can say for the RCA Lyra is that it didn't electrocute me or otherwise cause me physical pain.

<Title>Decent but...
<Date>Thu Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, I got this little gadget as a valentine's present.  Everything was allright at first, but, as I quickly found out it ONLY plays MP3 or WMA files...that means all Itunes files need to be converted before you can load 'em.  Plus, "around 100 songs" really means 60.  The first few seconds I had it, I broke the nail that keeps the battery in place (no super human here, it said turn with penny, I did and it broke), but since the belt clip locks over it, it wasn't really a problem...until you wanted to change the battery.  or reset the dang thing when the screen froze..which it did frequently.  the belt clip is next to impossible to take off once it's on.  The free headphones are VERY painful to my ears, so I'd suggest some replacements (unless you dig that kind).  Oh, and it doesn't stay on the arm band when jogging if you do anything faster than a brisk walk.  at least not for me.  anyways, it's more expensive than a shuffle these days, I only got it because no other model had this many features with a display screen for so low a price...but..  i'd save up for the big ones if i were you.

<Title>I agree with all of the others - Plus the Belt Clip Sucks! (and the Customer Service!!!)
<Date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just like most of the other reviewers I have not been happy with my Lyra. Every other complaint you see listed applies to my experience as well, but here is my biggest complaint. The belt clip sucks!!  After using the thing for lest then a month the flimsy plastic belt clip just fell apart. I spent hours (literaly) tying to reach someone at RCA to help me. After way to many calls I finally reached someone at the Customer Satisfaction office (or something to that effect) who appoligized profusely for my frustrating experinece and promised to do everthing humanly possible to solve my problem. After I explained the problem, she quickly told me I was out of luck, they do not make any replacements for that part. So much for jumping throught hoops! So now this $130 "sports" MP3 player is useless during sports because of a badly designed 3 cent peice of plastic ... and don't get me started on the arm band!  Don't get it!
