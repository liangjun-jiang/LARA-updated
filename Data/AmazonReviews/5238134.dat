<Title>Worth the Money
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[UPDATE]  Nearly two years later, I still have a working Creative Zen Micro. However, aside from the technical setbacks mentioned at the end of this review, I have encountered a few more problems. After several months of use, maybe a year, the ear buds broke, forcing me to buy a new ones (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JUZE1Q/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0945948-5579607">Earbud Headphones - White/blue</a> from Sony). Another problem that I can't seem to figure out is that sometimes, while it is playing a song, it gets briefly interrupted by another song or sound for a brief second and does this repeatedly throughout the song until you skip to another song. Another annoying issue is that sometimes, when I hook up the player to my computer, I cannot organize my tracks with the Creative Organizer because it cannot detect the player for some strange reason. However, luckily, I can still use the Creative Explorer to import new tracks, etc. Though the Creative Zen Micro remains functional for me, I feel that you should probably spend an extra $100 for a better MP3 player, such as the Ipod or Zune.  [/UPDATE]  For a while, I have investigated MP3 players, trying to decide which one I should buy and particuarly comparing them to the Ipod Mini. Based on the information I gathered, I made a unique move by stepping outside of the box and buying a Creative Zen Micro instead. I've concluded that the Creative Zen Micro greatly surpasses the Ipod mini in several categories, making it much more worth my money.  First of all, one of the biggest things to consider is the cost of the item. I was able to purchase my Creative Zen Micro for $171, including shipping and handling, as well as tax. The Ipod mini, on the other hand, is only available for around $240, not including shipping and handling or tax.   For $70 cheaper, I get 5 GB of memory space, an FM tuner, an organizer, 2 separate batteries (each providing 12 hours of playtime), a case, belt clip, stand, pouch, headphones, AC/DC power adapter, and USB 2.0 cable. However, the Ipod mini, at $240, offers only 4 GB of space and only 18 hours of playtime. It lacks an FM tuner, case, pouch, AC/DC adapter, and organizer, which are useful accessories and features to have.   - An FM tuner always provides refreshingly new music, which comes in handy when the songs get tiresome or repetitive when listened to too often. - The case and pouch help protect the MP3 player itself and save the buyer of having the time and money of having to purchase them.  - The organizer is helpful in keeping a record of events and contacts.  - The AC/DC adapter is an alternative way to charge the MP3 player, which becomes particularly useful when a computer is not available.  Finally, one of the main things that makes the Creative Zen Micro so superior to the Ipod Mini is its sound quality. Creative is known for its enhanced sound quality, which is one of the best in the business, whereas Ipod's is simply mediocre. Another additional bonus about the Creative Zen Micro is its compatibility with WMA files, which save the user time from having to convert WMA files to MP3 files. It also keeps a list of the songs that have been played the most and those that have been played the least. This helps the user single out favorite songs and new songs. Though navigation may feel a bit clumsy for some, the Micro's search feature makes finding tracks a breeze, whereas   to the best of my knowledge, the Ipod does not have one.  There are a flaws to mention about the Micro however:  1. Though some people are completely comfortable with the Micro's navigation, I find it is a little difficult. There are only 3 sensitivity settings and all three feel strange to me. The thing that is probably the most bothersome is how the scroller is also the selector, so if you're scrolling and accidentally tap it too hard, it will select something you did not want selected. I also think that the Ipod Mini's circular scroller is faster and more intuitive, but the Micro's vertical one is tolerable.   2. Yes, some people have claimed that their Creative Zen Micro broke within a matter of months or they bumped into some technical difficulties. This is not a myth. I, too, have been a victim, as my MP3 player froze a few days after receiving it from Amazon. However, I contacted Creative and they were very helpful and prompt in responding. Though I did have to pay a few dollars for shipping the product back to them, I received a fully functional replacement that I still use on a regular basis to this day (months later). I have researched a little to see how many people have suffered from any kind of technical difficulties with the Micro and have found that there are indeed a large amount. There are some who are more unfortunate than others, but it is more likely that you will not suffer from such problems and if you do, you will receive an excellent replacement.   Despite these few annoyances, the Creative Zen Micro is worth it. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase as I saved $70 while receiving more features than the Ipod Mini.

<Title>Worst product ever: Get the iPod
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a Creative Zen Micro in April and want to throw it against the wall in Dec. If I could, I would give it 0 stars. At first, it seemed like a winner. The fact that you could download mp3s rather than paying $1 per song via iTunes, I thought it would be a good deal. Unfortunately, this thing is so poorly made that it's been defective since the first three months. First the screen went out and what good is it if you can't see the titles of songs? The earbuds broke soon after. Then the thing just started turning off for no reason and having to re-build. Now, after just six months, my computer no longer finds it via the USB... thus can't download or do anything. Customer support? Non existent as well. I just wasted $200. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

<Title>Tech is pointless if you can't hear the music
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Tech isn't worth much if you can't get the music to the headphones. Buy something else.  My daughter bought hers in July. She returned the first one because it would not load music. She returned the second one because the headphone jack socket failed. Now she has to return the 3rd one because the headphone jack socket is failing.   Her experience is not uncommon.  She recommended the micro to a friend (it's really cool if its working). Her friend's headphone jack socket is failing.  (...)Consensus is that the only people satisfied with zen micro have not owned it long enough for the head phone jack socket to fail.   The problem is so common that there is a web site that gives the step by step instructions for fixing the socket. (with a caveat that you will void your warranty and should not attempt this unless you have professional soldering skills)  (...)

<Title>Don't buy it!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have never written an online review before but I feel compelled to do so.  While it appears some people have had good luck with this product, I found it a complete piece of trash.  My friends laughed when I said, "It was great until it stopped working."  I didn't mind the touchy controls and really loved the size and shape of the player.  Others on this site have described the many technical problems with the Zen Micro.  I will simply say I traded in my first one when it died only to have my second one become very sick in less than one month.  I now have an ipod nano with only 1/2 the storage capacity of my last zen micro but having 500 songs that play beats having 1000 songs that don't.

<Title>Love it to bits
<Date>Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Have had my micro since Feb this year and have no problems whatsoever. Great little player - actually has a replacable battery so you don't have to throw it out once the battery dies, like you do with the iPod. Just remember to download the firmware upgrade before you use it, I didn't know about this and had a minor issue with the battery life (fixed with the firmware upgrade).

<Title>Great player... for the first two weeks
<Date>Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player as a late Christmas present to myself this past January, figuring that while it was kind of pricy, that meant it would be high quality and last a while.  Wrong!  While I really loved the player when it worked properly, it hardly ever did.  After about a month, I started having compatability problems with transferring Napster songs I bought, despite countless upgrades.  After two months, the headphone jack started to go out.  Once it got so bad I could hardly use the player anymore, I sent it in to get repaired.  Not two weeks after I got it back, it fell about three feet off a table and onto the (carpeted) floor, and completely quit working.  According to Creative's customer service, they need $25 just to LOOK at it, so I'm done with this.    While the Micro is great in terms of features, it's badly designed and cheaply made.  I am extremely put out that I spent $250 on a piece of electronics that broke twice in less than 10 months.  I will be upgrading to an iPod Nano as soon as possible.

<Title>Excellent player - And Not an Ipod.
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this primarily for the FM radio - Apple and Ipod have dug in their heels and refused to include one.. Dopes. But then there are other advantages.  1) The sound quality is superior - it's truly excellent, with lower background noise with Creative than with IPod. See the specs. 2) The thought of having to buy the entire Ipod/Itunes/Music Industry monopoly seemed a bit bothersome. With the Micro you can run your toy off of RealAudio or MusicMatch or any of a number of other programs. 3) You can replace the battery - easily. 4) It used to be in competition with the Ipod Mini, and it's just got more memory. There's more bang for your buck. It is larger than the Ipod Nano, but..5GB!.. and I don't find the extra ounce or two to be a burden. 5) It leaves you as an individual - not one of the millions in the cult-of-iPod - I generally don't like 'mass fashion statement' accessories and I'm glad to be able avoid this one.  Creative has been an excellent alternative with no downside so far. Actually there is one downside, which is that 100 companies make accessories for Ipod and Creative doesn't have many similar add-on toys or cases available. But still I say - buy a Zen - you won't regret it.

<Title>Nice but needs to back to product development
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player a litle over a month ago... sounds good , nice features but it is realy unfortunate how badly it works... download and sync problems( Napster). Whatever you do don't drop it even a soft landing can damage the unit.... Battery life is highly oversold ( 12 hours! not in my experience- try maybe 6) .   When I return this unit it will be the sencond and last time.

<Title>The headphone jack s**ks
<Date>Sat Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the Zen in late August.  It worked fine until recently when the headphone jack started to "wobble" and distort sound...now I have to constantly touch/tap the headphone jack area for it to play correctly....I'm about to send it in for repair -- wish me luck... I love (LOVED) everything else about it until recently....

<Title>Good for those who aren't stuck on IPODS
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really like this player. The first day I got the player I wasn't used to the EXTREMELY senstive touch pads and pressed to many buttons too fast and it freezed. All I had to do was take out the batteries and it worked fine. It takes awhile to get used to the senstive scrool pad, but i like this thing better then the ipod. The software is extremely easy to use it's a lot like itunes. The only real con with this player is the battery life. If you listen to it for like an hour to 2 hours straight it'll be out of battery. That kind of makes it a hassle but its worth it. I really like this player better than ipods i've used. It's looks are awesome. it's WAY smaller than the ipod mini in my opinion, and the blue light around the outside is very cool. I've had many compliments about its looks and one of my friends bought one because she loved mine so much. It can fit in your pocket easily and you can throw it in your purse as well. The earbuds it comes with are not so great i went out and got some $30 really good earbuds to replace the ones the manufactuers give you, they have good sound, but fall out of your ears. Overall this is a really cool looking, durable, little guy who will make you happy.
