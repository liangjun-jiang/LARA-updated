<Title>The disappearing MP3 player
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved this product for 4 months (it does have lots of gadgets that I love) and then.....for no reason at all my computer no longer recognizes it! Rhapsody doesn't recognize it....It's turned into a ghost although I can see it!   I have a 5gb but a lot of the H10's are having the same problem.  I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....

<Title>I like this product
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this MP3 player for a little over a month and it's been good. The price and the storage capacity of this device are the two main features that drew me to it. I have 150+ CDs and decided that storing them on an MP3 player would be better than carrying all them around. The only problem is when the MP3 player is connected to the computer via USB 2.0, the player sometimes freezes up. I freaked out the first time this happend and called the company. It turned out everything was fine and all I had to do is hit the reset button on the player . It has alot of features minus the abilty to play videos. But that doesn't really bother me. I don't download music with a subcription service, so I can't tell you how it does with that.

<Title>DONT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR A MONTH
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is crap after about 9 months. If you dont mind paying 150 for something that doesn't last, go ahead and buy this. BUT TRUST ME. THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP. Yeah, I loved it too after a month, now it is making me want to throw it into the ocean with all of the pain and frustration it has caused me.

<Title>its worth 150
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Plus its blue, works, color screen, 20GB HD, Battery lasts about 12-14hrs. FM works rather well.  Minus can't really adjust music or make playlists on the unit. Have to delete them & re-enter them. & if you want a playlist, you have to make it on your computer & download it. So software! also a little bulky. Some times dosn't come on.

<Title>Absolutly Great
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an amazing piece of technology, and an awesome price.  The sound quality is great, the user interface is easy to understand and very intuitional (it doesn't take a lot fo thought...), and of course the capacity is amazing.  I have about 1300 songs on it right now and plenty of room for a lot more.  Only problem is that every now and then it has to be reset and it can be a bit glitchy, but that's pretty mch the way it is with all mp3 players.

<Title>piece of s***
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this player for only a few months.  It worked fine for only a little while then it lost a system file.  I've had to reformat the hard drive 3 times since then, losing all my music files each time.  After each reformat, I install new firmware.  The player locks up frequently requiring it to be reset and then it loses a system file.  I am ready to throw it in the trash.

<Title>Not Working....
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Received my remanufactured iRiver on time. When my iRiver H10 was working, it was an incredible MP3. However, within a few months of using my refurbished iRiver H10, it started to freeze up on me. Numerous reset attempts were made on the H10 to reboot it. Eventually, after resetting the H10 too many times it no longer turns on or hold a charge. I would highly recommend buying a Factory New iRiver H10 and stay away from a refurbished one.
