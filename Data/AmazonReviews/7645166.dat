<Title>Creative Zen V freezes up during play
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I liked the looks and colors for the Creative Zen V and the price. I bought these for 2 children ages 9 and 11. Both players have frozen up during play several times already. The "owners manual" has very little information for trouble shooting which led me to having to email tech support. There is a TINY reset button by the on/off control, so small you have to use a small safety pin needle to reset it. This unfreezes the unit but I've had to do it multiple times on both players already. Nothing was said about this in prior reviews so buyer beware. No technology is without issues I suppose. Still a good little player for the price, durable.

<Title>This product is awful
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player for my daughter for Christmas.  It worked for about 1 hour, then it went blank and never revived.  It isn't even recognized by my computer. When I tried to e-mail Creative I get a long list of what I need to do to get this working.  I don't have time for this. My son has an Ipod and never had the trouble we've had with this.  Do not purchase this item

<Title>This little mp3 player rocks
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great MP3 player at a really decent price.  The display is clear, the color graphics are great - and the unit is tiny!  This player interfaces easily with the PC.  On the downside, there are not too many accessories available, and the product purchase does not include a charger.  If you are looking for a compact MP3 player that holds about 300-500 songs - and graphics are important to you, this is the one for you.

<Title>Still a big mystery to me...
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I wish it was as reliable as my old, brick - size RCA player, but it isn't . It has some good days and bad ones. On good days it rocks. The quality of sound is great and operating this little fella is very intuitive. On bad days it just skips. It skips like every few minutes, and jeez is it anoying.... Since it is a MTP player you need Creative software to transfer songs to the player. I use it with Rhapsody and it works just fine.

<Title>"UP TO" 500 songs isn't even close---try about 250
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son has been downloading music on this since he got it Christmas Day and he's used up all of his space at about 240 songs.  The Amazon ad neglects to mention that it depends on the size of the song that you're downloading.  You'd have to download some awful small songs to reach 500 (or even close to it).  Also, he hasn't even put pictures on this thing and still all the room is taken up!!  Not happy with this one.  I would recommend the 2 GB Zen if you want to get 500 songs on it!

<Title>Good value
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We got one of these recently and have been using it for several weeks. Nice features include  - small and lightweight -- easy to carry around with you  - displays album cover art in the little LCD screen.  - compatible with Yahoo Music.  It has "frozen up" at least once. When that happened, I just took out a paperclip and pushed a little reset button inside the player.  Overall, this seems to be a good option to go with, considering the price and the features you get.

<Title>Zen Review (original, I know)
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Alrighty, so Im going to review this, I guess. Over-all, this is a great product- It holds enough music for my current tastes, the recording from a line-in feed is handy although it ocasionally forgets to seperate the CD tracks, and the volume control is phenomenal. The earphones it comes with are a bit on the poor side, but even so on the lowest volume setting, I can hear perfectly in a quiet room... The interface takes a little getting used to, or it did for me. You have to hold the "back" button to bring up an options menu; Until you get used to it, you'll often skip back a screen, which gets annoying. The customization settings are great, allowing you to change the screen orientation, sleep timer, idle timer, make play lists, change them, etc., All of which may be standard, but I still think its neat. Despite some small mishaps (dropping or accidently striking via a corner) it plays well, and still looks good. The lanyard it comes with is much better than most arm-bands, and is great for us poor folk (I bike an hour to work in the middle of the night) as it putsd the player somewhere it wont fall out or get hit. The software had me a little edgy at first, until I found some of it was merely redundant to prevent possible problems. Mainly, the interface is confusingly complex, and the instruction manual only gave the most bare-bones advice, about the few things which should be obvious.  As a storage device, you have to disconnect the player before removing from the computer, which I found a problem (It wouldn't disconnect the first time), it can only be charged by attaching to a USB port, which was a temporary issue, and it wont play on Macs, which my household switched to just days before I got it (which is my problem, and not the players), but other than that I found it to be at least addequate for my needs. I'm not sure why you would want to store photos on a music device, but the sample images had extraordinary quality for the size of the screen. The screen itself is a marvel- bright, very clear, and so far without a scratch. The best part is, unlike most players Ive seen, merely keeping it in my pocket or rubbing it lightly in the travel bag it comes with removes most grease. All in all, not the best player out there, but the best for it's price range- I refuse to pay $30 -$45 dollars more simply to have a different color case or a smaller playerr with less capacity.

<Content>The Zen V is a very user friendly device. I have never owned a MP3 player before and had no trouble using this one.  The programs are simple and putting songs on the player is very easy.  It is small and can fit in your pocket.  You may need to get a new set of ear phones, the ones that it came with were rather large and I could not use them.  Other than that, an awesome   product.

<Title>Garbage out of the box!
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After doing quite a bit of research, I settled on this mp3 player as the "big" gift for my daughter this Christmas. She was thrilled to open it Christmas morning, and we immediately loaded a few cds on the device so she could enjoy it. By Christmas evening...I was having problems. As she attempted to load a couple more cds, the computer could not recognize the device any longer. I went to the creative website and went through the troublshooting. I immediately was downloading "patches" and fixes" and "firmware" updates. When it was over, the device worked! Great! I solved the problem. Surely it will be a smooth ride from here. It just needed an update. Wrong! The device worked smoothly for about a week afterward when it started to freeze. Once frozen, it reverted back to the orginal problem of the computer not recognizing it. As other reviews have mentioned, the only way to unfreeze this device is to jam a bent safety pin into the side of it and hope that works, or wait until the battery dies completely and try again. So, now I have a device that freezes within minutes of getting it running and my computer won't recognize it.  My story isn't over yet. I still have to attempt to get customer service from Creative. Based on other reviews, it looks like that will require a phone call to a foreign land where they will no doubt want me to spend an hour asking me to download the same "patches, "fixes", and firmware. I just want my money back.  So...if you're looking for an mp3 player that you will need to dedicate three hours of tech support per week to and will work half the time after doign so...this is probably the one for you. Otherwise, look for something else.

<Title>Awesome little player !!
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an great player for the price.   My kids each got one for Christmas and I had so much fun with them that I had to buy one myself.  With a wide variety of accessories available, we each have different color skins to know who's is who's.  The stories you may see with them locking up is possible, but it only seems to happen if you fly through the navigation button faster than the menus change.   We have learned to wait a split second between bumps of the button and none of us have had a problem since.   If it does happen, it takes less than 30 seconds to reset the player and it rebuilds your library so nothing is lost.  Pros: -Great sound in a small package -Display is bright and large for the size of the player -Works with mp3 and wma files -Organize, sync and play by Artist, Albums, Playlists etc. -Vast number of setup options for the player and the display -Wide variety of accessories available  Cons(if you consider them cons): -Don't use the included software, go straight to Media Player 10 -The earbuds have great sound, but don't fit in small to medium ears -Charging with the USB cable can take 4-6 hours if the battery is low. Recommend the optional 120v charger is quicker charging is needed.  This is a great player for the price.   My kid's friends who have Ipod Shuffles are jealous.

<Content>I've owned Ipods and several other mp3 players. This past Christmas, I received a Ipod Shuffle and one of these Zen mp3 players.  The Shuffle does not have a screen but for the money it sure works a lot easier.  Trying to work the Zen program to get the music on there was a pain in the keester.

<Title>I love this MP3 player
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I first bought a Creative Zen Nano a couple of years ago.  I loved it so well, I bought my husband one for Christmas this past year.  Mine locked up then died about a week ago.  I went to buy another one, but the store was out.  I tried an Apple Shuffle.  HATED IT!  So, I took it back and got the Creative Zen V.  It is very nice.  It has a lot more features than the Nano, plus it holds pictures and comes with a lanyard.  It will hold about 500 songs...way more than I really need.  However, in order to learn about all the features, you will have to look up the user guide under your start menu as the little book it comes with doesn't have a lot of info.  I didn't have any problems transferring my music or pictures...

<Title>The Zen is OK but it freezes alot
<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like my mp3 player but it freezes up alot. I don't know why mine freezes because my sister and friend have the same kind and their's never freeze. today it froze up and i couldn't get it to unfreeze even when i pushed the reset button. I looked on the Creative website and it said what to do but i had to deleat all my songs that were on it. It's a really cool mp3 player and it works most of the time but i wouldn't buy it if you don't want to have to fool around with unfreezing it.

<Title>A three and a half star mp3 player...
<Date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ZEN V has agreat song capacity, a cool look and great features. One of the bad aspects of this is that it freezes when you use the contoler to fast. As long as you use it at a normal speed it won't freeze(that's at least what I noticed). Also, for some reason my screen is a bit scratched even though they claim to have a scratch resistent screen.....hmmm. Other these few faults this has been an over all great mp3 and I would reccomend it.

<Title>Amazing little bargain player with excellent sound and built-in EQ!
<Date>Sat Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For years as an audiophile, i've been blowing crazy money on 2-channel high end systems, but always wanted to get my first portable MP3 audio player to 'join the iPOD craze'.  After probably spending close to 10 grand on McIntosh equipment and huge Magneplanar speakers all these years, I realized I need something simple, compact, and cheap for when I walk the dog or cut the lawn.  So rather than spending 2 or 3 hundred on higher capacity iPOD players, I decided to get this 1GB player for less than a third of what I would have paid for an iPOD, as my foray into portable players.  The choice was a sound one (pun intended).  So far, I have about 200 songs in my 'Zen V', and the transfer from my PC was easy, fairly quick, and flawless.  The interface is intuitive, and battery life very good.  The built in variable EQ and 'bass boost' feature is a godsend as well, since you can effectively tailor your audio to the sonic qualities of your earpieces or headphones.  The cheap earpieces that come with this unit are not too good, so my only advice would be to invest in a good set of cans if you want killer sound.  I have a pair of AKG K26P 'cans' for portable use, and a pair of Sennheiser HD-595 'cans' for home use.  I cannot emphasize enough how a better set of earpieces or headphones will improve the Zen V's sound IMMENSELY!  Considering the size, price, sound, and features of this portable media player, it is a 'no brainer' for those wanting an excellent, more affordable digital music player!

<Title>Wonderful little mp3 player
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my little zen. I've had mine for about 4 months now and am incredibly happy with it. Its so small and convenient. I'm subscribed to Napster's "To Go" service and it works seamlessly with that. I dont travel a whole lot but occasionally I'll take a 2 or 3 hour bus ride and my zen makes it go so much faster. I use it mainly for when I work out. Its perfect because it so small I just carry it in my hand while running. The headphones included are not so good but I have a pair of Sonys that have lasted me years now that i use. The greatest thing about it was that I accidentally left it in the pocket of a pair of jeans and then put the jeans through the wash. The little guy survived an entire wash cycle and still works perfectly. Imagine that! I did let it dry out on the window sill for a week before turning it on.... but I didnt think it would still work. Zen, I love you!
