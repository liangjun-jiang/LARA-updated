<Title>Best bang for your buck
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This little bugger is great.  While, like some of the other reviewers, I was torn at first with some of the bugs, I quickly downloaded the firmware updates from the Archos website.  It fixed every problem I had and I just love the way this thing does it all pretty well.  It's no camera or camcorder replacement, but the picture quality is better than most any cell phone camera.    The controls and UI are easy to understand and figure out with only minor exceptions (adding songs to an existing playlist took me a bit to figure out).    I downloaded the codec that allows you to play podcast and iTunes files for $20.  Well worth not having to convert all my music.   Only con is that it doesn't come with a charger.  It charges via the USB cable rather slowly, and the docking station/charger is sold seperately.  Considering what all this little thing does and its price, you can't really go wrong.

<Title>Almost great
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I hate writing reviews like these.  Why? Because this little guy has so much potential...! And I was so excited to finally get this thing! But, at the end of the day, it's a bit of a mixed bag.  Some back story: I'm a Mac guy who had given up on a widescreen iPod (thanks a Steve!), but stumbled upon this. All the reviews on the Archos 404 from the "in-the-know" sites like Wired and CNet gave it really good reviews: "Great little screen...! fairly spacious hard drive...! decent camera/camcorder...!". Sure, it was a jack-of-all trades they said, but it was a darned good one.  So I bought one. And, well, it's not bad! It wasn't too expensive. It certainly does have a great screen. And the camcorder and camera aren't too shabby either. Even the interface, for a Mac user, wasn't the worst thing in the world.  But then I tried to play a movie.  It's supposed to play .mp4 movies "right out of the box", and it does. Sortof. I had transferred a movie I own (and watch way-too-much: "Office Space") w/ Handbrake (a great program) and saved as an .mp4. But I could only watch the first 20 seconds on the Arcos. Anything after that the sound still played, but the picture froze. And fast-forwarding or rewinding just made it angry. Always kicking me out to the video menu.  So I put some smaller .mp4s on. But not only did it have trouble playing them, when I scrolled down the list, the unit restarted! I thought I was crazy, but it did it over, and over.  So, undaunted, I download the "Podcast Plugin" from Acrhos: $19.99. It allows you to play H.264 video (a better compression) and AAC audio, which is darn good too. I was impressed at the Mac friendliness of the offering to boot.  I then re-ripped my movie in Handbrake using the H.264 setting, and it played. Finally. Without crashing. And it looked, and sounded great. Yay. Whew!  But then I tried the camcorder.  I've got to give Archos a bit of credit here, because for what it is, this is a cool little camcorder. You can even get this optional little "snake cam" (which I bought: $129). Stock, even though it doesn't have a zoom, it makes impressive video.  The only problem is the resulting .mov movies don't play in Quicktime. Or iMovie. Or anything else I can use. While the video looks fine, the sound stutters uncontrollably. And it sortof plays in VLC, but while the sound is good, the video glitches.  Well, it says right on the box that it's a Windows Media Centerdevice, and I began to wonder if some of the files I was trying to work with were just a little to "Appley".  Hmmmm, I thought. And I did a little "get info" and I found that the sound on the camcorder's .AVI files uses DVI ADPCM compression. Both very Windowsesque formats. And while Quicktime, etc, does support most AVI files, it doesn't support DVI ADPCM.  I called tech support. And after a looonnnngggg time on hold, a sleepy guy finally answered and curtly answered "sorry, you can return it who you bought it from" to every one of my questions.  So I emailed tech support. And I got the same answers, plus an offer for a "repair" (I think it was the same guy!)... but I kindly explained that it wasn't broken, but simply needed some support and firmware upgrades.... To no avail.  So, bottom line is the Archos 404 is has got a severe case of the yinyangs. On the one hand it's simple, beefy and gorgeous. On the other it's twitchy, finicky and handicapped. Especially for us Mac people. In fact, I'd like to go on the record and  say this is an EXTREMELY Windowsfriendly device... And for a guy who got this primarily to quench his iPod jones, that's a bit of a heart breaker.  Archos, if you're listening, you need to offer a free plugin for Quicktime so the sound works, pronto. Or, a firmware update that allows for a different on-deck sound compression option. Or better yet, do both.  Until then, this will be a crippled unit. Another could-have-been in the handheld what-have-you category. Another iPod casualty. A frigid lover. Especially for us Mac users.  e

<Title>Better than an iPod
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my son so i guess I'll let him write the review from here on in. Hell yeah this is better than an over hyped mp3 player(iPod). I've had it for about a day now and to be honest the only complain that I can make is that Archos is cheap. This product deserves the 5 stars it's just that you have to buy simple little things that should've came in the box. My brother's mp3 player came with a/v plug that could connect with the tv to record or play on-screen. Archos wants you to fork up $99.99 for the DVR station, when I buy mines i'm getting it from Walmart for less than $74.00. The camera and camcorder is great and the built-in speaker is superb. The clarity and crispness of the 3.5" screen is eye-orgasmic when watching pictures or videos. Pros: It's a damn good mp3 player/camera/camcorder Cons: Archos wants you to pay for certain things that should be included in the box

<Title>Great buy
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for recording TV programs and making videos without using external device and wires. It works great when connected to my Panasonic HDTV which has a video output on the back. This little device also allows you to make photos at the resolution for e-mails, such as made by a cell phone. The 30GB storage and the USB connector make it a replacement of a needed computer for transferring files from other portable devices or cards. For the price and portability, it is a great buy.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This media player is just awesome!! I just bought it and I don't have any trouble so far. It supports avi video format (what I needed) and the video quality is great, even amazing for a portable media player like this one. The sound quality is also very good, the camera and the microphone work fine. I was about to buy an 8gb mp3 player with video support for 160$, but this item is far much better and its just 200$. Do I have to say anything about the design? It just ROCKS! I strongly recommend this player, for all its functions, the picture and the sound quality and the design. Five stars from me. Thank you, ARCHOS and thank you, Amazon, for your support and fast delivery!

<Title>Nice Try Archos, But No Cigar
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It seems that Archos had good intentions with product, but fell short in a few areas. The camcorder/camera was a smart idea and is of a decent quality. Not as good as a real camcorder, but it will do in a pinch, plus its alot smaller and convenient. The MP3 part is ok i guess. Sound quality compared to ipod is terrible. It has a built in speaker,which is nice but it has a weak sound. The video shows a nice picture and it can double as a DVR,but if you want that you have to buy seperate equipment. The graphics are cool but kind of business like. Even the feel of the Arcos is very businuss like...cold hard metal.(Although i don't think it will scratch as easily as an ipod) Bottom line: for all the many things it does, and for the price its pretty good, and is a nice alternative to ipod, but for all the things it does, it does nothing particularly well. I love my music way too much to enjoy this product so i sent mine back and unfortunaley i became a "Pod-Head".

<Title>Archos Product and Customer Support
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The low price of this item is deceptive.  Upon receipt, it will perform minimally as an MP3 player, but hardly anything else.  Each added feature requires an additional purchase.  One can expect to spend another $60 to $100 to bring it up to 'advertised' capability (recorder, multi-mode viewer, photo vault, etc.) .  My experience with Archos customer support was disappointing.  In trying to replace a part for a legacy 402 Gmini, I found the support to be unfamiliar with the products and unwilling to help.  I will not purchase another Archos product.  More expensive products may actually be less expensive after factoring additional purchases for increased functionality and subsequent replacement due to nonsupport.

<Title>My daughter loves her Archos
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My daughter really loves her archos and I am impressed with the features and the price.  The only dislike is when I read the description and capabilities before purchasing this item, it was not very clear if you need the Archos 404 DVR station to record from the tv onto this device.  Found out you need this station, but unable to locate one to purchase.  When I finally found one it cost as much as the device.  But overall, it is very nice.
