<Title>Good value for the price.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player. It is easy to set up and use. It's also compact and light, and has a bright screen - perfect for exercise and other outdoor activities. Holds approx. 125 songs or many, many hours of lectures, conference calls, audio books, etc.  I like everything about this player except the fact that it "loses your place" when you turn it off. That is, if you're part of the way through a one hour call that was recorded on a single track, you have to write down or remember where you were when you turned the player off - because it will start at the beginning of the same track when you turn it on again.   Hopefully, as another reviewer said, Philips will release a firmware update that addresses this issue. If not for that one challenge, I'd have rated it a solid 5.  Hope this helps.

<Title>Do not buy this MP3 player.
<Date>Wed Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this mp3 player just after Christmas. It worked great at first but slowly the battery started to fail. Eventually, it would not hold a charge at all, I would let it charge all night and it would only run for about 15 seconds before powering down.  I called Philips and was told it only had a 3 month warranty. A $100 plus mp3 player and it only lasts for a few months?

<Content>This is the best MP3 ever! My parents bought it for me for a XMAS gift and I only have had to charge it once since 2005 christmas! Tough, great sound, cool lighted screen, awesome voice recorder, (Good for comedy) awesome radio, what's not in this awesome little MP3? I'm 11 and responsible as an 11, so what's surprising is there's no scratches whatsoever on this MP3! I know, amazing. Buy it and you won't regret it, I promise!

<Title>Don't  buy this product
<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought 4 units of this product as Christmas gifts for myself, my wife and teenage kids.  Three of them died within the first two months of very light use.  I was successful in returning two of the units for a full refund, however, I'm stuck with one dead unit, and waiting for the fourth to die any day now.  I got replacement iPod shuffles for the kids. The iPods have performed flawlessly for a number of months.

<Title>Awesome Player!!
<Date>Sun Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my player from Costco a few months ago. I love the thing to death. Couple things to improve on... a protective skin would be a nice option, and an expandable memory. I love this player for it's compactness, however the memory is just okay. When I bought this product I thought it would be perfect for me, small and lightweight, but only room for approx. 120 songs. It fit a reasonable amount of songs on there, but not all of my collection. One of my only complaints is that mine wouldn't do a playlist, which is fine for me, it would have been a nice feature. I love the "on the fly" radio recording and the voice recording, for notes, ideas and thoughts. All in all, this is a great beginning product.

<Title>mp3 player for people with tiny fingers, huge ears and a lot of patience
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have bought this MP3 player a month ago and I have been using it daily while driving to work, This player is a pain to use even without driving a car at the same time.   These are the design flaws that I found:  1. Very small wheel used to change volume and advance through the songs This kind of input device would be very good (see the wheel on the iPod) if only it were not so small. My fingers are long and relatively thin, yet this wheel is completely covered by my thumb with some room to spare.  This wheel is hard to use.  2.The headphone ear plugs are big (think elephant ears big) The plugs keep falling from my ears although I have normal ears.  3. The shuffle feature is broken Once you turn off your player and turn it back on you will keep hearing the same songs again. In other words this player does not store the names of the songs already listened to. You have to shuffle your songs in some way before you get them onto the player.  In conclusion, buy this player if you have tiny fingers, huge ears and lots of patience.

<Title>very very sturdy
<Date>Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I forgot to take this player out of my pants pocket before it went through the wash. I was crushed when I pulled it out of the washing machine. I let it dry out and plugged it into my computer to recharge. I surprised when it began to charge and I could see my files on the screen. I was delighted when an hour later it booted up and played my songs!  What a gadget!!

<Title>Love the features
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having an USB recharge is wonderful - no batteries to replace regularly.  Can easily switch modes, and it will remember reliably what your last setting was for.  You will love this little gem and 512 mb is more music that you really need to carry around.
