<Product Name>Sonic Impact Video-55 Portable LCD/Speaker System 7" 7-inch Widescreen LCD Display with Remote for iPod - 5090
<Title>Very Cool, but doesn't work well with iPod Classic yet

<Content>This is totally cool for use with iPods up to Generation 5.5.  It has a great 7" LCD, and the speakers sound great.  You can even synch your iPod with the PC/iTunes without removing it from the dock.  Unfortunately, Apple has done something to the new iPod Classic that makes it incompatible with many Video devices - and this is one of them.  It kinda works with my 160GB iPod Classic, but it's seriously impaired.  This appears to be an Apple grab for revenues as opposed to a consumer feature.  I wouldn't buy this for your classic, but it's awesome for a Generation 5 or 5.5.

<Content>This is much better than I expected. The audio quality is much better than one would think. It is actually better than many dedicated stereo systems for the ipod I have heard. The video looks great. The product fit and finish are great. I'm very happy with it. To me this is a high quality product with a nice soft bag, screen cleaner, remote, and video cable. I like that it can charge the iPod while it is plugged in.
