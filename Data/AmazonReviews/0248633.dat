<Title>How to get it working again!
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>True, this little guy freezes from time to time when you forget to dismount it properly (NOT creatives fault!). It's pretty easy to reformat if you people who say it's 'broken' used LINUX and not windows! Simple as that guys - no need to bother with with wasting your money on repair costs. Unbelievable.

<Title>Really Nice To Have
<Date>Sun Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This has been working great for me. The headphones aren't the best so it sounds a whole lot better with good ones. Once the USB stick has been formatted on a Windows machine, files (audio or other) are easily transferred using a Mac in OSX. Having the removable USB stick to transfer files between computers is a huge bonus.

<Title>Great little mp3 player!
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the MuVo 64mb mp3 player. I actually got it through bartering on craigslist. I must say that I am VERY pleased. It's great that I now have a removable usb stick and the playback sounds absolutely incredible. It has surpassed my expectation. It is very simple to load songs/files onto. I can store about 13 songs on the 64mb version. :) Great for students, at the gym, while commuting (metro only hehehee), and just walking around town while shopping.

<Content>Long battery life, apprently indestructible, no moving parts, no display, drag and drop, totally unsophisticated but WORKS to hold a cvouple oif hours of songs for workouts, etc.  No playlists, but I simply plug it in to my USB port and replace the songs with new ones every few days. AAA batteries can be bought anywhere.  Of course you cannot compare this with a fuill-featured player, but for what it is it ROCKS!

<Title>Very nice MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my very first MP3 player I purchased few years ago. In two words, I just love this little thing. I visited my country taking it with me, droped it several times and nothing happened to this little machine. I had only one trouble in Athens (Greece), when I could not turn it on, but after Creative sent me an e-mail telling me what to do, voila, my Muvo is back working again. It needed a firmware ...  Yesterday, I ordered from Amazon, another MP player, this time I got me a bigger one. I am getting the Creative MuVo N200 512MB, plenty of music for me since my other one (64MB) is holding only 10 to 12 songs.  Now, if you wish to get a very small gadget that plays good music, I strongly suggest you get a Creative product, I do like them.

<Title>Great for Third World Travel
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this simple little player for third world travel.  Without having any bells and whistles, the batteries last a long time, which is important when traveling in areas where these might be hard to come by.  The simplicity of the controls makes it easy to use at night.  Its small size and its simple exterior allowed me to travel confidently without the fear that strangers in the bus stand thought I was holding something valuable.  I would recommend this player as an alternative to your Ipod for rugged travels.

<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When this device worked, it was great.  Small, could go running with it, and I remember excellent audio clarity.  But every once in a while it wouldn't work.  And I could never figure out why.  80% of the time worked great.  20% of time it really pissed me off.  A year later it seems to have completely stopped working.  Would probably have given a 5 if the player was more solid and tech difficulties/bugs had been worked out.

<Title>Very Unreliable
<Date>Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Like a few other people here, I'm having the auto-lobotomization problem big time. I had to do the hard reformat every other day or so, and it's presently not working at all.<p>Oddly enough, I got a 64 meg model as a gift after buying the 128 meg model. The 128 meg model worked fine when plugged into the 64 meg battery pack. Then they both stopped working at all. <p>I think Creative is very close to having a winner here. Using the thing when it works is a dream -- no goofy programs to load the device (which always seem to break or refuse to see the target). The fact that some people love it while others hate it make me suspect that they've got a really nasty QC problem in the assembly line.

<Title>Great product, but defective....
<Date>Sun Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I loved my MuVo, it's awesome. But after a few weeks of use, it stops playing mp3's. Still works as a usb hard drive, but stops playing mp3's. Not only that, but it also drains batteries that you put in, even if it's not being used after this problem occurs. My muvo, and my friends muvo had the same exact problem. Save your money, don't buy this just yet. If this problem was not present, I would defenitely give it 5 stars.

<Title>The Simplest MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I received my MuVo 64 last week--no problems whatsoever. (My OS is Windows XP.)  This is the first MP3 player I've ever owned, so I'm not an expert nor do I miss the extras most of the other players have, such as the LCD screen. It couldn't be easier to use: separate the removable media from the battery pack, plug it into the USB port, drag &amp; drop your files, then eject the removable media. I bought mine primarily as an exercise buddy-makes my treadmill time go a little faster. Since these sessions generally last just 30-45 minutes, I don't need a large capacity player. The cord that enables me to hang the MuVo around my neck is a real plus; it's so lightweight (approximately 1 oz.) I hardly know it's there. The earbuds sounded OK, but a set of normal headphones (for ex, the headphones that came with my Walkman) proved to be a lot more comfortable. The only reasons for my not giving it 5 stars are (1) the earbuds, and (2) the need to press the play button for a few seconds to power up/down (I initially thought it was broken because of this).  Nevertheless, I love the size, weight, and sound of this gadget. A definite recommend for someone who wants an easy-to-use player and not looking for the extra features-a great exercise companion!

<Title>Great MP3 player with bonus portable storage feature!
<Date>Wed Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>After reading various reviews, professional and these user reviews, I knew this was the device for me. I was not disappointed. I was loading MP3s on it three minutes after opening the pacakage. <p>I am running XP home edition and had no problems getting it to recognize as a removable hard drive. Beautiful.<p>I mainly use mine to listen to music while jogging. You definitely need to get rid of the included earbuds. I threw mine into the trash after listening to the poor quality. Sound quality is great with my Sony earphones. Good bass as well.<p>If you are looking for a great no-frills MP3 player with removoable-storage capability this is the product for you. The reverse is true also. Both functions work great on XP and my Win2K system at work.<p>I agree with everyone that they definitely need to release some kind of armband for us joggers. Its annoying to have to carry in your hand and I don't trust the included lanyard.

<Title>nice job
<Date>Sun Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the MuVo 128 MB for my workouts and traveling. While I am optimistic about the traveling capabilities, I already enjoy this tiny device, which can hold 2 CDs in good quality, or up to 5, if you squeeze hard, for workouts and during work. The minimalistic user-interface appeals to me. The MuVo also works with NiMH AAA rechargables. <br>There are a couple of minor things: The sound is bass emphasized, which is not a problem with any earbuds, but becomes an issue when connecting it to the car or other stereos. Connecting to line-in, you have to max-up the volume. The earbuds that come with it sit really bad - they stay at most five seconds in my ears, and won't do for workouts; quick fixes available at your local CC or BB stores. Though I am able see the files in Linux, I haven't found a solution to employ Linux to move files onto it. And there are strange lapses in music, after it was accidentally getting a sometimes not completely avoidable discharge of statics and gym sweat humidity. <br>Still, for giving me *my* music commercial free in such a small housing for hours, and the ease of use, I rate it five stars. And it also transports regular files.

<Title>Perfect Product for the Right Consumer
<Date>Thu Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This MP3/WMA player by Creative Labs is just plain awesome.  True, it doesn't have an LCD screen, a clock, an FM tuner, or a built in stop watch; however, in exchange for these &quot;features&quot; what you do get is simplicity, ease of use, incredibly long battery life (12 hours on a AAA), unbelievable size and tremendous flexibility.<p>This device is so much more than just a portable MP3 player.  It is a hybrid portable storage device that can be used to transfer any file type from one computer to another.  In addition, it plays both MP3 as well as WMA formats.  I have found this to be a very important feature because of the relatively small size of WMA files.  The 64 MB model will easily hold 25-30 songs in WMA format.<p>If I had to sum this player up in two words it would be . . . wonderful simplicity.  I had this player out of the box, installed, and loaded with songs ready to go to the gym in five minutes.  (NO Exaggeration) There is no tricky software to learn or installation headaches to worry about.  You simply plug it into your USB port and then drag and drop the music files you want from your hard drive.  (I am running Windows XP; however, software is included in the box for Windows 98 users.)<p>The bottom line is that different people want vastly different things.  If you are looking for fancy menus, jog dials, and a lot of battery-draining bells and whistles, then look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for the simplest, smallest, lightest player on the market to take to the gym and to work that doubles as a really cool file storage device then look no further.  This is absolutely the product to buy.  I highly recommend it!!

After contacting customer service multiple times about a warranty item, I talked to one of their techs,   who said that they estimate 10% product failure on their products.

<Title>Small and easy to use.
<Date>Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was impressed with this mp3 player for several reasons. First off, it is easily the smallest mp3 player I have ever seen in my life. My previous mp3 player was a Samsung Mini Yepp. That model which is small enough is relatively huge compared with the Nomad MuVo. Second, the functionality is quite ingenious. NO SOFTWARE is required for XP users. You simply pull the white part from the blue part and stick it into a USB port. And the transfer rate is pretty damned fast. It took me less than a couple of minutes to get the player out of the box and ready to go. Unless you like bulkiness, or need expandable memory slots for your 1000 mp3's, this is definitely a great deal.

<Title>Great for music lover and excellent for external data storag
<Date>Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This MP3 Player is really an innovative stuff from Cerative NoMad. NoMad is one of the leaders in MP3 music player. The design really catched me at the first time. It is so small and very convenient to carry anywhere. Then I learned another feature of it. This is extremely attractive. You can use it as a external storage device to transfer any files you want to any computer which uses Window 98SE and above. <p>Nomad MuVO is not only MP3 player. You can use it just like Thumb drive or Sony Micorvalve. When compare with the price per Mb, MuVo is far better than their competitors because it can be an MP3 player too. <p>The design of it is quite simple and easy to use. One thing don't like about it is the lack of LCD screen. You will not have any information about the songs. <p>Bottom line, this Nomad Muvo is very convenient for student or businesspersons who love music and want to carry music with them, and transfer files for friends or colleaques. With its light weight and very handy, you can carry it with you everywhere all the time. Only drawbacks that I can see with this product right now are the use of AAA battery (instead of rechargable battery) and unability to upgrade (unless you buy another higher capacity stick, but now it is only available on 64 Mb). This is only the first step and first model of MuVo. I am pretty sure that they will come up with the new model that eliminates the drawbacks I have said in the near future.

<Title>Muvo could have been a real win
<Date>Mon Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>After I wrote this review, I discovered major problems with my Muvo and also a replacement unit: memory corruption that leaves the Muvo dead or files mangled.  <p>You can restore the unit with a special recovery mode hard format with their windows only utility, but this is not documented in their meager documentation.  I found that this was needed every day or two with the units I had.  Since I purchased it for file storage also I returned them both.  <p>That aside after using a Muvo for a couple of weeks, I found: <p>* the lack of a resume where you left off feature to be a major problem (four hours of music in a 128MB unit and you have to keep listening to the first half hour over and over ...).  <p>* you have to reformat and load all files in correct order if you want to control the play order. <p>My original review follows:<p>Rather than the 64, the Muvo 128 makes for a better value.<p>I've upgraded from one of the original Rio 300's so having 121 MB of memory to play with is a blast. Not being locked in to Windows was a big motivation for wanting a device with standard USB storage, plus there's plenty of room to keep your crypto keys and other files. <p>* Windows 2k shows about 121MB (not 128) free on my unit to start. There is a windows specific program for formating the drive. I suspect it puts a copy of the system software in the flash memory somewhere in the missing space. If so then it should be possible to update the firmware on the device a real plus. <p>* The player doesn't play files placed in a subdirectory. Your mp3 files need to be in the root directory. The play order seems to be the physical storage order on the flash memory disk - not alphabetical. <p>* The sound quality sounds great especially with my Sony Fontopia EX70LP ear buds - occasionally almost too much bass. The headphones shipped with the Muvo belong in the back of your bottom drawer. <p>* The unit feels solid and well made in spite of its small size and weight.

<Title>excellent product, but know what you want
<Date>Wed Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have owned 4 portable MP3 players and have found that the key is finding the product that matches your intended use / priority list. This player's strenghts are: very small form-factor; simplified operation; no drivers reqd for most OS'es; good dynamic range and bass output with low distortion (like most, the supplied earbuds leave a lot to be desired so plan on using another set of headphones); added functionality of a portable storage device; very good maximum volume level; very good battery life. This product is not: a feature-rich toy with a cool display and a lot of gimmicky features; expandable; versatile in the way you can bring it with you.<p>The player looks like a slightly oversized disposable lighter and leaves few options for you to clip it on or attach it. BUT, it is extremely small and the few buttons and features it has are very well thought out. There are no EQ settings and the factory settings are slightly bass-heavy but pleasing for rock and popular music. <p>I use this unit primarily while exercising and find its simplicity, small size and big clean sound, perfect for gym duty or on the trails.

<Title>Muvo reconsidered
<Date>Sun Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've now had some experience with my second Muvo and found that both units: <p>* will not play some .wma files that MS Media Player and MusicMatch will play - the Muvos power themselves down at the same spots. <p>* Both Muvos have shown signs of corrupting their flash memory - the common one being self labotomization: the flash area with files may look ok, but the Muvo will no longer power on. You must go through a special hard format procedure that restores the Muvo firmware and hard formats the flash memory. <p>Finally there is a major misfeature in the Muvo. When powered off the Muvo always returns to the first song. With no random play function this means that you will listen to the first 30 min to 1 hour of music over and over again unless you do a lot of button pressing. <p>I think the Muvo is a great idea, but the execution and quality should rule it out for now.

<Title>Serves a niche...
<Date>Sun Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I use mp3 exclusively for audio books and text to speech stuff. Therefore the lack of a &quot;resume&quot; or infinite pause for that matter, make this unit inconvenient at times. Also, they need to get the hint: NOBODY LIKES YOUR EARBUD DESIGN. I don't want to swap earwax with someone and share a set of assymetrical earbuds, so JUST STOP. The first thing I did when I unpacked the unit was to plug in my RCA earbuds in its place. MUCH better. Next was to put a keychain clip on the unit. (I took the twisting one from a cheap keychain laser and it works great.)<p>The big improvement of this player over my old one is the fact I don't have to burn a CD to listen to a quick web download, VERY NICE. Also, it is small enought that you can wear it for hours and forget you have it on. The lack of an LCD screen is not really a problem, becauseI figured it was new and they would add them to later models. The unit also seems pretty rugged.<p>In order to recover the use of the unit, you may have to run SCANDISK and defrag every once in awhile. Slightly annoying, but at least you don't have to use the crummy software that comes with it. Just treat it like a portable USB device and drag and drop your files, or the VERY useful &quot;send to E:&quot; via right mouse click command.<p>All in all, I like this product, but hopefully the newer models will address this one's shortcomings.<p>(Did I mention that NO ONE LIKES THE EARBUDS???.)<p>Thanks.

<Content>I bought this player when it first came out a bit more than a year ago. I took it with me on a 4 month trip to Nepal and Tibet. I dropped it, sat on it, dropped it some more, and the little trooper never gave it. It doesn't have any shuffle feature, and the memory could be bigger, but this is one hell of a resilient little bugger. The only reason I don?t have it is that I gave to a Nepali guy as a thank you gift for letting me stay with his family for 5 weeks. I just bought one of the new 256mb models with a screen. We'll see. It'll take a good showing to beat the usage I got outta the last one.

<Content>I've had mine (64mb version) for about 2 years, and haven't had a single problem with it. It's very small (I quit smoking years ago, but if memory serves, it's a little smaller than a bic lighter), but because of it's size, you obviously can't sort, or view file names.   Loading the software was easy, and glitch free, and there isn't any complicated interface to work with; you just plug it in to the usb port, and drag/drop your files on to the hard drive icon that shows up after it's been plugged in.  It does exactly what it says it does, nothing more, nothing less.

<Title>Not the most reliable player
<Date>Tue Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I love my MuVo, I've had it for over a year.  I got it from a friend who said it was suffering from the same problems as most reviews here list.  Creative Support was no help, so I installed everything from Creative's site, used their music organization software to reformat the player, and it's worked fine ever since.  I've been moving files on and off on a daily basis, used it with 5 different computers with not one problem since.  This thing gets beat around in my pocket with my keys, I've dropped it, washed it, pulled it out of the computer without stopping it properly, got it dirty, almost every way I could possibly break it, and no problems yet.  However, judging from the reviews here the quality of these players is very inconsistant, either they'll break after a couple months or keep going forever...  Also, Creative desperatly needs to work on its Customer Service. I haven't found any problems with the playlist restarting when I turn it off or unplug it from the battery.  It does restart when you format the player, but I would think that's expected.  Sometimes when you skip through tracks, the player will cut off the first half-second or so, but it's not a huge problem.  I also think the A-B repeat function is pretty useless, a random play button would be a much better idea.  I'm impressed with the durability of this little player, but it seems I am in the minority.  As to the storage, 128megs is about 4 1/2 hours at WMA 64k, which is what Creative's software converts MP3s to with its "SmartFit" program.  The battery life isn't exceptional, the battery lasts about 2 hours at most with standard Duracells.  Using higher capacity batteries may get you better results.  Overall, a good player if you can get one that works well, so I'd reccomend getting a little more reliable player.

<Title>Poor battery life
<Date>Thu Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>2.5 stars really. Not a bad player but there are better ones out there. The 128Mb gives a reasonable no. of songs but recording at low res makes for disappointing playback. Using alkaline batteries this unit has no where near the 12 hours it claims. It is a handy USB drive however and that part of it has helped me out in many urgent work situations.

<Title>Just what you need, but not much more than that.
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It doesnt have a display, which was my only concern. Once I got it though, I found that I could careless. Im to busy listening to music and forwarding and rewinding tracks are just a button push away. Synch went great with windows media player 10 (xpsp2 also installed). No problems what so ever, I went from taking it out of the package to walking out my door listening to music within about 20-30 minutes. MOst that time was spent realizing I had to "synch" not burn onto the Nomad.(im a goof). I used it all night and worked great. Only draw back that the earbuds wont stay in my ears. Could be just me but I ordered some new headphones anyway so not a problem for me. Bottome line, if what you want is a dependable MP3 player to strap on and listen to music, this player does just that without breaking your bank account.

<Title>Remarkable machine, 100% Macintosh compatible!
<Date>Tue Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is a remarkable machine.  It is tiny, magnificently designed and so easy to use, it defies the imagination.  Why other companies are not using a similar approach is a mystery to me.  I want to emphasize that this is 100% Macintosh compatible!  No one is saying this, but all you do is open the box, put in a AAA battery and plug the little guy into a USB port.  In 1 second you will see a new drive called "Untitled" on your desktop.  Open up your iTunes or other MP3 program and just drag the songs you want onto the new drive.  Then remove it and you are done!  No software, no upgrades, no cables no incompatibilities!  It's even easier to use than the venerable iPod (which is also excellent but larger, less portable and much more expensive).  I'm using it with OS X Jaguar as well as Win 2000 and it is a joy.  I also have a PowerPoint presentation stored on there so that I can carry it with me.  This is the future.  A perfect gift for anyone new to MP3s as there is simply no learning curve.  I can't say enough about this amazing product.

<Date>Mon Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I had such high hopes for this machine. I have had my eye on one since they came out, but I've now gone through two of them and both were defective. It sure is small and easy to use when it works, but my first one had a propensity to shut off with no warning, and my second one blasts me with static every once in a while and the red light won't stop blinking when it should be green. I thought maybe my Windows Media files were corrupted, but they play just fine on my computer. I'm returning this thing and getting a different product.

<Title>great sound! wonderfully versatile! So far, I love it!
<Date>Thu Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have had my Muvo for 5 weeks and absolutely adore it-- on the other hand I think I must be its perfect target audience. I mainly use it for going over a fairly small selection of choral music while I'm walking to/from work, so I don't need to be able to store too many songs (and do Love having the repeat button!)-- 128MB is usually enough. Also,I was looking for something as small and light as possible, without compromising the sound quality or battery life, and this definitely is it-- for the sake of the small size and great sound I'm willing to do without LCD, etc. And I love the ease of use. I have been using the file transfer features a lot more than I had expected to-- I can transfer large papers/presentations between home (win98), office(linux) and lab computers (XP) with no hassle at all. (The linux mount command is <p>mount /dev/sda1 /your_dir ; cd /your_dir<br> and<br>umount /your_dir<p> (I think) to unmount, if you are a linux newbie like me. Then you can just copy/move files around, treating it as just another directory.)  The only problem I have had so far is that when there is any static electricity around it seems to affect the player very adversely, sometimes even cutting off the signal entirely-- but this is only a problem when it's dry and I'm wearing fuzzy sweaters.I'm so happy with my muvo! <p>(On the other hand, if you are looking for a feature-packed mp3 playerwith 20GB memory, you will probably be unhappy with this. Get the archos jukebox, which a couple of my friends have and like a lot-- I was tempted, and it's only maybe a hundred bucks more, but it was just too heavy for me, and I don't actually need those fancy features.)

<Title>Works as Advertised... Great Sound... Small Size
<Date>Thu Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I use the MuVo at the gym and in the car. It is very easy to use, both getting music onto it and playing it. The buttons are big for a small player, and give a noticable click when you press them, so you can feel when you have activated a button for that &quot;I've got better things to look at&quot; style. It has a neat repeat function, you can repeat a song or any portion of your play list. It has a single light which flashes red, or glows steady red or green, depending of course on what it is telling you. The normal alkaline battery lasts at least the advertised 11 hours. Complaints: none. It is small and sounds great, and holds about two cds worth of your music. 5 stars.

<Content>I bougth my Muvo MP3 Player a few months after it came out and still own and use it.  It's pretty durable, I've dropped it several times and it still works.  I use it everday to listen to music as well as transfer files.  It's also very easy to use.  You just drag and drop the songs that you want, and it's played in order that you copied it, even though it list it alphabetically.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lock function as well as having to start from the beginning when you stop playing it.

<Title>Good value, but has some issues :
<Date>Wed Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have my 128mb Muvo for over a year. Here are some things to know about it:<p>1. Song playing order is set according to the order they were transferred to the muvo.<br>(And if a song is deleted, the next song copied to muvo will take it's place.) So the only way to set the song order to your liking is to copy the songs one at a time after formating.<br>2. The sound using the original headphones absolutely sucks! you must get headphones which emphasize bass. I recommend "Sennheiser MX400" which makes my muvo sound superb!<br>3. Muvo uses a hidden file called: SETTINGS.DAT<br>If it gets deleted (for instance by regular Windows formatting, instead of using the supplied formatting software) the device won't work! (I keep a copy of this file on my pc, and put a copy of it back on my muvo when ever I need too... but you can also restore the file using the supplied formatting software.)<br>So if all of the sudden your muvo buttons don't have any effect, now you know why....<br>4. File transfer is slow (USB1). It takes over 10 minutes to have your muvo filled up with 30 songs.<p>Still it's my favorite player do to it's size, versatility and great sound.<br>Bottom line - <br>Once you know what to expect, and you get to know your muvo - it's a very nice device!

<Title>Please read this review, it IS helpful
<Date>Tue Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well, first of all if I could rate this 4 1/2 stars I would, mainly cuz its not perfect.  I ogt this for a Christmas present a few years ago and its worked great.  For of all, I would curse all of you people who gave this less than 4 stars but I'm going tyo qoute what my mother once told me, "Saying negative things never helps, it just makes the envirment more negative, and hardly ever fixes anything." So, that being said I'm not going to be nasty because what some of you did I might have done as well if my brother hadn't told me what was wrong.  My only real problem was I woke up one morning and it just, didn't work so I moped a while thinkling it was broken until I asked my brother if he knew how to fix it.  Appernetly there is a System.dat file in the mp3 player that if you delete (or don't delete, I'm not sure which) it will cause your mp3 player not to turn on.  So I went and did what mny brother told me (which was to delete the Sytem.dat file) and HALLELUJAH it worked again.  So if it won't turn on and you think its broken, look at the maual, do a web search and if all of that doesn't help, try what I did, (especially if you think itrs broken and were going to return it anyway).  SO for all of you out there who returned thers all you can do is think, " (...)WHY DIDN'T I TRY THAT?"  So, here are the pros and cons:<p>Pros:<br>Lightwieght<br>Stores bout 36 songs( which is nice for such a small player)<br>Small<br>Cheap<br>Durable<p>Cons:<br>Bad earphones<br>Have to hold the on/off button for 3 sec. to turn on or off<br>And without my brother I would be  Mp3 playerless and sad to know it wasn't really broken if I had returned it.<p>Overall:<br>My first Mp3 player and a nice one.  Reliable and nice for going to the gym jogging, or mowing the lawn (which is when I use it the most). (...) 1/2 (THATS FOUR AND A HALF STARS) oNCE AGAIN FROM  UPYOURARSE.

<Title>It just stopped working
<Date>Fri May 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the most compact and convenient MP3 player.  It runs on one AAA battery.  It's truly dummy proof.  You don't even need to install a driver...just plug it into a usb port then click and drag your music into the drive and you're in business.  You can even use it as an removable drive to transport any type of files (media, documents, etc).  <p>Having said all these positive things, here comes the BUT.  I loved this little guy, but it broke after only 2 weeks.  I bought it 1 1/2 years ago for about $120.  I didn't drop it or drown it.  It just stopped working.  I guess I shouldn't have disregarded all the other reviewers' caveats.  I traded it in for the 128MB RipFlash MP3 player/voice recorder. Although in retrospect, commuters like me who spend at least 2hrs daily on the subway should think in terms of GBs and not MBs.  Perhaps it's time for an upgrade.

<Content>I bought this unit and used it for about 2 hours for use while running and working in the yard.  Shortly thereafter, I broke my ankle and was unable to work in the yard or run, so had no use for it.  6 months after recovery, I plugged it into my USB port and it froze my computer.  I tried again and same thing.  I contacted Creative and they had me try some things to no avail.  Creative Labs wants me to cover shipping and a minimum of $20 in &quot;assessment&quot; costs + whatever costs to repair it.  UNBELIEVABLE.  This is a product known to have major issues and yet they want me to pay to fix it.  UNBELIEVABLE.  I will never buy a Creative Labs product ever again.  Be smart, avoid their trash.

<Title>Think: Flash Drive that just happens to support MP3/WMA
<Date>Tue Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>The MuVo was my second choice player, having returned a Samsung Yepp YP30-SH model to Best Buy the day before. The latter has  better styling, features and display, but its atrocious digital rights management gave me a new appreciation for the MuVo.<p>Basically, the MuVo has none of that. It's a flash drive that just happens to play MP3's &amp; WMA files, and in a Spartan fashion at that. On the downside, of course there's no EQ controls or LCD display, volume level is just adequate, and it doesn't skip playback of incompatible files gracefully. The MuVo also occasionally clips the beginning or ending of songs, so consider adding a little padding when compressing your files.<p>On the plus side, its codecs have breadth; it supports a good variety of MP3 and Windows Media bitrates, which is an important thing that's almost never mentioned on the box. If the unit only had a built-in microphone, I'd give it five stars.<p>For reference, here's the test matrix I tried with the unit.<p>Windows Media 9 VBR100 1-Pass Lossless: No  (811Kbps)<br>Windows Media 9 393K VBR: No<br>Windows Media 9 192K VBR for Portables: No<br>Windows Media 9 96K 2-pass CBR: Yes<br>Windows Media 9 64K 2-pass CBR: Yes<br>Windows Media 8 6K Voice: No<br>Windows Media 8 20K Mono: Yes<br>Windows Media 8 32K Stereo: Yes<br>Windows Media 8 128K: Yes<br>Windows Media 8 160K: Yes<p>And a few unusual MP3 variations.

I have switched to MP3 to see if it<br>matters.  Anyway, unlike other small devices, I can put both WMA<br>and MP3 on the same space.  I have about 20 songs, really long<br>songs!!!  I have listed to most of the others and this by far sounds the best.  It's easy to drag and drop files. I have used both windows media player and creative labs play center. (I also<br>own the nomad 20gb 3).  Their firmware update now allows an icon for the MuVo.  This is really cool.  I can use up ALL the space on the MuVo becasue it tells me how much I got left.  I get nothing but compliments when people see it.  When I let them hear it, they are astounded.  Now I must say, I don't download mp3's cause I think the quality [stinks], but rip from my own collection.  I highly recomend this product.  Battery life is not as advertised but were talking aaa batteries, and not an issue when you compare what else is out there

<Title>Creative MuVo vs. Kanguru Micro MP3
<Date>Fri Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the MuVo and was very impressed with it all around.  Easy to use, light, and I could use the universal headset plug with other devices, like my stereo. I didn't mind there was no display on it. (No display on the Kanguru, either.) All the controls were easy to figure out. However, on the second day I had it, it broke and wouldn't turn back on. I returned it and got a comparable product, the KanguruMicro MP3 drive from Interactive Media Corp. <p>The Kanguru is a little more difficult to operate. For example, the volume and skip buttons are one and the same. It has a 2.5mm headphone plug, which can only be used with the included neck strap/earphones. (The earphones are part of the neck strap and don't come apart.)  The manual says there is a universal headset adapter, but I didn't get one, and tech support is a long distance number.<p>In Kanguru's favor, they do make a 256MB model, which Creative doesn't yet. It is easier to pull the cap off the Kanguru than the battery pack from the MuVo to plug in the USB. (Kanguru has a lithium-ion battery that charges off the USB port; MuVo uses AAA batteries.) Also, Kanguru has a neck strap and a clip, and the MuVo doesn't have any way to carry it. Although the MuVo being about 1/2 the thickness allows you to stuff it just about anywhere.<p>If you want more capacity and will be using the product as-is, you're fine with the Kanguru.  But if you want to use your own head phones and tote around an ultra-light USB drive/MP3 player, go with the Creative MuVo.

<Title>Fits the bill for ease and portability
<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This the third MP3 player I have owned and the ease of file transfer is the best part of this unit.  Drag and drop files to the Muvo which appears as a drive on your computer.  It helps to have an accessible USB port or hub.  The battery life is good as well.  Only downside is lack of a display but you know what u downloaded. right?  Also, display sucks battery life.  Main problem is the wife keeps wanting to borrow it.

My only dicapointment is there is no lcd screen but the size makes up for it. I dont have to lug around my bulky cd player and i am happy with this product.

<Content>I got this Nomad for free.  After 1 week (3 uses), and the thing will not turn on (the play button).  Now, what I have is a USB storage device (NO MP3 player).  If you received 2 weeks use out of the player consider yourself lucky.

<Title>Broken
<Date>Mon Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like many of the reviews, mine is broken too.  I received the player as a gift from my fiance and loved to use it when I was running.  Unfortunately for me, the device mysteriously stopped working after about a month.  Since I received it for Christmas and don't run much in the winter months, the warranty expired by the time I realized it was faulty.<p>I wanted to see if there was anything I could do and decided to call the manufacturer.  I could only find a long distance number for technical support, and when I called I was also told that it wasn't working properly because I did something wrong when installing the software - even though I had been using the device successfully for a month.  Then, I was told I could send it back to them for repair for $50.00 - a brand new one doesn't cost much more than that.<p>I would suggest that if you are considering buying this product, reconsider.

<Title>Finally an MP3 player that is easy to use
<Date>Tue Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I tried two other players before I purchased this one.  The first one (Rio Sport 64MB) did not sound very good and the software it came with was bad.  The second one I tried was the Philips/Nike.  This one was way too complicated.  You had to go to the Philips website and download software to load the correct drivers for it to work. After doing that it still didn't work. I finally bought The Nomad Muvo 128.  It does not need software or a cable. All I did was use Windows Media Player to copy music from my CDs, create a playlist, plug in the Nomad to my usb port and transfer the playlist.  It was so simple.  I was able to get about 2 hours of music onto the player.  I did not have to do any type of conversion to mp3 files.  The sound is good too.  I have only had it for a few days.  So far so good.

<Title>A little too expensive for the features
<Date>Sun Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A friend gave me this as a gift, which I'm glad she did because I'm not sure if I'd want to pay for it<p>The good things about the player is that it's very simplistic.  It only has two pieces to it, so you don't have to worry abot a bunch of cables or anything.  You slide out the flash drive, plug it into your USB port, and start copying files to it directly from Windows Explorer, which recognizes it as an additional hard drive.  The player will hold around 15-18 mp3 songs encoded at 128kbps.  This is plenty for someone like me who only runs for 20-30 minutes.  It's also nice to have a flash drive that I can easily transfer files with. I have not experienced any effect of the player cutting off the first second of each song like another reviewer said.  Every song starts right up at the beginning.<p>The cons: AT first, I couldn't do anything with this device until I formatted it.  Windows would recognize it, but not let me remove or copy any files to it.  I tried it on several computers and could only listen to the songs already on it until I found the format software, but it works great now.  The player doesn't have an LCD screen, so you can't see what song is playing, although this isn't really a problem with only 64mb of storage space.  Another problem, is that it didn't come with the armband. You have to order it seperately from Creative.  For a portable MP3 player designed to be used with exercise, this is ridiculous.  For the price they should have thrown it in, or at least put a belt clip on it.  I have to wear shorts with pockets in them to carry it with me when I run.  I also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around.   The armband would have prevented all this.  The player does come with some earphones that suck and a neck loop that is great if you run in the woods or at night where no one can see what an idiot you look like.<p>The player also features a "loop" button that allows you to start recording a point in one of your songs, press a button, and it will loop the section you recorded over and over.  I have no idea what the point of this was, or why they wasted time with it.  As far as I can tell, it is completely useless.  <p>My biggest complaint is the battery life.  It holds one AAA battery.  This is nice for the compact size, but I would have rather it been slightly larger and held tow batteries.  I like my music up pretty loud, and my battery is dead after 45-60 minutes.   That is unacceptable. I've seen reviews that say the battery life lasts 12 hours at 60% volume.  I have never seen that. I have to buy batteries in bulk just to be able to use it.  What's more, the Muvo will actually drain amps from your battery when it's turned off. For the life of me I can't figure out why.  It's a flash drive, so there should be zero reason it needs to keep power up.  It is not very significant, but if you put a brand new battery in and don't turn it on at all, in about two months the battery will be dead from the drain.  WMA files also consume more battery usage than mp3 files.<p>The player also has a skip button that lets you skip tracks and fast forward, but it can act flaky on WMA files, and instead of seeking through a song, just skip right to the beginning.  There is also no repeat feature.  After the last song, you have to hit play again to restart it.  No random song feature either.<p>Although this player is pretty much outdated now, it would be a decent player.  I like the basic design and the controls are easy to use.  It's just not worth the current price, and it has too many flaws to use for serious athletes.

<Title>Great -- While it Works
<Date>Fri Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great product while it works. It is compact, reliable, and easy to use (just drag your music files to the player as if it were a removable disk drive). <p>But beware: it WILL fail. I had three and all failed completely within a year -- one within two months. Once your player fails you are pretty much out of luck. Creative support is almost non-existent; but if you can track it down you will have to pay $20 to have them &quot;look at it&quot; and ultimately nearly $80 to replace it. In this product's defense, it could be pointed out that many MP3 players have a limited lifetime (e.g. even the iPod's batteries run down within a couple years and are costly or impossible to replace) so it could be argued that product failure is not in itself a reason to avoid this product (that's why it doesn't get just one star). But the MuVo just doesn't last long enough to be worth the price: two months of 128 Mb of music for $90 (or 64 Mb for $80) just doesn't compare with a year or more of many gigabytes for a couple hundred (even the overpriced Porsche of players, the iPod mini can he had for $250).

<Title>Does its job, but sure is flimsy...
<Date>Thu Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this thing used.  Thus far, it's working fine.  <p>But, be warned that every thing about this Muvo is flimsy from the buttons, the casing, and even the battery cover. So if you're likely to drop things, DON'T GET IT.  There is no 'lock button' and the pause button easily gets set off by slight pressure - even by the wrinkle of your jeans.  I find this to be the most annoying thing.<p>Also annoying is the fact that once the player is shut off and then on again, the playlist resets to the first song.<p>I would not buy thing this at the retail cost.  There aren't enough options and it can hardly be called a quality piece of equipment.  Plus, there are far better options out there for less money.<p>If you happened to get it for cheap and are just looking for something to bring to the gym or listen to while jogging in the park, it'll do fine.

<Content>I received this for Christmas and I really love it so far. It is small, lightweight, easy to use. The sound quality is awsome! The only problem I have had is after about 3-4 hrs of play it will randomly shut off. I can turn it back on &amp; it will be fine for a few songs then shut off again. I placed a new battery in &amp; it was fine for awhile. I thought it was the player so I took it back &amp; got another one. It also does the same thing after about 3-4 hrs play. Not near the 10-12 hrs it said it can do. Other than that I really like it.

<Title>Send MuVo Back to the Design Lab
<Date>Sun Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My MuVo died a premature death after an hour of use. Simply stopped working and had to be returned. Creative Labs "support" for this product was unresponsive-- no help from the live technical Rep or e-mail support. [Weak] customer support for troubleshooting product which can only mean that the product has known out-of-box first use issues and when it's DOA it stays that way.  Flimsy design and obvious commodity quality and/or firmware issues prevent the MuVo from achieving it's potential. In short, poorly executed product with horrible support from Creative Labs-- Recommend you buy something else from someone else who better understands how to design, manufacture and support consumer audio electronics.

<Title>A well designed minimalist MP3 player
<Date>Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received the Nomad Muvo 128 as a gift and love it. While it's advertised to support the Windows platform only, I've been using it with ease with my Mac OSX iBook. You can drag and drop right out of iTunes to the Muvo, which couldn't be easier.<p>I've had no problems with the unit and with NiCad rechargeable batteries, I'd say the 12h playing time is an understatement. Sound quality is great, though the included headphones aren't much good. Plug it into a good quality pair (or your home stereo) and you'll immediately notice the great quality sound.<p>I'd give it a 5 except that the Muvo cannot remember where it left off each time you turn it off. When you turn it back on, it always restarts at the first song in your play list. The good news is that the Muvo's firmware is upgradeable, so Creative will be able to improve on it in the future. Fixing this issue and adding better mac support would get a 5-star rating out of me. [...]

<Title>Poor quality
<Date>Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My first unit failed within a few weeks of purchase. It would simply turn off after several minutes of play. When I'd turn it back on it would start back at the beginning of the playlist. I sent it in for warrantee repair, and after several weeks got a replacement (refurbished). Now I'm having the same problems occur and I'll have to send it back yet again. <br>Another issue I have with the player is that the buttons are much too small. It's very hard to press play/pause without looking at the unit or accidentally pressing the forward button. <p>There are higher quality products out there with more and better features.

<Content>...BEST PLAYER FOR SERIOUS ATHLETES.  Do you run, lift, bike?  This player is the one for you.  Do yourself a favor and order the armband/belt clip from Creative America.  This $.. rubber exoskeleton for the MuVo has a wonderfull design and still make the total cost of the player $.. less than the Nike psa128.  I own both.  The MuVo wins hands down.  Lite, small, and easy to use.  I did have the problem that some have had with the sudden loss of ability to play mp3's but still function as a keychain drive.  THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH ALL MP3 PLAYERS (similar problem happened with the nike).  I inadvertantly had the player in close proximity to my cell phone when it rang.  If you have ever had your phone next to your computer/monitor, you have seen what it can do.  There is no reason to believe that the MuVo is more succeptable to this than other players.  People may see this as a problem with MuVo because they can still make it function to transfer songs.  <p>If you enjoy small, simple players, that will not get in your way while working out....the MuVo is it!

It is very simple to use, all you have to do is plug it into your usb port and drag and drop files to it.  It doesn't need any special software or anything.

<Content>My MuVo was also dead after about the 3rd time I used it. I got online and started doing research and found that many others were also having issues and I became concerned. So, I contacted Creative tech support and they helped me to resolve my issue. While this device boasts that it requires no additional software that's not exactly true. You must use their software to format the device. Also, I had to reset my MuVo by holding down the play button while inserting the unit into my PCs USB slot and continuing to hold it down for 10 seconds. Then, remove the unit, plug it back in and format it. Walla, good as new. Don't be afraid to try this product. I only wish it had a belt clip or arm band included.
