<Content>Do not buy the iPod Classic!! While this iPod offers the basic benefits of the iPod family, Apple has made one, Microsoft-worthy, change.  The only component cables that will work (especially the video/AV/component cables) are the $50 (or more) Apple brand cables.  They have inserted an "authentication chip" requirement into the firmware.    If you notice, the 5th and 5.5 generation iPods (not the newest 6th gen. Classic) are more expensive for a reason: They're LESS RESTRICTIVE.   After-market cables (such as Belkin/Griffin/Etc) will not allow video output from the Classic to TVs.   If Apple introduces a firmware change to allow ALL video cables to be used, then you should consider this one...otherwise, stay with the 5th/5.5 generation units.

<Title>Decisions, decisions..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had my 3rd gen ipod for 4 years, holding out on a video ipod until for a larger screen.  I was torn when Apple released the full-screen flash memory based 'touch' with 16gig max (less than my old 20gig full with music files), and the small-screen hard-drive 'classic' with up to 160gig. Maybe the full-screen and hard-drive together would wear too much on a battery?   I decided I would be annoyed with 16gig, managing which files to load.  I have a Blackberry, and get enough internet, without being limited to wi-fi, plus all my work mail and calendar are tied to that. The bigger touch screen was not worth it for me, and I could not wait for another upgrade.   Because of an Amazon delivery est. 4-7 weeks out, I canceled my order for an 80gig, went to Apple instead(free shipping), and ordered the 160gig.  160gig does not seem extreme.  There is always something new to fill space.  Higher quality music and videos, backups, games etc..  Plus the apple-site shows the 160gig battery has about an extra 30% play-time than the 80gig (apple site Classic tech specs).   Had to pay sales tax, but got free engraving.  Used that to add 'return to' with my name and email on the device.  That gives the honest majority of our population the chance to get it back to me, and the less classy folks will need to scratch up or hide the back side.  **update** I now have it in hand and stick with my 4-star pre-review.   I got it loaded fine, including new videos I had in anticipation, and many photos from my pc -all of which barely made a dent in the space.  The options are very easy to manage in iTunes.  I like you can choose full-photo vs. ipod-veiwing-photo file sizes. Old news to many of you though. Of course I went full-sized, I have 160gig now, and this is a great way to back up those pics. Actually I have 148.79 available space.  Everything looks good and runs smoothly, so I'm not griping about the space the os/software used up.   I like the album art display on the menu and songs.  Things like that don't matter in the big picture to most people, but those types of touches make Apple products seem a little more friendly. I am jumping from a monochrome music-only ipod, so for me this is a major upgrade.   It does have the search option, but typing in a word by scrolling around a click wheel is not much faster than working through the menu. It also has a few games loaded, clock/alarm, a lock code setting, notes and calendar you can load from your pc/mac.  I like the stopwatch, which dispays an old analog version.  Using a stopwatch makes even boring activities seem more like an event. The only real rub with this is the 'TV-out' (video output)option is locked to 'off'.  I had seen a 50buck cable for sale from Apple so I knew I could do it(cnet claimed video-out had been removed), but I read on a rumor-site that you will now be forced to use the Apple licensed component-cable in order to enable the video out.  Fine, it comes with some other adapter stuff, so I'll do it, but their availability is 3-4 weeks.  I do love this device, and appreciate how far we've come since reel-to-reel and projectors, but not getting a hard-drive in the the 'touch', and not having the video cable (and many games) ready for launch takes a star off. *** Update 2 *** Well, I had it stolen already.  Hope the engraving somehow causes the perps some pain.  Smashed my car window at church and grabbed my bag.  I was dumbfounded.  I did an on-line police report and tried to get my serial number from the Apple registration.  Could find no way to veiw previous registrations, and the email confirming the registration didn't have it.  Without the ipod connected to iTunes there appears to be no way to see it there either.  I easily signed on to Garmin and got my gps s/n (they got that too), so I don't know why apple would make it so difficult.  My wife found it printed on the box.  Good old printed ink.  Writing it down may be a good idea.  Maybe this is gods way of telling me to get the touch?

<Title>Prefer Touchscreen
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I prefer the touchscreen, at least over the scrollwheel, simply because the scrollwheel is too imprecise, and it's hard to get to deeply nested items.  I've been happily using a 1 gig (yes, that's one gig) device for almost 2 years now, and have been anticipating moving up to an 8 gig device, so moving to a 16 gig device seems downight exciting.  16 gigs holds 192 CD's at 196 kbps, mp3. Does anyone realize this? I don't have that many CD's, and a lot I don't listen to anymore anyway, and even when you include some converted mixed-tapes and long podcasts, which I need to "recycle" anyway, 16 gigs is, quite frankly, great. I can't imagine having to manage 160 gigs of music, what with al the tagging and converting of files - sounds like a nightmare, and intrudes on the listening experience.  The touch is definitely a breakthrough.

<Title>IPOD 30G + Video Problem
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received an iPod for Christmas 2006, and lately it has been cutting out about 1/2 second, I estimate, randomly. I emailed Apple on their incredibly confusing website, saying let me know how to get this fixed under the one-year warranty. I actually did get a response, but: get this: they'll cover it under warranty, but the shipping and handling would be $31.65!!! I emailed them back complaining, saying it's too much, and that I'll just live with it and buy a Zune next time. I never got a response other than the usual offers to buy more Apple stuff, now that they have my email address!!! BE CAREFUL with this company!!

<Title>Don't buy a special offer from Apple
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Foolish me, I just followed Apple's invitation a few weeks ago to buy their 80 GB iPod classic in flashy, greasy, view-all-fingerprints black finish. What I paid for that meager package (not even including a decent power supply for the wall outlet included, not colormatching white USB cable and white earphones!), was way much than their new classic models. And now this! Apple is fooling us with dumping prices of iPhones and iPods much lower than they offered just a few weeks as "special offer". Yes, their offers are special, but in a manner that I will probably never ever buy an Apple product again. Foul Apple.   BTW: Guess, the new iPod 160GB features a bigger, more power-consuming hard disk drive. So: more memory, less running time (about 8 hours less compared to the 80 GB model), and of course no way to replace the battery yourself?

<Content>I like almost everything about iPods, but I can not STAND having to use iTunes...it is a total pain in the behind...If Apple would allow the iPod to just look like a hard drive to my computer I would be all over this thing. I started with a 30 gig iRiver which I loved but out grew. Now I have an 80 gig Archos 504 which is good but a bit large.  When I first got my iRiver I used iTunes software and it drove me batty...Come on Apple!! Free up...let folks use iPods as little HD and you will lose your competitors but until then....

<Title>a "fascinating" device
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This small, portable music player is quite fascinating. It is composed of a synthetic byproduct of petroleum, known by most as plastic, though the exterior shell seems to be composed of a thin sheet of brushed aluminium (Ai, atomic number 13). The "plastic" from which this device is constructed appears to be of the highest quality, however, when closely observed, I found it to be softer than desired, thus, it scratches easily. It plays music that is downloaded to it via a computer, either Macintosh or PC. This may be a deterrent to those of you who do not own a computer. When playing the music, it uses small phonic devices inserted into the ears. These are called "headphones". Due to the nature of these "headphones," dogs cannot listen to your music. When listening to the music, I found it to be of satisfactory quality. This device has a large storage capacity which is its primary selling point. If you buy this device, you should be sure to have music to download to it, otherwise, there will be nothing to listen to. The music that I recommend is Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and Puccini. I find this music to be of superior quality, and worthy of listening to.

<Title>I've got one!!! Size matters..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok guys, I just picked up my silver iPod classic 160gb from the Apple store on Regent Street in London so I can give an actual review on it.  I've had an 80GB video iPod for a year and it's already full, so I was really hoping Apple would make an iPod big enough for me. Presently I've got 110GB (and counting) of music, so this iPod is for people like me who have a large music collection, and who like to be able to take it anyplace.  The 160GB iPod is the same size as the 80gb, but costs less than the 80GB did when it first came out.  With a brushed aluminium front finish (similar to the 2 and 3G Nanos), it should be less prone to scratching, though the back is the same smudge magnet, and I don't know how resilient the screen is. The front is curvier than that of the last 2 video iPods, with the screen slightly depressed from the rest of the casing.  Additional features are extra long battery life (40 hours for music, 7 hours for video; I've tested this and playing music non stop without much fast forwarding, etc, it's about right), and cover flow (a fun way of scrolling through for music using album cover art, though it is a bit sluggish).   The new split-screen interface lists functions to the left half of the screen, and symbols (or previews of content such as cover art, videos or photos shown as a slide show) to the right as you scroll through the functions. Neat!!  During music playback, after being idle for about 80 seconds, the screen goes gray and displays a clock, and battery power. Viewing tracks in an album also gives you, at a glance, the track times. Same for video. A nice touch. To my hearing, the sound quality (without equalizers, mind you) is improved; more bass and a bit more treble. The iPod turns off in about 2 seconds, much faster than previous models.  It's still got the other regular features; album track lyrics (new, nicer text font, and it also shows the album art), can play video and games, store photos, contacts, calendar, notes, stopwatch, and screen lock (which allows you to lock the screen with a password), and it can be used as an external hard drive. It shows up in windows explorer as an external drive. The search feature allowing one to type in album/song/artist titles (introduced in the last video iPod) is still there, but relocated to the "music" menu. I didn't spot it at first. In fact, the menu has been reshuffled to make it better, and (under settings) one can now view number of songs, videos, photos, etc graphically just like in iTunes.  If you need loads of space for your music collection, you can't go wrong getting this. Judging from the crowds in the store, Apple's got another hit here. Now if only the iPod touch had this much memory...

<Title>Finally, more than 80GB!
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>20 years worth of CD purchases filled my current 60GB iPod long ago, with another 25GB still waiting to go onto the first iPod that would break at least 100GB.  Glad it finally arrived with some room to spare, but hope it does a better job of navigating that quantity of artists/songs/etc than the 60GB did.  Hope it sounds better, too.  After all, that's what it's for.  I'm not ready to give up the click wheel for on-screen nav, but was impressed with the responsiveness of an iPhone I tried (and I'm brutally critical).  Still, you can feel and control the click wheel when you're not looking at the device (in your backpack, in the car) and you can't do that with a glossy screen on the iTouch.

<Title>Absolutely stunning (I own this product)
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>UPDATE after 2 weeks use:  One feature that makes it all worth it for me: switching the shuffle mode between albums/songs/off while in shuffle mode. Let's say I have 10,000 songs on shuffle, and I hear a song by Nirvana that gets me in the mood to listen to more Nirvana...I click the middle button 3X and switch random to "Album". Now I'm going to listen to the rest of the album. Before, I had to go to Menu, scroll to Music -> Albums, scroll 500 album names to letter N, then choose album. Can't believe reviewers overlooked this feature.  I insist the sound quality is very good. The new DAC is different than the previous gen iPods, but by no means worse. Sound quality is subjective and depends on many factors including genre, encoding, headphones, hearing loss etc. In my isolated case, I noticed a slight improvement in treble and a huge improvement in bass. The 5.5 gen 80gb used to wash out the bass. Mids and overall dynamic range is just about the same.  ------------------------------  Pros:  - For MP3's encoded in 192kbps, you can fit roughly 27,000 on here - about .08 inches thinner than 5.5 gen 80gb iPod - sweet finish on the front - center button is a little concave and feels better - coverflow is great eyecandy, let's leave it at that =) - new interface for every menu is very intuitive and stylish - battery life is AMAZING - 10000 songs and 6 movies later it's not even half full - sound quality is great, no need for eq imo(using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGLZUE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-8782139-7500665">Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones</a> ) - when music is playing and the screen in dim, you see the battery charge and clock in large numbers  Cons:  - Coverlow only organized by artist, can't do by album (or at least can't figure this out yet) - Great theft potential - Back still scratches easily - iTunes is not exactly the best software ever written for windows  Notes:  No, this mp3 player is not perfect, but it's way up there when compared to other players overall. Obviously you won't get $100 headphones included. Yes, iTunes is clunky and there are better ways to organize your music, and you have to convert all your movies...at the end of the day: it's small, it's easy, it's cool and it will play you media really really well.

<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Pros: I had the first generation IPOD Nano 4GB before I bought this one. My music collection has grown so large that I need an mp3 player with a bigger storage capacity, which this IPOD delivers. I can now play all my music video on this IPOD too, and the video quality is great (provided that you start with a good quality music video in the first place). I also like the new IPOD surface too since now I don't see my fingerprints all over the place.  The Cons: The downside to this IPOD is it often freezes on me. I don't mean once or twice, but almost every time I connect it to my laptop. So it becomes an annoyance to me. Sure I can unfreeze it but why do I have to do this often? I've never had this problem with my old Nano and it seems like this problem is faced by newer generations IPOD (I have a friend who just bought the new Nano and it freezes on her several times already).

<Title>Good and Bad
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok The Ipod Classic's are a step forward and a step back. First Apple purposely disabled the video out feature unless you use their cables. This is all for more Dollars which for how much these things cost and the money they make off them is just ridiculous. I have had several problems with this new Ipod from syncing errors to general data issue's I bought one of the first released so I believe it had to do with that since I got that unit replaced it has been fine. The Cover Flow is neat I don't know why people complain about it if you don't like it don't use it. So the good with the new Ipod models would have to be the space and then the cover flow feature which I like. The Negative points are as always - apple, their customer service, and the disabling of the video out for third party devices - just underhanded. It is still a great device so if you are not to upset about having to spend 50 dollars on cables than it will be a good bet for you.

<Content>This is iPod #2 for me.  I'm one of those people who likes to have *way* too much music at hand at all times.  I filled up my 60Gig iPod, so I gave it to my wife, who has about 3 CDs she likes, and moved up to this thing.  I use the video function very rarely, but it *is* nice to take a movie along for long layovers in the airport or to have instead of renting a movie in a hotel.  I mainly listen to the iPod when I walk to work, or in the gym.  I hate going to the gym, so an audiobook on iPod makes that experience much better.  I'm very pleased with this iPod.  I use Sony ELP828 earbuds rather than the ones that came with it because a)I don't want advertise to the world that I've got an iPod, and b)They're really good and not terribly expensive (I have a cat that thinks they're food).  Be sure to buy a good case with a belt clip.

<Title>Lots of Problems
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I will go straight to the details as to why this unit sucks:  The software called iTunes will frequently duplicate songs and waste space.  The unit itself is prone to not being recognized by Windows XP, so there is frequently no sync available, so....when sync is not available, you cannot upload new songs into your ipod.  When plugging in your ipod, iTunes will tell you that the ipod needs to either re-enter all the songs, or reformat the whole ipod.  When you "restore" your ipod (according to the will of iTunes), nothing happens afterwards except an ipod with no songs in it....and trying to put the songs back into the ipod...i'm still trying. Help!  Getting help (help!) from iTunes is impossible, but I'm still trying.  Managing more than one ipod's music in your pc is problematic and prone to glitches. I heard it's easy to manage multiple ipods if you have a Mac.  If you are still thinking of getting an mp3 player, the most trouble-free is the Creative Zen Microphoto (8gb), and the Sandisk Sansa Clip (2gb) that holds 1000 songs.    If you do decide on getting an ipod, make sure you save the music on cd's (burn them to cd).

<Title>What went wrong???
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have a 40GB iPod Classic.  It's a breeze to use, an excellent product, and I love it.  It's full, so I wanted to upgrade to the 160GB.  What a disaster!  Apple was in a hurry to get this one out.  It shipped with a bad software version, so the first thing you're stuck with is updating the software, but there's a glitch:  You can't download the new software without jumping through a bunch of hoops to disable firewalls and other stuff on your computer.  That required a lengthy tech call.  After downloading the software, I tried to sync it up.  It would load a few MB and then freeze.  Several more tech calls and hours of wasted time (including reimporting my library and reformatting the iPod)and it still kept freezing.  Bottom line:  This piece of junk doesn't work with its own software and is nothing but a headache.  Apple should be ashamed.  They had a corner on the market and a reputation for excellence, and they blew it.  Keep your money until they remove their heads from their posteriors.

I'm music centric and don't care about the video or game functions. All I was expecting was the same device, albeit with more storage capacity.  The cover flow is superflous to me: nice but unneccesary.  This device is virtually the same size as my 80, but feels smaller and a bit heavier in the hand. So far I like it.  Too early to say I love it in the way that I love my 80.  The five stars are for IPOD itself.

<Title>CONSUMER ALERT
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item last week to upgrade my ipod 80gb (great item!!!). I found the sound on the classic VASTLY INFERIOR to the old ipod.  I thought it might have been my imagination but after cruising some websites, I discovered that APPLE is using another chip that deteriorates the sound in  significant way.  I found the sound of the Classic to be thin and shrill compared to the older one and not nearly as warm and "clean." (I mostly listen to Jazz and classical) Again, I thought this might be my imagination but apparently other purchasers have had a similar experience. I'll be returning mine.

<Title>Excellent sound quality, and the 160GB are a treat
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had the previous 60GB video iPod, and the additional 100GB comes very handy as I only use Apple lossless compression. What I did not expect is the much better sound quality on the new iPod. I did A-B comparison and the classic's sound quality is first rate and much more musical. I guess the DAC must have been improved. For info, I use the excellent Shure ES500 headphone. Most of my music is apple lossless compression. I never use MP3, as it throws away too much information, even at the highest setting (320kbps).  The interface is very intuitive, as usual, and fast. The screen is much brighter. The search option is very handy to locate album or song. A big plus too.

<Title>  Re: Ipod classic TV out problem 
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple has intentionally disabled the Video Out button on the Classic models.  Spend more, get less features.  I am shocked to hear that Apple will treat so poorly those who shell out $349 for a 160 GB Classic. I contacted the Geek Squad none of the salespeople or support team had a clue that Apple had disabled the video out feature. They pushed every available button before contacting Apple to find out that Apple has disabled a basic feature available on all prior video Ipods. I had stopped at Circuit City first and had the same experience there.  I would not have bought this so quickly had I known that Apple disabled the video out capability. The video settings menu is still there, but all the clicking in the world will not change OFF to Ask or On. Apple will soon be selling a $49 accessory to allow some limited output of video. I already own the Icuiti IWear. Memorex and Virtual Reality Ipod video accessories, all now rendered useless by this greedy move on Apple's part. We all expect value-added from Apple, not elimination of a basic feature. Shame on you, Apple and Steve Jobs.

<Title>Great size and hard drive capacity
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is pretty much the best iPod based on it's value. I did notice that they didn't include the soft slip case this time, like they did with the 5th generation iPods. They also took out the video out feature, which I think was a bad move on them. I do like the new interface though, they also added the cover flow feature. They include a nice shiny metal case when you get the iPod. I did end up buying a case for mine. I didn't mind buying one since I didn't pay for my iPod. And BTW for those wondering how I got my iPod classic go here: flingk.com/n21v9v1  I was amazed how thin the iPod Classic is considering how much space it holds. I do think it is better than the other iPods based on how much you end up paying.

<Content>Apple is pulling a clasiic Microsoft tactic here by making the 6th gen ipods NOT backward compatible for no apparent reason other than to force you to pay more to upgrade your OS and docking stations / cables.  Plus, the 5.5 gen is faster, and better assembled.  From what I am reading here, alot of others are saying the same thing.  Don't buy this item.  Buy a 5.5 gen instead.

<Title>Severely disappointed
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I thought long and hard before purchasing this iPod. Before, I had always used a Creative Zen Micro and was quite fond of it until I ran out of space. Then, I was torn between the iPod classic and the Zen W. I decided to give Steve Jobs a chance and shelled out $350 for the iPod.  Within about a week of purchasing it, it had a problem. It froze up for no apparent reason but maybe 12 hours later, it decided it wanted to work again. Then, I was quite pleased with it. The sound quality seemed good, the graphics on the screen were crisp and clear, it scrolled quickly, and overall, it worked very well.  One day when I plugged it into the computer, however, and downloaded and installed the required update, the screen suddenly went black. The iPod would not turn on and didn't respond to being plugged into the computer. I had not dropped it or mishandled it in any way. The support section of the Apple website was very unhelpful, and nothing I tried had any effect. Defeated, I called Apple. Apparently, spending $350 on one of Apple's products does not mean I am important enough to talk to a living, breathing person. After attempting to explain my problem to a computerized recording which basically told me to repeat all the steps I had already tried, I was told to send my iPod back to Apple so they can repair it--a process that will take, in total, about two weeks.  The iPod is wonderful when it works, but as soon as it has a problem there is no help for it. Do yourself a favor--avoid Apple and buy a Zen.

<Title>What's the point of upgrading to an inferior version?
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the 160GB version as an upgrade to my 5th generation Ipod Video with 60Gb of storage.  Sounded reasonable at the time.  I purchased a $340 Harman Kardon Go & Play to use as not only a sound system, but to use in the classroom when showing videos I purchased from Itunes and other educational sources.  It was very nice having my library of videos for class on my Ipod.  I figured the additional storage on the new unit would be extra nice.  So, imagine my surprise when the 6th generation Ipod is no longer compatible with the HK Go&Play because they've disabled the Video Out feature.  Now mind you, Apple is still advertising the Go & Play on their website as being compatible.  Ipod compitable logos are misleading.  Don't assume. . .  I contacted Harman Kardon and had an opportunity to speak to one of their techs who indicated that Apple decided to share the design changes just before releasing the new 6th Generation Ipods, leaving their engineers absolutely no time to process or adjust to the changes.  Intentional?  I guess if it boosts Apples sales of proprietary cables and docks, then probably.  I also noticed the sound on the 6th generation wasn't quite as refined as my 5th generation Ipod playing through the Go&Play.  More research online talks about sound compression modifications.  For anyone who has the Go&Play, you know what an amazing sound system it is.  It picked up the changes in the 6th Generation very clearly.  What a disappointment.  I also need to mention that having the video capability on the very costly Go&Play helped me justify the steep price and sold me on it. . .not much good now though. . .    I've owned every generation of Ipod that has come out and I'm amazed they would do this to their line.  What makes things worst is they've kept things very quiet to the point that their own technical suppport people are unaware of the changes and handle people like you and me who think the unit is broken, as just that. . .a defective unit.  You'll spend a fair amount of time on the phone with their people trying to figure out what's wrong with your unit when it basically amounts to Apple's irresponsible design change.  Until you do the research online, you won't know any better.  They released the 6th Generation sometime around early Fall. It's now almost February and it's amazing how few staffers know how to deal with the issues when customers start to complain.  There stores continue to sell you items that don't work with the 6th Generation Ipod because they haven't a clue. . .One additional note, if you've enjoyed the ability to fix minor things with your Ipod, like battery replacement or hard drive replacement, those days are also gone.  It wasn't so much an issue of getting rid of the white color of the Ipod, but designing a case that would have to be destroyed before it could be openned by someone like you or me.  Rumor has it that when it does need something as minor as a battery replacement, you'll need to take it to an Apple store where they'll exchange it for a "refurbished" unit.  My loyalty to Apple ends as of now.  I've taken back the Ipod and will continue to do what I can to maintain my 5th generation. . .which will be a very sad day when it finally goes to rest.  In the meantime, I hope that people initiate a class action lawsuit or the open source community makes it a mission to put Apple in it's place.  I'll be first in line to contribute to the cause.

<Title>Apple nailed it
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my 7th Ipod purchase.  Kept needing more and more storage space.  I've sold or given some of the others away and never had a real problem with any of them.  The Ipods all scratch way too easily.  You need to put it into a protective case as soon as you take it out of the factory packaging.  Otter Box makes some secure, sturdy, albeit bulky cases that have the added feature of waterproofing yor Ipod.  Now let's recognize that there are militant Apple people out there as well as Apple Haters.  I'm neither and will be as objective as possible.    The 160 GB Ipod does everything it is supposed to, and does it pretty well.  If you listen with ear bud headphones, I don't know that the sonic quality of this generation is any worse (or even different) than the prior ones.  If you connect your Ipod to a serious stereo system, well, I guess "you pays yo' money and yo' take yo' chances."  In my opinion, the Ipod was not designed for that task.  The fact that it is even possible to do that is more a function of aftermarket opportunism than because of anything Apple ever intended or did.  A lot of Apple Hating is probably directed at iTunes and not the Ipod per se (and probably rightfully so).  At any rate, Apple has done some consumer unfriendly things in the name of copyright infringement protection, and so on.  Many of the things iTunes prevents the Ipod user from doing are perfectly legal and sometimes absolutely necessary, like if your computer or HDD crashes, you get a new computer, etc.  A program called MediaWidget, widely available for under $20 obviates most of these Apple imposed undue restrictions and should provide you much happier Ipodding.  Anyway, Ipod 160 GB is the best product of its type available.  You will definitely need a protective case of some type, and the purchase of MediaWidget will greatly decrease the amount of Ipod related profanity. There are also many alternative sites for legally and safely purchasing music other than the Apple Store.  Frostwire is the first to come to mind, but there are many more.  These sites also do not restrict your ability to use the songs you purchase as you wish to, like Apple does.  Add these 3 tips to your Ipod purchase and you can thank me later.

Zune has video out - video remote - is faster than the IPOD - has a bigger and better screen - etc.. Wish I could get my money back for the IPOD. DO NOT BUY the IPOD 160, it is a waste of money.

<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After trying  some cheap MP3 players and discovering that 70% of the accessories are for Apple, I plopped down $350 for n iPod Classic 160GB.  It would hold ll the music I could ever want plus hold movies and play them back at will for the kiddies.  WRONG.  Boy was I wrong.  I had been seriously considering an Archos 605 160GB before this disaster and am now sorry I didn't go that route.   APPLE HAS PURPOSELY CRIPPLED THE VIDEO OUT ON THE 6G CLASSIC IPOD AND ITOUCH UNITS.  THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS WORK IS TO PURCHASE A $50 CABLE FROM APPLE.    They have incorporated a chip in this cable which will enable the video out to function.  This pretty much renders ALL THIRD PARTY ACCESSORIES USELESS (save the $600 B&W Zeppelin) that have a video out port...like my new Athens iVoice speakers, and my highly portable and handy retractable AV cable.  Apple did this quietly and did not even release suitable accessories until months after the iPods were released.  Now I have to spend another $50 on a friggin cable.  Forget about any other accessories.  Who knows what will work and what won't.  If you are considering purchasing an Apple product, I would seriously consider any other brand.

<Title>This is Everything I wanted!
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Apple Ipod Classic is exactly what I wanted in a multimedia player. I wanted to able to listen to music, audiobooks, podcasts, and movies in a compact, portable package. I wanted to be able to carry a large collection of media all at once. I think the 160 gig Ipod Classic is perfect for me. I don't have any plans on using this as a VCR to play movies on the tv. So, I'm not going to buy a $50.00 cable for that. I knew that before I bought this unit. I bought my Ipod the day the Classic was released. I bought a clock radio that works perfectly with it. I read about compatibility in the description of the product. No problems. It docked and it charged up perfectly. When I received my Ipod, I hooked the cord to my laptop and my beautiful silver Classic. It synced just fine, it even added my digital photos to the Ipod. I have added well over 80 gig of music, podcasts, audiobooks, and movies, so I'm glad I decided to purchase the larger Ipod. I still have a lot of space for more. One pleasant surprise for me was the ability to play games. I have bought 5 new ones, so I have a total of 8 now. I really like the game "Phase." I haven't had the problems other people have experienced. I use my Vmoda Red Roxx instead of the earbuds that came with the Ipod. Other than the bad earbuds, my Ipod has been a joy to own. I love my Ipod! I wouldn't trade it for a Zune, or an Archos!

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well, first off, it's my first iPod, so I have no previous experience with iPods hence I can't compare the new to the old. Here's my personal experience.  Pros: I can however say, that my iPod does just what I want it to do. iTunes works fine (a tad sluggish at times, but I guess that's understandable, seeing that there's over 70GB in the library...), I've never had any problems with the player itsself, the battery life is great the capacity leaves nothing to be desired. It's very robust, I dropped it more than 5 times and nothing happened! It's still as good as new. (Well, there's scratches at the back, but that happens to all iPods if you don't buy a cover for them, and even if you do!..)  Furthermore I don't understand people bitching about the slightly laggy coverflow feature... hey... didn't Apple give us a firmware update less than a month after the new iPods first hit stores that completely fixed the problems? There've been several updates since, and I can't say I notice anything being sluggish, or not working as it's supposed to work. Do those people never update their firmware?   The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that I hate the vendor lock... I'd have liked to install Rockbox on it instead of Apple's software, but this is NOT possible on the 6th generation iPods. Thumbs down at that move.  The second reason I've only given it 4 stars is that Apple haven't improved the sound quality yet, customers asking for this for a long, long time. The quality does me, I think it would do most customers, but another thumbs down at Apple for that.  Plus sometimes it takes the iPod a couple of seconds to start playing a track, probably because it has to look for it on the HD, since my music collection is so big.  Otherwise I love the iPod. Plus I like the stickers that come with it.

<Title>Great Battery Life- Poorer Sound Quality Then The 5G iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked one of these up about a week ago.  Battery Life is DOUBLE what my 5G 60 GB unit has.  Unfortunately in a side by side comparison sound quality has degraded significantly compared to my wonderful 2 year old fifth generation unit.  I did some research and found out Apple has completely redesigned the Logic Board and is no longer using the old Wolfson Microelectronics chip.  The new iPod has a dynamically compressed, tinny, metallic sound that can even be heard thru the cheap earphones provided.  There is almost ZERO 3D sense of depth and imaging.  The sound is so horrible compared to 5G that you can tell the difference thru every headphone tested except for Bose which has almost zero high frequency response.  If someone is new to iPod and never owned a fifth generation audiophile quality unit they will probably not have a problem with the sound though.  When I first got the unit it had firmware 1.00 installed and I experienced extremely sluggish menu response.  I updated to 1.01 and response is now much quicker though still not as fast as my 2 year old iPod.  Update:   The latest firmware 1.03 solves the sluggish menu response problem pretty well.   Too bad nothing has been done about the sound quality.

<Title>Avoid if you have an older computer!
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you have an older PC or Mac, avoid the iPod Classic and go for a previous generation of iPod.   The new iPod Classics are serious CPU hogs when they sync with iTunes. On my 1.8ghz iMac G5, for example, syncing my iPod Classic 160gb takes 7 minutes, even when there is nothing new to sync. Throughout that time, my CPU is over 95%, according to Activity Monitor. This is in stark contrast to syncing my other iPods (gen5.5, gen4), where syncing never uses more than 30% of the CPU.  Windows users report similar behavior (Google for "ipod classic sync crash").  So unless you have an Intel-based Mac (or similar post-2006 PC), stick with the earlier iPods.

My total digital content has been increasing exponentially with music, audiobooks, photos, movies, TV shows, podcasts and music videos. This 160 GB model is not really 160GB, in fact it is only 148GB when taken out of the box brand new? It seems sluggish when compared to the 60GB and 80GB 5th gene models.

<Title>Quality but certainly not perfection
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod, but I also understand it's not going to be for everyone. My primary reason for purchasing this product was to store lots of movies and music for travel. If you don't mind the tiny screen, it's great for a personalized flick on the airplane. And my entire music collection fits on the hard drive with a lifetime's growth that could still be added.  I've noticed people complaining about crashes, rebooting and the redesigned thumbwheel. I have no issues with these items. I have no issues with the music quality.  I do not like DRM or the fact that this iPod requires a special $50 cable to activate TV out features. That's a load, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me since I don't really plan on using mine for watching movies on a larger screen. For a man who can remember paying $400 for 4MB of RAM about a decade ago, I feel like I got a decent deal. I'm a fairly satisfied iPod owner.  This iPod will scratch up immediately. It does not come with a protective shell of any kind. I got mine laser etched with "ad vitam paramus" and I like scratches - they add personality like scars do.  Several other notes - at the time of this review many of the old accessories for iPods are NOT COMPATIBLE with the "Classic" - it's particularly important to note that your old docking station isn't going to work with this new iPod. The included headphones for the black model are white. If that's the sort of thing that bothers you, be prepared. I don't use these included headphones because I think they are crappy. I upgraded to black Shure e2c headphones.

<Content>Yes.....iPod created the wave with its beautiful mp3 player line. People loved it and placed complete trust in Apple. What ever comes out of Apple, must be the best and costs reasonably......The business strategy is to take people there before the corporations drop them down and make a helluva lot of money for lesser and lesser. I remember iPods used to come with chargers et. al. which has to be bought seperately now. Now with this jukebox what is called as a 'Classic', No TV out, poorer quality of audio. They brought in a newer and a cheaper chip that is not only a poorer performer but also a feature chopper!! Apple has disabled the TV out in an effort to sell another of their $50 product. AV cables work no more. Tell me something.....why will somebody watch a movie on a 2.5inch screen, unless they are waiting in a stinking airport? I also think their menu-ing system has slowed down a bit. Definitely they have been infected with Microsoft's monopolizing disease.   Here I am one of the first sheep to buy this product.....It is a shame. If you find a 30 or an 80 gb 5.5Gen iPod.....Simply buy it. Run for it since people are drying up this product from the market. I am sure this is an opportunity for other manufacturers to get ahead.

<Title>sluggish UI but larger storage space
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Today I had a chance to play with the new Nano, Classic and the iPhone. Being the techno geek, I have been keeping up to speed on the iPods and after going thru the various functions I have found out the following...  - the iPod classic has a sluggish response UI compared to the previous iPods. Very disappointing. It was more difficult to scroll through the albums and songs compared to the previous iPods. But you have to give Apple credit for the amazing 160GB capacity. - the iPod Nano was as responsive as the previous ones. Very pleasing to the eye and very well designed. But I read about the video out issue where you need to buy a $50 cable to make use of the video-out feature. Is Apple trying to milk the customer up as much as possible before something comes up to take over the iPod market share? - As most of us knows, the iPhone will not work at ALL unless you activate it with the AT&T service (unless you hack it...which turned out to be troublesome after today's Apple software update). The problem with the Touch is that there will be no scheduler feature for the Touch and there are some talks of how the Touch suffers from a "darker" screen compared to the iPhone. I asked about this and the Apple person told me that they heard about the problem but was not sure whether or not Apple would refund/replace the Touch because this was all very "subjective."  How nice of them to screw us.  The iPod is a very very attractive mp3 player to buy, but it seems like it's starting it's descent into ho-hum land.   ** Update: The dark screen issue for the Touch has been fixed with the new update.  It would have been nice for the Apple store person to tell me this when I was asking about this issue on Sept 27th.

<Title>Former Gigabeat owner - converted to iPod, a review
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>majority of negative reviews are based on what the iPod is not, ie - a camera, a tivo replacement, a toaster, a scooter...  Let's focus on what it is - the best digital music SYSTEM on the market.  I was one of the first people to line up and buy a Toshiba Gigabeat MES60.  Great product, great interface, had it for a year.  So whay the switch?  lets focus on the IPod's attributes:  Storage - blows everything out of the water Interface - slight edge to the Windows Mobile, but overall very clean, and easy to use Accesories - when buying a HDD based player - it becomes not just something you take on the road, but an integral part of any home audio system, and lets face it the iPod is miles ahead of anyone here.  it was near impossible to find accessories for my gigabeat. Support - nonexistent for the Gigabeat.  I mean completely nonexistent from day 1.  so even crappy support (which i have not had to use with the iPod yet) is better than none iTunes vs WMP - i think WMP is easier to use and has more features to manage your collection - but this is where Apple really got it right.  While iTunes needs some help - they nailed it when it comes to how you can interface with other content.  it was just simple to subscribe to a podcast, upload a video from my tivo onto the player, and so far i have had no problems interfacing between the systems, not sometihng that i can say was seamless with WMP - definately some panic moments.  overall - 1 week into this - it was the right call.

<Title>Incompatible with Mac OS 10.3, when update is not a sensible choice
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, the iPod itself is a lovely piece of equipment, the functionality I was looking for in a pretty package, at an acceptable price. It could be a nice replacement for the old iPod that I wore out.   But (as of late September 07), buyer beware: it does not work with Mac OS 10.3. Granted, that is not the latest OS, but a reasonable version to run on a home machine. And, updating the OS at the time the iPod Classic is released is not a sensible option, given that 10.5 will be available very soon.   Apple could have done better than that - leaving their loyal, long-time customers hanging like that is a terrible business strategy. A 1-star rating not strictly for the product itself, but for the overall experience. (And one would think they would have learned from the iPhone debacle.)   So, loyal Apple users with OS 10.3 - it is a wise choice to wait until OS 10.5 is out.

<Title>GETS BETTER EVERY YEAR
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple once again scores high, this is my fourth ipod, first I got the U2 20 GB special edition, then 60 GB Photo Ipod, then the 5th gen 60 GB video Ipod and now this beauty, I has great sound, great video cuality, love the new interface and what I love the best is the space. The interface is not as slow as some people claim, it just takes between 10 to 14 seconds to change menus. So if you are thinking of buying a new ipod, get this one.
