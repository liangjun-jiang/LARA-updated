<Title>Another Sansa winner?
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product tonight to use with the SanDisk FM transmitter for use in my car. I store a lot of streaming audio, plays, books, radio talks, etc., from the BBC and NPR, and they're great to use on a long car journey.  The player was a refurb and cost me all of $17.00 - gotta be great value, especially with the ability to use a 2GB card. Some people have complained about the sound quality - I wonder if they've discovered the equalizer and WOW sound augmentation system. And I use it with a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones as well, so flights are a breeze.  Only negative so far is those floppy covers for the MP3 and mem card slots.  But for the price, you can't beat it.

<Title>Rip OFF!!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this Mp3 player a year or so ago.  The first time I left it in my care over night when it was between 45-55 degrees.  It never came back on.  I then returned the product because I had bought the extended warranty so I got a replacement.  I then gave the replacement to my father in law.  He used it inside and when he went to use it the next day the same thing happened.   These are cheap and terrible.

<Title>Terrible product. Poorly designed, poorly made, don't buy!!!
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife owns the Sandisk 256k (red) flash player which is great, so I figured I'd try this one. After all, it's the same company. Plus, it's a 512k flash player plus expansion at virtually the same price as the standard 512k flash player. What a mistake! The standard Sandisk flash player is solidly built, has an intuitive design, easy to use buttons (even if small), a clear bright blue display, and great sound quality (even when using MP3s at 128kbs). The Sansa has none of these virtues. It is incredibly flimsy; the buttons are nearly impossible to use, the battery door is made of tissue thin plastic and constantly falls off, the sound quality is rotten, and once you put the plastic case on you'll never get if off. Further, while the SanDisk MP3 Flash player plays tracks in the order you place them in the player (very efficient), The Sansa seems incapable of playing songs in anything but alphabetical order, a real problem for someone like myself who likes eclectic music: (one track "Paint It Black" by the Stones; next track "The Prophecy" from "The Fellowship of The Rings Soundtrack"!) On top of this my unit was defective. The lock would lock the sound volume only temporarily. Suddenly music would blare out and nearly bust my eardrums; next I could barely hear a thing. Pure garbage. Get the regular Sandisk MP3 Flash player or get an iPod for twice the price and a thousand times the value. This product is pure junk!!!!

<Title>Not great, but works for me.
<Date>Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Tight case and terrible headphones aside, for 81.00 dollars, I was pleased with the product. Using a different pair of headphone I thought the sound quality was good.  I stretched out the case alittle and have no problems there.I generally use mp3 that are 160 or higher so I was pleased with the sound.  A firmware upgrade would make it a better player. I have contacted sandisk about the upgrade. Hope they are listening. Great for playing audible books on tape (you can use the highest quality file format). Transferring all files was quick and easy. I'm using a 512 mg card that I already owned and can fit tons of songs. The sd cards can be found for low prices if you shop around. All in all for the price I am very pleased with the player.

<Title>Not as bad as I thought at first
<Date>Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I still like the their joystick players better, but I need to modify some of my previous comments: 1. The sound quality is pretty good - after you replace the headphones and fiddle with the equalizer and SRS settings. 2. The click wheel for changing volume and settings operates raggedly.  3. It is much clumsier when strapped to your arm than the joystick player. 4.It is extremely difficult to get out of its clear plastic case without damaging the case - but you can correct this by wiping a very fine layer of talcum powder on the inside (got that from a forum).  5.Most annoyingly, whenever you turn it off and back on it forgets all of it's settings.  You have to reset the volume, the equalizer, and the play order - you can correct this by reformatting the flash memory.  It must be formatted in FAT 32.  It comes natively formatted in FAT 16   I'd bump it up to 3.5 stars but they won't let me change that on an edit.

<Title>good quality, good value, great "starter" mp3 player
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the sansa for 3.5 months now, and have had no major complaints. Works well, easy to use, battery life is above average(I am still on 1st battery, and I use mp3 all the time). It is great for running or working out, won't skip like some hard disk mp3 players.   Is it the best sound in the world? No. But it is adequate, and other buds or headphones can be purchased. The only thing I would change is the playlist function. But putting songs in folders in order and renaming can fix this. It really does not bother me at all. How many entire albums are you going to listen to in a row anyway? Most times it is used while exercising, on the subway, on a plane, etc.  Overall, I highly recommend this little guy, you won't be disappointed!

<Title>Simple to use, inexpensive, and good
<Date>Mon Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After reading some of the reviews, I hesitated before buying this.  I've been looking for a flash drive to store more audible files and finally decided to buy this. I haven't had it long but I'm delighted with it.  The player is simple to work without looking at the manual.  It uses only 1 battery. I've replaced the enclosed earplugs with better quality ones and the sound is excellent.      I know some have complained about the wheel.  This is the first player I've had with a wheel and, possibly because of this, I've had no problem with how it feels.  My other flash player is an Iriver which has some additional features but is more complicated to use and far less intuitive.      The player is very light.  There are few parts to break and it seems sturdy. It also comes with a one year warranty.  Most other players I've checked out have a much shorter one.      A final plus is its exapandability.  I've been using a  512mb player for some time and haven't needed more space.  If I ever do, it's nice to know I can add it.  Addendum:  I've been using the player daily.  I still love it and find it easier than my iriver.  There is 1 glitch I've found re auto-resume.  Several times, while listening to an audible book, the player has come on back at the initial index instead of where I left off in the book.  It appears that to auto resume the book I need to press the start button very briefly.  If I press it for several seconds, the player opens at the settings index instead. Those having problems with auto resume might try this.

<Content>I have been satisfied with this product. It was simple to load songs on to the player. The operation is very straight forward and easy to understand as well as implement. The ear buds were different than I was previously acquainted with but after a short time, they were comfortable. They also provided an excellent quality of sound reproduction. All in all I am very happy with my purchase and would make this same purchase again if I had the need to do so.

<Title>Nice little player...
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Nice mp3 player, gets the job done. The FM tuner is a definite plus. The user navigation is ok. There is an upper right click-wheel is for scrolling and another button on the side to select a menu option, and the buttons on the front for song/radio navigation. Call me spoiled but I've gotten use to the consolidated buttons and menu navigation of my Ipod. I'm more comfortable navigating this with two hands, but that doesn't bother me.  The size is small; it fits in the palm of my hand. I actually like how this player looks. The main reason I got this was because it is flash-based and I can work out with it without worrying about jostling parts. And also because it's expandable. I use it with a 1GB SD card. That's a BIG plus.  Drawbacks are ones that have already been mentioned by other readers, e.g. doesn't have an auto-resume reader, but I don't listen to audiobooks so that's not a big issue for me. One minor annoyance is how the songs are automatically sorted by song name ascending. I know I can rename the songs with a number in the track title like others have mentioned, but that requires more work than I'd like. Also, I haven't figured out how to create a playlist, or if that can even be done. It allows the user to choose from album, artist, songs, and some other options, so I don't think there's a way to make a mix of various songs. If anyone has figured it out, please post it.  Uploading songs is simply enough. Connect the USB cable from player to PC and create folders and just drag and drops songs with Windows Explorer. You can also copy songs off the player back to PC, which is nice.  Battery life is fine with me. I used up the batteries that shipped with this in about a day I think and shortly after got NIMH rechargeable AAAs. If you use this with an external SD card, it's going to consume more battery power...  Headphones are ok; I've never been a fan on the in-ear design though.  The plastic case that came with the player drove me nuts the first week or so. It was skin-tight and I almost ripped the case the first few times trying to get the player out to change the batteries. But now it's loosened up and works fine. I'm withholding a star on this review for lack of belt clip on the case. This might sound minor, but I'm not a fan of the included arm band when working out and so I have to put it in my pocket or hold it. It's small but not ultracompact so a belt clip would have been nice. I haven't found another case that would fit this that includes a belt clip either. If Sandisk offered one, I would purchase it.  And something I found out when I first got it...you need to leave about 4MB of space from the Sandisk 512MB that's included on the player for its software to work. (And note to Sandisk: you have a spelling error on the error message that comes up if there isn't enough space).  Let's see what else...I took the plastic port and SD card covers off, those aren't going to stay on, but no biggie. It also comes with a stopwatch function in the software. I like the Sound Effect and Equalizer features of the software, and that it can also play WMA files. And I don't know if I am the only one experiencing this but sometimes when I listen to the radio, the volume level seems to drop about two levels on its own. It happens rarely though; not yet to the point where it's become an issue.  Overall, I like this player. I looked at various models before deciding on this one because it had both an FM tuner and was expandable. Compared to other players in its price range, the included features are great. I would purchase it again.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Thu Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was quite disappointed with my purchase.  Cons: 1) I could not figure out how to control the order of the song playing.  It would only play in random or alphabetical order.  I would have to change the file names for all the music files to make sure that the files play in the same order as the CD. 2) The SD slot was practically useless.  I have a 1GB chip and everytime the player powered-up it would spend about 5 minutes examining the files on the SD looking for new files. 3) This is the big one.  I was listening to the player in the car when I dropped it on the carpetted floor - it went dark and has not worked since.  New batteries could not bring it to life.  After spending a hundred on this, I have a dead MP3 player.

<Title>Pretty good piece of music equipment
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is pretty darn good.  It is light weight, easy to handle, and fairly inexpensive ($103 from Amazon).  I bought the Sandisk over the Rio and RCA offerings because Sandisk, at least in my research, didn't seem to have the number of complaints about product quality and lack of customer support that the other two brands had.  Also, it seems as if getting at least a 512MB flash memory player with an expansion slot is going to cost around $100.        This player represents the second Sandisk mp3 player in our household.  We were impressed with the ease of use and tranfer speed of the 512MB flash memory player (with no expansion slot).  The Sansa player is no different.  It is literally drag and drop on to the Sansa.  The number of features also put it over the top versus the RCA and Rio.  Overall, you can't beat the usefullness of this little gadget.  Pro's:  --Small size, light weight --USB 2.0 file transfer speed (transfer 100mb worth of songs in seconds) --Backlight display --Plays mp3 and WMA (you can put both on the player at the same time and it doesn't even blink) --Radio reception is fairly decent here in the hills, but still won't pick up all of the available stations in your area (none of the small mp3 players on the market get anything more than decent reception so don't use this as a selling point regardless of what you buy) --Sound quality is decent even when playing songs at 64Kbps.  If you use this compression level, get good earphones. --Lots of features including a customizable 5-band eqaulizer with presets, WOW surround sound simulator, and other sound effects.  Also, has stopwatch timer and a host of other settings you can play with. --Battery life is excellent.  Not as good as some, but still near the top of players that have good battery life. --It comes with pouch, armband, earbuds, usb cable.  Minor Con's: --When you purchase this player, buy headphones.  The included earbuds are pointless as the sound quality is barely adequate and the included 3 sets of earbud covers can't keep the earbuds in my ears. --The battery cover door comes off fairly easily.  It looks like it's on there pretty tight but it's not.  I think Sandisk did this because of the many complaints that the battery covers on their mp3 players were too difficult to remove causing many people to break the battery cover (like my fiancee did with her own player). --Your music files need to be properly tagged. I thought my files were appropriately named but this player doesn't seem to recognize the songs.  I think the ID3 tags on my music are not correct as the player will display the music title you typed in but it will also show the album, song title, and artist as unknown. --The buttons on the front are hard to push if you are not expecting it.  You just have to adapt to pushing the button deeper than you would think. --The volume is controlled by a rotary wheel on the top right side of the player.  It is very difficult to turn, especially when it is in the holder.  I would have preferred two more buttons on the front or side than the wheel. --Getting the player out of the holder is incredibly difficult.  Wipe of the display of the player and the inside of the plastic holder before putting the player in the holder.  The plastic film that protects the display during transport leaves either static or a light adhesive film on the display that makes it stick to the plastic holder after you put it in.  It took me five minutes and many attempts to get it out before I realized what happened.  Also be careful not to yank off the battery door when pulling the player out of the holder.    There you have it.  None of these gripes add up to more than a minor irritation which is why I gave it five stars (I would have given it 4.5 starts if I could have).  However, having experienced other mp3 players, this one has the best combination of manufacturer product reliability and product support, versatility and expandability (up to 2GB SD card), features, and sound quality.  My finacee has started using my player instead of her own player.     Added on 4/25/05: In my initial review, I forgot to mention two things.  The Sansa ignores your file organization so don't bother trying to setup seperate folders for different genres of music.  This is why I warned before to make sure that the music you have is named and tagged properly because it does allow you to play songs by artist, album, date added to player, and so on (let's hope SanDisk fixes this with some software upgrades).  Also, there is about a 1-2 second lag when switching between songs.  This can get a little annoying at times but you will get used to it. To be fair, one more upside is that I added a 1G SD card (SanDisk Ultra II) and after the initial 60 seconds to read the card and update the playlist, it doesn't miss a beat.  I still really enjoy this mp3 player.   Added on 05/02/05: My Sansa has started to drink batteries like I drink Coke.  Not sure why; it could be using extra juice to read music on the SD card.  I may have to purchase rechargeable batteries if this keeps up.  I got 6 hours of playing time out of my last battery.  My fiancee's Sandisk (a flash memory player, no expansion slot) goes about 15 hours on a AAA battery.  Not sure why the huge discrepancy between our two Sandisk players but my best guess is that my batteries are being drained reading the memory card.  It would be helpful if someone out there with some knowledge about this would write a review.    Added on 0725/05: After having a chance to live with the player for a few more months, I have to downgrade the rating to 3 stars.  The player has become harder to live with.  It plays reliably and the sound is good but it is still drinking batteries like crazy and the rotary volume knob hasn't loosened up much.  Sandisk hasn't offered any software upgrades to address the lack of being able to organize your files any way you want to and it is still very difficult to remove the player from its holder.  Having owned several makes and models of players before, this is still better than those players because each of those players died 2-8 months after purchase.  Shop around and get what sounds good to you.

<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player for one reason:  It's the cheapest device compatible with Audible and AudioFeast.  The integration with AudioFeast isn't elegant, but it works and I'm happy I can now easily use both services without all the workarounds necessary on my other player, which I now just use for music.  The interface will never be confused with that of an iPod, but with relatively limited memory that shouldn't be too much of an issue.  It's a pleasure to now be able to listen to public radio programs like This American Life and Talk of the Nation whenever I want.  I can highly recommend this player for users of Audible and AudioFeast, but if you don't subscribe to those services and just want it for music, there are better designed players available.

<Title>Close but no Cigar (or iPod)
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the e130, for about a month, it is a small light weight player that works well enough, but has one MAJOR draw back for me, it is unable to play tracks in their album track order. Basically this player only plays tracks in a shuffle mode or in alphabetical order.  You could rename all your tracks (as SanDisk support suggested to me) but if you have a large MP3 collection, this would be absurd.  Also you need to plan to spend at 1-2 times the cost of the player if you want to add an additional 1-gig or 2-gig memory card.  Use of the memory card also uses up the battery faster.  If you're not using the memory card, take it out.  I would suggest that if you are considering this player, plus a SD 2-gig card, you better be prepared to shell out at $250 dollars or more.  For that that kind of money, ante up another 50 dollars and get a 20-gig iPod, if size is not an issue or an iPod Shuffle if it is.  Sorry SanDisk, but you missed the mark with this one.  Maybe they can create a firmware update and fix this issue.... Who knows?

<Title>5 stars???  Are you kidding?
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I simply cannot believe this unit got rated 5 stars.  Those reviewers probably never owned a decent MP3 player before.  This player is mediocre at best.  Pro: NONE  Con: 1) Loose battery door, it falls off easily without even have to pull on it 2) High-tech lookin' but lousy earbuds, they can't even take the bass produced by the WOW enhancement; there are sooo much distortion when WOW is turned on. 3) horrible sound quality, I can hear every bit of artifacts of a 128kbps MP3 track; Sony network players can process it so well that you can't even tell it's a MP3, but this Sandisk can't 4) 1st grader UI.  The programmer designed the UI for this device must be novice at best.  This is the most cumbersome UI ever, you can't jump/seek/select easily.  You can't play by albums easily.  Thank god it's only 512MB of storage, if I have a 20GB disc-based player using this kind of UI, I would kill myself in a heartbeat. 5) tacky weird buttons, the up down left and right buttons are NOT responsive at all, because they are not discrete buttons, they are actually part of a cutaway plastic. 6) flickering blue backlight, when the output sound is power demanding, you can see the bluelight flicker, very very irritating. 7) non-attached rubber seals (USB and SD doors), you will lose them within a few uses; why bother supply them when they are not attached to the unit? 8) horrible menu nagivation: menu, tracks, album, whatever it is, you will always start from the 1st item; it doesn't remember previous position. 9) ear piercing tremble introduce a lot of high frequency into the sound, I get a headache in 10 minutes everytime 10) the scroller volume control lags like crazy.  in general, response time from button push or scroller clip is very long.  You have a much higher tendency to think "oh that was not loud enough, let me turn it up" yet in fact it takes almost 1 sec for the player to actually ramp up volume, your previous clicks will register when you do the second/third click, which then can over-ramp up the sound and it's way too loud 11) you can't put the unit in "STOP" state, PAUSE is the only state it will be in.  Which explain why skipping track takes a long time, because the unit is trying to load the next song.  Had it be able to stay in the STOP state, it would be a simple quick seek through files without the need to load the actual track. 12) the battery life is no where near what's claimed.  I think the unit is poorly designed that even at its OFF state, it drains significant amount of power.  I had an AAA Duracell Ultra, the battery mysterious drained about 1/3 while in the OFF state for a couple of days...  Sandisk: hire some real engineers and released a version 1.1 firmware soon!!!  Fellow customers: skip this, try a Sony, iRiver, iPod, Creative... anything on the market is better than this.  This unit excels in NO area at all.  There are flaws in every aspect of this device, and those flaws really make this unit a crappy product.  BTW, I don't work for any of Sandisk's competitor, I am just an engineer with a very fine tuned taste and have seen a lot of better players.  UPDATE 6/26/2005: I am now downgrading this player to 1 star.  It seems like at least 3 people found my review "not useful", oh well...  I am surprised that while I read the 5 star reviews, those people are generally complaining about the same things I am, yet they generously give this unit a 5 star.  After a few more days of usage, I am convinced this unit doesn't even deserve 1 star.  A good mp3 player should function well in core areas: sound quality, user interface, battery life and etc...  Unforunately, this unit doesn't do any of that!!!

<Title>Bad Sound Quality, Stupid Software
<Date>Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been using Creative Muvo for a while, which allow you to play songs in a folder. But this stupid Sansa only wants you to sort your music by Artist, Album and ... Anyway, I like to edit play list on my computer and selete maybe only one or two songs from an album. I like to listen to difference singers. But this become very tough with Sansa, you have to either listen to all songs or you have to edit your Tags.   I hope there is a firmware upgrade soon, which allow you to play a specific folder.   The sound quality is so lame, WOW is totally a joke. It is not even comparable with my old Muvo.  The only good think I can say is the SD expansion, but it looks so ugly when you put a SD card in.

<Title>Best iPod "knock-off"
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this unit for my wife on her birthday. She uses it constantly , we go through a lot of AAA batteries but its still more convenient than trying to replace the iPod battery. She has 80+ songs loaded and a few extra memory cards with approx 400 more songs that she carries with her, the entire set weighs about 6 ounces, with the extra cards. It has not caused any problem and she's had it for almost a year now. Great item , great price (I got it at a really low price- under $50)

<Title>Great product for the price! (Paid $30)
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having used this MP3 player for several weeks now, I have seen its pros and cons clearly. I bought this model because a) its is currently considered the older model = cheaper   b) it is expandable with an SD card (up to 2 GB) and c) has some body too it, it isn't just one of those tiny matchbox sized ones with a 1cm screen. So far I am very happy with my purchase. The screen has the artist, album and track name on separate lines making it very easy to see. If you scroll through the menu screens you will have many options for customized playback, including a detailed equalizer, one of my favorite features. If you have an ear for music, when you get yours, set this and turn of the SRS WOW effect. For anyone that doesn't know how to set this up to your musical taste, play around with the WOW, FOCUS, TruBass and SRS 3D effects. One of these 5 options is guaranteed to fit your taste. The volume levels put out by this player is also sure to satisfy. Some mp3 players only go so loud or only so soft. This model covers both ends of the spectrum, you can keep the volume low enough to fall asleep to or loud enough to blast your favorite song and feel as though you are standing in front of the PA at the concert. On to the physical design; I love the fact that this mp3 player is easily held in my hand and all the major buttons (Play/Pause, Back, Skip, and Repeat) are all on the front. It makes it much easier to change through songs while driving in the car. With some of the smaller players, you have to maneuver it around in your fingertips till you get to the buttons on the side/bottom/top. My vote goes to this model for its design. With that covering the few pros that I can think of off the top of my head at 2:05 AM, now on to the short list of cons. My only real negative thought about this player is that is does not take folder/file structure into account. Simply put, it jumps around between artists because is plays songs by track listing I think. So, to combat this dilemma, I just hit the menu button on the side and "Play by Artist." This brings up a complete list of all the artists in the memory and allows the user to select a particular artist and it will play all the files by only that artist. This works fine for me because I upload entire cds on there, not just tracks. I'll wrap this up so I can get to bed soon by saying it's a great MP3 player for the money. The player is user friendly, it comes with a clear case, armband, and surprisingly very good sounding earbud headphones. Once purchased, I recommend turning off the SRS WOW and just setting the equalizer to match your preference (i.e. more bass, more vocals (mid-range), more high-end (treble). Also if you have a couple extra dollars, $19 to be exact, go out and get a 2GB SD Card. If you wait, I'm sure the price of the cards will continue to go down seeing as 2 years ago I spent $70 on a 128MB card and last month I spent the $19 on 2GB card. To anyone that has no idea what that means, 2GB = roughly 2,000MB, so 128MB vs. 2,000MB. Big difference in space. Long story short, this MP3 player easily matches the performance of more expensive mp3 players while saving you a small fortune. It is perfect for the car, gym, napping, boring lecture classes, etc. If you're reading this, hopefully you found this review helpful, if not, read it again or look elsewhere for more reviews. Good luck.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00083XXQM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2499447-0175033">SanDisk Sansa e130 512 MB Digital Audio Player with SD Expansion Slot</a>

<Title>Great deal for MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked this up on sale for $65 from Amazon. The player is tiny, but the face is large enough that even my fat fingers can hit all the buttons just fine.   I had a 2GB SD card from my digital camera that I wanted to load MP3s on to for this player and it worked just fine. I put the SD card in to my laptop and copied over almost 500 MP3 files to the card. Then I popped the card in to the player. It takes a minute to read through the directory listing of the card and then it started right up. I haven't used the included cable to hook the player up to the laptop since I had the SD card ready to go.  There are only 2 real issues with this model. First, it eats batteries like candy. Fortunately, it only takes one AAA battery and it's easy enough to keep a spare or two at my desk. In fact, this battery issue is the real reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5. Second, it comes with a clear plastic sleeve that the armband attaches to. The sleeve is just barely large enough to cover the unit so getting the sleeve on or off is a pain. The battery can be changed without removing the sleeve. However, the SD card might pop up during this process - at which point, it's easier to take the whole sleeve off.   There are a couple of minor issues with this model. If you want to skip a song with the FF button, it takes a good two seconds (or more) to skip ahead. Just a minor annoyance. Also, the menus are a little difficult to navigate. All the regular functions one would expect (all play, shuffle, equalizer, etc.) are in there - somewhere.   For the price, this is a great player. Amazon is running a special on 2GB SD cards (search for "SD card bulk") for ~ $12, which gives this player 2.5 GB of storage (about 630 MP3s) for under $80.

<Title>Great little mp3 player!
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned the e130 for over a year now and have had no problems with it whatsoever. I think I paid around $60 for it at the time. I chose this particular player for a number of reasons--it has an expansion slot for up to a 2GB SD card, an FM tuner, runs on one AAA battery, comes with a USB cable so you can use it as a storage drive if you're in a pinch (which I've done many times at work!). The earphones are probably middle-of-the-road; they're still better than a pair of $6.99 tin-can sounding ones, and I haven't had any problems with them falling out of my ears. Battery life is decent; I bought 4 rechargeable AAAs and a charger for around $30 total and they're still charging fine even a year later. All in all, it's a great little mp3 player that, to me, is a step above the iPod Shuffle.

<Title>Greate player, easy to use
<Date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought it as a refub for $17.  The most that I like is that I can connect it to my computer with usb cable, and the player shows as a disk, then I just delete the music file that I don't want and copy over the file that I want, without go through the sync up process like the ipod.  It comes with a FM tuner as well.  Unlike the ipod, once the bettery is dead, dead as the player.  Just keep some rechargable betteries around, this thing can last forever.  It also allow me to expend its memory up to 2 GB with memory card, which costs like nothing these days.

<Title>Quit Working after Two Years
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this in early 2006 to use to work out with.  Since then I have used it close to everyday and utilized the expansion slot for most of that time.  Two days I tried to start it up and it was dead.  I changed multiple batteries to see if I had a bad one, but not.  It is done for.  Before this it had signs of giving up the ghost, such as the sound would wildly fluctuate if I bumped the button.  I believe I paid in the $80 range for this brand new and I am disappointed that it wasn't more durable.  It was never dropped and was well taken care of as well.  I guess it is time to join the cult of the iPod.  Well, it worked great when it worked, hence, the three stars.

<Title>Had it for 2 years and it's STILL going strong...
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>knock wood.  For what I paid for this little gem, I don't expect "state-of-the-art" with tons of bells and whistles.  It does what I want it to do, play my favorite music for me and NOT break.  It does have a fairly quality sound (with the 'right' tweaking) and IS RELIABLE (make sure you don't DROP it, STEP on it, LEAVE it out in the snow or SIT on it)...things/electronics tend to last longer if you avoid these actions.  There is 1 thing that's not so great on it (after 2 years) and that's the flywheel.  It tends to be somewhat unreponsive at times, but I'm going to try to use that 'canned-air' dust remover on it...hopefully that will work.  I LIKE mine and I can't complain.

<Title>great value
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have bought four of these babies and love them. I can't see 8 gigs for an MP3. If you have that many songs, you may as well listen to the radio. Half a gig holds lots of music and with the expansion slot, I download books on tape for long car trips. A two gig chip will hold 10 or 15 books or several books and lots more music. The FM tuner has great reception and fills in the gaps for those occasions when I would like to listen to some talk radio or some station that programs music I don't own. The display went bad on one of mine, and I was worried when I scanned the paperwork and saw no warranty info at all. I contacted SanDisk and they replaced it immediately. I have great confidence in the products this company makes.

<Title>Decent for the price / features
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all there is a firmware upgrade available (1.0.010a) which allows one to create "a" playlist within the device: http://www.sandisk.com/retail/sansa-firmware.asp  Using it with a 1GB SD card works well (but does cause a few seconds of delay upon startup). Some controls are a bit unresponsive and cheap feeling, and there is no alarm clock.   Style geeks won't be impressed, it aint no Ipod. Although you can organize songs in folders, the player displays them all in one list!  Annoying!  PROS: Inexpensive, simple and gets the job done. Can copy files easily to and from the device, no software needed.   Like the in-ear headphones that actually fit my ears!   Overall, not the most feature rich or stylish device, but great for the price / expandability and raw simplicity (kinda a USB flash drive with Music playback capabilities  :)

<Title>The Gist of it - Works Great for Me
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had mine for about two weeks now. Overall it's a great little player. It could be better, but definitly worth having. This item is recommended. Even when better ones come out later, it will be a great MP3 player to pass on to someone else.  I plan on buying another as a gift for a friend.  Comes with good headphones, but I have a really nice wide spectrum Sony set. Makes a difference in the lows and highs.  PROS: - The sound quality is excellent - same as iPod as far as I can tell.  - FM radio works greats - picks up all the regular stations I  listen to. Sounds good. The player is of a high enough sound quality to easily tell the difference between a good FM station and a good MP3 song. - Small and light - but seems durable enough. - Screen is nice - clear and gives all the info. You can set how long the light stays on. - Easily connects to computer via USB.  - SD card slot is nice. Takes about 6 seconds for it to load a 1Gb card the first time. Turning it on again later starts in about 2 or 3 seconds. Not annoying for me. - Good for audio books - 1) has a button to quickly lock button presses and 2) you can fast forward over previously heard parts. - Overall volume is loud enough for me - i like it real loud sometimes. - Equalizer - only 5 band but it's great and customizable. The presets are good but I use a custom setting. You can even set the player to play full bass tones via SRS (recommended with better ear buds) - Very compact and light. Easily fits anywhere you want. - Battery life is plenty long, longer than I can pay attention to. I listen to mine a lot.  CONS: - Navigation - not my favorite (I like folders), but it works ok. With a lot of different types of music with long names, it can be a bit tedious to get exactly what your looking for. - Main menu navigation is not immediately obvious, but you'll get used to it. It's not intuitive how to get a favorite station. - I agree with others the the volume scroll wheel is lame. Its doable but could be better. Takes pretty firm pressure to get it where you want.    MENTIONABLES: - FM radio  - it does remembers your last station and if you has present programmed in then it can jump to the next station forward or back. cool - Once you do figure out the navigation and how to find the song you're looking for, it's pretty easy and works well.  NEXT steps: - Really want it to play through my Passat's Monsoon sound system. :( - It'd be great if it could record voice or lectures. - Better volume control and 'menu' button. The latter is too hard to press. - Another model/brand has it so that it recharges the battery via USB! That'd be cool! - A little bit bigger screen. - Playlist creator

<Content>I made my purchase decision by comparing all the Amazon reviews for similar MP3 players. This one seemed to have the least negative remarks for an affordable unit. I have NO negative remarks. The sound quality (using the equalizer) is better than I had expected. The controls are not what I'd call intuitive, but they're easy to learn. The complaints about the armband case are puzzling - it's tight, but you just need to push it down from the top rather than pull it - comes right out! Maybe my MP3 tastes are not as advanced as some of the other reviewers but I think this is a great expandable player at a very affordable price.

<Content>The features on this MP3 are pretty standard. The SD storage slot is a nice touch. The screen makes it very simple to play songs by title, artist, album, or random shuffle. The battery life on an iPod shuffle may be better, but for the money, I'd buy this. I was able to fit about 18 full albums onto it using the internal and extertal memory (I had a 1 gig card). The first time I put songs on it, it took a few seconds to load, but after that it worked fine. It even remembers your place when you turn it back on.

<Title>Works if you work with it.
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>1. It DOES retain your EQ (and other) settings in custom after power off. 2. Sounds better without SRS Wow (menu>settings>sound effect>SRS WOW>off) this eliminates bass clipping (distortion). 3. Jazz or Rock EQ sounded good to me. 4. I rip CD's with audiograbber (free) at maximum sample rate (320 I think). Click the penguins to get all info for mp3 (if you use audiograbber you'll see what I mean). I'm sure there are other ripping software products that do the same. 5. If you have windows 2000 or later with the updates, forget the CD. Put it in the microwave for 3 seconds (it's cool to watch what happens). Windows will detect this device, no problem. Just plug it in, and use Windows explorer to transfer files. If you are not used to browsing for music files on a computer using windows explorer, then maybe you need the software to manage your files (bummer). 6. The headphones sound almost identical to the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia phones (like $25). (too hot on the mids for me though) However, I think the headphones included with this device have a little better bass. Mind you, they are not better than the Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia (which are $45). Nevertheless, I plugged in the Sony MDR-EX71SL phones and it sounded great! 7. Take an exacto knife and skillfully cut a place in the plastic cover in which to insert an SD card (kind of red neck I suppose). Never remove the device from the carrying case again. 8. You can sort by artist, genre, album, year etc. that's how I recovered from the "no folders" problem.  Why the score? I hate absolutes. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Office Depot for $70.  10/12/05 update.  Got 256MB card in and the powerup time is minimal 5 seconds or so. The battery life is maintaining.  Make sure to run the firmware upgrade by doing a google search for sansa-firmware, it should be the first result.    This will fix the order problem and a few others. It adds a Favorites list, as well. To use Favorites simply press and hold the center button for a couple of seconds. It will ask if you want to add the currnet song to Favorites, press the center button for OK, and that's it! You can clear your Favorites at any time.   The upgrade will ask you to clear all music from the Sansa, so be prepared. Firmware upgrades are serious business. Make sure you have a fresh battery and a reliable connection to the computer.  5/25/06 Bought two more for my children. All work flawlessly under heavy use. No need to upgrade the newer ones' firmware. I have three now. Getting ready to buy another one.

<Content>I wanted to purchase an mp3 player, but I wanted to stay away from I pods, in my opinion, your are mostly paying for the name and I felt that I could get a better value for my money with something else.  The Sandisk mp3 players immediately jumped out at me.  I finally settled on this one.  I chose it for a few reasons.  It offered me the storage that I wanted for the price; I am a poor college student so I cannot afford too much, and really how many songs can you listen to.  I also chose it because of the expandable storage.  Therefore, when my funds and my music grow I can add more to it.  I use this player everyday.  I did not even read the owner manual and I figured everything out, after making one or two mistakes, but the player is pretty much self explanatory.  I also loved the ear buds came with 3 different size covers, I have small ears and trouble wearing other ear buds, but with these, they fit perfectly and was very happy that I did not have to go out and buy different ones.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase; little sad that it went down in price since I bought it but go with the flow.

<Title>MP3 Player...
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a pretty good MP3 player. It takes both MP3s and the WMA files generated from Windows Media Player, and doesn't need you to run a program when transferring files, or for you to keep the original copies of the MP3s on your computer, saving PC space. It's pretty durable too, and very simple to use, and upgradable. It plays FM radio, though it uses the headphone cable as an aerial, so you've got to make sure they're straight when you're walking about. It's got a sleep option, which saves batteries when you fall asleep listening to music. It takes AAA batteries, so rechargables might come in handy. It also has a stopwatch...  I'm really glad this is the MP3 player I own.

<Title>basic, light and expandable!
<Date>Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great little mp3 player, simple as that!  It's easy to operate, has the option of expandability, and won't break your heart if it's stolen.  PRO's: *standard size (AAA) battery.  I hate proprietary batteries and chargers. In this, I use rechargeable or alkaline with no trouble, and even use this unit to sap the last bit out of batteries too low to use in my pen light.  *expandable.  My camera uses SD cards, so I have a few, and can multi-task them while on the road.  The expandability means my collection is as large as I want it to be, without need for upgrades.  With 1G SD cards going for under $20, I can have all the music I want.  *sound.  I get great sound quality from this unit, and even plug it into my computer speakers (with sub-woofer) for a more-than-decent sound system.  CON's: *earphones. the earbuds are better than ipod buds., but that's faint praise.  I upgraded to better headphones and am glad for it - though the earplug-style buds do block out external sound, and might be good in certain situations.  *features.  This has WOW and an equalizer, but no color screen, no video, no telephone, no WiFi, etc.  It's simply an mp3 (and wma) player.  Some people want more.  OVERALL:  I see no need to ever replace this unit, and would buy the same brand again without reservation.

<Title>Great MP3 for a great price
<Date>Sun Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What I like about the e130 is I can use the sd cards (use the fast read write 60x and 130x) to play music so I can have a library of sd cards to plug in. I use 2 gb ones and the prices are really coming down on the sd cards.    I use the online local library to check out audio books and use the FM transmitter (E100 Sandisk, bought separately) in my car to listen to on my way to work.  I modified the clear plastic case (removing the snaps) so I can use the clip (to shirt pocket, pants pockets) that came with the FM transmitter.  I've had mine for about a year and really like the sound and yes, if you turn it off, then turn it on later, it picks up where it left off.    The FM station comes in loud and clear.  I use a rechargable AAA battery, that way it saves on the cost of batteries.  I use different earphones that what came with it cause mainly the right earphone gave out on me, the earphones wasn't comfortable, and I wanted a better quality sound. I already had some good earphones, so that wasn't an issue for me.

<Title>So far so Good!
<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the simplicity and the beauty of it (it's so different from other mp3 players out there). I figured out how to add my own 'genres' and how to make it recognize my files and folders (retag your files, I simply use WMP to do it). I just need to know whether there is a way to make it pick up where it left: turn it off, then on, then say minute 2:34 seconds in the last song played (that's 6minutes 14 seconds long for example). Another thing: where can you get it new for less than $50?

<Title>A+++++
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The sound that comes out of that little machine is awesome.It has a eq that I did not know about. The WoW system that is in it makes it 10 times better. If you turn the WoW on then off again it has such a better sound. There is such a difference.The head phones are the best I have ever had they block out all the soud around you because they fit right in your ears there are 3 different sizes to fit any body.Plus I bought a couple 2 gig memory cards for the expation slot, off the internet for pretty cheap which makes it way better.I can hold alot more music. The mp3 player says refurb on the back but thats because it was sent to the factory to be upgraded.I would take it over a ipod anyday. The ipod can only hold so many songs and they are so expensive. The mp3 player you can keep buying memory cards and fill them with music.I love my sandisk e130 thank you. I would recommend it to anybody.Plus the fm radio comes in purfect. Now my girl friend wants one. She wants get rid of her ipod because she see's I can keep changing the memory card.I have more memory than her on my sandisk and she has a I think 4 gig ipod sorry to take up your time but i recommend it.

<Title>Great if you don't like playlists
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like this player but for me, it has a critical shortcoming...no playlist capability.  I am a road bike cyclist and I also teach an indoor cycling class.  When I am on the 50 miler, having the e130 with a 1 or 2G sd card helps.  It's like a big iPod shuffle with the capability of scrolling by artist, album and song selection.  I have a 512mb iPod Shuffle and it's not big enough and besides, every now and then, I'd like to listen to a particular song.  So, for a road ride (or whatever your time consuming hobby is) the e130 great, although if you have a 2G SD card in the unit, expect to wait about 30 seconds when you first turn it on as it searches the SD media for new files (annoying but not a huge deal).  Once on, and playing it's great.  The major pain is no playlist capability.  Since I teach a cycling class, it's important to have the music playing in order, since workouts are kind of choreographed.  I've downloaded the latest firmware updates, tried Sandisk tech's playlist fix for the e200 series (doesn't work for the e130), looked at the blog fixes (I'm fairly tech saavy but Linux is over my head). Nothing works.   So, if you're an iTunes user like me and need a playlist in order, here's the clunky fix I came up with.  First plug the e130 into the computer (remove any sd cards before you do this) with the usb. Erase any song files on the internal e130 memory.  (Keep your road tunes on the sd card and remove the card so that all the e130 can read is songs in the RAM memory.)  Next build your playlist in iTunes.  Then click on the first song in that list to highlight it.  Then hit control r, which highlights the song's mp3 file in windows explorer.  Drag the file over to the e130 directory in windows explorer.  Do this for each song.  (This saves you from having to look for each mp3 file manually in windows explorer.)  If you don't need an order of play, then you're done.  If you need them ordered, go to step 2.    Step 2: Click on the e130 directory in windows explorer.  Right click on the first song in your desired order.  Highlight properties.  Highlight summary.  Click on the song title in the Title area under Description, which should highlight the song title as editable (make sure you click on the actual song title, not the title icon).  Edit the song title by adding a 1 or the letter 'a' before the song.  Continue with song 2 using 2 or a 'b' until you finish your list.  I prefer to use a b c d, etc because some software will play a 15 song set with 1, then 11, 12,etc.  I didn't test the e130 for this.  You may want to try numbers.  So now you have the playlist with the order you want.  Warning, you can't just edit filename of the mp3 file to order the songs because the e130 is not looking at filenames.  It is looking at another field in the file description, part of the id3 information.  That is the 'title' field that is referred to above in the windows properties.  Lastly, be sure to edit these files on the e130 directory, not the files on your computer if you want to maintain your itunes library intact and in sequence.  Fyi, for a 15 song (1 hour) playlist, this took me about 7-10 minutes.  yeah, it's clunky and a pain, but if you're like me and you gotta have it...  Sound quality is decent and the e130 plays remarkably well through amplifiers (better than the iPod shuffle, which suffers from clipping unless you turn the amp way up).  You may need to turn the WOW sound setting off if you want to crank it up in the car stereo.  Get yourself some better headphones.  I like the Sony MDR-J11G sports headphones, which are decent sound quality and super efficient.  They cost about $12-15 bucks delivered on the internet.  Lastly, battery time is pretty good for a single AAA battery.  I got a couple hybrid rechargeables and they last about 12-14 hours per charge.  Gosh, I keep thinking if Sandisk would only add some firm ware to correct this seemingly minor software issue, they would sell a lot of these.  Maybe they already have with the latest series.

<Title>A highly under-rated product
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I read all of the reviews on this page before buying the Sansa;  some were fairly critical so I had second thoughts.  In the end I decided to try it because it had all the features I wanted for a reasonable price.  I'm so glad I did.  I use it with a 1gb SD card.  With the card, the player holds about 55 CDs, and I keep some music on other smaller spare SD cards to occasionally swap out music I don't listen to as often without removing any of the albums I like to keep on hand.  Without any expansion, the player will hold about 15 CDs.  A note -- when copying songs onto the SD card, make sure you create sub-folders and put the songs into them.  If you put all of your music directly onto the card and not in any subdirectory, the player will not recognize them all;  you'll get messages that the card is full when it isn't, and songs you know are on there will not be found.  At first that's what happened to me.  Then I moved my songs into folders (I named them "jazz," "rock," etc) and the problem completely went away, and the folders had no effect whatsoever on the music directory that shows up on the display.  It took me awhile to figure all this out, but once I did, I was able to get to full capacity.    That was the last and only problem I ever had with this purchase.  The radio works suitably and gets adequate reception (admittedly I wish it had AM, but it doesn't).  The screen display is effective and attractive for both radio and for audio files.  The sound is good, and inserted properly, the headphones block out noise extremely well, stay in your ears, and provide quality sound -- with these headphones I can use this player mowing the lawn, on the treadmill, and doing other things that usually are too loud to use portable audio.  It's true that out of the box you cannot play songs in the order they're on the album, or create customized playlists.  I find this to be a non-issue, or at worst a minor problem, but realize for some people it would be significant.  There is now a free firmware upgrade that fixes this.  By downloading the updated firmare (do a google search for "sansa sandisk firmware upgrade," it will be the first hit), you can create playlists, and songs will play in original album order instead of alphabetical.  Problem solved!!  But upgrade the firmware FIRST when you buy the player, not after loading music onto it, because the upgrade erases everything on the player and you'll need to reload.  It can go through battery power pretty quickly;  but I love the fact that it uses conventional AAA batteries.  Frankly it is much better to run out of power in 8 hours (if all the eq features are on, the display is bright, etc) but be able to pop in a battery, than it is to run out of power in 15 hours like an iPod but have to stop your workout (or be out of luck while out on a jog) to plug it into a USB port (or pay extra for an external AC adapter).  When the guy sitting next to me on the plane has his iPod die, he's out of luck, perhaps for the rest of his trip.  When my Sansa dies, I just put in a fresh AAA battery.  I paid about $80 on amazon (plus about $50 shopping carefully for a 1gb SD card).  I couldn't be happier with the purchase and recommend this player highly.

<Title>A very good product to get but hard to find.
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was very fortunate to find this product for $45 new through amazon.  As I look now this item has been discontinued and no longer being produced. My previous player was a Creative MUVO Sport c100 with 256MB expandable SD slot.  I was forced to relinquish my player to my wife and found this one which can be considered an upgrade.  Pluses are the size is smaller than what I had before and it holds twice as much music.  The headphones are very nice in that they block out any outside noise which you may like or dislike.  The case and arm strap are less than what was desired and the volume is controlled by the wheel rather than the up/down buttons which I was used to.  It may take some getting used to.  Sound quality seems to be less impressive than my Creative Player otherwise it is acceptable for the Gym however the wrap around headphones on the creative Player did not last and fell apart.  I hope Sandisk would reconsider the design of the new models coming out which appear much bulkier and no longer have the expandablilty of the SD slot anymore.  I believe this feature prolongs the useful life of the product but maybe it keeps people from replacing their players as well.

<Content>A couple of months ago I bought this wonderful mp3 player.  Of course Amazon's shipping went smoothly and the little thing works like a charm.  Recently though I lost my earphones, and thought that I could just go online and buy them.  Not as easy as that.  I could find them no where and I loved these, they are very comfortable and have great sound quality.  So I called up Sandisk Support and they are mailing me a FREE pair.  I just really want to thank Sandisk for all their love and support, I think the company is just great.

<Title>Great player for a great price!
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did little research before buying this device, from what i saw clicking on 2-3 websites, it seemed pretty ok. Now i am owning it for almost a week, and i can tell you it is great.  Pros: The LCD is well readable, good ilummination. You have all the information you need, at the first look: artist, song, album name, duration. Downloading files to the player is very easy, you dont need no special software, its all just drag and drop. The menu is very easy to use, you dont have to look into the manual (which is not very detailed, and pretty useless). The radio works very good, you can save 20 presets. The SD slot also works well, even if I don't use it, I tried to put in a MMC card, and there were no problems. Battery life is ok, i bought 2 rechargeable 800 mAh batteries.  The earphones are just great. Before buying this player, I never even heard of that "in-ear-phones". At first, I didn't know how to use this new earphones properly, but after I figured out, I realised that they have great sound, even the bass sounds good. They fit well in your ears, and they are pretty comfortable. If not, you can choose between 3 different sized covers, depending on which fits to your ear. The covers are easy to detach, so cleaning them is very easy.  Also, the player comes with useful accessories: a plastic case with 3 buttons. Not only that it is keeping away the dust from your player, but you can very easily attach it to your belt, instead of filling up your pockets with the player. Also, for sporty people, there is an armband, so you can use the device even while jogging.  THE PRICE of the device is just great. Here in Romania, I buyed it for around 80$, while any other 512 MB flash player is way over 100$.  Contras: The only contras are the volume knob, which won't work very smooth, and maybe the fact that you have to take of the plastic case everytime you want to plug in the USB cable, but I think thats just ok.  In conclusion, the Sansa e130 is a great player for an unbeatable price. I recommend it to everyone, maybe if you have more money, you could look even at the new e200 series (with 2-6 GB memory and color LCD)

<Title>Multipe problems!
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 player on sale and at the time, I thought it was a steal.  But I quickly found it was not so.   - The headphone jack doesn't play stereo (only mono) when you put the headphone jack in regularly. The only way you get stereo is if you pull out the jack half-way. I'm willing to accept that this may be a dificiency with my player alone. - When you upload files, the player puts them whereever it wants. It doesn't put them in order, like the newest to the oldest added files. - Scroll feature is not adaquate if you have a lot of files.  It takes forever to get to the song you want because it scrolls one at a time.   - It doesn't read a lot of MP3 files that I know are good, because I can play the same songs on my computer.

<Content>I love this mp3 player! I got it last christmas from my grandparents because they had heard that i had been carrying my c.d. player to school with me and they thought it would be more organized. It is way better! I had it with me every day on my walk to school and back and the battery lasted at least 2 weeks! It is awesome because I can put an expansion card in there so i can play more of my music and it is soo portable. I can stick it in my purse to ride my bike to the library and dont have to worry about it skipping. It is so easy to download my music on there or even rip some from my c.d.s i have about 71 songs and it is great. I havn't had one problem with my player since cristmas. I wouldn't care if it had a bookmark on it cuz i like to read my books not listen to them. the headphones are great because the ones that come with other players are those hard ones that fall out, these ones are nice and they stay in my ears so i dont have to worry about them falling out every five seconds. I think this is definatly a wonderful product and I wouldnt want any other one!!

<Title>Good alternative to an iPod
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little thing is an excellent and much cheaper alternative to buying an Apple iPod. I've had mine for almost a year, and it's still going strong. It takes one AAA battery, which is very convenient for me. It's small, lightweight, and portable. You can sort by artist, album, and genre, to name a few. It has 512MB of internal memory (which I didn't find to be enough), but it also has the SD slot, which allows me to add my 1GB card. Overall, I have not had any problems with it, but I HATED the ear buds that came with it. They hurt my ears, so my mother bought me a different pair. However, I'm inclined to believe that this is just me, as my sister uses them and likes the feature of being able to change the cover to fit her ears. The sound quality is excellent, and I'm impressed that such a little thing gets such a good FM radio reception. I haven't had any problems listening to the radio with this device. Transfer from my computer to this player is very simple, as my computer sees it as another hard drive, and I can simply copy-and-paste albums. You need to copy it over in folders, or it's all a huge mess; mine wouldn't recognize any of the songs when they weren't in folders. However, you need to adjust your file tags, or the player will only show you the title, and not the album or artist. Also, when they're in folders, the device sorts them by artist, album, etc., and not by your folders.   I wouldn't recommend this MP3 player for someone looking to listen to long MP3s or audio books, as it has no bookmark feature. Also, the volume wheel for mine is slightly messed up. If I turn it down, sometimes the volume drops to zero, or it goes up to max. This can be a bit of a problem if I am turning it down because my music is loud. I don't use the plastic case, because it has no belt-clip, and I don't like the arm strap; it irritates my arm. I bought the silicone case, and it's a much better case. However, it doesn't protect the screen from scratches, and the plastic one does. However, it's almost impossible to get the thing in and out of the case. I fought with it for 5 minutes. It was very frustrating.  Overall, if you're looking for a lightweight, reliable MP3 player for listening to music, this thing is for you. There are some minor cons, but not enough for me to lower my rating. I still think it is an excellent MP3 player. However, if you're looking for a player to play books or long MP3s, I wouldn't recommend it.

<Content>I got this MP3 player at BestBuy for $47.00 on black friday.  For such a cheap price, this thing has impressed me so far.  If you're looking for a low-price MP3 player with quick results, just buy this.  250 songs is enough for me because I am always changing them around and what not. If you have Windows Media Player its very easily to drag music and download it to the player.  Ipods are overpriced and a bit terrible.  Oh yea and the earphones for this thing are terrible but the rubber knobs on them are extremely fun to play with.  Rumor has it that this comes in pink too...

<Title>Sandy Sansa
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this MP3 for my deployment in Iraq. It has survived all the abuse (ie: climate, sandstorm, and accidentally dropping it). Transferring music files is a snap. The sound quality is good. It even has a sleep feature (up to 2 hours). The in-ear headphones help filter out some of the noise so you can hear the music better. I especially love the memory extension feature. Overall this MP3 completed all of my basic needs. Just one note. The case was ample but sucks when it's hooked on the armband. It keeps on falling off so I modified it with the velcro sticker. I suggest that you do the same thing or purchase a better case for it.

<Title>Excellent Entry Level Device
<Date>Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent entry level device for listening to music.  The sound is ok.  But switch to a different set of headphones.   The earbuds are adequate.  Better than other sets I have tried.    The controls are simple.  It is almost as if its designers were attempting to replicate the IPOD (without getting sued).  I do have two issues with this player.  1) You can't plug it in to an electrical current.  I like to load music on to it and take it to work to listen to on my stereo in my office.  Not being able to plug it in to the wall outlet means I have to utilize the battery always.  It has a reported 17 hour playing time...  this means if I only listen to it at work I will go through at least 3 batteries a week.  Expensive.    The second issue is that there is no jack to play music through devices such as a stereo.  There is a workaround for this, however.  You can purchase a cord designed to split stereo audio in to the left and right (white and red) plugs that fit into your stereo.  This cord plugs into the headphone jack of the player.  It should only be a few bucks at your local radio shack.    I also like this player because it has upgradeable memory.  This is the same memory module that our digital cameras use.  So, if you have extra sandisk chips lying around you can erase their contents and save music on them.  Imagine having an entire collection of music on five or six (or even ten... they are really that small) 1 gig memory chips that fit into the palm of your hand.         Also, the sandisk has something cool that I have hear that ipods do not have.  A radio.  This feature is nice when you get bored with the music that you happen to have saved on to your player.    Plus, it plays windows media format songs, mp3's and other file types.  I have heard that ipods are limited to apple i-tunes and certain specific formats of songs.

<Title>Very Happy Overall, But Battery Issue
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently got the 512MB model and used it on a long airplane trip (24 hours each way)with Bose earphones, I had a 1 gig SD card with lots of music. As pointed out in other reviews, be sure to do complete tagging at all levels (album, track, etc. unless you just want to play in random mode) Synched to the Sansa with Win Media 10.   Two things I noticed: 1.When turned on, the device takes a lot of time to check the card for content updates, this seemed like several minutes each time even if the card content had not changed. 2.The battery life was more like 3-4 hours at best, maybe due to the SD card, you might want to consider the 1 gig model. I am still checking to see if different batteries make a difference. Also, if the battery is low, the device automatically shuts off after the card check, not before, so you have to change the battery and do it all over again.  However, I found the device to work very well overall in spite of the above, sound quality and volume no problem with the Bose phones, which I used before with CD player on airplanes. I see price on this device is still coming down. The FM worked OK even overseas, but would not get all stations probably due to being inside buildings, if you do get a clear station the quality is fine.

<Title>The Best
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this product now for about 5/5 months.  There is no MP3 player better then this at the price I paid.  It has an expansion slot which most mp3 players do not have.  After I used the player for a couple months I don't have any problem getting it out of the plastic case.  The ear buds are okay but I have a pair that covers my ears, that blocks the noise while I am cutting the grass.  It is easy to step thru the different modes.  I like the fact that you can replace the batteries versus a built in battery.  Maybe the volumn control keep be a puch button rather then a wheel.  This is in deed a fine product.

<Title>Great Product, but...
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Of all the Mp3 Players I've listened to, this one definately plays the best quality music. Great features and you can easily find the song of your choice.  But, there has been a downside. The Mp3 Player automatically shut off on me after only 3 days of having this product. I thought it was the battery, but it was not; I changed the battery several times, but the Mp3 player would not start. A day or so later, it finally worker properly again.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Sandisk Sansa thinking that it would be a good, durable mp3 player. Boy, was I wrong. About a week after I bought this player, the LCD screen got shattered after being in my pocket. I was able to return the player, and get a new one. About 2 months after I got the second player, the same thing happened. Now I am stuck with an mp3 player with a shattered LCD screen. If I were to do it again, I'd go with the smaller Sandisk player. It's less expensive, smaller, and is much higher quality. You may have to take some extra time to organize your music, but it pays off in the end.

<Title>Great little player but one flaw
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this Digital Audio Player for $64 after rebates. The user interface is good, screen is clear and bright, sound is great, the FM radio works well enough, and the expansion slot will keep my daughter happy when she wants to add more music. Battery life is good and I like the fact we can use standard batteries rather than a built in battery that can only be charged inside the unit.  It has one flaw for us though. We like to listen to audio books (which can be downloaded FREE from our local library!). However this player does not have an Auto Resume or Bookmark feature so when it turns off it will only start at the beginning of the book. For music this isn't a big deal. For books that can be 10-20 hours long this is unacceptable.  We will keep this as my daughter wants it only for music, but we couldn't use it for my son who only listens to audio books. For him we had to buy the other Sandisk 512MB Player without the expansion slot.

<Title>great product
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this mp3 because my aunt bought me an ipod shuffle, which was fine, except I wanted to be able to tell what song I was on, so I got this mp3. Its the first day ive had it, and ive been happy with it so far. One problem is that the volume control has a lag time, so you might turn it up and it seems like nothing changed, so you'll turn it up more than you need too, and end up blasting your ears out.[ive done it twice]Another problem was that the software wouldnt download, but windows media player works fine. I chose this mp3 because of its price.[and its a good deal!] The radio is a nice feature.The headphones work better than I thought they would. Earphones never stay in my ears, but these never fall out, and have very good sound after you mess with the equalizer. I like the cover. I read other reviews on this product, and they almost all say its hard to get the cover on and off, but I had no problem at all. In all, I'd reccomend this product.

<Title>Pretty good overall--Great for Audiobooks
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this for about two months now and here are my thoughts:  Pros * Has an SD slot, which gives more room for more songs (I could get 124 songs on it by itself, and with the SD added could get close to 340 or so songs--if you use WMA format you can get more songs on). * If you are listening to an audio book (I get mine from audibles.com), it will keep your place.  There were some instances where it didn't, so I had to search for my spot (I think it is because I switched and listened to music). * Easy to put music on (I have found this much easier than my iPod Shuffle). * Easy to navigate through menus * I enjoy being able to listen to FM * You are able to lock the keys so that if it is in your pocket nothing happens.  Cons * Not compatible with iTunes (this is annoying since I also have an iPod). * Can't set up play lists, it will play things alphabetically (you can listen to only a certain artist or album, but it will play it alphabetically, not in order from the CD). * I find that it can be hard to read sometimes. * Goes through batteries quickly--(I switched to rechargeable batteries).    I would have liked an option of being able to plug it into something, for instance the cigarette lighter in my car, instead of only having to rely on batteries, but it isn't too bad.  Overall this is a really nice, easy to use unit.  I would highly suggest it for those who like to listen to audio books.

<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>getting good headphones (the included ones are simply horrendous), and turning the SRS WOW off. Sometimes the SRS WOW might make a song sound terrible in some parts. It's usually really good, but sometimes you might need to turn it off. Plus, I think it uses up more battery power.  Don't listen tot CNET's "mediocre sound" complaint. They're too stupid to play around with the settings before reviewing this excellent product. I'm going to post an intensely long review soon. Until then, this is sufficient to remedy that complaint.   P.S. My first E140 quit turning on after less than a week. I got a replacement, and so far it works fine. If it stops working, I'll give up on it. If it works, I'll give it four stars.

<Title>Quiet a good player .. Nice piece voice quality is also very good
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Quite a nice piece , voice quality is gr8. Special design of earphones produces nice bass etc and external voice cant disturb at all. It fits very nicely in ears. I have used it only for last two days and quite satisfied by the performance.  Cons:  I think that external design should be improved a little bit   1. SD slot and USb slot cover (plastic caps) are totally removable ,I dont think this is good. They should remain attached to player otherwise it increasing the chances of loosing them which will lead  to dust in player and will lead to its damage.  2. It should also come in some other nice colours like black and white etc.  3. Most important it should not have USB cable ,it should be able to attach to Computer directly , like ipod shuffle.    Otherwise the player is quite nice.   Thanks Saurabh

<Title>Great MP3 player/great value
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 player, and I can see where a person could get addicted to them.  I only use mine for audio files, so I cannot speak to music quality.  But, I have only had it for 3 weeks, and I have already bought the external speaker dock and a secure digital card to expand its capabilities.  Adding and deleting files are a snap and I like the feature to have everything in alpha order.  I find the navigation very simple and I especially love the small size. My only complaint is that I had a hard time finding a leather case for it, since everything out there seems to be for the iPod.  But, I found one at Best Buy for $9.99 that seems to work.  I would highly recommend this player for anyone who wants to jump into the world of MP3 players.  It is awesome and I can't imagine being without it now.

<Content>I have had this unit for a few days and have found it to be an excellent player. With Rapsody (outstanding service) it was easy to rip and download content from my CD collection. I am especially happy with the additional memory slot. I was listening to music on my PDA, but battery-wise, it ran the unit down quickly. This unit uses one AAA battery and it really did last for several hours. Navigation is useful. I read some complaints about the volume wheel being hard to turn, but being hard to turn makes sense. For an active person, one could accidently turn the wheel and experience  distress with an unexpected increase in volume. Hence building the resistance into the wheel is a good idea.

<Content>I don't have the money for a I-Pod but this is a wonderful alternative.  It is small and portable and its big plus is the SD disk drive that comes on it. This way you don't have to buy a whole new MP3 player when you run out of space.  Just get a new SD disk so space is unlimited.  Another big plus is the arm band that comes with it so it perfect for running or walking and you don't have to stuff it in a pocket.  The one downside is that you can't create a playlist and have to thumb through the songs manually. But it is easily compatible with Realplayer and a real find for the money.

I downloaded the firmware upgrade before I used it cause one of the reviewers on this site said I should and I'm glad I did, because I wouldn't have wanted to erase my mp3s off of my mp3 player to upgrade it.  Now I want to get a SD card to put my other type of music on here. Right now, I'm just using the internal memory for my fast music for my workouts. But when I get a SD card I'm going to add more types of music.

<Title>Good for random songs, but bad for album/artist organization
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sansa apparently pays no regard to organization of mp3s into file folders, instead playing songs in alphabetical order (rather than by album or artist). Playing an "album" (folder) of songs requires digging into a submenu, and even then depends on all songs having well-formatted ID3 tags. The interface is somewhat clunky, and hard to use without looking (an important consideration for listening in the car).

<Content>The product is excellent the 500MB held a little over 150 songs for me in WMA format.  It was relatively easy to learn.  I had to adjust the graphic equalizer to make the sound right for me.  The battery cover is a bit loose and the screen display is a little small if you do not have 20 20 vision.  I'd recommend the 1GHZ unit for more song capacity and loose the ear buds too tinny.  But it does what it was made to do give you excellent sound in an easy to figure our package.

<Title>Really good basic player
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'd been searching for a SD-expandible player for some time. I use a PDA w/ SD cards, so it is very convenient to swap them between devices when going to the gym. I was a little cautious going with a SanDisk player, b/c the last SanDisk mp3 player we bought was a disaster (lipstick-sized one w/ joystick and lcd), but this one has turned out quite good. I've been very happy w/ the player at the gym and on the road. It gets most of the basic functionality right, has good sound, and is flexible/expandible and cheap. Other thoughts:  The Good: * Great size and weight. Not to big, not too little * SD support (huge plus) * Perfect accessories: Armband, actual battery, decent headphones (for working out) * Good sound, SRS WOW * Doesn't use annoying touch controls. There is nothing worse at the gym than an iPod or Creative Zen with the touch controls instead of buttons. They get accidentally pushed so much that you have to lock it - which then makes just changing a track or pausing it to talk to someone a complicated , many step affair.  The Bad: * Really needs bookmarking functionality. I was suprised that a player w/ Audible.com support did not offer this. I listen to audio books quite often, and not having this is a pain. * I really don't like that they overloaded the power button on the side so that you use it to get to the main menus. Makes it cumbersome while working out. * Can take quite awhile to read an SD card when inserted. The player is inoperable while it is doing this too. * They should offer a no-internal-memory version of this and just bundle an SD card. Once you start using the cards, the internal memory is just inconvenient and pointless.

<Title>Damned good MP3 player!
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought this product and am listening to it now. I can tell you that though the earbuds don't give quite the quality sound that the ones from my Creative Muvo do, I otherwise have no complaints. I opened the box, put in a AAA battery and plugged it into my computer's USB port. I was able to download songs easily (though it did seem to take longer to download than my Muvo did) and voila!  Like I said about the earbuds, they aren't quite the quality my other ones are (I do notice some minor static where there wasn't any on my other ones, but when plugging those in, it sounds perfect!), but they fit more securely and comfortably in my eard than my others do, so I consider it worth the sacrifice, especially since I usually listen to my MP3 player via my car sterio speakers anyway.  The SD slot holds my SD card securely and there is a key lock switch on the side that prevents accidental pressing of the buttns (including the volume), so you won't have any problems with accidentally bumping it and switching the song or anything.  The settings are mostly intuitive and I have figured out all the basic functions without using the manuals or included software.  If great sound is important, then invest in better earphones, but otherwise this product is everything I could want in an MP3 player!  The platic carry case is less than spectacular, as a previous post mentions, but again, this is a minor irritation at most.  My only complaint is the sound quality from the included earbuds, which brought it down from an otherwise 5 stars to 4.

<Title>The best bang for your buck
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had the player for over a week now, and I can already say I'm very well satisfied with it. Intially I was very nervous with buying it (I'm a rather poor guy, and slapping down $70 on anything is a big thing for me). It seemed to me at the time, though, that after weighing the options, features, and prices of other mp3 players, this one was the best option; and luckily for me, it was.  Hands down, the thing I like most about this mp3 player is the SRS WOW effect. It's something I can't really live without, since it makes the music so much more alive and vibrant (I use the SRS WOW effect in windows media player too). Now, I don't actually know if other mp3 players have the SRS WOW effect too, due to not having tried any of the others, but none of their product specifications even mention having it, so I'll have to assume this is the only one so far.  The earbud headphones that came with this are actually pretty damn nice too. They -can- be a little uncomfortable if you're not used to using earplugs or if you don't have them set in your ear just the right way, BUT once you get used to it you can ignore it pretty easily. Also, with earbud phones you don't have to worry about "headphone hair" either (I always used only headphones before getting this player).  The FM radio tuner function is nice, but it would have been nice if they had made it recieve signals better. Some sort of FM antenna attachment would also be nice for this player, but I don't really know if there is one. This feature is more of a moot point if anything.  I definately like the capacity for this player, given the price. For some reason I still see even 128 and 256 mb players being sold for -higher- prices than this player, and I can only laugh. Honestly, having been a CD guy for so long, the lower storage wouldn't bother me as much, since it's still enough to hold a good 2-5 CD's worth of music (just a matter of choosing what you want to hear ahead of time). But the 512mb on this one is very nice, since I can hold about 8-10 CD's worth of songs (I use MP3 format instead of WMA). The real boon here, though, is that if I ever decided I needed more storage, that instead of buying a whole new player, I can just get an SD card and then I have anywhere from 128mb to a whole 2gigs of extra space for songs.  The controls take some getting used to, but once you get them figured out its a good setup, I think. Although, it would have been nice if there was some sort of setting for the player that allows you to specify whether or not you WANT to use the indigo backlight. Because every time you fiddle with the controls it flips the light on, regardless of whether or not you can already read the screen. I find that to be something that's an unneccessary possible drain on the battery, but oh well. The battery still lasts a long time as it is.  There are moot points that could be gone over (the nifty armband and carrying case that work well, being able to use space space on the player to store files/data, etc), but in the interest of time I'm gonna sum this up.  Long story short, this player is worth the money. Especially if you're a holdout like me who stuck with CD players for as long as he could and you're trying to find somewhere to get in on the MP3 trend or you're just tired of having to carry around extra CD's with you. Even if you're not like me, I think you'll still enjoy this nifty little player.  Thanks Sansa, and thanks Amazon.com. ^.^

<Title>Quality MP3 For a Low Price
<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros -Arrived about a week early, with free shipping -Backlight -Menu is easy to navigate -Low price -Shuffle/Repeat functions -Holds about 150 songs -Radio -Stylish case -Easy to transfer songs -Pocket-sized -Low battery indicator -Various playlists, ex. new music, favorites, artist, album, etc.  Cons -Bad sound quality with the earbuds it comes with, unless you jam them in your ear and put yourself at risk for premature deafness. I'd recommend spending $10 and buying a new pair -Only 493/512mb are available to save songs to

<Title>Died in two weeks
<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product was a complete disappointment to me. After reading a number of positive reviews, I purchased this device to use with audiobooks from Netlibrary. The first disappointment was in discovering that although you can play wma files on the e130, it cannot bookmark them. Therefore, it is difficult to find where you left off, especially when you're listening to an 11-hour book. The next disappointment came when after only two weeks, the device will no longer power up. And finally, I am frustrated by the fact that I paid $66 for this device and two weeks later the price is $54. Buyer beware.

<Title>really good :-P
<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i got this mp3 because of the prize. this is very light too. i dont like carying a cd player they get on your way too much. this beats an ipod very much. ipods cost more than a 100$, and those things go out of fashion like the minis people bought them and now their old. well this mp3 is good because of its radio, and the fact that you can put expanction cards to it. this is one of the best mp3 you can buy. and they got the update software that lets you  you choose "Play Music-->Album" and select album name, tracks are sorted by track number rather than alphabetical order. the website is [...] you have to back up your songs or otherwise they will be deleted. also buy the rechargable batteries which cost like around 10 $ for 4 but make shure that their max is about 2400 or the others just will die in a couple of hours. the charger itself can be bought at target for 10 $. o and by the way buy some earphones the ones included make you feel like you have wax and they can make you deaf. buy some sony of ne ones you have at home. well thats all. enjoy

<Title>My kid loves it!
<Date>Wed Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After returning the Macvision because it crashed my computer and it was incredibly difficult to operate, I went to Circuit city and purchased this one for my 11 yr. old daughter. I give it 4 stars because it is plasticky, but for a kid....hey, not bad.  I paid more than if I had bought it here, but since we had purchased for her B-day and had to return the other one, I felt that she should have one and enjoy it right away.  It did not dissapoint, she was enjoying it almost immediately.  We downloaded all her music in minutes and did it directly from the cd drive to the mp3 player.    I have read reviews that the player quits working after a couple of weeks, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  We have not tested all the other features because we don't need them.    It was recommended by another reviewer to go to the website and do a firmware update before downloading music, so as to not loose the data, etc.  I did not find any firmware update on their website for this model, so maybe it does not need it?  If someone knows anything about the firmware, perhaps they'd be so kind as to post what needs to be done?  Thank you.

<Title>A pretty good player at a reasonable price
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Quite a good little player. Having the SRS/WOW and sound equalizer does help achieve a very good sound quality.   I suggest to compliment this player with a kit of rechargable batteries. One battery could last me up to 3 days but I don't listen to it all day. If you do I wouldn't be surprised if you get around 6 to 8 hours play time. Battery life depends a lot on your sound settings (equalizer, bass), if you use SD memory cards, lighting and volume levels. But I carry a spare rechargable battery with it and recharge the old one when I get home.  What might not be great to most people are some user interface issues. The menu is very minimalistic and you learn to navigate buy using the player buttons (play, repeat, rewind, forward) to move up, down, left, right. To confirm settings press the white round button in the center and to cancel press and release the power switch.  Once you learn this it is easier to switch FM stations presets and to play your music only from the SD expansion card for example.  The earphones have different rubber covers so you can choose the the pair that fits better, they are by no means cheap I find them adequate.   I didn't botter to place it inside the plastic carrying 'case'. It would just stick to it and would be very hard to remove later, but then I don't take it out for jogging either.  The only bad thing I can find is that you don't get to preload your play lists, you do have favorite lists but you have to define them for every song. It would be nice to have random play as an option, I beleive it defaults to random when you select 'play all'.  I think the issue is that this player is no ipod in terms of appearance and design but it does exactly the same things quite well. I don't think you can find a better quality player at a lower price.

<Title>Good player but not always
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player since November and have had no problems with it... sofar.  I like the size and lightweight aspects of it.  I like that it has the key-hold function so that when it's in my pocket the songs don't change with an accidental bump.    The only thing that I didn't like at first was that the songs were ordered alphabetically and not by track number.  But, after installling the firmware upgrade found on the Sandisk website, it was no longer an issue. The link to the update is: http://sandisk.com/Retail/Default.aspx?CatID=1295 if you are interested in downloading it yourself.     Just beware because this mp3 player does not always work as it claims.  My boyfriend got one and before even putting any music on it, it died and would not turn back on again.  I myself have never had an issue with mine but he sure did.  He returned it and is waiting for his new one to arrive and hopefully this one will work better.  The sandisk website was very helpful to him though and even paid for his shipping to return it which is a plus.    I really love mine and bought a 512mb memory card for it so now it holds about 1 gig which is a good size for me.  The batteries seem to last for a good amount of time and if it dies it's super-easy to put in a fresh battery and not have to wait for it to recharge like ipods do.     This player is a good one for a budget.  I just hope that if you purchase one that yours works as well as mine does.

<Title>Player is great except for SD card reconginze problem have to swtich cards in order for the player to be reconginzed
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hi Everyone,  Here is my problem with the player and it is GREAT but my complaint is SANDISK is that you have to swtich the SD card in order for it to reconginze the same SD card.  Here is my problem.  I have a problem with the E140 series. The problem is I ordered it from Amazon.com and the player was defective in many ways. First, the radio shuts down automatically. I had to replace the player and the replacement worked, so the radio was fine. Then with the replacement there was a different problem. That problem was with the SD card slot. Let me just note that the SD cards works OK on other devices so there is no problem with the card.  I have let's say I have 2 SD cards, which I will call "A"&"B." When I put in SD Card "A," the first time it reads the card. When I pull out the SD card "A," then Obviously the player does not see the SD card because it is not inside the slot. Then if I put back the same "A" SD card, the player will not Recognize it. If I switch to the "B" SD card and then it recognized it. If I took it out and put back the same "B" SD card and then it does not recognize it. I switch back the "A" SD card and it recognizing it and then I took it out and then I put it back in and it does not recognizing it. The same thing happens again until I have to switch the cards around. The point I am trying to make here is that You have to switch the SD cards, then it will read them. I spoke to Sandisk about this and they said the product is defective.  So with the second player replacement, I had to call back Amazon. They gave me a refund because the SD card slot problem. So I then went to J&R Music &Com World, my local store and purchased the Sansa E140 and still it has the same  problem. Then I called Sandisk and was told that the problem I have is still The same thing about the SD card. Then Sandisk said it's defective again. So I went to J&R to exchange it and then the same thing happens with the new product. I had to refund my money because the SD card has the same problem--again. My mom has the same problem with the SD card and her player is a E130 (512MB) and she bought it online form Buy.com.  My friend has the E140 1(GB) and she bought it from Amazon.com and she has the same thing with the SD card too. So that's a total of 6 MP3 players that have I found with this problem. I am now without an MP3 player due to this defective SD card problem.  I also tried upgrading the firmware and it does not seem to solve the problem.  I have emailed to Sandisk tech support and it is not resolving the issue.   I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO PURCHASE THIS PALYER TRY THE SD CARD FIRST AND IF IT HAPPENS PLEASE CALL SANDISK TO REPORT THIS ISSUE.  SANDISK HAS TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  Try this by inserting the SD card and then take take it out turn the player on and then turn the player off and then reinserting the SAME SD card and then turn the player back on.  Then use another SD card and then try the same thing and then go back to the first SD card and it will reconginze it.   I am not trying to hurt the company but I want to help the company to make better products.  I have another problem.  The Amazon.com player firmware version was 2.0.0.01A.  I refunded the player and I went to J&R Music & Computer World.  When I got the new player, the version was old, which is 1.0.0.1A.  I tried to to upgrade the firmware and when I called Sandisk regarding the problem, they told me to try to upgrade the firmware, but it cannot be updated.  Also, my friend has the same player, but it is the newest version of the player.  She has the same problem with the SD cardand whether the firmware is 1.0.010A or the 2.0.0.01A the SD card does not recongize it.   I would give it 5 stars if Sandisk would fix this problem.  Then I would probabbly but the player again if the issue is fixed.  I think that SANDISK should do a "PRODCUT RECALL" to fix this issue.  ALL there E100 series players has this issue problem but when I called SANDISK about this problem they said no one ever had this problem so I suggest you to try this out and report to SANDISK so they can fix this problem.   Also I have formated the card and it is still the same problem.  Also I have formated the INTERNAL PLAYER and it is still the same problem so those do NOT solve the problem.   Thanks  Mike  PROBLEM RESOLVED 4-6-06  OK the problem is resolved now that is great and I spoke to a level 2 tech and the problem and the thing is here you have to go to the menu and then press "Play all" and then the player will see the SD card (the same one) where I said it cannot see it.  The instruction did not say that.  The insturction in the manual is NOT CLEAR and so I had to go to a level 2 tech and then first he was saying my SD card is defective and IT'S NOT becuase it works on other devices and it's be SANDISK the SD card I am using.  It took me 40 minutes speaking with the person and then we figured out what the problem was.  When I was saying to him he didn't even understand what I was saying and then he figured out what the problem was.  Well I still will give it 4 stars not five because the instuctions is VERY PLAIN otherwise I would give it a 5 star.  Oh well now I am happy that the player is NOT DEFECTIVE well... except the first one with the radio shuts by itself and the auto power is OFF not set to on.  Now I will buy the player again now that I know it's not defective.  No wonder he says no one compained of this problem and I now know why no one compalain.  If I were them I would re-write the instructional manual again so people are clear and they don't have this problem.

<Title>Buyer Beware
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After a day of enthusiasm, I was brought up short by this product. The SD memory feature didn't work, in that it could read SD memory but Windows/XP couldn't recognize the SD memory card when it was in the player. After ten days of correspondence with SanDisk Technical Support they finally told me that they do not guarantee the SanDisk player will work UNLESS you use SanDisk SD memory in it! This is not in any documentation, sales brochures or descriptions of the product. You can check the description here on Amazon, there is no mention that only SanDisk SD memory is supported in Amazon's description. The SD memory I have has been used without problem in my RIO Forge MP3 player, my Canon video camera and my Toshiba digital camera. Yet SanDisk's Technical Support says it isn't guaranteed to work in their products.  So I am stuck with a unit I can't prove is defective because I don't own a SanDisk SD memory card to test it with so they will not replace or repair it. It's obvious to me the player isn't functioning correctly since the same SD memory card functions just fine in my other three devices.  So my advice is that if you buy this MP3 player and intend to expand memory with an SD memory card, be sure that the only SD memory card you use in it is a SanDisk or else you will be left without support from the manufacturer if a problem arises. Having dealt with dozens of electronics companies, this is the first one to refuse to support its own products unless all accessories are made by their company without warning you  before purchasing the product. Also, if you check my other reviews, I almost never assign a product only one star but this outrageous policy forces me to do so.

<Title>Awesome Mp3 Player!
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this mp3 player about two weeks now and I love it.  It has great sound and works flawlessly.  I love the earbuds that it comes with.  They block out some sound and fit comfortably in the ears.  They also sound good.  They work better than a $100 pair of noise cancelling headphones that I have.  The only complaint I have about it is the plastic holder it comes with.  It would be nice if it came with a holder that can clip to your belt, instead of one that only works with an armband.  I purchased another case to solve this problem though.  This player beats the ipod shuffle anyday!  It has a nice display and the FM radio is very nice to have.  I highly recommend it.

<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The pros & cons have been covered by other reviews but one BIG surprise was there is NO Resume or Bookmark feature on these players. Audiobooks have to be cut into 3-5 min chunks or everytime you stop you have to fast forward through a hour or more to get back to your spot. I recommend the older smaller Sandisk player which at lease has resume.

<Title>Still IN LOVE with this MP3 Player!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little player is just great. I did tons of online research before buying this, (it's my first) and it is just perfect for me. It's just the right size, not too small, not too large. It's only slighter bigger than a credit card, the thickness of a AA battery (it runs on one AAA battery) and it has awesome sound!! And I am very particular about sound! Even the included earbuds (they give you three sets to choose from) work great and I think they have good sound, but I did buy a pair of Koss Pro1 headphones (cheap on Amazon) and they sound fantastic with this player. It is lightweight, it was immediately detected by Windows XP and transferring about 80 songs from Windows Media Player took all of 3-4 minutes. I was impressed. I downloaded the manual from Amazon. That was another benefit. Amazon's price is great right now, and I ordered it on a Friday, received it on Monday, doesn't get any better than that!!     The buttons are easy to push, and if you can operate a CD player or a cell phone, you can figure this out, and I can easily see the screen with my "over 50" eyes!! LOL  It doesn't help to put your songs in any particular order as it will arrange them as it wants, but you can add songs to a Favorites list and then just play the Favorites. It is simple to pause the song currently playing, push the forward or backward button and go to another song (just like the tracks on a CD...simple) I barely looked at the tiny little booklet they give with fourteen languages in it...only 6 pages for English. It comes loaded with some audio excerpts from audible.com trying to sell that service. You can delete them when you are transferring your music files to the player. It was easy to do. Or if you are into audio books, you can check them out.     One minor thing to mention is that the little rubber cover on the USB port of the player is not attached, so be careful when you take it off, it would be easy to lose, and it is a little "fiddly" to get back on. I had no complaints with the battery cover. It seemed substantial enough, they even include a battery and I haven't changed it yet. Have listened for hours, not sure exactly how many, but at least 6 hours so far and still going strong.     The blue and white of the player has a clean, fresh look. It comes with a plastic cover/bag, not real attractive, but it would keep it from getting scratched I guess. I haven't used it. I think if you're looking for a great, easy to use player that will hold a ton of songs (about 240 WMA) and has an SD expansion slot(you just take an SD card you have lying around in a camera bag and plug it in to add lots more songs!) I just think it is a fabulous deal for the money.     I'm totally a first-timer in the MP3 player world, but I don't think a newbie could possibly go wrong with this player, unless you get a dud. Mine is anything/everything but!  For $66 and change, free/fast shipping, with the great sound and all the memory it has, I think this is the best one I could have bought. I will update this if I have any problems later on. Good Luck!    Update: I've now owned my first one for about 2 months, and I have since purchased a second one of these (price keeps dropping!) because I love it so much. I now use the little plastic cover because I finally figured out how it fit! LOL  And I use the armband. I haven't had one problem and get fantastic battery life. I have also discovered that my CD player's car cassette adapter fits the headphone jack of this player, so now I listen to this player through my car's speakers. I'm still VERY pleased with it, would recommend it to a friend as the one to buy! In fact, I'm considering getting a third one to give to a friend. You simply can't go wrong with this one, unless you get a lemon and that happens unfortunately with everything in life. But Amazon is so good about returns, you can't lose!

<Title>Garbage-Maybe Not!!
<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Took forever to get it to work with Windows ME, but it finally did, beautifully. Worked fine with the ancient MMC card from my old digital camera(no the computer won't recognize it in the player but that is easily solved by using a USB card reader to add songs to the card). The radio had excellent signal, even the earbuds sounded great and were comfy. So why am I giving it 1 star? It died on me today! Refuses to power up, it's useless. I've only had it since Christmas, and it wasn't dropped, used roughly or even taken out of my house. Fresh battery didn't help. I am absolutely disgusted that the thing quit working after a month. I am waiting to see what Circuit City and Sandisk have to say. I think I am entitled to either an exchange by CC or a replacement from SanDisk. This is an AWESOME player...too bad it didn't last a month! :-(  2/9/06 UPDATE: Circuit City refused to help me but Sandisk's customer support came through! They got my player working again! Here's what to do if it happens to you:  Take the battery out and wait 5 minutes. Then hold the power button down for 10 seconds Replace the battery  And your player should work again! The procedure above resets the unit somehow. If I could I'd change my rating to FIVE STARS!

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product yesterday from Circuit City because they're on sale for $60 there. I was up all night transferring most of my music onto it which was very painless. The copy-and-paste method is so much easier than it was with my iPod.  There were some complications that would require patience and diligence on the part of the consumer.  The problem was that some of my songs were in an audio file type that wasn't the accepted WMA or MP3 (they were M4A). This isn't a big deal; there are many free converters that you can find on Google and download in seconds. But it was an issue that I had not forseen.  I was impressed by the size, the picture had me thinking it was larger but it's really only slightly larger than a business card.  It is, however, true about the headphones-- they produce moderately good sound but they plug in your ear like a stethescope and it's not exactly comfortable.   Oh and the radio works well. I thought originally when it said "20 Preset Stations" that you could bookmark your favorites, but no such luck. Oh well.  Just to put this review in perspective, I am an undergraduate college student (hence the stinginess), whose iPod was stolen a few months ago; I needed a cheap replacement.  I chose this model because of the optional expansion slot. I have SD memory sticks already which I can now use with this player instead of having them sitting idle in my camera. My main intention is to use it at the gym or walking to class. I have no doubt that it will suffice.

<Content>While this device is easy to use and gives you the ability to increase the storage with a SD card, I found the sound quality to be poor. The equalizer function changes the way it sounds, but the result is always lacking. The reliability is also poor. When I recived it, I could not get it to turn on. I tried different bateries but it still would not work. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement to me right away (5 Stars to Amazon for customer service). The second one worked. It is a battery hog.

I like it very much; this review is based on the usage for 2 weeks so far. I will try to post updates if I find anything good or bad about this in the future.  I am enjoying this player so far. I use it everyday in the gym. I do jogging and it is really apt for me (Thanks to the armband). The sound effect is really cool. The ear phones are great and never fall out of my ears while jogging. It comes with 3 different sizes of ear buds so I hope it can fit in all ear. The navigations are simple and easy. The sound control wheel is bit let down but I don't find it annoying at all. The expandable memory slot is really helpful for me as I already have a 1 GB SD card from my PDA. One problem with this player is if you switch off the player and switch it on, it plays from the beginning of the last track played (It's not smart enough to bookmark the exact spot on the track) So if you are listening any audio stories, you may have to fast forward every time you reset the player.   Overall, I am completely satisfied with the player so far! I would recommend this!  
<Overall>5
