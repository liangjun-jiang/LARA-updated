<Title>This is righteous stuff!
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this for one reason, and one reason only: size. Many of the other mp3 players out there were larger and clunkier. I own a Handspring Visor Deluxe and was going to use that as an mp3 player because of the aforementioned clunky sizes of other players. &quot;Why spend money for something that's not much smaller?&quot; I thought. Then, I stumbled across this baby... I read the specs and was admittedly not too impressed. 32 megs is not much, especially if you're going for full stereophonic 128 kbps sound. At that rate you could only get about half an hour of music - enough to go to the store, but not much more. Of course, there was always the option of a memory card but those added to the cost. It looked like I was going to pass this player by until I saw one on sale at an un-named competitor of this fine site. At the price I saw it for, I had to take the chance... Twenty four hours later, I'm still in awe. To begin with, just seeing the darn thing gives you a swell feeling. It's tiny, I mean tiny. It made my wife proclaim it to be &quot;cute.&quot; In such a small package I was expecting so-so sound at best. Not true. It is super duper. The built-in equalizer is servicable enough, and it takes a quick press o' the button to change settings. So I was hooked on the sound and size, there was only the capacity issue to consider... Then I rememberd my good friend db PowerAmp Music Converter (search for it on the web). This sweet program lets you convert current mp3's to lame or blade mp3's with a smaller bit rate. Smaller bit rate means smaller size. Smaller size means less space on the 32 meg memory, which translates into more sound. Lovely. Some will decry encoding anything to less than cd (128 kbps) sound, but pah I say. I was born and raised on analog and a little less crispness in my music is actually preferred. The human ear can barely discern the difference between 80 and 128 kbps recordings anyway, so why bother? At 80 kbps I can squeeze about 50 minutes or so of music into that 32 megs. Not bad. Not bad at all. After I buy a 64 or 96 meg card, I'll be waltzing back and forth to work with only my tiny kazoo as my companion. Beautiful. If you are reading this and thinking either &quot;What in hades is he talking about?&quot; or &quot;That is way to much bother for listening to some music!&quot; please reconsider! It takes only a few minutes (even for you 56 k types) to download db PowerAmp and a few more to convert the mp3's to lower bitrates. Trouble? Nah. At least not for the payoff. Sweet music for a sweet price. Did I mention it's tiny and cute? Buy this mp3 player and be a happy camper. It's a wonder.

<Title>Not Universal
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Beware when considering this product!  Although it prominently displays the USB compatability, it does not state on the exterior package that it is only Window compatible.  When I found a friend foolish enough to be using Window's software I got some music loaded into it.  It is a remarkable device, small, easy to use, good sound quality, and expandable.  However, after about 1 month of use the screen died and it is currently in route to RCA for a repair/replace.  I complained to them that the word Universal in USB should mean Universal, i.e. both Mac and Windows compatible.

<Title>The smallest MP3 player; very well designed.
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>After about a week of researching about 25 mp3 players I finally settled on the RCA Kazoo. I wanted the smallest mp3 player possible, but didnt want to sacrifice great sound. My Kazoo delivers for only $... After much research I decided I needed a unit that had: lock (so buttons dont get pushed accidentally), bass boost/ equalizer, digital volume control, big clear display, & fast transfer rate (2.4Mb/sec). You'd be supprised many more expensive units dont have all of these features. I also didnt care about other formats since mp3 is the standard & all formats can be converted to mp3 via software. The included software Music Match & Real Jukebox are excellent. I just dragged & dropped my mp3 files from explorer into real Jukebox. Real Jukebox lets you set the bit rate you would like and automatically lowers bitrate on files to bitrate you choose to save memory/size. This brigs me to the 1 of 2 drawbacks. ALthough 32 mb is common w/ mp3 players it isnt enough (at 128k bit rate). I plan on ordering a 64 MB MM card (dont pay more than $1/mb if you decide to buy memory). I did find out that at 56k the sound was still awesome & I can hold about 75 minutes of music w/o extra memory. The second drawback doesnt apply to me but I read in one review that this doesnt support Mac. If you are a windows user you will be very satisfied!! I can't see why anyone could buy a player w/ a slower transfer rate; USB is the way to go. <br>One last note: The display is large & easy to read. It shows track, time, bit rate, volume, battery, & dsp.  It does not show the name of the current song that is playing the way larger mp3 players do.<br>Hope this helps & good luck in your search.

<Title>RCA K@ZOO
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This mp3 player is awesome. It's go great sound and is so small. It's lightweight and portable. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it doesn't have that much memory. I can fit up to 10 songs on it. If it had more memory I would give it a five star. But great for beginners who want a mp3 player because it's so inexpensive and it's easy to use.

<Title>DO NOT DEAL WITH RCA/THOMPSON!
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this player and was fairly happy with it.  It is very small and sounds fine.  Unfortuneately, I lost the cd containing the drivers for it.  I called customer service to get a replacement cd.  My first call to RCA/Thompson technical support directed me to a page where I could download software for the RCA Lyra.  After telling the representative that I had the K@zoo, and not the Lyra, he said &quot;sorry, that's all the information I have.&quot;  <p>Today, I figured I'd try again - maybe there'd be more information.  This time I was told, in fact, that the software is not available online, but that the cd could be shipped to me.  However, it would cost $12.95 for a cd containing one driver, and 2 free to download software programs.  I was about to order, when I was then informed of the $9.95 SHIPPING FEE.  TO MAIL ME ONE COMPACT DISK.  <p>Needless to say, I am far from pleased, and I urge anyone considering buying an RCA product to stay far, far away.  If you ever need customer service (and judging by the reviews of many mp3 players, you will), you will greatly regret the purchase.

<Title>Great Product!
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this today and I'm very pleased.  The size is great (very small), the sound quality is excellent, and the behind-the-ear headphones that it came packaged with are also very nice.  The price is very low and the USB feature makes transfer easy.  The software included is relatively simple to use and allows you to insert cds, and create MP3 files.  <br>The only drawback is that the 3 ways they made for you to wear it are pretty bad.  It comes with a pendant (who wants to have it swinging around their neck?) a little plastic pouch that is very hard to put on your belt, and a wrist strap.  I found a good way to wear it, though.  Buy one of those little sticky things with the belt clip that you use for a cell phone and then just clip it on your belt with that.  Once you get that, it's perfect.

<Title>CRAPPY
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>The software on the RCA Kazoo is almost impossible for me to figure out.  The RCA kazoo's Headphones also "are bad".  I think it is too expensive for what its worth and i am asking you not to buy this peice of junk.

<Title>DOESN'T WORK ON MY WINDOWS XP MACHINE
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Even thought I got this thing FREE after rebates with the purchase of Windows XP, even though the Install disk says Windows XP, Windows XP tells you when you try to install it that it is NOT CERTIFIED to run on Windows XP.  I figured it must run OK nonetheless, since the Install disk says XP and it came free with Windows XP, but it doesn't on my machine.<p>In fact, even though the player shows up when you plug it in on the taskbar, the software doesn't recognize it.  Windows Media Player doesn't see it either.  <p>The USB cable is too short if you have a tower machine.  It doesn't even reach to the counter.

<Title>Nice size but need more memory
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>While this unit best feature is it's small light weight size, without a memory card you can only get 6-8 MP3's on the built in 32 meg of flash ram. Also I've heard that the software won't work with Windows XP, I had planed on upgrading soon? The headphones are pretty good although they start to hurt the ears after 30-40 mins. This MP3 player sure blows away those old clunky walkman CD players, it's 1/10th of the size and weight! Smaller is indeed better!
