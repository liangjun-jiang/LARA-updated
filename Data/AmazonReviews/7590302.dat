<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is an excellent alternative to the ipod. Its features are great ranging from a line-in jack to built in microphone to an FM tuner. However the headphone jack on my player wore out eventually and so I unscrewed the back and inserted a small piece of aluminum into a side of the jack and now I get full sound again. A small hassle but an awesome product overall.

<Title>Adequate
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not the best player out there, but it works.  I can use it with Windows Vista and my XP laptop.  Controls could be easier to use and give more options (like making playlists).  All in all, it was worth the $100 bucks I paid for it.  I just wish those jerks at Creative would have continued to support the Zen Nomad Jukebox, instead of saying it "has reached the end of service life".

<Title>Unreliable!
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The COBY MP3 player I purcahsed worked fine at first, but it is very poorly constructed and the two halves are held together by 4 screw into very thin plastic ears which broke the first time it was dropped.  It still worked OK held together with tape, but now (3 mos.) the HDD is dead and therefore the whole thing is useless except as an FM radio (which does still work). Certainly NOT a robust product - better to get a flash ram one at nearly the same price!

<Title>Slow Tech Support and then HDD Read Error
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first got this player I e-mailed tech support because I had a question and did not get a reply after two weeks.  Then, after 4 months of purchase (Coby warranty is only for 3 months), I got an "HDD Read Error" and all that worked was the radio player.  I managed to contact tech support and they told me that I need to buy a new player because mine is out of warranty. I searched the internet and found out that many people are getting the same error message as me. I cannot recommend this player.

<Title>My luck was bad...care to try yours?
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Received player. Pleasantly surprised, felt substantial and controls seemed sturdy. Downloaded music file folders (Country, R&B, Classic Rock, etc.,) all with subfolders by artist. Noticed 1st problem, could not shuffle within main genre folder. Had to be on a song to go into shuffle mode but as the files within my folder had subfolders by artist, all it would do was shuffle within an album by that artist or between all songs by that artist. When I went to "Shuffle all", would shuffle all songs, playing a country followed by rap, etc which I did not like. After trying to call customer service (line repeatedly busy), I went to bed. When I awoke, I turned on MP3  so the unit would be powered when I called Coby's support line and noticed that I now had a "HDD read error". After an hour got through to Coby: they were rude and unhelpful. Sent back to Amazon.

<Title>Good and cheap mp3 player
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I needed an mp3 player with a bigger storage as I had become tired to regularly copying files from my computer to update playing lists on my flash cards. I listen a lot of audiobooks, language courses and, of course, music. But I did not want to spend too much money for it.   I like this players design and so far everything has been working as expected. The plus is that I can simply plug the USB cable and open the drive letter nad copy all the files I need without the hasle of some proprietory software. And I can use it as a backup drive for important files as well. The black colored case makes it rather inconspicous thus better protected from thieves.  Negative trait is that it took some time to learn the controls, several times I jumped onto the next track when I just to skip forward.  The player malfunctioned in cold (below freezing point). The sound became garbled. But when I carried it into a warm room and restarted the glitch disappeared.

<Title>Great value!
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, mine must be an upgraded version from this.  Amazon, cnet, zdnet all have this same outdated photo.  The new one can be seen on the cobyusa.com site.  Also, the shuffle modes shuffle by song, directory or to include or not include subdirectories now.  As for  other reviewers having problems with it shuffling country with rap, that can easily be solved by a little file maintenance and organization:  First, delete most of the country, and then all of the rap - that way, almost everything you have left that might come up on shuffle will sound musical!  (Sorry, couldn't resist...)  Anyway, it's a great value and easy to transfer MP3's and WMA's via USB.  You can also set it up to charge via USB, and skip the wall wart.  No Apple proprietary garbage or silly software to install, either.

<Title>The Biggest waste of Money
<Date>Thu Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the worst item I have ever purchased.  If you feel like throwing away $175 save yourself the shipping cost and just open your trash can.  The item was great for about 12 hours of total listening prior to the music stopping in the middle of a song and never turning back on.  Yes, it was fully charged at the time.  My best advice, spend the extra money and buy something better.  This is a very expensive piece of garbage.  DO NOT BUY!!!

<Title>works well, excellent value!!!!  You do have to be patient.
<Date>Wed Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, for those who only read the first line, if you are not a patient person with electronics and computers, then this unit is not for you.  But if you can navigate computers well, and can easily troubleshoot computers, then this is a very good unit for you.    The price of this unit is dropping like hotcakes.  I got this for $100 bucks brand new from a chain store. Very good value.  20gb of storage, and easy to load and use, once you figure out all of the fuctions.  It transfers files fast, and you can create sub folders on the root directory to get nice and orderly.  the menu functions are easy to navigate, and the settings are easy as well.  large, well lit display showing the names of the music clearly.  Fast transfer as well.  I had no luck with windows media player playlists, but at least the customer support was very good about responding to all my questions.  Windows media just would not "sync" with this unit, or recognize it was there to make a playlist to.  I did find that musicmatch playlists work for this unit. You have to create a playlist from files on the unit itself, then save it, then pull the actual playlist file by drag and drop over to the unit into the playlist folder, and boom it works.   Overall, the value and functionality of the unit outweight the time it took to learn how to maximize the utillity from it.  Good buy if you get it for the price I did.  This model will soon be obsolete, and is quickly being discontinued soon due to new models coming out.  FYI here are the specs: FEATURES:  Stores More than 5,000 Songs  Up to 12 Hours of Battery Life  Supports MP3, WMA Music files  Ultra-fast USB 2.0 Transfers (up to 40 times faster than USB 1.0)  Built-In FM tuner  Built-In Voice Recorder  Simple and Easy Music Navigation  Real-Time MP3 Encoding (no PC required)  20GB of Internal Storage  Mobile Data Storage Function (Store or transfer files of any type)  Big Backlit LCD  Rechargeable Lithium Polymer battery  Upgradeable firmware   ACCESSORIES INCLUDED:  Installation CD  USB cable  Charging cord Professional Neckband Stereo Headphones  small tie pouch for cables/unit windows 98 driver cd

<Title>why so many bad reviews?
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a college student who travels a lot (home is on the other side of the USA) so this mp3 player is GREAT. I haven't even used 1/2 the memory and I have ALL my music on it. It's great for on the airplane and for roadtrips, I just connect it to the car speakers with one of those tape connector things. THe radio works great too and I can record songs off the radio and onto the mp3 player. I love it and found it a lot easier to use than my old iPod or my Creative Nomad mp3 player.

<Title>Good value, but no accessories and so-so case.
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an ideal mp3 player for someone who wants to take their music collection with them but is on a budget.  I wasn't about to spend a bundle on  an iPod and didn't want to use iTunes software, so I picked this one as a low-cost alternative.  As with most mp3 players, the earbuds they supply with the player aren't that great, so I hooked up my Labtec headphones to it and it sounded fine for classical and jazz music.  Has a sturdy look and feel to it.  If you have Windows XP or a newer version of Mac OS you don't have to install any drivers--your pc will detect it as an external hard drive.  You can just drag and drop your music files into the drive window and off you go!  It easily read the format folders I made for classical, jazz, new age, audio books, etc and stored my files in nice neat order.  There are two ways to charge the unit--either with supplied USB cable or the AC adapter.  The transfer speed (USB 2.0) is quite fast given the size of the hard drive.  I was able to transfer my entire music collection from my CDs to the player quickly.  One of the best features of the unit is a line-in outlet (cable included) that will let you plug it into any audio device with a headphone jack and convert the output to mp3 files.  This is especially handy for those who want to record their old LPs, 78s, and tapes to mp3 files for archiving.  The FM tuner is also a nice compliment.  Reception of local stations and sound quality are good.  It may not be a McIntosh 1700 receiver, but for something this size it sounds decent with a good pair of headphones or earbuds.  The only downside to the player is that there are no accessories I can find anywhere for it--no silicone skins to protect it, no apecially designed tabletop systems to fit it into (as with iPods), and the carrying pouch it comes with is only good for storage to keep the dust off.  There are also no protective screen covers for it, so be careful about scratching or dropping it.  Other than these very minor issues, it's a great player for the price!

<Title>Amazing! Incredible! Super Deal!
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, this device is awesome! It works beautifully, and does everything they said it would. Apparently there are two versions of this product, both with the same product number. the earlier version sucks, but the one I received, as I said before is great. Sound quality is great on the FM radio function, and it has 20 slots to preset stations. It even has the ability to save all the clear stations for you. There is an awesome equalizer function in the options menu, which is sweet compared to other mp3 players with only 5-6 preset settings. The 12 hour battery is nice, it takes about 3 hours to fully charge. Some stores that sell this say that 5,000 songs is the max, but if you convert them to wma, it holds around 10,000 songs. The navigation system takes a little getting used to but that doesn't take long, and they are very detailed. Transferring songs over is as easy as using a usb flash drive, just drag and drop.  Overall, I love this device and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap, powerful mp3 player.

<Title>Quite a let down
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In theory, the price is excellent, the features fantastic and the look rather pleasing. In practice, however, I was let down by this mp3 player. First, it gave me an I/O error message when I was attempting to upload my music. Eventually, by adding the music a little bit at a time and constantly disconnecting and reconnecting it, I got all of my music uploaded. I listened to some music that night and it played three or four songs before simply giving me garbled nonsense- I was listening to Sheryl Crow and it displayed her as the artist and a They Might be Giants track name!  The next day I turned my Coby on and it told me there was no music to play. I tried several times, resetting, formatting, uploading and deleting music but I got the same problems again and again. My Coby was completely defective and I have since sent it back. However, they cannot possibly ALL have the fault that mine did, so if you are considering buying this product, just make sure you keep all the original packaging for a while.  Maybe it is worth paying that little bit more for a reliable mp3 player.
