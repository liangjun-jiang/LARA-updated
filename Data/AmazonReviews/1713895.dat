<Content>The small size is great and the features are wonderfull.  The FM transmitter picks up stations better than any other receiver I have had.  I use it mainly for running and love it.  One draw back is that the joy stick for the controls isn't well designed.  If you are not careful, it will break off.  The one I own is my second one because of the joy stick breaking on the first.  I've had the second one for about eight months and the volume control doesn't work anymore.  
<Overall>3
