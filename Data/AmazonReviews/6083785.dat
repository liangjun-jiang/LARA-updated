<Title>A good no-frills choice

<Content>This MP3 player is about as basic as it gets, which was fine for me.  I like music but I'm not an audio person - my main priority was to get something cheap and portable, and I literally hear no difference between, say, .WMA and .MP3 sound files.  Well, I now have a player that's very portable, well priced, and makes it easy to load and delete music as needed - as others have said, just drag and drop.    Once you figure out how to turn it on (hold play for a few seconds, and note that it starts up paused), you get no features to speak of.  No special playback modes, no sound equalizer, no track names or times.  Not even a screen, actually, and the only way to shuffle between tracks is one at a time with the forward and backward keys.  It'll easily hold 10-15 records' worth of music at a time (if you're okay with WMA format, anyway), but sorting through all the songs can be a bit rough.  They're played in the order they were uploaded... most of the time, anyway... Again, this is the most basic of basic models, and given the price, it's good for what it is.  So, yes, I recommend this product, as long as you know what you're getting.  I was a little concerned about reliability, because others have raised questions about that, but it's been smooth sailing for me thus far (after about two months).    This player theoretically comes with headphones and a AAA battery, but you'll probably want to supply your own of both.
