<Content>I love watching music videos, and the ARCHOS AV480 has been incredibly reliable. It allows you to record right from your TV or cable, and then you can take your videos with you and watch them anywhere. I love the sound quality as well. I have relatively high-end earphones, the SHURE E5 sound isolating earphones, and the sound is awesome. It even comes with a remote control, so that while you are watching music videos (or even TV shows on TV), you just hit 'record' and that's it, it records your song or program. It is very user friendly. I recommend this ARCHOS very highly! Enjoy!
