<Title>Sound it good, but that media explore has problem
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound of this zen 8gb microphoto is good, the photo is also good. but I found the software which transfer cd to MP3 called "media explore" is bad. When I installed it, true it works, but this software will cause you windows explore "not responsable" when you install it(even not run) regularly. So you can't use windows explore without unstall "media explore".   Creative's software design must be worse. That's the reason I give it 3 stars!

<Title>Love my Creative Zen MicroPhoto 
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Being an ex-iPod owner, this item definitely is better than the hype of Apple products makes iPod's out to be. I am very pleased with my Creative. I'm amazed with how much more the user can do on the player itself, unlike the iPod where functions and settings were barely customizable from the player. Love the radio and microphone features which iPod also lacks. I use these features quite a bit! I've convinced several friends to buy this product because I've been so pleased. And besides all these features, 8 gb is the perfect amount of space for most "normal" people... and can be purchased for the same price as an apple nano 4 gb, which I must say is too small anyway. This player fits right into my hand. The volume is also great in the headphones. If a friend is listening with me, I no longer (like w/my iPod) have to turn the volume all the way up and ruin my headphones to have lound enough music. Works great in the car with my iRiver FM Transmitter. Couldn't be happier with this item! Thank you Creative Labs. Way to go with this product.

<Title>Best miniature hard-drive player!
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Best little hard drive based player I've found.  I base this off the comparisons with ipods, Dell DJ's, larger Creative players, iRivers and other players that lack that "Je ne sais quoi" that I was looking for.  I have an older 5 gigabyte Zen Micro that I really like (so does my wife), so I purchased the 8GB microphoto for her.  It is everything the Micro is and just a little better in all ways.  Naturally the color display is the highlight here as well the increase in storage capacity.  I might note that the Microphoto is slightly thinner (about a millimetre) than the 5 GB Micro, yet it still has a choice of many different face colors.  It has lost none of its nice feel in the hand that was there before, in fact it was so well liked by my Nephew and two Nieces that they asked for them for Christmas.  I take that as major praise for the design since teenagers have quite the opportunity to see different players, especially the ipod!  Also important to me is software and where I can purchase from online sources.  This is important if you want to buy from Napster and others.  Ipod=itunes store for online music purchase, in fact you should check the online source to see if your player is compatible.  I have both Windows and Macintosh computers and I still choose a Windows device (maybe Microsoft is on to something!!).  Also the rechargeable battery is replaceable, I have replaced two ipod batteries for a friend on an older second generation ipod (not something I'm fond of) and when another friend's newer fourth generation ipod's battery began losing capacity I couldn't find  instructions on how to dis-assemble it, he brought it back for service for $85.00 and a day's wait, not for me!  The Creative software works well and is a good tool for organizing your Zen Microphoto's music and files.  I could not use my old Zen Micro Explorer with the Zen Microphoto, no problem though, both versions of software run fine together!  The software is a piece of cake to use and the 8GB Microphoto transfers files about 3 times faster than my old Zen Micro, I assume a faster hard disk is in the new machine.  The sound is breathtaking and you may use one of eight pre-set equalizer settings, your own custom setting or you may disable the EQ function if you wish.  Currently there are five Zen Micros in our family, four 5GB Micros and one 8GB Microphoto, they all work perfectly and I am very pleased with them!  I have read in some reviews regarding complaints with the headphone jacks, the newer ones do seem to have a different connector on the end of the headphone; however, we haven't had  trouble with any of them!

<Title>the little player that couldn't
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to admit, 8Gb for the same price as the 4gb ipod nano, what a deal!  I had this thing for a day and I tried to download the firmware like Napster says you should but my computer wouldn't recognize it-I ended up erasing the firmware on the player and the new version wouldn't download, leaving it on the recovery screen with no remedy.  I heard something about a different cable was needed to do that so make sure you don't erase the firmware without the correct equipment to replace it.  Anyway, I waited 3 weeks to get a replacement and I am only following the directions to make sure nothing like that happens again.  If Napster works with the player, don't try to fix it if it's not broken-I learned the hard way.  My new player is working fine, I did a lot of research and this one was the best-and the color screen is so vivid, it's unbelieveable that something so small could be so great!  I have a hard time blaming my 3 week wait on Creative, it just means that this little thing is the best because they were always sold out.  The 4 stars are because it is quite fragile-you need to be careful when you're outside in the New England winter weather and you can't jog with it either.  But don't let my bad experience taint your thinking--this player really is the best buy!

<Title>So Much Better than an I Pod
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The best thing about the Zen Micro Photo is the ease of use.  For many people who are not experienced with computers, this product makes it easy.  You install the software and your done.  You rip a Cd or add tracks already on your computer and then quickly put them on the micro photo.  I had the thing going 15 miniutes after I had it out of the box!  The Micro Photo is easy to use, has a removable battery so you can just buy a new one, without having to send the entire product back to the manafactuer " COUGH COUGH APPLE"  Plus has and * Gigabyte hard drive so there is plenty of space. Not to mention it's loaded with features, such as a FM Tuner, Microphone, and the ability to show photos. Creative makes a superior product and I recommend this to any one who wants more bang for their buck!

<Title>It's a hard drive player, not a flash like the Nano, so they are not comprable!
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is OK. I also looked at this before buying an Ipod. I found the touchpad annoying to say the least, although I did like the size. The controls were not nearly as responsive as the Ipod, and after using Itunes, I guarantee there is no way the software is easier to use. There is a reason why everyone buys Ipods, they are just better.  By the way-the reason the Nano is more expensive is because it is a FLASH DRIVE, which means you can bang the heck out of it and it won't skip or break, just like a USB. This player is a HARD DRIVE player, which means it has lots of tiny moving parts that can be fragile, so you cannot run with this player like the nano, and you have to be more careful with it. If you want to compare the Nano to another player compare it to another player that has 4GB of FLASH space--Oh, wait, THERE ISN'T ANOTHER ONE. I'm just saying, compare apples to apples, people.

<Title>Own it, had the competition, glad I switched
<Date>Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must say, after owning an iPod mini which I loved despite it's quirks (ie. clickwheel simply didn't respond in some areas due to being packed in a pocket with all my other junk for some time) then buying the Nano because everyone else seemed to love them. Promptly I broke the screen (ok, I'm hard on stuff), sending it back, getting it back(two weeks later), then after two more weeks the battery wouldn't hold a charge (hmm, overcharging over USB?, well maybe) then doing the return/recieve thing again, then putting it in a "protective case" only to find when I pulled it out the whole thing was covered in scratches, FROM THE CASE!! (screen really was fixed though, no more cracks, just scratches).   At that point I figured, oh well, I've spent more on less before and started to shop around. I found the microphoto fell in love with it (I actually prefer the fact that it is larger, way easier to hold). Me, being the compulsive consumer I am forked out the cash right there and then. Brought it home and wow, it can tune into FM stations, that was an annoying little bauble I had to plug in to my docking port before, thus making the nano bigger and adding leverage to a wee little connector. Then boom, you mean I can record those lectures that I usually tune out of because the girl that sits next to me is hot!?!   Then BOOM, when I plug it into my PC, Windows recognizes it as a removable harddrive right from the start, my backup program asks me if I'd like to create a new profile for it and Outlook says "would you like to sync your calendar to portable device?". Now I'm thinking, why did I ever like apple products?  Then it hits me, I can't use iTunes, my trusty friend. It was so easy to sync my music and I worry, will this be a problem? Then I open Windows Media Player (which, if you have a sound system like mine, you will know actually produces better output than iTunes, thus making it my default music player even during my iPod days, plus it plays DVDs) Low and behold, there is my zen again, just waiting for some audio goodness to be transferred (unbelivably fast I must say, less than one second per song).  Then comes the moment of truth, what does it sound like with my 500 watt THX certified logitech sound system plugged into the headphone jack. It sounds good, way better than the Nano or the Mini (which both sounded identical I might add, same audio processor in both, anyone who says different is a victim of their own mind) The navigation is different, going up and down rather than round-and-round, but not all that bad, especially when you find that little touchpad sensitivity setting. After precisely one month of use I am now a Creative touchpad pro, nothing can stop me!  Not only does the battery keep it's charge, (by the way, new firmware seems to fix the short battery life thing, had the same issue and now she gives'r for a good 12hrs) but hey, I can buy a new one for 20 bucks and replace it myself! I never bought any music on iTunes, but I can't imagine it being any easier than MSN music, seems to work good, and I can play my girlfriend's songs from Rhapsody, not limited to Apple (or Microsoft for that matter) music files.  Ya, It isn't as "chic" as the nano, or as popular as the mini was, but it is a heck of a lot better. I loved my iPods, but I see now my eyes were closed to the truth, there is life beyond a clickwheel, and it is much better.I get a whole boat of features you have to pay extra for in an iPod, which consequently makes the devices rather irritating to operate. (and why oh why did Apple put that little headphone jack on the bottom of the player? everything else seemed to fit just fine)  Best of all, when I whip out my Zen, people at my University actually look and say "whoa, that looks cool" rather than "dude, you got one too, sweet". And though I will never ever use 8gb of music, I do have some rather sensitive databases backed up on the player as a tertiary backup (three harddrives, two mirrored, one important files only, one removable disc and now the zen) that works with existing backup utilities, on any computer (windows based i would assume).  Now, you make YOU'RE decision.

<Title>Absolutely Delighted with the Zen Micro Photo
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am absolutley delighted with this player. The color screen makes the player FUN... otherwise no advantage over monochrome. Love the fact that you can create multiple playlists on the player itself and name them for future recall. Just love the way the menu structure works... takes a little figuring out at first, but not difficult and gives you so much more control over the player. FM radio is a nice plus when you just want something different. Battery life is more than acceptable and the battery is replaceable, so you can always carry a spare when you take that 17 hour flight to Sidney!! Very nice construction and I very much like the size... rests very comfortably in your hand... The nano is TOO small for me. The full size iPOD is TOO big for my use. Don't hesitate... you will end up loving this player. Hey, the 8GB is sooo.. nice. Oh, and one more thing... you can just drag and drop your mp3 files via Windows Explorer to the player... my favorite method... so easy... Also, when you touch a control the player lights up in a very pleasant blue color... again FUN... just like your music!

<Title>Incompatible with most operating systems.
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is compatible ONLY with Microsoft Windows XP.  Creative has really fallen short on what could have been a nice product by choosing to offer drivers for only one operating system.  If you have Windows 2000/ME/98, don't waste your time with this product.  There is absolutely no way to transfer files to it.  I had one, tried it, and sent it back for a refund.

<Title>Keeps on Surprising!
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Where to start? I've bought a lot of different Mp3 players. In fact, you might say I'm obsessed with them. I also have friends who have Ipods. (bah!) The only good thing about Ipods is the wide variety of accessories you can get for them. This little Zen beats them all, hands down! I'll start with the list of cons since there are so few.  CONS:  Touchy buttons. (even with senitivity turned on low, but easy to get used to, and there is a hold button) Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time. (?) Has ability to record, but has no line in.  PROS: (and this will be quite a list!)  Plays WAVE,Mp3,and WMA as well. (I have everything in WMA) Bass booster option. Smart volume option. Sound quality is great. I've read complaints about the bass boost being distorted. Turn on the smart volume and the disortion goes away. Crisp clean treble as well. Smart volume also adjust for different record levels. (quite nice) 5 band graphic eq, as well as plenty of presets. 8 gigs holds tons of music and photos. Very small. (fits in pocket comfortably) Works as an external hard dirve, and lets you decide how much space to use for this. (128mb upto 4gigs) Uses a standard 2.0 USB cord. (big advantage) Charge battery while you put music or photos on it. Not only is the battery rechargeable, but also replaceable. (you can buy extras for long trips) Screen looks bright and clear from any angle. Main menu is very customizable. (options, wallpaper,and colors) Easy to navigate. Almost no gap between songs. (good for Pink Floyd albums) Built in microphone. Seems to record pretty well. Has a calender where you can store reminders and events. Not so important, but it really looks COOL! Not a bad price for all it does.  LAST WORDS: At first I didn't like the fact that you have to use software to transfer files, but now I see why. I have other Mp3 players that are plug and play. It takes them a minute or so to boot up. Not this baby. Turn it on and it's ready to go in less than 3 seconds. The software updates the player when you close the program so that it doesn't have to boot up.  I'm not the kind of person who likes to read manuals, and with this player, I didn't have to. It's almost too easy to use, and yet full of features. I've also read complaints about the software. If you know how to navigate windows, then software will be easy to use, and it works well. I've only had it for 3 days, so I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting or haven't found yet. But it just keeps getting better. Has more features than I dreamed it could.  BOTTOM LINE: Buy what you want, but the Zen Micro is BETTER!

<Content>I never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. Wow I have owned this wonderful toy for a year Never had a problem with. I have dropped it! It rebooted and rebuilt the library. It does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (Think Felix Hernandez) Keeps data and photos (no Video) Create play lists whatever suits your mood. It's like walking around with your own theme music. An equalizer, choose your list random or planned. Play all or play some. Adjust the volume. Oh and another thing get your own headphones. Creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. But if your thinking of buying this at 8GB think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EA8U12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-1437992-4183657">Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB Multimedia Player (Aluminum/White)</a> Same price but get more, more more!

<Title>Don't last
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was really happy with my Zen Microphoto until it stopped working after less than two years. Creative offered me a new one for $150 (which is half what I paid for it), but I'll probably try to find one without built-in obsolescence. I think that a $300 device should last longer than that, and I wasn't impressed with Creative's after market support. My other big problem was I could never get it to work with Windows XP, although Vista seemed to support it OK.

<Title>Awesome Mp3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this Mp3 player over an ipod nano over a year ago and still use and like it. It doesn't compare with the new nano's but is better than the previous generation of nano's. It's well built but still should have a protective case for the obvious reasons. The touchpad was a bit tricky at first, but I figured it out in a few days just like everyone else.   The things that keep me from giving it a 5 star rating are the following; it takes awhile to charge and the wall chargers are hard to find, plus they're over $25 without shipping, if you find it. But maybe this is just me since this is my first Mp3 player of this sort. Maybe the ipods take hours to fully charge as well. The other thing is that I have an apple macbook, and so their is only one freeware program that lets me use this on a mac, but it commonly requires that I replug it several times to have it detected.     Bottom line is that the thing works very good.

<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player back in 2006 and it worked faithfully for me for two years.  The Good -the software is easy to use -the interface is not bad -the construction felt very sturdy -the music/picture quality was excellent  The Bad -the touch pad was not as easy to use as the ipod wheel -the cases that could be bought for it blocked the pleasing lighting around the unit  So I had a silicon case for my unit because I am a clumsy person. I have dropped it many times over the two years and finally, last week, I dropped it one too many and it would no longer start up. I have since purchased a "Zen" and am very satisfied with it so far.

<Title>Little Zen Microphoto mine
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first MP3 player and I choose a Zen after much careful comparison. The main purpose was for audio books, so I required a set bookmark function as well as compatibility with common e-audio book formats. Zen came through! I encountered some issues with initial set up using the ultra-sensitive touchpad, but these are now resolved with patience. I am thoroughly enjoying my little Zen. It works well, is easy to use and at 8GB, holds quite a lot, even some lovely New Age & Celtic music! I did purchase ear buds that noise-cancel to replace what is supplied. You should also purchase a rapid wall or auto charger as the battery only lasts 12-15 hours. The PC interface is easy to use and rips audio from CD with ease! Get a Zen Microphoto and ENJOY!

<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>DO NOT BUY THIS!!! This player has gone bad twice for me and I have had it less than a year. Creative customer service is awful. You have to pay them 12 dollars just to talk to them on the phone, and although email support is available it is not at all helpful. In addition to this,  if the product is still under  the one year warranty a 25 dollar "diagnostic fee" is charged each time the player is sent in for repair. Unless you want your mp3 player to be complete garbage in less than a year, purchase something else. I am giving up on this one and purchasing a different brand.

Menu a bit clunky I've had it for three weeks and am still not used to the touch pad.  I always end up selecting things I don't mean to. Who needs photos on an MP3 player?  I think they just add that to raise the price. I wish there was an 8GB without photo capability that was less expensive.  Overall To me the most important thing in an mp3 player is sound quality. That combined with the amount of space and the easy transfer of playlists makes this a good deal. I would buy it again if I had to do it over.

<Title>Not bad, but a couple of minor quirks
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a decent little player, with good sound, bookmarking support, excellent FM reception, etc, but it does a couple of things that annoy me. I bought it to listen to lengthy podcasts and audiobooks while moving around, but I'm not sure I'm all that much better off than I was with my old 512MB RCA Emusic1.  The Micro Photo is very ID3 centric, using the MP3 file's abritrarily defined tags to sort the files inside of the hierarchies by artist, album, and genre. I haven't found a way to also sort by directory structure, meaning that I have to explicitly create playlists containing everything but my podcasts when I want to listen to just music in shuffle mode. Not a huge problem, but it wouldn't be a problem at all if this were a simpler device.  More importantly, it lacks any sort of grip for a pendant, band, etc, meaning that the only way to carry this thing short of, well, carrying it or dropping it into your pocket is to buy a clunky silicon wrap to put around the entire device. That's not a huge problem for me, as I'm a guy who always buys big pocketed-pants, but it'd be a big problem for my wife  and anyone that wants to use this device while wearing gym clothes.  Both of the above problems are also present in the iPod, but are absent in most bottom-rung flash devices that sort files by filename. If you're deciding between going low or going with a device like this, ask yourself: Would you rather have to put up with this device trying to organize your files into a tiny little 8GB library based on their metadata, or would you rather put up with a bottom-end device that doesn't have support for bookmarking/file resumption?
