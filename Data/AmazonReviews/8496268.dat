<Title>2 HUGE problems with this player!!!
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>1.  It will NOT play any songs purchased from Itunes.  (Itunes songs are MP4, but this player ONLY plays MP3 format. Who knew???)    2.  There is a FUNDAMENTAL, SERIOUS design flaw with this player.  If you attempt to rotate/twist the bottom white band (which you must do in order to skip ahead to another song or go backward to a different song), the entire bottom cover of the player FALLS OFF!  Seriously, this happens every time.  I'm an adult and no matter how careful I am, I simply cannot skip to a different song without the bottom cover falling completely off the player.  BTW, I purchased 2 players, and BOTH have this problem.

<Title>Good Product, Good Price, Good for kids!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the Shaker for my son (he is a year old, but loves music).  It came with some childrens songs on it, which was good for him.  I put a variety of pop, jazz, rock, and hip hop music on it and he just carries it around dancing and laughing.  The size is perfect for him and the built in speaker is the main selling point.  We have had the product for over a month with no problems.  We also use it while preparing and cooking meals. Thanks SanDisk for making an MP3 player for my kid.

<Title>Perfect for kids - and great for the price!
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I researched MP3 players for my 4 yr old for months before deciding which one to get her for Christmas. I decided on the Sansa Shaker 512MB (at the time I was looking they did not have the 1GB option). I could not be happier with the purchase. When reading reviews you could read 10 good and 1 bad and just not know what you are buying. Even though there were a few lower reviews for this I bought it anyhow. BOY, am I glad I did. The speaker function is great. My daughter likes the headphones and has no problem wearing them in the car or when we ask her to but otherwise she just plays it out loud and dances around the room with her sister.   It is a bit of a pain that you have to convert the files to MP3s but not so much of a pain that you'd not get the item. I transfer whole CDs at a time for her and it only takes a few minutes.   As other reviewers have mentioned, our "shaker" function does not work either - and trust me, she's shaken the thing! Not that big of a deal though. She knows how to move it to the next song by using the ring at the bottom. She also had no issues using the power button. You do have to hold it down for a few seconds but it makes a little sound when it's shutting off so she knows it's done it.   She's used it a considerable amount since Christmas and I've only had to change the battery once. It's nice that it just takes a AAA battery because you don't have to connect it to the computer to recharge it.  I did find that she was dropping it on the floor while dancing or she'd set it down and it would fall so I added a neck lanyard to the clip thing on the side so she can wear it around her neck. Voila! Problem fixed!  This is well worth the price you pay. My own MP3 player was three times the price and just died out of the blue. I'm thinking of getting one of these for myself except for it has no display, which is nice if you are an adult.

<Title>Perfect for Tweens
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My 10-year old daughter got this for Christmas from her uncle and she loves it.  I was wanting to buy her an mp3 player but the good ones were so expensive.  He discovered this one online and bought one for her and his step-children.  She loved the colar and how it was so easy to carry.  It is very simple to download the music onto the palyer and it holds tons and tons of songs.  My only complaint is that it goes through batteries fast which is way I did not give it five stars.  If you are looking for an inexpensive mp3 player for your tween this is the way to go.

<Title>My kids love it!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've now bought 2 of these, one for each of my kids (age 5 & 7).  For this age group especially, this is a great player as there's an integrated speaker.  The one downside is that it does only play mp3 files, so I sometimes have to go a round-about way to convert wma and m4p files to mp3.  (But, it can be done at no expense through iTunes, at least with a Mac.)  My 7 yr old got one for Christmas, and so far, we've had no issues with it.  (My 5 yr old just got one to be like her big brother.)  As with most electronic items, it can tend to go through batteries fairly quickly.  But, we've had less issues with that by switching to lithium ones.  Overall, a great, inexpensive player for younger kids!!

<Title>Good for the young and young at heart
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this mp3 player for my mom, who is not too tech savvy, so she can listen to podcasts of radio broadcasts that she missed.  Although this player is definitely aimed at children, it's also great for anyone in need of a simple player.  There are several features that made the Sansa Shaker the ideal purchase for my mom: 1) an external speaker, since she doesn't like using headphones 2) uses a AAA battery, this way mom doesn't have to worry about recharging through a USB port, or buying an extra charger 3) uses an SD card, this is actually good for me since I'm the one filling up the player, using my computer's built in SD-card reader it's extremely easy for me to get the podcasts on the device, and it allows for cheap memory expansion  I have to say that the quality of the external speaker is pretty good given the players small size.  The only downside we have discovered is that powering down the Sansa Shaker results in losing your place.  Not a problem with music, but more annoying with a long podcast.  Although you can fast forward through the podcast, it's a bit cumbersome to do with the "ring" control and no time elapse display.  Otherwise, mom and I are both extremely pleased with this product.

<Title>My kid loves it..
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 7 year old's b-day and we've had it for over a month now. She absolutely loves it!! She thinks that shaking it is so much fun, and so far it has lasted through all she's put it through. I especially love the speaker feature so she doesn't have the ear pieces in all the time, plus we can listen together if we want. I like the AAA battery and it lasts for quite a while, especially considering how much it's used. It was very easy to use even for me, this was my first experience with an mp3 of any kind and I didn't have any problems.  It was a bit of a hassle to load songs cause it doesn't take wma, but solved that by loading a free switch program to convert them to mp3. It also doesn't have a menu so you can't choose what song you want to listen to. Plus no shuffle feature, just goes through one CD at a time. It's ok for kids, they don't seem to mind much, but it is kind of annoying to listen to her shake through 25 songs before she finds the one she wants. That's my main reasons for not giving it 5 stars.   Overall, I'm very happy with and my kid loves it!

<Content>Great little player for yougsters. Simple to use. I only rated it 3 stars due to the basic (flat) sound quality from built in speaker. Also the instruction on opening it for battery replacement was unclear. Nonetheless I would purchase another one for my 6 year old.

<Title>Good Enough
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old because I was sick of having her music blasting out of my laptop. I particularly bought this model because of the speaker - I didn't want such a young kid using earphones. So far, it's done pretty well. It goes through batteries quickly - but it only uses one AAA. Once in a while, it will play a new song really slowly, like the wrong speed on an old record player, but we just turn it off and back on and it's fixed. I'd say the biggest pain is that I had to work around all of my itunes music being protected in order to get them onto this device. But once I did that, it's been pretty useful.

<Title>easy to use, nice design
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i got this for my 5 year old niece and didnt really know if she was gonna like it or use it for more than a few days, but she loves her sansa shaker, its really easy and fun to use, and she loves to listen to music with the speaker on, which i find great cuz headphones can be dangerous at such young age. It comes with some stickers to decorate. I would have liked to have a bigger range of color to decide from thou, but its not a big deal. It sounds fairly good, obviously with such a small speaker you cant expect a lot but for its size, it does the work. Plenty of memory space. It makes a great present. Price/quality is very good, i recommend it.

<Content>My 2 1/2 yr old daughter was jealous of her 6 yr old sisters "music box"- aka MP3 player. We got her this and she is thrilled and can operate it herself. I like that you dont have to have headphones to hear the songs, there is an speaker on the end and the sound is great. I also like that you load the songs on a SD card, that can be replaced with a larger capacity is desired. Great product, wonderful value!

<Content>This is a really nice mp3 player with a clear crisp sound quality. My daughter really loves it. It is nice to have the option of either using the ear buds or just playing it without. However, the battery life doesn't seem to last that long (3-4hrs continuous play) therefore I would recommend chargeable batteries. I would highly recommend this to anyone because you would be happy with this purchase.

<Content>I brought one for my 12 year old daughter.  I loaded songs into it and tested it out.  It was so much fun, I hated to give it to her.  I wanted to keep it. You can pretend that your holding a microphone,  its fun to hold and I love the sound it makes when you shake it to change songs.

<Title>Fun product for kids
<Date>Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We purchased the Sansa Shaker for my four year old for his birthday.  He is a kid who loves to rock out.  We loaded tons of his favorite songs on it, and he carries it everywhere.  It's pretty sturdy.  It's already been dropped a couple of times and it has held up well.  Good sound comes from the top and it is very kid friendly.  He learned how to operate it in under five minutes.  This mp3 player is PERFECT for him.  The only thing I don't like about it is the battery cap at the bottom of the player.  At first we couldn't get it off and now it just falls off randomly when you try to skip songs.  It is difficult to get it on just right.  Other that that I would recommend this player for kids up to age 10-  Any older than that and you might as well invest in a real iPod.
