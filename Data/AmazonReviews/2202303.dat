<Content>Rating out of 5 stars....negative 5! This is the worst thing I have ever purchased. The thing looks very cheap. Once you put the battery in it, it turns on. You can turn it off but guess what...can't turn it back on. There's a defect with the on switch.  Then when you play a song it only last about 10 seconds before you hear a beeping noise and the whole thing shuts off.  Complete piece of crap....don't waste your money.

<Title>DO NOT BUY...

<Content>I bought this MP3 as a replacement and regret making the decision.  It was cheaply priced which made it attractive but what it did not get in the purchase, it has more than made up for in how it goes through batteries!  I can say it is "the gas guzzler of MP3s".  The program it uses WMA which makes it easy to load and has a stopwatch that is useful in the gym.  The controls are located where any bump can stop or pause the music if you carry in your purse or pockets; overall not worth the investment.
