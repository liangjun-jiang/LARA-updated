<Title>Outstanding MP3 player.
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I began looking into an iPod purchase over a year ago, and was almost sold on the 4th generation iPod.  I liked the colors of the mini and was okay with 4 GB of storage (though that was a tad on the small side), but the main thing that deterred me from the mini was the less-than-desirable 8-10 hour battery life.  Then the 2nd generation mini was released.  Apple seemed to fix and improve every little thing I had held against the original.  They made the colors brighter, increased the hard drive space to 6 gigs, and most importantly, at least to me, increased the battery life two-fold.  The 18 hours that Apple advertises is EXTREMELY conservative.  If you're content listening to music and don't need the backlight for more than a minute or two every hour, the battery can run for about 24-25 hours.  I can go a week and not have to worry about recharging my battery.  I could listen every waking moment of my day and never have to stop and recharge before I went to bed.  It's a wonderful thing.  The blue is very bright and pleasing to the eye--I've seen the pink and silver versions and they too are visually appeasing.  6 gigs is nothing to shake a stick at--on the contrary, I've found that 6 gigs is just about the perfect size for someone who has a vast number of interests musically but doesn't have thousands upon thousands of CD's to rip and upload.  Unless you have literally hundreds of CD's in your collection that you plan on putting on your iPod, I'd recommend the mini, since you'd more than likely end up with half the space on your regular iPod sitting unused.  Despite the fact that the iPod scratches easily, there are several cases which work extremely well...I'm partial to the ones made by Power Support, though you have to import them from Japan.  Uploading your songs is quick and easy.  Navigating the menus takes about 15 minutes to master.  There's really nothing more I can say that can do the iPod mini justice.  I will make a quick note and add that I'm not an Apple fanatic.  I think that Apples are good computers, but I'm still attached to my PCs.  However, when it comes to MP3 players, there's really no comparison; it's going to take many many years before Microsoft or any other competing company can put out any MP3 player nearly as nice as the 2nd generation iPod mini.  Also, if you have a friend that's a teacher in a school, look into the education discount on the Apple website.  It ends up being 20 or 30 dollars off.

<Title>practical and easy to use
<Date>Wed May 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>let's put it this way, if you want to store all your music in your ipod ( and when i say all your music, i mean ALL), then  this ipod mini is not for you, 'cause as you guys know, this ipod mini only holds up to 1,500 songs (6gb). Now,  that's a lot of songs if you ask me, that's an entire week of music, i love classic rock and i filled my ipod mini with all of my favorite songs, you know how cool it is for me to take this everytime i go to the beach or if i'm having some company, i can just press shuffle and enjoy without the hassle of getting up everytime, you know to change cd's??, so if you're looking for something that's not that expensive and just want to have a good time and easy to use then i recomend this little item!! Respeta a un varon!!!!!

<Content>The iPod mini is a wonderful invention - thank you Apple.  I'm a Windows user, so when Mac came out with the Windows version of iTunes, it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  The iPod mini is the best music product on the market for people who only have time to list to 1000+ songs - you never get through them all.

<Content>I just got a silver ipod mini for my 13th b-day, and it is way cool! I was going to get an ipod shuffle, but I am so glad I went with the mini. I was frusterated at first, because I couldn't figure out how to transfer songs onto it. However, my mom finally figured it out. It sounds great! I did not use the headphones that came with it, 'cause they didn't seem very good. It can fit in my pocket, and I don't have to worry about getting to many songs on it. Way to go, Apple!

<Title>Fantastic!!!!!!
<Date>Tue Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, I bought my iPod mini 6gb (Pink)to hold my favorite songs to listen to on the go, in the car, etc. I cannot stress enough how much fun this amazing little thing has been. This is the best thing I have ever spent my money on.  iTunes is incredibly easy to use. I was able to easily convert my songs from Windows Media Player over to Apple's iTunes with no problems. Just make sure you go to the Tools Option in the task bar on Windows Media Player, then to Options and then to the Copy tab and turn off the Copy Protect music (for all you Windows Media Users). Windows, by default, automatically protects your music to keep you from being able to use other formats.   I have around 1200 songs loaded on my iPod and still have a little over 1 gb left. I like to keep it in the shuffle mode to mix up music and listen to things I have not heard in a long time. I am actually purchasing my husband one for his birthday/Father's Day because he loves mine so much. He owns an iPod shuffle, but would prefer a mini.  The iPod mini seems sturdier than my 20gb iPod. I use a case for it occasionally. It has yet, knock on wood, to be scratched. It works superbly and right now I am getting over 24 hours on one battery charge. I find my iPod mini impossible to live without. I take it everywhere and use it for hours every day. It comes in handy when you have to wait in long lines or shopping alone, etc. I also use it in the car with the Belkin TuneBase FM modulator for the iPod mini. It works well and holds the iPod in a slot so it does not slide around the car and get scratched. It also works as a charger.   I feel you will not be disappointed with this purchase. It can be pricey for some people, but it will be well worth it in the long run. If you have a really large music collection, I recommend buying a 20, 30 or 60 gb iPod. But, if you have a smaller collection, or only want your favorite songs in one place, the iPod mini is perfect. I know most people eventually own two. A large one for the entire collection and the mini to hold your workout, driving, etc. playlists. So, good luck and have fun with it.

<Title>Convenient, easy to use, fun, and silver!
<Date>Sun Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple 6 GB Ipod Mini is very convenient. First of all it comes with all the necessary stuff (at least mine did). A firewire cable, a belt clip, Ear buds (with extra pieces) and the Itunes CD.   The Ipod Mini is also very ez to use with the click and scroll wheel that allows you to easily move through categories of selections and through songs. Also besides being able to hold up to 1,500 songs it can help you with a variety of other things from remembering e-mail addresses to telling you the time and date (even comes with an setable alarm). It has a built in backlight too for night trips and and a few simple built in games like brick for when you become bored. And if that's not enough it's silver :)   I recommend the Ipod Mini 6 GB silver ipod not only because it's a good product but because of the battery life. After one single full charge it can keep playing for up to 18 hours which isn't bad at all. It's especially good for people who prefer quality over quantity of songs. Ipod Mini is perfect for car drives and even plane rides and it's small enough to fit well in a pocket or a bag and is very light and is guaranteed at least 25 minutes of not skipping. A very good buy.

<Title>There is a reason for the phenomenon...
<Date>Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>iPods change your life. Simple as that. The ability to carry 1,500 songs in your pocket (or a bunch of audiobooks, one of the many free Podcasts of news, commentary or music 'radio,' and your contacts) is still revolutionary.   In addition to the iPods, which are clearly best-of-breed devices (in part because they maintain their simplicity instead of adding buggy feature bloat found in competitors), iTunes and the iTunes music store have run rings around its competitors. That's why iPods have 76% market share -- and rising.   About the new mini:   It gives you iPod-level functionality in a 3.6 oz. masterpiece of engineering, with newly improved 18-hour battery life to boot. Colors add flash and style that make competitors look oh-so-80s.   The Click Wheel input takes a few minutes to master and is far more intuitive than anything else on the market -- which are fully of clunky buttons.   Another reason to buy an iPod over a competitor: Add-ons. There are literally thousands of products out there for customizing your iPod.   Finally, if you are getting this as a gift for someone else, for heaven's sake, don't go for a 'bargain' player. Especially if this is for someone new to digital music. A big part of Apple's genius is its ability to make its software easy to use for all -- heck, even The Queen has an iPod Mini! If she can use one, so can your mom, your grandmother and your kids. Those same people are likely to look at a Rio like it's an alien from another planet, and when they are forced to use that confusing Windows media software, well, that gadget is going to end up on a shelf gathering dust...   Enjoy!

<Date>Fri Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my iPod a couple of months ago, and it is the best thing I bought beside my guitar.  I love the sleek look, also it is so easy to use and is almost like a mini organizer with music.  iTunes is the easiest and best digital music company out there.  The mini iPod comes with the USB cable, earphones, the iPod, instruction booklet, and a belt clip. Some of the features beside playing music is rating music, creating playlists on the iPod (with a touch of a button), playing games, a calendar, notes, to-do list, and much more... (I don't know how to work those things but I'm gonna learn. =] )  Overall, an iPod is the best mp3 player out there and is worth every cent. =) =] :)

<Title>THIS PRODUCT ROX 
<Date>Fri Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No wonder the Apple iPod mini is so popular, whether it is 4GB or 6GB. 4Gb holds 1,000 songs and the 6GB holds 1,500 songs. The other mp3 players, like Zen, have really bad quality. But the iPod mini 6 GB's  quality is really good. It comes with a calendar, alarm clock, games, plus you can rate your songs (yeah, with five stars or whatever) and shuffle them or choose whichever song you would like to listen to.  Or you can simply choose a playlist. It's really easy to turn the iPod on or off; you simply press the play/pause button. If you put the iPod in your pocket, then you can simply push the lock button to prevent the iPod to turn off in the middle of a song. The iPod mini comes with a firewire, earbuds (extra black thingies in case they fall off; which mine do a lot!!!), a belt clip, a CD for iTunes, plus itself! I chose pink because I like pink. That's another plus: you can chose whatever color you like. Charging is kinda bad. Ever since the price was dropped, iPod minis stopped coming with chargers, so they take longer to charge. I bought the XtremeMac AirPlay FM Transmitter, and it's really good with my iPod mini. Plus, it also fits into my sister's iPod photo so we don't have to waste our money buying two separate Airplays.I find buying the speakers to play for the whole room to hear very silly. At a party, I unplugged the speakers from my computer and connected them to my iPod, and they worked fine. Also, buy a cover for your iPod!!!! I am very clumsy and keep dropping my iPod. I bought a Ipod Mini Flip Case for my iPod. The flip part protected my iPod from damage, and when I opened it I could use the scroll wheel. (By the way, my iPod seems to find it very funny when I put it on shuffle and it plays two songs by the same artist in a row). Over all, I am very proud of my iPod, and I think, and although my iPod was $250, it was worth every penny (actually more like dollars). Apple rox!!!!

<Content>i'm a kid who has lots of songs and wants to listen to them all the time. When youre going on a plane,car,train ride etc... you dont want to carry a ton of cds. When you have an ipod mini you dont need to. My 6gb can hold up to 1500 songs, has an 18 hour battery, and great sound. i dont need to turn it up even half way to hear it perfectly. It's small, compact, and easy to carry around. Unlike the ipod nano it doesnt break easily if you put it in your pocket too much. My sister has had her 20gb ipod regular for more than a year and so far neither of us has had any complaints to apple.

<Content>I don't write many reviews, and I know this is model isn't being manufactured anymore, but if you're thinking of buying one second hand or something, don't hesitate. It's the best mp3 player I've ever had. I've dropped it about a hundred times (no exaggeration) and it still works perfectly. For this reason alone, I implore you -GET ONE!  Other than that, it's simply great. Stores about 1100 / 1200 songs depending on bit rate etc... doesn't nearly fit all of my music... but certainly does the job. Have never experienced any problems with software jams and I'm using Windows XP. Seamless integration. Perfect. This one is actually worth the retail price. Probably more.  Have a good one!

<Title>One of the best out there,the cons really hurt it.
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had an Ipod Mini 6GB since October of 2005.I was lucky to get one because they were discontinued and i refused to get a Nano.When i first got the product and opened it the installation was easy.Plug the Ipod to the computer, insert the CD and your ready to go!Adding songs to my Ipod was quick and easy with Itunes.By the time i was done adding songs it was ready to go!So i finally started listening and i was amazed at the sound this little machine contains.The sound on this is incredible but when i turned the voulme up to full i discovered the first problem with the included earbuds.When turned to full voulme the earbuds make a clicking noise.I listen to rap and r&b so i like my bass heavy but everytime it's at full volulme it clicks and its annoying because u can't hear the bass just the clicking.I found that i could get over this problem.So i was enjoying my Ipod listening to my favorite songs on it for hours and hours.My battery life was amazing i still had a full charge 3 hours later!Then Hurricane Wilma was coming so i charged my Ipod and pack songs on to it.After the power was out I listened to it some but i conserved the battery.And let me tell you, my Ipod lasted me a week and 3 days and we were out of power for 2 weeks!Thats almost the entire outage!I was amazed.All my friends in school want to listen to it but i just tell em get your own.As i experienced my Ipod for more and more months, my Apple experience started to get worse..I started finding out more and more about my Ipod.I had looked up the battery problems before i got my Ipod and i knew that once the battery is out i'd have to send the Ipod to apple.So about in December just 2 months after i got my Ipod, my Ipod's battery life started getting bad.After a few minutes of listening atleast most of my battery would be drained,not half,but most.Just enough to continue through my day though.Also my click wheel became dirty,i also found more problem with the stock earbuds.They fall out of your ear so easily,there painful,and the sound is horrible.I listen to my ipod when im sleep alot and when im laying down im constantly having to put my earbuds back in my ears because of pain or falling out.Also the battery life is 18 hours but i recently tested that my ipods max battery life is 8 hours.The same expected battery life as the first generation Mini.I was afraid my Ipod would be wearing out and i'd soon have to buy another Mp3.Recently i've been looking up other Mp3's on the market incase of my Ipod breaking.The Ipod is really the top dog and most expensive brand out there.Apple also is ripping people off if you notice but that's a entirely different review.Over all the Ipod is great,innovative,fun,and looks great.But read the title and you will know why this has a 3.The battery only lasts 500 charges as many expect but your battery life will start to go down after just a few months!Also the earbuds suck ass but can be replaced no big deal.The ipod is very expensive.For example,my 6Gb silver mini was 250$ compared to the Creative Zen 6GB which is 200$,and the battery is easily replaced.In all Ipod is great but Apple is just taking advantage of people IMO.IT is very expensive,battery can't be replaced you have to send it to Apple and 99$ to get it fixed,and compared to the others in the market it will soon be overtaken.Well this is my review i hope it is very helpful as i hope it will be to you.

This company has a class action lawsuit against it for this, among other claims. You can view the class action lawsuit by googling "tell on apple."    Don't get cheated the way I did!

<Title>maybe, maybe not
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the ipod mini from Amazon on September 17, 2005. I used it periodically over the next few months, probably about 50 or so hours total play time. This week, I rediscovered my ipod after not using it since December. I was so excited to be able to listen to podcasts, audiobooks, and music at work that I joined audible.com and started downloading all this great stuff. It's really a great toy to have around to break the tedium of the work day.   If only it worked.   After about 50 hours of lifetime use, this unit froze up in the middle of changing tracks and has been stuck on that screen for over 6 hours now. I followed all the troubleshooting stuff on Apple's web site, but to no avail. I was able to put in a support request to send the unit to Apple for replacement. They did charge me about $35 for shipping and handling, even though I am within warranty. Of course, I am not too happy about that, but I forked it over anyway. We will have to wait and see how the company does on their follow through.   If it wasn't for this one incident, I would say it is a great product, with a nice intuitive interface. Partnering the hardware with i-tunes makes for easy organizing and listening of your audio library.

The battery life is ok, its more like 12 hours but its probably because mines a bit older. It does the job more than nicely for me. However it could be better. I like the extras, but it could have some more exciting games on it. They are pretty poor. It also could have an FM radio as sometimes I would like to change. Its easy to use and looks good so no other complaints. I recommend it!!!!

<Title>3.5 stars.  YES! It Does Play .MP3s!!!!!!
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros:    I've always been hesitant to buy an ipod... or any mac product.  But this is one of the few devices that have an H20 audio case (sold here on Amazon), that enables you to swim with your ipod (a couple other ipod models have h20 cases too).  I've been a little ignorant about the ipod thinking it wouldn't play .mp3s, but it does. (It just doesn't let you transfer them to another pc).  But if you have some .mp3's on your PC from whereever, it will copy them to your ipod, and leave the one's on your pc unchanged!  This rocks as I thought it would encrypt the mp3s on my pc... it doesn't.  It has more features than I expected... the ipod wheel is pretty easy to figure out, I didn't read the manual it was soo easy.  It comes with a Calendar, To Do List, Clock, alarm and more.  I'm impressed.  Spending this much on a device, I did get a warranty added on.  It has a super interface that automatically organizes several different ways, by artist, by album, by genra, etc... and you can access your music by these different ways.  Much better than the old Creative Zen's that have no folder functions or any additional functions listed above.  Cons:  You have to connect to your PC via tha USB transfer cable in order to charge the unit.  The battery is not accessible.  You must send the unit to Apple to get it replaced (there are others on the net that do it for less).  It encrypts all music you transfer to it (on the device only, not on your PC).  It isn't compatable with many mobile music services, such as Real Rhapsody... etc.  Pretty foolish.  People are willing to pay a monthly subscription and be legal, and ipod denies them this because they want you to use itunes only.  Well, this encourages illegal downloading as the non-protected mp3 commonly downloaded will easily go onto the ipod!  >:(  Get with it ipod!  Otherwise, this is a player I would recommend.  If you're planning on getting a bigger player, 6+GB, I'd go with a different brand that has all the features of the ipod plus more... the Toshiba MES60VK, available here on amazon, has the same features as the 60GB ipod, with compatibility with subscription services AND digital FM radio!

The player needs a a bit of a better battery I have the newer model but still doesnt live up to the 16 hours they claim but for the room and the money its the better one out there it really hasnt locked on me yet only a couple of times but the they also claimed this newer model had a auto volume adjustment feature which may work somewhat but it is simply not true some songs are louder and some a quiter depends on quality of mp3 but over would recommend it I hope they come out with better features in the new one and smaller

<Content>However, I have to knock it down to a 3 because sound quality is unspectacular.  Is it too much to expect the mini IPOD to have good decent eq options?  If so, then shame on me.  I think creative players offer much cleaner and varied eqs. There is no auditorium, small room, or my favorite "garage" eqs.  Most of the eqs on the mini are horrible and colorless. However, functionality of the player otherwise is fine.

Several down loads and no resolution of the problem resulted in my returning the unit. Second unit does the same.  Surfed the web and found this to be a common problem.  Will not buy an apple product again. Not just because of the problem with this iPod but because of the lack of support.  Apple thinks that a customer forum where the customers try to assist each others is support. It isn't in my opinion.

<Title>Great mp3 player even if a tad expensive and lacking some features
<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Good:  Excellent interface. A monkey could learn to operate it.  It took me longer, but I've got it mastered now. Excellent design.  Very light. Perfect for running at the gym and lifting while listening to it. Much sturdier than Creative's powder puff players. Excellent sound quality  The Bad: No ogg support. Slightly subpar headphones. No FM.  I could care less since FM radio is a wasteland but you might want it in spite of that fact.  The Ugly: Janice Gryffloch, George Bush, Sandra Bernhardt and George the Animal Steele.  Oh, wait, Steele is kinda cute.

<Title>iLove my iPod!
<Date>Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It is amazing how Apple can manage to fit 1,500 songs into this lightweight, tiny little thing. How do they do it? It seems even smaller than it looks when you actually get to hold it. This thing is so amazing.  Some of the other features with the iPod mini- the click wheel is really cool. My mom has an older version of the regular iPod, the one with all the buttons on the top. Coming from a person with experience, the click wheel is a lot handier and easier, especially when you are on the go or maybe out running. Like other MP3 players, this one doesn't skip. This a big improvement to my old Walkman that has "30 second skip protection." Yeah right. Another thing I like about the iPod mini is the battery life. I am this music freak who is constantly using my iPod, and this thing can go a LONG time before the battery needs to be recharged.   I decided to buy the green iPod mini. At first I was sure I was going to buy the silver version, but after seeing the real life mini in green, I changed my mind. See, in pictures at Apple and Amazon and in magazines or whatever, green looks cool, but something that people would get tired of quickly. The green is a lot flashier and prettier in real life. I have had my iPod for almost a year now, and I'm not even close to being sick of its color. So just so all you prospective iPod buyers out there know, the green is different in real life than in the pictures.  Now, I am not discouraging people not to buy the real iPods, but there is no point if you are like me to get 60, 40, even 20 GB of songs. To all you teenagers, kids, or people who don't have an extremely complex CD collection, it will save you a lot of money to buy a mini. Music is my life- I have tons of CDs and pretty much spend all of my money on songs off iTunes and more CDs, but I'm only 15. I don't need to spend all that money to get a bunch of space that it will take me years and years to fill up. I strongly considered getting a 40 GB iPod, but now I'm happy with what I've gotten. It saved me a lot of money, because as I said, a lot of the space in a real iPod would have taken forever to use up. So again, I'm not telling you all to go buy a mini rather than a real iPod, but just think of how many songs the real ones have. It isn't necessary if you don't have hundreds and hundreds of CDs. And believe me, 1,500 is a lot more songs than you think.   That said, I do have one minor complaint about my iPod. Mine has frozen up once or twice and I can't figure out why, but it isn't a big nuiscance. I have taken it in and nobody can really give a diagnosis why it freezes up. I don't know if my iPod is the only iPod out there that does this, but be warned.  The earbuds that come with the iPod mini- I haven't trashed mine yet. I often use my old pair of headphones, however, when I'm running or something. Basically I swich off headphones- old ones half the time, and earbuds the other half. I personally think this is a wise decision because 1) the earbuds don't always stay in your ear, especially when running, and 2), because since the earbuds go directly in your ear, after a long period of time of listening to my iPod, my ears feel kind of, well, worn out, I suppose. I don't have my volume extremely high or anything, but going directly in your ears, the earbuds can hurt your ears or just be annoying. When I have my earbuds in I also hear less noise around me. The volume with the earbuds is a lot louder than the same volume with my headphones. This is just because the earbuds are right in my ears. Before I had an adapter to get my songs to go through my boom box, I was experimenting one day and turned the volume all the way up. I plugged in the earbuds, but I didn't put them on my ears. I put my iPod on my bed along with the earbuds. It was just like listening to my CD player. With the volume turned all the way up, I could hear every word and every drum beat of my songs. Though I had never turned the volume all the way up when listening to my iPod before, needless to say I will never do it after that experience.  Otherwise, I am extremely impressed with the iPod. I'm sure it will be with me for years and years, until I have bought so many CDs that I need a bigger iPod. Really, this thing is so cool. Go Apple!

<Title>One of the best gifts ever
<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My husband gave me this for my birthday in May.  Since then, I have taken it with me every day for a walk, worked in the yard with it, played it in the car (tape adapter), and listened to it in bed when I was too sick to watch TV or a video.  This is my first mp3 player - unless you count the Zen Micro that died within an hour of purchase - and it was very easy to figure out how to use it.  I have downloaded old radio programs, walking music, podcasts, and I have never lacked for something interesting to listen to.  I recommend buying some kind of protective sleeve to protect the face since I suspect it will scratch with a lot of use.  I also recommend buying something besides the ear buds that come with it.  I can't comment on battery life because I charge it almost every time I update it with a new podcast.  This little player has really been fun and is part of the reason that I walk about 5 miles each day.  The best advice I saw:  remember that it's still a little tiny computer so don't do anything to it that a little tiny computer wouldn't survive!

<Title>BEST THING EVER
<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The ipod mini is the best thing I own right now. I can download my cd's in it and categorize them all so they are easy to find.  The only thing I have a problem with is that the ipod did not come with an adaptable charger so I have to plug it directly into my computer to charge.  Luckily the charge holds for an extended amount of time but I still feel that for $250 apple should have included a charger.   Overall its really worth the money and I think its fantastic for anyone that exercises.  I do recommend getting the accessories such as arm band to hold it while you exercise and the transmitter to listen to it in your car.  That will make the ipod experience all the better and those accessories are reasonalby cheap.

<Title>Crashed but had it replaced fast
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>OK....so I bought the 6gb ipod mini 3 months ago from best buy.  The nano had just been introduced, but too me, they seemed too small and chinzy...so I passed on the Nano.  I have a ton of music but have no plans to put every single album i have in the ipod....so I went with the 6gb.  It seemed to work fine, but the sound was kinda muddy...i thought this was just due to the fact it was mp3....and then it did crash on me 2 times in the first 2 months.  I was able to troubleshoot the problem each time and get it back up and running within about 10 minutes.  Then it crashed a 3rd time and I spent the better part of one night trying to get it to work....no luck.  So i took it to the apple store in Downtown San Francisco.....I took it to their help desk which they call the "Genius bar."  Anyway, they ran a few tests and the guy said the hard drive was "toast" and gave me a new one at no cost.  No problems with this one so far and the sound does seem to be better then the last one.  Contrary to what others have said, you can jog with the mini...  Do get a protective case as soon as you buy it.  It will get scuffed if you don't....get one of the covers that also covers the display screen.....  I'm giving it 4 stars because apple was quick to replace my defective one....so we'll see what happens with this one.  Dollar for dollar, and despite the problems I had with my first one, I still think Ipod is the way to go....I know tons of people that have never had a problem with their ipods....

<Content>DON'T SKIP THIS REVIEW! I'M NOT JUST ANOTHER KID WHO DOSEN'T HAVE AN iPOD! I REALLY DO AND THIS IS TRUE! I got a Pink iPod Mini for Christmas in 2004. I love it! The sound is great! My advice though: Buy your own headphones! The earbuds are junky. I'd advise headphones that are not in-ear like the ear buds. The Mini doesn't have a color screen like the Nano, but it is just as good! I listen to Green Day, and expect the fullest sound. It's awesome! Wake Me Up When September Ends Live sounfs like you're really there! If you are thinking about buying one of these, DO IT! You'll love it! iPods rock! Ignore all the bad reviews! This is the whole truth, and nothin' but the truth! Take it from me! You'll love your Pod' as much as I love mine!  -Peace Out-

<Title>One of the better iPod buys
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: -Terrific battery life:  Apple claims 18 hours, and I've found that even when I change the volume, song selection etc. fairly often, I get a good 12 at least -Storage: Even though I have more than 6 GB of music, I find that I don't really ever need to have more than that on hand, and yet it's enough that I never get bored. -Size: Smaller than a regular iPod, and big enough that it's easy to hold on to, like if in your pocket, or attached to the belt clip (I haven't used the nano, but from having held one I can imagine fumbling with it comstantly) -The interface is incredibly simple and very easy to get used to, and the click-wheel design is probably the best out there -Very sturdy: I've dropped mine or otherwise mishandled it on a few different occasions, and yet it works as well as it did when I bought it (~1-2 years ago)  Cons: -Doesn't come with an AC power adapter (inconvenient for when you simply want to charge it without bothering with your computer) -Apple's included headphones have relatively meager sound quality, and aren't very reliable over a long term (the wires on mine actually freeze up and won't move when I'm outside in the winter!)  Aside from these inconveniences (which can be handled by buying other items), the iPod itself is truly outstanding.  I use it constantly without any problems, and the lack of photo and video storage that the new iPods have is definitely not a problem (I use mine more often when I'm on the go and listening to music, not sitting down to look at pictures or watch a show).  I'm really surprised that Apple discontinued these, but despite that, I still think they're the best iPod out there, in terms of features and value for the price.

<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There's not much left to say that hasn't already been covered.  This is a great little toy.  The battery life is one of the best from the iPod range (Apple claims up to 18 hours) which is a great thing to have for long trips.  The included belt clip isn't really that useful for me, but might be for using at the gym or treadmill.  One thing that I wish it could do is gapless playback between tracks (for mix CDs or live concerts), but this is a limitation of MP3's in general, not the fault of the iPod.  If you're able to get your hands on these before the iPod nano takes over, you should definitely go for it!

<Content>I own at least a half dozen MP3 players including a 20 gig Nomad Jukebox.  I don't know why, but the Ipod interface is the best I've ever used.  It just works.  Think of two pairs of shoes - one fits but the other is just a little too big or a little too small.  That's how the mini is for me - it just fits.  BTW, the size is just right too.  I carry it in my shirt pocket without weighing it down too much.  The Ipod (regular) is too heavy for me.

My ipod broke down and so I decided to go mini this time the colors are kicked up a whole lot really bright and matching click wheel icons and the mini now has a whole lot more battery life and plus you get 6 gigs for 250 dollars instead of the four gigs the first generation had then there is the feature you pull the headphones out the mini pauses the song  im so glad i waited for generation 2 and the green ipod mini is sick people are always staring at it because blue and silver are very popular for dudes but me i like to be differnt great investment

<Content>I have had my mini Ipod 6 GB for 6 months now and enjoy it very much.  Its a great way to dump a whole bunch of CD'd into and bring them with you in a small package.  I dislike however how the battery drains itself even when not being used.  This is troubling since the battery has only a certain number of charges in it over its lifetime.  If I fully charge it and don't get a chance to use it again for 2 weeks, when I go to use it the Ipods shows only a half charge.  My daughter's Shuffle doesn't seem to discharge over time but then again it really only tell you when it needs to be recharged.

<Title>Good - but it should be for the price
<Date>Thu Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The ipod mini itself is built solidly.  The sturdiness of the product was the biggest factor in my decision to buy an ipod rather than another brand.  Some of the other ones are put together like a Yugo made on New Year's day.  The battery life has been good.  I would say it is about what is spec'ed, but I've never totally drained it.  The user interface is straight forward and utilitarian.    This was my first purchase of an Apple product - and it galled me to no end that iTunes music cannot be effectively exported or other copy protected music adaopted for iPod, thanks to Apple's dilgently monopolistic efforts in thwarting Real and others.  Ipod does not support Yahoo's music service (of course).    Nevertheless, the ipod is typical Apple - a good product with proprietary features that force you to stay within the Apple ecosystem and pay high prices for equipment and accessories. What's the profit margin on a pack of 3 ipod skins that sell for $25?  gimme a break.  In spite of these negatives, I am satisfied with my ipod and would recommend it - it's definitely the "safe" way to get a quality MP3 player. It functioned well on a 3 week trip through China.  You can always just buy MP3 music elsewhere and import it rather than patronize iTunes...

<Date>Tue Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After much research I decided to purchase the 6GB Mini Pink Applie iPod, and I couldn't be any more happoier. The iPod is lightweight, easy to use, has a fabulous pink color and the storage space is perfect for me. I have had my iPod for couple of months now and have about 790 out of 1500 possible songs on it. I have created many playlists from the songs in my library and was able to upload songs from other peoples playlists directly to my ipod.  Pros of the 6GB Mini Pink Lightweight Great Capacity Value (money's worth)  Cons The dial wheel got dirty sort of quickly after I removed the protective film. (I recommend getting a case) Earpieces' cord is kind of short  I bought the product on amazon and I recommend for everyone to do the same. The price was cheaper, AND the shipping was free, what else could I ask for.

<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My iPod Mini died with less than 5 month's usage.  It simply refused to turn on; refused to charge; and would not be recognized by my PC after docking via a USB port.  This is the 3rd time that this occurred.  The first two times, I was able to reset my Mini.  This time, no such luck.  I owned a 3rd generation iPod.  That thing was a clunker and had horrendous battery capacity, but I had no such technical difficulties as described above with my Mini.  I also own an iPod nano.  But that's just too new for me to recognize any problems.  I hope I have better luck with the nano.  Depending on how Apple treats me with my Mini with the warranty service and how the nano performs, I may STOP buying Apple MP3 players and trade onto a iRiver player.

Definitely. Easy to transfer music and easy to navigate. Things I still have to learn include making folders for each genre.

<Content>It is flexible... can be used as a peripheral drive. It is user friendly, very intuitive. 6 GB is more than enough. It is very small and light.

<Title>Ipod Mini
<Date>Sat Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I saved up my money to buy a mini last christmas and i bought it and everythign was going great until about the 2nd month i had it. My sister had just gotten a newer version of the ipod and when she downloaded it to her computer itunes wouldn't recognize my older ipod and i couldnt put any new music on it. About a month later I started getting this weird symbol that looked like a folder and an exclamtion point when i'd go to turn on my ipod. So i looked on the website for troubleshooting tips and i tried everything but nothing worked.i couldn't turn on my ipod. Luckily I was still under warrenty so i sent it in to the repair shop and the sent me back a brand new one. Once again everything was going great up until last month. the battery ran out one day but thats no big deal i charged it until it was full like normal and the next time i go to turn it on it says low battery and it turned off. I know the  ipod's batteries can die completely after about a year but 3 months? Now i will charge my ipod fully and it will say low battery and turn wwhile the little battery sign says full. this is ecspecially annoying when yo uare away from home and can't charge it, not like it help mine anyway. I am so frustrated with my ipod running out of batteries after every ttime i charge it makes me want to chuck it out a window. Right now i am looking at other mp3 players. Maybe this is a special case, but my mom and my friends ipods have both done similar things. I do not recommend this.

<Content>Love my ipod even tho this model has now been discontinued (replaced by the nano). The only thing is I wish it came with the AC power adapter the regular ipod comes with and I wish there were a way to turn it off, otherwise it's awesome!

<Content>This is a execllent product. This has changed the way I hear music. I used to carry those cumbersome walkman. Now I carry 300 songs in one device. It would have been good if it had FM tuner. This will be helpful when we want to take a break

<Title>Similar problems to those reported
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok,so my friend had a 10 gig iPod, one of the white regular sized ones and he was saying that it was the best mp3 player he ever had and it convinced me to buy one.  I didn't have 10 gigs of music so I bought a 6 gig iPod mini.  I thought it would be at the same amazing level that the regular iPod's were on, but no.  My mini just one day decided not to recognize that my iTrip was plugged in, then for a full day the screen would turn black and then light up and the little apple sign would show up then turn back to black to eventually shut off.  Then it decided not to show anything on the screen but it would light up and it would work with my headphones.  Then one day, it decided that it just wanted to die.  So, no more iPod mini for me.  I would like to say that the iPod was never in danger, and barely moved from my car to my house and vice versa.  I have heard many similar stories with mini's.  Oh, and the paint scratched within a day of having it.  You would think that paying this much for an item, they could use a higher quality paint.  I'm not here to bash Apple because they make some amazing products and the regular iPod is amazing in the mp3 world.  If you are willing to make a $240 investment in an iPod, spend the extra $30 or so for the regular iPod.  They are so much better.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player of any kind, and i think i made the right choice. The ipod mini is a great size and very easy to use. The price is high but you get what you pay for. The over all feel of the mini seems tough and the color is awsome. Green is totally the best color, in my opinion. Great player for anyone.

<Title>disappointed
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the 6GB iPod in Aug '05, after previously using Dell Jukebox for a couple of years. The iPod is a superior product with iTunes being more user friendly. HOWEVER, one of the major reasoning for buying the 6GB was battery life, which is advertised as 18 hours. What a disappointment to discover on a long overseas trip that in truth 6 hours is closer to the limit. I have since discussed this with other mini iPod users & they confirm a similar story.  When I brought this up in an Apple Store in NYC, the sales assistant stated that " 6 hours is a good result".   How can Apple be so far out in their battery estimation is beyond me. Besides the battery life disappointment the product is very satisfactory.
