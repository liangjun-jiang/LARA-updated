<Content>I cant seem to find a software that works flawlessly with this thing.I have tried MusicMatch,Media Monkey,Media Jukebox,Rhapsody and they all tend to freeze up when loading songs on to this thing,so I am assuming it is a flaw in the product.Other than that it sounds decent,its little enough to put anywhere,although it is a tad bulky for its size.It only holds like 150 songs for me,so I am looking to upgrade soon.  
<Overall>3
