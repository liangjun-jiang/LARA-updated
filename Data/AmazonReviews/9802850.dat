<Title>The best and most you can get for your money!!!!  
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Just got mines (2days after ordering....fast!) and I couldn't be more pleased.  I reaserched the net and read over 50 reviews on different MP3 players in this price range and capacity level, I found this to be the best & most for the price (very inexpensive for what you get in fact).    This came w/ software that allows you to rip your own cd's into your MP3 player,  it was a sinch to work..... after 15min's I had already opened, assembled my MP3 player, downloaded the software and ripped 2 whole cd's into my new MP3 player (40 songs) and I still have about 1/2 memory left so I'm sure I can fit about 100 songs in total onto this little thing. I was able to sort and creat playlist using the software as well...very handy.    So far so good...........I'll keep ya'll poste!  Ciao :o)

<Title>large ear buds/eats batteries quickly
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>not only did the ear buds not fit in my ears but this thing eats the batteries so quickly (5 hours max).  Also, it doesn't have any sort of clip attached to it.  So even though it's inexpensive, count on spending at least another $25 on smaller buds and a case.  i had to buy a cell phone clip on case so that i could wear this while working out - which is the only reason i purchased it.

<Title>Awesome for running!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had mine for over a year now and I am still very pleased.  I like the fact that it takes one AAA that last for a good while.  I don't have to charge it.  It's lightweight and I can fit it the little fold-over pocket on my running pants.  Easy to toggle from one song to the next.  But my FAVORITE  part is the snap in/snap out feature that allows you to plug the unit directly into your USB port.  Works great with WMP.

<Title>cool mp3
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this product alot even though I bought it a while back and have since purchased a MAC computer.  Now I cannot download to this mp3 player.  I bought myself an ipod shuffle (loving it) and my son is enjoying this mp3 now.  Very simple to use.  Enough storage capacity for my son, but you might want to up the mbs if you like to store alot of music.  I used it for file storage as well.  Never had a problem.
