<Title>Great little player
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this because I was looking for a smaller mp3 player to carry on my long runs.  After doing a lot of research I decided to give this one a try.  I wanted something with drag and drop capabalities that I could use with windows explorer.  It's small, easy to use, good battery life and good sound.  I even like the headphones that comes with it.  I wasn't sure before buying if it had random play mode but was extremely happy when I discovered it on the player.  I wish it had a clip but I can live without it.  So if you don't want to workout with your $300+ Ipod this is a great choice.

<Content>This mp3 player is great.  At first it was hard to operate, but now it is easy.  My headphones broke shortly after I got it, but we replaced them with some really cool ones from home.  I like the cord/necklace it comes with - it can hang around your neck.  It holds lots of songs and it is just really cool.  This is my first mp3 player.

<Title>Works, but marred by horrible usability problems
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Usability wise, this is one of the worst players I've seen.  The unit takes about 7 seconds to switch on, requiring you to keep the button pressed all that time. Once it turns on it goes through 3 screens before the actual display - and it starts in 'stop' mode, meaning you have to press again to get it to play. It also fails to remember which track was played last, which makes it useless for audiobooks. Turning it off is a similar process - first stop, then hold a button for 7 seconds to turn off. The buttons are difficult to press (they're not visible - you have to press the metallic ring in a certain direction), respond differently to short and long presses, which makes even changing the volume a chore, and if you hit record mode by mistake... it's probably better to just turn off the player. The company doesn't respond to tech support questions. It would be easy to issue a firmware fix - but I can't even tell if the device has this feature, the company never issued a fix and they won't comment on it, so my guess is it can't be fixed. It's got a very nice form factor, and with one day of usability testing would have been a 4 star product. As it is... it's not worth your money.
