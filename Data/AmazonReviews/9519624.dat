<Title>Excellent quality, great features
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Model: Creative Zen Nano Plus (1GB) I purchased this primarily for the features it provides and so far I am very satisfied with the quality and the features.  - Line-in recording. records in mp3 format (96, 128, 160 Kbps). It requires a smaller plug for the line-in and the included wire is very small, so recording from TV etc. might be problematic. But I guess you can buy a longer cable.  - FM radio and recording. Records in WAV, not sure why they would do that. No time-based recording. Recording FM will need the headphone cable plugged in, coz thats the antenna.  - softwareless transfer. So I can use it as a USB stick. U can also transfer the recorded track to your pc, without software, just copy-paste.

<Title>great player- no problems
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had one of these for 6 months now and it has held up to steady use and being knocked around in a backpack and in and out of my car. It works great, is light and small, easy to use. I love it. Triple A batteries last a long time in it and they are cheap too- no pesky recharging time.  My wife, who avoids electronic gadgets, wants one for Christmas.  If she's happy I'm happy so soon we'll have two. I don't get to be in the ipod clique, but I save money and have a player that does more, takes music from more sources, plays more types of files, and is just as easy to use, so I'm surviving. The controls: there are 2 volume buttons, a power/pause button, and a scroll wheel. I can hold it in one hand and handle all the controls with my thumb easily. Without reading the instructions it took me one minute to figure out the controls. Highly recommended.

<Title>Excellent!
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought the Zen Nano Plus for my 13 year old son. I am pleased to say it was an excellent choice, as it's very easy to load with music and to use the controls. The sound quality rivals the best of players. And most of all my son loves it. Some of his friends who have ipods even envy his player! Bravo to Creative for bringing us a great product at an affordable price!

<Title>Creative Zen Nano Plus is a bust
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered the Creative Zen Nano Plus, and it was a bust. Amazon.com had fantastic customer support on the returns, but the Creative help team was nonexistent. You are put on hold and then disconnected. The players would not turn on, so you are stuck with no help from the maker, nor able to listen to music. I will stick with better quality products like an IPOD.

<Title>It even grinds Coffee Beans!
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Nano Plus for Christmas and it is too cool.  I have already used all the features (except the line-in) and they all work great.  I can record all my favorite radio shows and make e-mailable podcasts right on the Nano.  Thanks to all the research I did on Amazon I helped my wife get me the perfect gift!!  I am not anti - iPod, but this player offers so much more.  I spent at least 2-3 hours in the Apple store talking with the rep. (who by the way was very helpful) he showed me all the features and went over the software and I went for about 3 weeks saying that I wanted an iPod until I did more research.  I learned that you can get so much more out of other players.  Based on my research I know that you get more for your money with this player.

<Title>Doesn't install easily, help nonexistant, manual uninformative
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This looks good on paper but:  None of my three computers at home recognize it (XP home SP2, XP Pro SP2) so I can't transfer files. I've tried installing CREATIVE's software but their software nor WMP 10 recognize this.   Play for Sure? Not in the least.  Check out the website? Not much help there. A few things to try that don't work. Look at the manual? Not much there. They don't even tell you how to use anything more than the most basics. Call support? Well its a toll call and they are only open when I am at work (9-6 central time M-F). Looks to me that they don't really want to help their customers.  I am a fairly advanced computer user and I am very dissapointed. I've check the USB ports, used multiple computers, and check the web. Four hours and I still can't hear a single song.   Stay away from this one. Even if it works for you, supporting a company with such poor customer support is a bad idea. No more CREATIVE for me.  (OH, and it comes in one fo those packages you have to destroy to open to returning to AMAZON is not an option unless you accespt a partial refund.)

<Title>Creatively lacking support
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Zen player with high hopes that were ultimately crushed by their technical support.  I am a pretty savvy, techno-geek but I met my match with the mp-3 player from Creative.  After experiencing set up problems, I contacted their tech. support.   I spoke to a friendly girl who seemed to be dazed by even the smallest technical problem which she was obviously enslaved to answer.  I asked to talk to a supervisor.  When I was told I would be contacted in 24 hours by a supervisor to clear the problem, I returned the product.  I never heard back from the girl's supervisor, nor was the problem ever resolved.

<Title>awesome and i love mine
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i-pod? whats that? this thing is the best MP3 player in its catagory. #1. its TINY TINY TINY ! #2. it plays all MP3 and WMA formats #3. if you get one of those HORRIBLE proteced CDs that SONY makes you can RIP it directly into the unit by using its built in analog audio input. Battery life is very good and the sound is truly excellent. I have not tried the build in voice recorder or FM tuner, I didnt buy it for those features. I should point out also that it does NOT come with a neck strap however it does come with an arm strap. You could use a neck strap if you have one because it has a hole for it. Only bad thing is the battery cover comes off a bit too easily so i just put a peice of tape on it JUST IN CASE !

<Title>sounds grate
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 so i am new to the game.It sounds grate after you mess with the EQ.The headphones they give you suck but after geting my sony ear buds(walfart$10)i realy like the thing.It was a little tricky at first to figer out how to down load my music.The player uses a drag and drop process.It may be me or windows but it would not sinck my playlist from windows sinck list.Every time i tried it would put songs from the same album in thier own folder.it only holds 30 folders.So if you have just a few songs from each album and more than 30 songs you have a problem.But once i figerd out what was going on it was all good.Thier software works good becuase it keeps all the songs as singls and you can make play lists with it.And with a simple click,drage,drop you have your music.I gave it a 4 becuase of the lack of instructions in the manaul.It just tells you how to turn the darn thing on and scroll thru folders.I do wish it was a 2GB player.But for my first MP3 it will do until I get the 30GB M-Vision.

<Title>Great Until It Quit After 13 Months
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned my Zen Nano Plus for 13 months before it stopped working.  The LCD will still light up for a few seconds after I try to power up, then it shuts down.  My computer won't recognize it, so I can't update firmware.  Since I'm 13 months out, I can't get any support from Creative, except for paying $13.  I'm going to buy a different, cheaper brand.  I dont expect things to last forever, but 13 months?  C'mon.

<Title>Bombproof
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Why WhY WHY do companies always discontinue their bombproof, proven and reliable products in favor of the latest, greatest and inherantly buggy?  Stupid move, Creative.  This player is phenomonal.  The Zen Stone Plus - it's presumed replacement - isn't even close.  Sigh.

<Title>creative labs is a bad company w/ bad product
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned this device for 5 months and it just stopped working... I went though all the proper channels for repair and was told they want at least $25.00 to "work" on my warranty repair. It turns out only parts are covered for a year and labor only for 3 months. This is NOT what I call standing behind your product.  DON'T BUY CREATIVE PRODUCTS! Not only are they poorly made, but Creative knows this and doesn't stand behind their own products.

<Title>Survived water
<Date>Mon Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my player for a little over year now, and I like it.   But what I want to tell you about is it's durability.   I have dropped my mp3player, and all the normal things to abuse it.   But two nights ago I dropped it in a cup of iced tea.    I got it out, got the battery out, and blew on both the player and battery it to dry them.   The music stored on it still played, and after one day of drying out, the radio works as well.  That's what I wanted to say.

<Title>A few more comments
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Others have described this unit fully, so I won't do so here.  Highlights are: (1) About the size of a pack of gum and comes with an arm-band carrier which is great for running (2) Has an FM radio and microphone built in (and a line-in jack) (3) Runs on an AAA battery (my sons' Ipods all died prematurely because of the rechargeable batteries which aren't replaceable)- for me it is easier to carry a few AAA batteries than a charger (4) An incredible number of settings and modes that are easy to access once you get used to the toggle-press switch (5) Extremely easy to drag and drop songs into organizing folders on the PC interface (6) Tiny display is amazingly informative, with song time, repeat mode, battery life, equalization setting, and song title all displayed when a song is playing (display changes when accessing other functions).  I have only one minor complaint, that is not documented: You are limited to 60 song folders (including the one or two folders that are built in).  You can set up more than that on the PC interface, but the player ignores them.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this about a year back to gift it to my brother... I guess he is using it regularly and is working fine.. I got it for a good price at that time and quality of this product is good too.. I transfered about 150 songs into it and listened to them.. it was a good quality sound and was very easy to use too.
