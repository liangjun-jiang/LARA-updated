<Content>I had a iRiver T10 1 GB MP3 Player and tossed it in frustration. I purchased this player (TrekStor i.Beat Organix FM 1 GB MP3 Player with FM Tuner) because it behaves like a flash drive - not dependent on Windows Media Player (you can use it, but don't have to.) I use it constantly. It is highly configurable, easy to figure out without the manual, has a long battery life and sounds great. It feels much nicer than the iRiver, the buttons are great. It supports many file formats: MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, ASF. Best of all it can use DRM but is not a slave to DRM. Next I'm buying the TREKSTOR 67136 Datastation Pocket x.u Portable 160GB Hard Drive & TREKSTOR 12GB USB-Stick CS-D Drive.

<Title>"Died" after finally getting it to work

<Content>I really wanted to like this player.  My favorite colors are in the red "family" and the color black, and this player looked sharp, "cute" and simple.  If only it performed as well.  At first it could not detect my computer (I have Windows Vista), so I feared compatibility issues, even though the box indicated it was Vista-ready. Once it finally recognized my laptop, I had to try and learn how to program the thing.  Although this was my first mp3 player, I didn't expect it to be that hard to use.  But I think the problem was simply that the player is defintitely not user-friendly.  I can't tell you how many times I had to revert to the manual to do just about anything.  I am not a stupid person by any means; I just found that the player is not very intuitive.  You basically have two different buttons to navigate with ("menu" and "mode"), but where you go depends on how LONG you press each button.  Pressing quickly brings you to one "place"; pressing a little longer, another.  Then once you get to this particular "sub-level", so to speak, you need to navigate THAT level to get to where you truly want to be.  I found it overly complicated and tedious.  On the plus side, the earphones are great (soundwise).  I have a "regular" pair of Sennheissers, and they can't be beat..however, I find earphone plugs to be rather uncomfortable and sometimes struggle to keep them in my ears.  That is a downside, to me.  Anyway..long story short: After spending hours figuring the player out and adding songs and programming the radio, the player suddenly decided to stop working.  Tsk..and just when I was thinking I might be able to live with the players idiosyncrasies.  So now the player is on its way back to Amazon, and I've barely had it for 24 hours.  I hope anyone else who decides to buy it has a better experience then I did.  As for me, if I've learned anything, it's actually that I probably need to get a "bigger" (i.e more memory) player, anyway. ;-)
