<Title>Nice for mp3 songs but locks up using Audible book format
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This unit is a nice mp3 player.  I bought it though to use it for audio books from audible.com.  I have no problem with using this for music but if I download an audio book it locks up.  I called RCA for assistance with this.  Their response was that I need a firmware upgrade.  The problem is that there is not firmware upgrade available. Of course I did ask when would be availabe and the reply was, we don't know.  I am returning this unit since RCA has no idea when a firmware update will be made avaiable.  Another problem was that I bought it from jlhwholesalers.com  even after I read a notice that their communication with customers was bad.  Well of course it's been a week and 4 emails to them and I still am unable to return my unit.  jlhwholesalers keeps telling me that they are waiting for a return authorization from a vendor.  I should have stuck with Amazon but they were out of stock.

<Title>OK for MP3s but Horrible for Audible
<Date>Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for something that plays Audible as well as MP3s but the Lyra is not it.  Do not buy this unit if you plan to use it for Audible files.  As far as MP3 player it is acceptable but I suspect there are far better units on the market that do both equally well.  Until I find that unit I will go back to my old Creative Zen for audible and my Oregon Scientific for music.

<Title>Exceeds expectations, acceptable mp3 player, RCA has done a great job
<Date>Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The day I brought this home, and installed the software, and updated the software at [...], I was listening to Audible books, podcasts, mp3 files from my cds, and fm radio stations.  I recorded 5 minutes from a FM radio station minutes after I took the player out of the box. I'm very satisfied with my RCA Lyra 512 mp3 player.    I chose this model over units made by Creative and the Ipod Shuffle.  When I brought the unit home, I installed the software on the included cd and followed the instructions to go to [...] to update the firmware on the player and the installed software.  It only took several minutes to download and install.  I installed Audible and chose the Thomson Lyra as the portable player.  The Audible software recognized the Lyra instantly, and since then my laptop and desktop have transferred Audible encrypted files to the Lyra without incident.  I currently have 240 mb of music files and the rest is given to podcasts, Audible files and an audiobook. Available space is shown as a pie chart in the Audible software Otherwise you can use Windows Explorer, a command prompt, any program since it's treated as a removable hard drive or the menu with the LCD screen will show you how much space is available.  Every morning I plug it in and add new daily broadcasts to the player.  When I'm on the bus, walking, waiting, or working out in the gym, I can listen to the current news. The data transfer rate using the USB 2.0 protocol is very fast.  I've transferred 300 mb of data in less then 1 minute.  The belt clip is durable, very strong.  It gives the impression of a lifetime of normal use.  I've dropped it twice from a height of 3 feet while it was playing and it didn't skip or pause. The battery compartment is removed with a coin, and the belt clip covers the battery compartment completely after it's snapped on.   LCD Screen - Bright blue, contrast can be adjusted in menu.  Shows duration of the file you're playing, file being played, and counts up.  Displays options used - shuffle, repeat all or once.  Shows bitware, file type, current equalizer setting (5 to choose from).  The text is large, clear and easy to read.  Can change the duration the bright screen lights up from 10 to 20 to 30 seconds or set it to 0.  Whenever you press one of the buttons the LCD screen lights up a eye pleasing blue, very helpful at night.    FM Tuner - I picked up 8 stations from my living room and recorded several minutes from 3 broadcasts.  By default it records FM radio at 128 bit, into mp3 files.  The audio quality on the playback on the desktop computer was excellent.  FM Tuner Recording - When I took the unit out of the box and started to record FM broadcasts on the empty drive, the screen said I had 8.40 hours of recording time.  You can set a timer to record an FM station for 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, or 120 minutes.  Or you can set it to "max" so it records to the maximum amount of space left.  The Creative models (MuVo micro, N-200), when I asked their customer service, records FM to .wav files at a lower bit rate than 128 bit presumably.  This unit records FM to .mp3 files at 128 bit, 64 bit, and 32 bit, your choice.  In the beginning the joystick was annoying to use, taking my right or left command for an "enter".  After a couple days, I learned to use it effectively, and the joystick seemed to function better.   Auto shut off feature - This is called the Power Saver feature and will automatically shut off the unit due to inactivity. 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and "off" are the options.  Size - Like holding a cigarette lighterr or matchbox in the palm of your hand.  Lighter then a roll of coins.  Case - Rubber rimmed, shock absorbent.  Has a hole in the top right for threading a neck holder through or any other holder.  Audio Quality - Indistinguishable from my portable cd player. The equalizer can make a big difference in the playback of some files.  Usual settings - rock, pop, jazz, flat, bass.  Included Headphones - Nice pair, wraps around your ears.  Battery Life - Up to 50 hours on a single AA battery.   Very convenient to have a AA battery requirement, spare ones are easy to find, and carrying a couple spares or using a recharable one is easy.  No fixed, 14 hour capacity rechargable batteries here.  Pop in a fresh one and you're good to go.  Accessories included - Durable belt clip, headphones, installation software, arm band, battery, easy to read instructions.  Stopwatch - Reliable, you can capture lap times, and review all the times in a list after pressing stop.  The stopwatch can count up to 99 hours presumably, and into days.   Menus - easy to navigate when you get in the habit of using the joystick.  From the menus you can see the profile version on the device, available space, contrast settings, duration of the LCD screen lighting up, repeat mode, shuffle mode, power saver feature.       Complaints.  I have 3.  I wish the joystick was replaced with buttons, I wish it had a voice recorder, and I wish it had a USB port covered by a cap like the Ipod Shuffle or the Creative Models, so I could have the option of not using the USB cable. In my view these are fairly minor complaints about a excellant mp3 player.  Before disconnecting the USB cord from the computer you must do 2 things - profile the devices contents, and click on "safely remove hardware" and then "stop" to stop the device.  When the popup window (In Windows XP) says it's safe to remove the device, it's safe.  The new firmware upgrade lets you make up to 50 folders with up to 8 sub folders, to a total of 520 songs.  It's available at [...].  (Choose RD 2215)   Of course, by the time this review is published, a portable player with more features, capacity and accessories will be on the market for the same price - or cheaper.  But I hope my review has provided some help.

<Title>Great Music, BAD BAD BAD for AUDIBLE
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this unit to use at the gym for music, the FM for the TV's, and the ability to use Audible files.  Music, FM...they work great.  HOWEVER...when selecting an Audible file, the unit LOCKS UP!  Solid, dead...see ya.  I spoke with RCA and they told me: "Yes, there's a problem...and right now we don't have a fix."  Oh well...Audible gave me an iPOD shuffle with my membership...guess I'll use that!

<Title>How can anybody design something like this?
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am an athlete and i decided to buy an MP3 player recently. This mp3 player had everything i wanted. But i got sick of it within 2 hours of trying to use it.  The joy stick was too rigid. I had to use all my strength to operate the player. It was hard to find music. I was scared to use the player while driving.  I wish RCA could have done some market research before even releasing the product to the market. I returned the product to Frys electronics within 12 hours of buying and bought Philips SA261 Solid State 512 MB MP3 Player instead. Easy operation , great looks and I am loving it.

<Title>Look somewhere else
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for my wife as a gift because she loves to work out with her mp3 player.  Control stick was hard to use; rarely the direction you move it was the direction shown.  HR monitor was completely off, showed a resting HR of ~160 BPM for a healthy adult.  Would not recommend this product to anyone looking to for an mp3 player to work out with.  Try the Zen Nano Plus or Sandisk players.  They have armbands and are much easier to use, especially when running.

<Title>Great for mp3, far superior to many. Sucks for audible.com
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been through a bunch of impossible players which don't allow folders. This is the sturdiest and best for recorded books EXCEPT audible.com (it simply won't go to "last position" playback for audible). I use other players for audible but THIS one is the balm for simply dragging and dropping album folders and book folders onto its flash drive. I've dropped mine dozens of times expecting it's gone and yet it always survives my abuse. Other players force you to interface with Windows Media Player etc. This one doesn't. It also has a non proprietary usb device AND and gets an impossible amount of usage from one AA battery. A dream boat of a unit.

<Title>Quit working after 5 uses
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had been very happy with this player until is just quit working in the middle of my run.  I turned it on, the sound was off - like it was coming from somewhere other than the ear buds.  Two minutes into the song, the sound is just a dull hum and that's the end of the story.  I tried to re-set it by taking the batteries out, no luck.  I tried to work with it through the computer, but the driver for it wouldn't even recognize it.  The manual is lacking, it says replace the battery and if that doesn't work pay to mail it back for repairs.  Thankfully I was able to return it for a full refund and now I'm searching for a more reliable player.  I had only used it about 5 times when this happened.  I'm very disappointed.

<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A decent buy for the price.  This is my 2nd Lyra and I hope this one lasts longer then the 1st which got wet from sweat/drizzle.  This one is supposed to be able to handle the moisture. Easy to use.  As of late, will not turn off--must remove battery to shut-off.  Maybe it is a low battery.

<Title>First was good, second unit died in 10 minutes
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>EDIT:  This was a 1-star rating - Amazon changed it between previw and save I think.  My wife was/is happy with our original unit.  She's been running with it for about a year, and it has worked well.  The only issue she has had was the headphone cable stripped out at the socket - something she blames on bad design.  I personally think that the mini "joystick" is really hard to use, something that has been expressed on these boards already.  However, the functions for this little player are really nice.  We purchased a new second unit.  Prior to doing so, I re-read some of the reviews here, but just didn't believe that the product could simply die after a few uses.  So I went ahead and purchased the unit anyway since our first has been reliable.  The second unit died within 10 minutes of my first loading of music.  First, I could not get the menu to come up on screen.  Next, the screen disappeared all together.  Third, the unit would not turn off (music kept playing).  Finally it just died and the PC won't even recognize that it is attached by the USB cord.   It's hard for me to give this a 1-star rating since my wife has enjoyed it.  However, it's a simple chip and flash drive.  There is no excuse for the thing to die in literally 10 minutes (I'm really not kidding about the time).  Since there are other stories about that here, the QC on these devices must be pretty horrid.  Buy at your own risk.
