<Title>Fine deisgn, but lacking by comparison to other budget players

<Content>I came late to the MP3-player revolution, but soon guzzled the Kool-Aid right out of the thermos. I love my music machine and use it in the car (via stereo adapter) and at work and around the house.   I'm still waiting for iPod prices to come down, but in the meantime I've been using, and greatly enjoying, two different SanDisk models.   This was the second one I bought, after I literally wore the other one into the ground -- I used it so much it literally deflated and melted into a small puddle.   The Sansa C240 has a great look -- thin, sleek and black it vaguely resembles an iPod but is just a fraction larger than Cricket lighter.   But, design aside, I still prefer the Sansa M230. That one is light but slightly pear-shaped, but it has significant advantages over the C240.   The M230 display will show you both how long a song has been playing and how much time the song has left, on the same screen. The C240 only shows the time playing.   Also, the M230 allows a smooth scan-forward or backtrack, whereas the C240 skips forward in units of about 10 seconds, which makes for clunky work when you're trying to scan to a particular part of a song.  The C240's display is slightly cooler, and allows you toggle onto a color image of the CD cover of the song playing, but features like that really don't do much for me.   Both units are cheap enough to be worth their cost, but the C240 is about three times the price of the M230. If you're looking for the best value in an almost-disposable player, you can hardly go wrong with the M230 which is currently a little over twenty bucks, or slightly more than the cost of a single CD.
