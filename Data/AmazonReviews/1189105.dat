<Content>I have an earlier model of this and I sincerely hope that it has been greatly improved upon since that one was made.  I took it to work and was shocked that the battery was low after 3 hours.  So much for using it on a long flight.  The headphone jack loosened and ultimately caused the unit to take up residence in a drawer.  It was a great device for the few hours that it ran per charge, but I expect longer battery life from something like this.

<Content>I love this little unit! You can hook it up to a tv, vcr, dvd,etc and record video directly to the 20 gigabyte internal hard drive. There is also a spot for a SD card for extra storage. After your shows are recorded, you simply hook it up to a pc and use Windows Explorer to download the video. You can also use the device as an extra 20 gig hard drive. It will sync with Windows media player if you prefer to go that route. It has a beautiful lcd screen and of course you can watch videos or play mp3s on the device itself. Unlike some competitors the volume is adequate for listening in a car. Recording is a one button affair, or you can also set it up to automatically record those late night movies. All in all, a good product!
