<Title>My first iPod...
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my iPod straight from Apple a couple days ago and all I can say is WOW!  The capacity is great and fit my needs perfectly.  The sound is absolutely amazing - it's as good as any portable CD player, if not better.  The look of the 2nd generation is very sleek and I'm digging the scratch-resistant metallic feel of it.  While some feel it's too small, I think it's perfect.  It fits in the hand perfectly and is very intuitive.  The menu design is easy to navigate.  I also like the fact you can "lock" the volume bar so it can't go past a certain point and that you can also lock the screen, turn of the backlight, and all the other functions this little gadget has.  All in all, this is one of the smartest buys I've made in recent years and will last me (hopefully) a few years.

<Title>One thing to 'whine' about
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Love the new nano, fantastic improvement over first-generation counterpart.  Only caveat: When I purchased it, every time I turned it on it emitted a high-pitched whine (the iPod itself, not the music or anything) that was REALLY grating on the ears, even when listening with the headphones on. I brought it to Apple and they replaced it, no questions asked... the new unit works just fine. I've heard this is not a common problem, but just so you know, listen for that whine.

<Title>Wonderul Design and Function
<Date>Wed Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a mini that I loved and replaced it with the first Nano. I sold that one to buy the new one and I'm pleased with my trade up. The unit's new case gives me the security I didn't have with the first gen. And the sound does appear to be improved - posibly due to the better design of the new earbuds.  I don't bemoan the lack of Fm radio, voice recording etc. since I bought this to listen to music, books and podcasts. I try to avoid the radio and if I want those other features, I'd buy something specifically for that.  All told - elegant design, simple function control and durability. Oh and the battery life is greatly improved.

<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new iPod nano rocks. I just got one, green, and it is so cool.  Pros: Light, fits anywhere, and it is COLORFUL. It holds a thousand songs and the battery lasts all day. Pictures look nice too. And the sound quality is great.  Cons: Doesn't play video but that doesn't really matter. Might be too small for some.

<Title>maybe if I could use it, my rating would be higher
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a beautiful product. But, if you're like me and have next to no computer savvy, be wary: iTunes 7 can be excruciatingly slow. I put in a CD more than a day ago to import to iTunes, and it is still not done. I have no idea what to do.  The iPod, which I named Lulu, was plugged into my computer for the first time yesterday, and ever since has been sporting the "do not disconnect" screen.  I have found no support phone numbers to call. If/when I figure out how to use this very pretty piece of technology, I may update my review. But as of now, I am hundreds of dollars poorer and have nothing to show for but red-faced frustration.

<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again. How many versions do you need???  First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again. Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!

<Title>The Mini Mini
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been reeling over when to buy a new ipod for a long time now. I have a 3rd generation 10gb ipod that I got for Xmas in '03 and it was immediately filled to the brim with music. I have probably used the thing every day since I've had it but the battery isn't what it used to be and I have to charge the thing for a good hour and a half during my work day just so I can listen to it for the last few hours. This has become an inconvenience for me considering that my job is extremely boring and the workplace is fairly loud and I find myself getting easily frustrated without music. The new nano commercial certainly is flashy and very persuasive. I want to point out that the click wheel does not glow up at all-I think that Apple falsely advertises that it does and that they should look into changing this misrepresentation. I am sure that they did this in the commercial for a greater effect but I can bet that people who haven't seen it in person and purchase this item online will be a little disappointed when receiving it.   Considering how fast I filled up my 10gb ipod I was torn between getting the new 30gb model with 3 times the amount of space I had before, or, the nano with considerable less space but a much longer battery life. It was a very tough decision but I went with the 4gb nano because of its long battery life. I know that Apple is going to continuously have new and improved models so I decided that the nano could hold me over until a 30gb model with a better battery life (for music and videos) and other improved features comes out.   The nano itself... I would say that I wasn't all that impressed at first sight of the nano, it looked different than the previous nano and very similar to the mini which I thought looked silly. My impression has totally changed considering the fact that I haven't been able to put the thing down since I got it last week. I can't stop holding it and marveling at how compact, light and sturdy it is (compared to the previous model). The screen is colorful and bright and I am happy with the resolution of the photos (albeit on a really small screen). The new headphones are an improvement since the previous ones didn't fit in my ears too well. I haven't noticed much of an improvement regarding the sound quality but I am extremely satisfied since these are more comfortable in the ears than the previous model, the cord is longer, and they also will not wind up together since they are separated by a handy little piece of rubber that you can adjust to your preference.  Some small gripes...I have noticed that the games tend to slow down at times, not really a big deal since these games get boring within the first 2 minutes of playing them. Transitioning from one screen to another isn't as smooth as on the other models--probably due to the fact that the nano is flash drive based. The click wheel isn't the most stable and certainly takes some getting used to. I have noticed that turning the backlight on and off isn't as easy as it used to be. On my older Ipod all I needed to do was to hold down the Menu button for a few seconds for the backlight to turn on. It isn't possible to do that anymore so you have to make sure that the backlight settings are turned on. I also would like to say that my previous model came with a white plug that you can put into the data outlet to protect the outlet from dust and other hazardous circumstances. I think that the little piece of plastic is essential to the life cycle of the ipod and it should be included with every Ipod model.   All in all I couldn't be more pleased with this item. I would definitely advise you to purchase a case that would shield the nano from everyday hazards. The new anodized aluminum casing should protect this item better than the previous models which were easily scratched. I will probably purchase a case from Otterbox when it becomes available because it appears that it will be the best protection available for this fragile investment. Hopefully I won't regret not getting the larger storage model but as of right now I am 100 percent satisfied with my new ipod 4gb nano. It has all that you really need in an mp3 player.

<Content>The product itelf seems to be fine. Shipping time was minimal. However the packing of the product was substandard. The box it arrived in was crushed on one corner due to no packing material around the product inside the box. The plastic case was therefore scratched on the outside. A little more care in packing the item might prevent damage in future orders.

<Title>Close to perfection
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>To hold this iPod is to be amazed. It is almost lighter than air - any thinner and it would slip through your hands. It is truly remarkable that something so lightweight, so small can do so much. My less than perfect rating is for the screen size and lack of firewire support. As I creep into my late 30s, I simply cannot read text that small anymore, and playing solitaire on that screen really hurts my eyes. The definition & brightness in the screen are truly remarkable, however. I truly miss the firewire iPods. On a Mac, synching was just faster w/ the firewire models - and if I'm on an older Mac that has USB 1.0 and FireWire, I would prefer firewire, but am stuck using USB. *sigh*  The small size means you can forget you have it in your pocket - so you should really have a case to protect it. I've talked to some folks who have accidentally left this in a pocket and then put it in the laundry. Adios ipod. Electronic components & water rarely make good dance partners.  I have more than enough audio (especially podcasts) to fill up one of the new 80GB video iPods, but I bought the new Nano for the Nike+ support - seems like a smart match - running/walking w/ an iPod that is so lightweight it doesn't bounce around and it has no moving parts to get rattled. I do like the huge numbers in the display when using the Nike+ adapter.  The sound is excellent. A definite upgrade from the Mini - even the center select button has matched color. This is a piece of futuretech - available to you now - and it works!

<Title>Nano is fantastic
<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had an ipod for 4 years. I have an original 5 gig Ipod and fell in love with it back in 2002. It still works great and battery life is still good. I was thinking of getting a new 30 gig ipod with video but received the 4 gig nano as a gift.  So far I love my nano. The size is just right, the screen is very bright and clear, and battery life is very good. The only thing I don't like is the headphones. I have never liked Ipod headphones but thought the new Nano headphones might change that, they didn't. For me they just don't fit well so sound fades away very easily. They also fall out easily when on a run or walk. I have a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones and when you match them up with the nano the sound quality is fantastic. For walks or runs I use a cheap pair of nike headphones that wrap around your ear.   I picked up the Nike + integration device and a pair of Nike + shoes to track runs and walks. For the price this is the best addition to your Nano if you like to walk/run with your nano. The shoes are a little expensive but not much higher than most shoes today. The adaptor integrates so easily anyone can use it. It provides a great way to track your workouts.   Overall, I love my Nano. For the features, Itunes integration, and many offered accessories for the Ipod, I'm not sure why anyone would buy anything but an Ipod. Good luck to the Zune, you'll need it.

<Title>Improved? Nano Won't fit my Dock/Speakers now!
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After exhausting research and sound testing, I purchased speakers, only recently, for the Nano (perhaps the best available portable speakers now, Altec-Lansing InMotion IM7) and the new improved, second generation Nano will not securely fit into the dock of these beautiful speakers! Why did Apple feel the need to move the docking and headphone jacks? Whatever happened to backwards compatability in electronics? The Nano will fit but  only if you don't use the supplied Nano adapter which holds it snug in it's dock. It will now have to sit loosely while docked and so there goes my portability with this system and lose one of it's many/best features that made the IM7 a solid choice over the Bose and the Apple Hi-Fi. I hope  Altec dsigns a new adapter for this generation Nano. I suppose I have to buy new Apple speakers/Dock made just for this unit. That is until the 3rd generation of Nano comes along that won't fit in the second generation designed speaker/dock accessories. What a joke! I am in the process of trying to cancel my order for the Nano before they engrave it. Originally I wanted the Sandisk Sansa e270 because it had more memory, bigger screen, will play video and pictures, not to mention FM radio and additional 2GB storage via SD memory disk and easy user battery change. It was also considerably cheaper. But... It would only play on my InMotion speakers by using the aux in cable... so I balked on the Sansa  opting for the Nano's docking ability instead. So much for that. Goodbye Nano, Hello Sansa.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sansa. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them.  I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected!  I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. (update 12/2006- found a case just like my other one, but this one is actually made for the 2nd generation nano! Fits perfectly!! Got it at Radio Shack. They allowed me to trade it in for the other one that actually fits.) I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs.  People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips! I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sansa. This new nano is a must have!

Sadly, it just didn't have the audio punch and unique size/shape of the 2nd gen Nano. So I, "Traded" my wife my super-shiny brand new iPod Video for her scratched-up 4GB Pink Nano 2nd gen, and I absolutely LOVE it. It's the perfect size, amazing battery life, crystal clear audio quality, and fits anywhere in my car. I am a guy and even my friends think the pink one looks cool haha! This thing is a classic.

<Title>Worst Purchase Ever!! 
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the Ipod Nano for Christmas last year. It has been nothing but trouble from the start. To begin with, I had to exchange it the first week I got it. The original Ipod I was given was not recognized by the computer so I could not charge it and I could not download any music. So then I exchanged it for a new one which is recognized by my computer. This one worked much better except that it would randomly choose not to play some of my songs. They will begin, but then suddenly stop and skip on to the next song. The songs play just fine on the computer and on cd. They simply do not want to play on my Ipod. The latest thing is that, in the last few months, my Ipod has started to freeze. I will go to select a song or just advance to the next song, and it will just freeze up. It won't play music and the screen won't advance. Since there is on/off switch and the battery is not removable, I simply have to wait for the battery to die and then recharge the Ipod before I can get it to work again. This is an awful product. My first advice is do not buy an Ipod. My second advice is do not buy anything that does not allow you to replace the battery and make sure  it has an on/off switch.

<Title>IPOD did not work
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My IPOD did not work, and I spent over 6 hours on the phone with Apple tech support, calling 6 different times at 45 min-1.5 hours each call, and the product still did not work properly.  It would randomly stop playing songs and would skip to other songs, when they would work fine on the computer or as a single file.   I am never buying a refurbished product from here again.

<Title>Very good mp3 player...for a while
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I recieved the 2nd Generation iPod Nano blue about 1 year ago. I loved the bright, beautiful color and aluminum coat. But, Apple claims that the coat is scratch resistant, but it's not. It's gotten scratches all over, and the aluminum is sort of easy to chip and dent, and I have barely even dropped it! The screen is very nice though with barely any scratches but after a few months, a black line appeared from one side of the screen to the other. I don't know why. I called the Apple company and said I needed to get a new one.  The sound quality is great, but Apple earbuds are really disappointing. My family had a total of 3 pairs of the "new" earbuds and one had barely ANY sound out of them, and the other 2 were staticy after a few days. No destruction was done to cause this. Apple needs to produce better earbuds.  From what I've seen, the iPod Nano isn't nearly as slow as iPod Videos. Unfortunately, the Nano still freezes sometimes.  Being the only second mp3 player I've had, it's pretty nice. But I recommend buying a case and ejecting it EVERY single time you disconnet it from your computer because I think not ejecting mine made the random black line on the screen.  4/5 stars

<Title>Horrible Experience and Bad Customer Service
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 4GB 2nd Generation Green Ipod Nano through Amazon from Ace Photo Digital. While the transaction went smoothly when I received my package it was damaged. In fact the box was completely battered. And not only that, THERE WAS NO IPOD INSIDE! So all I got was a battered box. I have called customer service at Ace Photo Digital many times and they have not responded. It has been well over a month and I have NOT received any money back, or an Ipod. I do not recommend buying from Ace Photo Digital. Their customer service is crappy and I have yet to hear back from them regarding how they are going to fix this matter.

<Title>Can be annoyingly glitchy, but still the best game in town
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 2ndGen 4Gb Nano has been glitchy from the day I bought it.  I have a list of things that were odd, frustrating or annoying but for times sake, I will say that it frequently freezes up forcing me to reset it; it sometimes locks itself [the lock icon is on the screen but the hold button is not in the hold position] forcing me to reset it; if it gets cold, the battery dies very quickly; the spin dial for volume and selection is so sensitive that I often have to make several attempts to adjust anything without over- or under-shooting the menu (or volume) I want.  All this said, it still sets the standard for MP3 listening, beats any known cellphone option for listening to music, and is quickly becoming a part of the fabric of our culture, as the cellphone did 10 years ago.  PROs: Sleek, lightweight, innovative design and technology CONs: Can be glitchy but once you accept that, very easy/simple to use.

<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this Ipod! It's a beautiful hot pink/Magenta color and has a ton of room on it. I am able to fit all of my favorite songs as well as a number of podcasts from my favorite radio show that I can listen to while I am at work. It's small, light, pretty and just a wonderful little device to have and so simple to use. I never leave the home without my pink Ipod and I can use it for 8 hours straight without it even losing half its battery power and I leave it plugged into my computer overnight so it is fully charged the next day. This is the PERFECT present for anyone. I highly recommend it!

<Content>when i first got my ipod...i loved it! it's pink...engraved...i saved up for a lonnnngggg time to buy it. my warrenty expired 2 weeks ago, and just the other night it shut itself off.  off as in, the buttons no longer work, my computer doesn't even recognize it's plugged-in-ness, and i'll i'm staring at is a dark, blank screen. i now have to drive 45 min away to cthe closist apple store only to hear them tell me that it's gonna be cheaper for me just to buy a new one. i searched the apple website extensively for an answer as to what could be wrong with my ipod.  it was never dropped or went anywhere near water.  after finding nothing in the pre-written help articles, i went to the message boards, hoping someone could give me an answer as to how to make it work again.  have i gotten an answer?  no.  but i have gotten a ton of other people saying that they have the same problem!

<Title>Big improvement.  Battery still a problem.
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall, this is a great improvement from the original nano.  Appearance-wise it is fantastic looking and performs on a "cleaner" level than its predecessor.  I have no problems with the performance of the actual product.  My complaint is that my battery is having the same type of problems that most other versions of the ipod have experience.  Short life (less than advertised anyway), fluctuations of power level, etc.  You would think that after this many variations on the model, Apple could fix this problem.  Still, it's not entirely noticeable except on long plane rides when my power runs out.  This is my only complaint, but a considerable one to take into mind.  Still, this is my favorite version of the ipod yet produced.

<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(This is my mom and dad's account, I'm really only 14, and named Kaylee) I have wanted an iPod for sooooo long. I saved my money and bought one myself, my parents did NOT pay for it. They color is even better than in the picture, which was a pleasant suprise. The earphones are really nice, not like the crapy ones all my friends have on their video and first generation nanos. The outside non-scratch is awesome. I got my iPod on Sept. 29 of 2006, (a friday) and left to go camping less than 4 hours later. Ofcourse I took my iPod with. We camped on DNR land in the middle of no where in our trailor. So I ran around, rode my dirtbike, climbed trees, and a whole lotta other stuff while carrying it in my pocket. I dropped it a few times, and it doesn't have a scratch!!!! The only bad thing is it's so small, and easy to loose. I recomend getting a screen cover though. But you really don't need a case to keep it safe, cuz that would just hide the color of your iPod. It has 4 great games on it, and stores a ton of photos. It loads super fast, and is easy to update. The color screen rocks to the fullest. It's definatly worth the money. Besides, it's a 4g which in my town niether Wal-Mart or Cosco carry, only 2g. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.

<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me.   I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.  The case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL.

<Title>Excellent iPod, my favorite so far.
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the new nanos. I don't think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I'd rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 stars

<Title>Ipod Mini ordeal
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought 2 ipods mini (one for me -blue- and one for my wife -green-)At 6 months the blue one completely died (apple sent me a new one without charge -great!)Six months later the battery died so I use the blue one as a hard disk or connected to a JBL device to play it.  My gentle wife gave me hers and a few weeks later I began having trouble with the battery again (nightmare). It says "out of power" even though I fully chraged it for hours. I found out that if i hit the device it would start again. As i do not care if i destroy this thing I will use it this way. I did not charge it 1000 times as Apple stated. I am getting a 4gb nano hoping that I will not live this again. If this happens again I will buy a radio and forget obout Apples ipod for good (cost to learn this lesson: US$700)

<Title>Absolutely the best mp3 player there is
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I tried many players, but this 2nd generation Apple iPod Nano is my favorit. The player is very small, the battery lasts very long, the screen is bright and there are practical functions for storing calendar, alarms, addresses. There are Games (I never need them), and I very like the clock that can be set to show different times of different locations. There is even a search function where you can search for music titles with a specific letter or even word. And there are so many third party products out there that are compatible with the iPods. Have you heard about that Zune from Mircrosoft? Probably not, well, forget it anyway, the iPod's are much better in any aspect.

<Title>Get a Creative, much easier to use
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the ipod nano this weekend at Best Buy. My reasons for buying it were mainly cosmetic: I liked the color and there are a lot of different accessories you can purchase for it. I got the nano home and installed itunes, THEN found out that you have to keep your entire music collection on your computer, so that the next time you plug the ipod into the computer, you don't lose your music on the player. First bad thing. I had transferred music from my old player onto my computer in order to transfer it onto the nano, but was up until 1 30 in the morning figuring this out, because the instruction that come with the nano are very limited. Second bad thing. The next morning I wanted to copy some cds onto my computer so I could put them onto the nano, but when I plugged the nano in, nothing would register as being plugged in. That was the last straw. I took the nano back and got a Creative Zen V Plus instead. The nano just isn't worth it. The Creative Zen V Plus has the same amount of storage, yet holds 2000 songs, as opposed to the nano which only holds 1000, and even then it doesn't really hold that amount. The Creative plays video clips, whereas the nano does not. And the Creative was $20 less than the nano. Bypass the ipod and go straight for the creative...you won't regret it.

It has a few glitches, like every once in a while it will have trouble fastforwarding or it will act funny for a second, then return to normal once I turn it on then off again, but overall, I couldn't really ask for a better product. All electronics pretty much have their glitches, but I feel good about my buying it. It is quality over quantity.

<Date>Fri Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>And his complaints have been kept to a strict, strict minimum.  I love the color (though I would prefer the blue one any day). It holds up to 1,000 songs (WMA-style, AAC-style and MP3-style. Possibly WMV-style, but I highly doubt the latter), has some games to play (I believe), and charges pretty fast.  I really like the wheel you use to turn the volume up or down, and to toggle through all the menus and such. It also has the time and date, and I believe that you can listen to the radio also. I-Tunes is what you would normally use to get music files and pictures onto this thing, and at first I was wary about using it, but it's awesome. You can burn a CD in 2.5 minutes, flat!  I would fully recommend this device.  There's little that you wouldn't like about it.   4.5 stars.

You can play games on it,have a calender, it holds up to 1,000 songs, you can 'lock' the volume so that it can't go past a certain point, you can rate each song, my friend has the pink (magenta)one and it's color is so vivid, it is very very light and thin, it has a scratch resetaint outer coating (unlike the first generation), apple has made some new earphones that are more comfortable, but if your picky(like me), you should probably get some new ones, there is only one con:ther is still no fm radio and the screen is kinda' tiny, but oter wise i think this is the best player out there!

<Title>Great value for the money.....
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>iPods certainly pay for themselves, especially with all the accessories available to listen to them in your car, home, etc.  At this price point, you can get a lot of music into a very small package that is easily affordable.  I use the Transpod system with mine in the car and the sound quality is better than a direct connection via a cassette system.  I also use it with a Denon stereo and docking station and have been happy with the sound quality.  While the sound of an iPod isn't quite that of a high quality recording, it is still very good.  I'm a musician and I'm happy with how it handles most types of music including classical music.  If you don't have a lot of money to buy albums, this is a good investment because you can use your family members or other people's music.  While I don't condone breaking copyright law, you certainly can "share" music if you want to with friends, relatives, etc.  If you are a young person, perhaps you can load some of dads albums for him and borrow his iPod!  This is a less expensive option than buying a lot of albums yourself.  All iPods are easy to use, but they do have a proprietary format.  If you go this route, you can record CDs no problem.  However, you can't use this as an mp3 player.  You are basically married to getting your music from iTunes or directly from CDs.  Some people find this a disadvantage.  It depends upon your needs.

This was a great decision, but the disadvantage to nano iPods is you can't download games or movies! I was really disappointed...well I knew anyways. You have to buy the A.C. adapter, which I was very PISSED because of this. iTunes is expensive the lady at best buy said you can only buy the songs and not burn them off a c.d. which...is a lie! I wish I would have gotten Zen Vision. I love my iPod though...haha im funny.No, don't  get me wrong I love my iPod.

<Title>WOW WOW WOW
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>WOW That's just about all I can say about the new Nano. I just got this nifty little thing this Christmas Morning, and I can already call myself an expert with it. Now, if that doen't tell you how easy to use this thing is, I don't know what will. There are so many things tha just WOW me, but mostly its the sound quality. This is my first Mp3 player ever, and i'm glad that I didn't just settle for the first generation. The sound on this thing is amazing. Talk about turning your whole life into a movie, complete with music. I just put the earbuds in my ears, turn up the volume, and tune out the world.  But, I have to say that the earbuds are a little bit uncomfertable. But, how can something be compleatly comfertable with things stuck into your ears? Also, iTunes was extreamly easy to use. It downloaded in about 5 or 10 minutes, and was ready to use right away. The result? Having music on my iPod only two hours after taking it our of the package. The only thing: there is really no instruction manual, not that you need one. I was able to just go and mess around in iTunes for about ten minutes and find out how to sync stuff into my iPod, but still. But, I didn't even read the ITUNES HELP thingy that they had, so that's probably why it took me so long to find out how to sync! :) I love that apple finally got a nano that comes in color. When I started shopping for an iPod, I consitered getting an iPod Mini because then I could get one in that light green, my favorite color. But, iPod minis die after about a year and a half of use, so I wanted something that would last me a while. Long story short: I went to the apple website and cames across their new 2nd gereration iPod Nanos, and put one of those on my Christmas Wishlists instantly.  To a kid like me, being able to chose your own color is the best thing next to slice bread. With all that peer preasure, it's fun to be able to show off your inner self with the color of your iPod. Overall, apple listened to everything that their customers said, and put everything that we wanted into a compleatly cool iPod. Oh, and one last thing: the 24 hour battery life is really cool, and the battery would probably last 10 or so hours if you were doing something other than listening to music (as most of us do). I LOVE MY NEW IPOD!!!!!

<Title>Best iPod Yet~Unmatched Mp3 Player
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received the Pink 2nd Gen 4GB Apple iPod Nano as a surprise gift. I'd long wished for this baby, and I couldn't be happier with it. It is beautiful and tough--seriously, when I'd played with my friends' first-gen Nanos I was terrified I was going to snap it in half. This iPod doesn't feel like a toy; its heavy enough to feel good and strong. Still, I keep it in a wallet because I'm paranoid like that.    PROS: ~4 GB is plenty of space for most people. I have 806 MB left over after putting most of my music library and 35 pictures on it. It is honestly PLENTY of space. ~Love the color choices. The choice of black or white in the first nano was a big dealbreaker for me. ~Pictures look great, you can have tons on there, you don't have to format them to put them on, just choose an iPhoto album or the whole dang library. ~Music plays beautifully, all the time. Expect nothing less of Apple. ~Album art showing up is a fun touch. ~Its in Color, which makes a huge difference. The screen is more lovely than any iPod i've ever seen, and better than any PDA too, for that matter. ~Lots of good options, like search, settings, extras, photos, music, etc.  ~Plenty of icons to let you know which settings you have on. ~Sleep timer! For an insomniac like me, I have to have music to go to sleep. Its great that I can set it to 30 minutes, put it on my Sleepy playlist, and I'm out, plus it'll automatically turn off after 30 minutes so that you don't have to worry about battery or get woken up by a sudden screamo song. ~Comes with good earphones. ~Tons of other pros. It is way cooler than I ever imagined.  CONS: ~You can't use the nano to delete songs. You have to upload it on to the computer and then delete the songs. ~It doesn't come with any exterior speakers, a dock, a user's manual, or an outlet charger. The only things in the box are the nano, headphones, a cord to connect it to the computer (which charges it and lets you put all the music on it) and a quickstart guide. You can only charge it using the computer and can only listen to it using the computer's speakers when it is plugged into the computer.   Overall, it is a beautiful and amazing machine. I would buy them for everyone I know. The perfect adorable little music device. Apple's done it again. I would recommend it to anyone who loves music.  UPDATE (01/07) Its been almost a month now, and the thing is WAYY cooler than you could possibly imagine. Yeah, there's no manual, but it is easy to figure out if you play with it a little. It just is made with a technology you can't match anywhere else. Lots of these reviews don't understand the technology that goes into every iPod...really, its incredible. I'm like....wow.

<Title>Works great, and it SURVIVED THE WASHING MACHINE!!!!
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Nano since January, and love everything about it.  I use it almost exclusively to listen to audio books, and have purchased small speakers (JBL Creature) and a car kit so I can listen just about anywhere.  Last night I accidentally put my Nano through the washing machine, and was horrified when I pulled it out of a jumbo load of sheets and towels.  It wouldn't turn on at all, and I had resigned myself to ordering  a new one.    After about half an hour, I got the idea to use my blow drier on it.  Voila -- the hearty little Nano perked up after about 5 minutes of drying, follewed by 30 minutes of rest.  All it then needed was a fresh charge to get it going again!!!  I love it all the more now!

<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't believe it doesn't come with a charger like the older ones did.  We all got Nanos for Christmas and I planned on selling our older 1st and 2nd generation iPods we got years ago, but....I have to keep the chargers so we can charge the Nanos without having to do so through the computer.  When I plugged my Nano into the computer, it didn't charge it.  Not sure what's up with that.  For the price of the thing, you'd think it would come with a charger.  Great if you're replacing an older iPod and have the necessary accessories.  Not great if it's your first one.

<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I always said that I wouldnt fall into the big ipod trend, but after getting a sandisc sansa for Christmas and having it freeze up right away for 10 hours (which i was warned about in adavance from people) I returned it and got the 4 gig pink nano. And I think Im starting to see why the world is falling in love with the ipod. Ive only had it for 2 days but so far I love it! The nano only comes with some quick start instructions but honesly, I figured out how to use it on my own in 15 or so mintes. And putting music on it has ben easy. All you do is transfer all your existing music on your computer into itunes and drag and drop what you want to your ipod.     Only one complaint so far....it did freeze up once yesterday. All I did though was press the reset button and it was back to normal in a minute. I guess thats just normal for these things to do? A worker at best buy said some players freeze up because of the music you put on it. But hopefully it wont do it again.  THE GOOD: - sleek design, very thin and light - Easy to use - Easy to load music onto - Great sound quality - Has games on it - can hold photos  THE BAD: -froze up once -??? there's not really anything bad about it, yet - I feel like it needs a protective case but I dont want to cover it up  All in all.....its worth the money

<Content>The sound quality is excellent. Charging and synchronizing with my iTunes library is automatic and easy. Two issues where Apple could do a bit more work are the controls and the earbuds. Because so many functions are combined in the touch wheel, it's easy to do something you didn't intend to do (e.g. switch to the menu when you're trying to adjust the volume) This is not a serious problem, and it gets easier to control the unit as you get accustomed to it. The earbuds don't stay in my ears very well when working out. I replaced them with a set of Sony noise canceling headphones.

<Content>Slick design. Very good battery life. The screen is bright and clear. Very easy to browse. However, the letters appeared on the screen are not quite crisp as expected. When a cassette adapter is used to connect the device to car stereos, or to a sound system using composite cables, the volume must be raised to near max position. For me, this is a drawback of most players lacking a line-out.

<Content>I use my nano every day. It's the best MP3 player of the four different models I've owned. It has great sound quality and is the perfect size and weight for exercising. I have an adapter and use it in my car daily for my commute- the battery life has been holding pretty close to the advertised 24 hours, as long as I don't mess with the games too much. It holds between 850-880 songs, and I get tons of comments on the color. It is very durable, I've dropped it a few times and I've carried it in my purse since September, and it has no scratches on the casing or screen.   The reason I rated it 4 stars is it freezes up occasionally and you can't manually put songs on it using your computer's folders- you HAVE to use Itunes to manage your music and create playlists. The music doesn't stay with the nano if you change anything on Itunes- I once accidentally deleted my playlists on Itunes, and when I plugged in my nano Itunes promptly deleted everything on the nano as well, and I had to start over from scratch. One other thing is it actually only holds 3.65 GB of songs, not quite 4GB.  Overall, I highly recommend the nano, it's perfect for everyday use and has plenty of great features that I feel outweigh the drawbacks.

<Content>i LOVE the new ipod. i'm 13 and i got it for xmas and it is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. my sister has the old nano and i have to say mine's looks cooler and has a brighter screen. i LOVE the new colors especially BLUE, the one i have. mine's is also tougher and doesn't scratch as easily as my sister's does. but i think you should still buy a case for it. its super small so i can take it to almost anywhere. its brilliant and costs less then the old nano too! the earphones still suck though. buy your own and save yourself the trouble.   i also don't get what some people say about itunes and that besides that and this other microsoft thing is the only way to get music besides downloading cds. me and all my friends have been using limewire the whole time and its EXCELLENT. its faster for downloading songs. of course i still mostly download cds so i won't waste time. xD lol but still you should try it. its at [...] and doesn't cost anything unless you wanna upgrade to pro, then it costs more money but you get more options.  but still this is an excellent ipod, BUY IT!!!!!!!! five stars and i would rate it even higher if i could!!!!!!!

<Title>Perfect size, lots of capacity
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own a 2 GIG iPod nano and bought two of the 4 GB nanos for Christmas gifts.  Obviously, I'm a satisfied customer and I particularly like that these units are not too large or too small.  This can be an issue when you are handling them and result in dropping them or not having something that fits comfortably in your pockets.  I use my iPod while commutting with the TransPod unit.  This is a nice combination and I was so impressed I wrote a review about that too.  In fact, this unit was even better than a direct connection via the tape cassette player, but I don't understand why.  I also have a docking station for my iPod and my girlfriend has the Logitech 50mm speaker system.  This speaker system works very well with her 4 GIG Nano and it's at a great price point.  I use my docking station to connect to my Denon stero.  This works well for newer albums, but I can hear the limitations inherent to this technology on some of my albums.  I'm a musician and quite fussy about sound quality.  I listen to all varieties of music including classical, jazz, rock and vocals.  I didn't expect a lot from iPod technology, but I've found that this unit is a great value with good sound quality for the applications I mentioned above.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase an iPod again and I particularly like that this one is large enough to put together lots of custom playlists for many settings.  This is useful because I can use these in my car, at home or in other places where I don't want to fuss with the menu systems.  This ability is also comes in handy for parties and romantic evenings.  This is not unique to the iPod, but if you are new to this technology it's definitely an advantage over a CD player.

Apple Corp. could have made it much easier to download information into it from their web site.  It seems to me they are more interested in selling you music than they are helping you understand how to use the nano.

<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I initially bought this for myself and loved everything about it except it didn't take long for me to run out of storage space. My taste in music (Jazz & Classical) is often comprised of extended works that exceed the necessary space that would be required to accomodate the average contemporary popular song. I decided the 80GB IPod would suit my purposes better in allowing me to contain a large portion of my extensive CD collection in one convenient device without having to be concerned with being so selective in my download choices. I gave the 4GB IPod to my wife (whose taste in music is a bit more 'Pop' oriented) and it wound up being perfect for her needs.

<Content>iPod Nano is sleek and cool, the menus are intuitive, the display bright and easy to read. However, beware: if you are serious about listening to your music, you will need to replace the supplied headphones as they are totally inadequate.

<Content>For such a small mp3 player, it is certainly packed with alot of extra features - including games, calendar, address book, stop watch, alarm, world clock and more.  With 4 GB of storage, you can store around 1,000 songs and alot of photos. You can even view your photos as a slideshow, complete with transitions. The click-wheel is intuitive and easy to use.   Battery-life has been improved (up to 24-hour playback now) from the 1st Generation Nanos and there is a handy on-screen battery indicator.  The all-aluminum body feels solid in your hand and does not get scratched easily.

<Title>Functional, fashionable, and overpriced.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The machine works as advertised, but I had underestimated the inconvenience of using a system that is incompatible with the rest of the audio world.  Apple uses its own format, which means that if you get a different computer or want to get a different brand of player you lose your music. The recipient of the gift also spends time at two parents' houses, and can only download iTunes at one and cannot synch in both.  This was solved by not putting iTunes on one of the computer and using the iPod like a flash drive (song files appear as hidden files), but it's inconvenient.  I understand they are trying to build a captive market and bow to the Gods at RIAA, but I wish there was an easier way.

<Title>IPOD review
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After comparing mp3 and ipod, we choose the IPOD Nano.  My 16 year old daughter has thoroughly enjoyed downloading her CDs and pictures.  The only problem is that this IPOD cannot download IPOD to IPOD like some mp3 players can.  The Nano has been relatively easy for my daughter to use, (what electronics isn't for teenagers).  I wasn't thrilled about purchasing it, but now I see how it can prevent losing of CDs and she can download only the songs she wants instead of having to purchase an entire CD, (99 cents per song vs. $16 plus for CDs).  Amazon was the cheapest when I comparisoned shopped.

<Title>product couldn't live up to the advertising.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We, as America's consumers, have to stop rewarding unscrupulous megacorporations from creating oligopolies from slick advertising.  Yes, the i-pod commercials and advertising are creative, impressive, and impossible to escape.  The actual product is overpriced, unreliable, and overrated.  I've had to buy I-pods for nephews and nieces, in order to maintain favorite uncle status, but there are some consistent problems, shared by MP3 players costing a fraction of the I-Pod retail price (I can compare because I get the cheaper ones for myself).  These devices are fragile, their hard drives easily become damaged with routine use.  Their batteries are characterized by planned obsolescence. For anyone who will use their i-pod daily, you won't be able to get a full two years use out of it before either the battery fails or the hard drive crashes.  Apple has dismally poor customer service.  If you don't believe me, go to their site, and try and find a customer service phone number.  Google on a few I-Pod topics and you will find an expanse of sites dedicated to disgruntled I-Pod customers.  You can get the same low quality with the cheapest line of MP3 players at a quarter of the price.  Or, you can get either more memory, or better looks, or more convenient controls, or better durability (you can't get it all in one package) with a number of i-pod competitors, still at less cost.

<Title>good but expensive
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is a great product, but there are other products in the market at a lower price with more features. Nevertheless the reason to buy an iPod is that in some senses Apple behaves like a monopoly. They have a very successful product that dominates the market, tied with the music store. Music that you buy on iTunes may or may not be usable in other devices. Apple also controls prices very tightly, without giving much leeway to retailers to discount the device.  Q: Why can't you see videos in this iPod? A: Because as a monopoly they select the features they want to include in the different products so that you have to buy more expensive stuff.  Why don't they include an FM tuner?

<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Form meets durability, meets looks, meets price, and even re-meets iPod mini(!) in this, the second incarnation of the iPod nano line. The colors (blue especially!) are beautiful and even more vibrant than those of the second-generation mini, not to mention the trademark nano color screen. Somehow, even with the new, stunning metal enclosure, the new nano is 0.01 inch thinner and 0.09 ounce lighter than the first. And the new price for the increased durability, battery life, and storage capacity hermetically seals the deal. A personal music player cannot possibly get more comprehensively.... NICE, than this. It's EXACTLY what the nano should have been all along.

<Title>New Nano - The REAL Review
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, I see there are a few reviews on the new Nano but they need some clarification on why the NEW Nano is the best MP3 player out there.  Below are the Pro's: Size - The Nano is sleek and thinner than previous with a new aluminum scratch resistant coating.  Sound Quality - This is a great improvement area. The sound is much deeper and crisp. If a tune you are listening to has bass, you can feel the bass and hear the separation from the other tones music tones.  Battery Life - Apple listened! A new high capacity battery has been added and can playback up to 24 hours of music, or 5 hours of photo slideshows.  Screen - For those of you who had screen issues with the previous Nano's screen, Apple has made the Nano's screen 40% brighter. Personally, I notice a slight difference but its not a feature to run out and buy the new Nano for.  Accessories - This is the category that separates the Nano from the competition. Accessories are a plenty for the new Nano. (like previous) You can buy them at your local Radio Shack, Circuit City or a Grocery Store. The options of accessories range from cases, GPS additions, armbands, headphones, FM Tuners, car adapters, travel kits and much more. Since the Nano is already established in the market, Accessories are a plenty.  The Cons are minor, but they need to be mentioned to help everyone make a conscious buying decision.  Headphones - Though they have been redesigned for comfort, they produce mediocre sound quality at best and do not project the quality of the music that the Nano can produce. In terms of comfort, they are a great improvement and stay in the ear better than the previous design.  FM or Satellite Tuner - Neither are included with the Nano and it would have been a nice option. I cannot believe people listed to "old fashioned" radio still that is why I would have liked to seen a Sirius satellite tuner added.  Price - This can be a PRO or a CON. For me, the price justifies everything you get from the cosmetic improvements right down the multitude of accessories that are available.   On the other end of the spectrum there are those that think for $199 you should be getting a 20 GB MP3 player. To that I say, go get a Creative or San Disk player and enjoy the number of quality issues you will experience. With the Nano and the ipod line as a whole, these issues are near non-existent  All and all, the new Nano is a plus and will continue to dominate the MP3 market. My predication is that the new ipod line as a whole will hold its ground just fine against the Microsoft Zune.

<Title>Out of the box review
<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have the 1st generation Nano & now this one.  Since this is an "out of the box review", my comments are referring strictly to that.    First, I don't notice a big difference in the display.  Second, since I use the Nano for running, I like the Apple iPod plastic "tubes" that (hopefully) keep moisture from the Nano.  Although every site that sells the tubes (pack of 5, ~$30 for a blue, green, white, pink & purple one) says they are only for 1st gen Nanos, they fit 2nd gen Nanos perfectly.  In fact, 2nd gen Nanos have an "edge" (I'm hip to these things since I'm clumsy & tend to hurt myself without really trying!) and the plastic tubes make that a non issue.    Of course, the colors of the tubes matter.  I bought the pink (translate MAGENTA) Nano and the white, pink & purple tubes look great.  I kind of like the green & blue tubes on my pink (MAGENTA) Nano, too, but you have to appreciate the neon/offsetting colors thing to do so.  LOL!    Anyway, don't let anyone dissuade you that you must buy a 2nd gen Nano cover.  The 1st gen ones work fine.

She seems to be really tickled with it and plans on exercising & jogging while listening to her own tunes!  The order was received very quick and the price beat or tied anywhere else we looked.

<Content>I never thought I'd need an IPod, but I got one because I can get an addaptor for my car tape player and it's easier to put stuff on an IPod then on a tape.  But now that I have one (and the IDog) I'm listening to music alot more and it's so great.  I also have some books on cds that I've put on it, and it's alot easier carring around the IPod nano then 3 cds per book.  And I love the fact that I could get a pink one, it makes it very distincivly mine (because most of my friends wouldn't be caught dead with something pink)

However, we are lucky enough to have an APPLE store nearby, made an appointment with a Tech who could not fix the IPOD, but the store was gracious enough to exchange it for a brand new one. Since then, all is well and the recipient is thoroughly enjoying it.

<Content>I was a newbie when it came to the iPod, and my husband bought this for me for Christmas/Birthday. I love the pink color. At first it was hard to navigate through the screens, but it didn't take long to get used to it. My only complaint are the earbuds, they totally suck. They don't stay in my ears and are really uncomfortable - I ended up buying a cheapie pair of headphones so I could go running without having to worry about them falling out. There is plenty of room to burn over 100+ CD's I have, and it's fun to make the playlists; also coming with the iTunes software makes setup and installation extremely easy.

<Title>I was an anti-iPod for a long time
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For quite awhile I was very much anti-iPod and would regularly spout off about how evil they were and how I would never own one.  Then I found my Rio broken after a few months due to a fall and the 2nd generation of Nanos being released and, more importantly, a PINK IPOD.  I was in love.  You see, pink, especially hot pink, is by far my favorite color.  I figured that they can't be that bad and now that I own it and I've used it I see exactly why people are drawn to the iPod, it's easy to use once you adjust to the wheel.  It makes an excellent microphone, preferably when you're alone.  All around I wouldn't say it's that terrible of a product and I am considering the iPhone when it comes out as a result of my iPod experience.

<Title>Verde Pod!
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my green iPod!  Ohh!  After not caring about them since they were developed I finally has a change of heart, and I'm ever so happy with my choice!  **Make SURE you specify whether your iPod is compatable for Windows based computers or Mac computers.  A pod wired for a Mac computer will NOT work for a Windows computer and vice versa.**  The only minor issue is that the earbuds may not *stay* in your ears! However, nobody said that you had to use earbuds, but if you do, there is a newer earbud with fitted rubber ends, and if you don't like earbuds, you can still use regular headphones. I do. :D  The second issue is the USB wire.  Sometimes it may have to be giggled a little so that it can be read by your computer.  Or, just contact an apple store (which can be found in places like Circuit City, etc.) for a new one.  And just for protection, especially for those of you who participate in rigorous activity, a protective case might be good to own, and Apple care should also be bought by EVERYBODY just in case your "little green thing" acts quirky. ;)[...]

<Title>Best mp3 Player (currently)
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I could not be happier with my nano.  I had just saved enough money to buy a 2gb 1st generation nano when apple came out with these.  The fact that you can get 4 gb for $200 is one of the main reasons I bought one; very other mp3 player at that time only had 2gb for $200.  There is nothing to complain about with these iPods.  The battery life is long enough for me, I've never run out of battery life completely.  The screen is so bright, I've used it as an impromptu flashlight.  I also like how you can store information like a schedule, and contacts in the nano, along with pictures and even make slideshows on your iPod.  I haven't really used those features, but they're nice in case someone does use those.  The sound quality is very good, and 4gb is a good amount of space.  I filled it easily, but probably wouldn't have been able to fill the 8gb.  In short, there's nothing to complain about the iPod nanos.  They are tiny, don't scratch at all (so it seems, since I've dropped mine about 50 times, and it has no scratches on it), are perfect for playing music, and really adorable.  The colors (especially the blue) are a nice change from the monochromatic 1st generation nanos.  So if you're looking for an mp3 player and don't really want video capabilities, BUY THIS.  It's the best one on the market right now.

<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My experience with IPod went ok for the first few months even though I hated the proprietary format that force you to convert all your mp3 and wma formats to apple format which is tedious, then suddenly the player stopped working 1 week after the warranty expired, so the store told me to take it to an apple store maybe they can help, after waiting 45 minutes to talk to one of the employees there (at the Genius Bar!!) the genius dude checked the player and told me it's a hard drive failure, and can't do anything about it but if I wanted I could get 10% off on my next IPod purchase however since I don't enjoy pain I bought a creative player instead which has more and better features than IPod less the hype..., when I was exiting the store a thought occurred to me that thank god my desktop and laptop at home were not apple products! And god bless Microsoft for saving the world after all from Apple tyranny and  Unix Vi .

<Title>The 4GB Nano Versus the Video models
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was torn as to which one I should buy, the video one or the Nano. The video model is not much more in price than this one and holds a lot more songs, but I thought it would be too big and bulky for the gym. I'm happy with this one, being that the size is perfect. I also don't really have a need to watch movies or TV shows on a portable device. The main reason for this purchase was for music, and with a capacity of 1,000 songs that is plenty enough for me.

<Title>A Great Introduction to iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 4GB Nano is perfect for those starting out in the iPod world. It has enough space and enough features to satisfy the "listen-at-work-and-while-commuting" crowd. It is also great while working out on a treadmill or elliptical exercise machine (with the optional armband holder). Buy a car adapter for commuting and play it through your car FM. The silver Nano is much more attractive for the adult crowd. After about a month, you're going to want to move up to the 30 or 80GB models just because video is so much neater.   The only real downside is that the earbuds are terrible. They slip, slide, and otherwise have a tendency to remove themselves from most human ears. Buy a good set of small folding headphones.

Ask a friend that is familiar with the downloading process for help. My husband was very happy with his iPod Nano when we finally figured it out!

<Title>IPOD
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Ipod works great-my 13 year old programmed it & loaded songs in about 30 minutes - it took a little longer to figure out the pictures! Of course it would have taken me longer as computers drive me nuts. He had no problem loading songs that we load on our RIO mp3(after a little work)! Yes I am a 52 year old that listens to some of the same tunes! He has no complaints & now has what everyone else has - kids!

<Title>Unsatisfactory Shipping of a Gift
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had a long and happy relationship with Amazon up until this transaction.  The item did not arrive until well after Christmas (actually more than 10 days after it was ordered).  I replaced the gift with another Nano which I purchased from another source.  Eventually the item arrived and I gifted another individual.    Communicating with your company through e-mails was extremely frustrating.  Even when I eventually spoke with a representative, the suggestion was just wait and see if the item shows up.  When I asked for a refund/credit, I was told that wasn't you policy.    This problem was caused primarily because you do not a allow customers to specifiy a carrier.  This is totally unsatisfactory to me as I live in an area where the Postal Service does not deliver to my street address.  This was also the case with my daughter for whom this item was intended.  Both UPS and FedEx deliver to street addresses.  If I had known, or been told that this item would be shipped by the postal service, I would have given a different address.    Overall I am very disappointed in your service and responses regarding the status of the shipping and tracking on this item.  For over ten days, all that showed up when I tracked it was that it had been picked up by the shipper.  Very unsatisfactory from my point of view.    In the future I will give a great deal of thought to ordering gifts from Amazon.

<Content>Unfortunately, this product froze on my daughter after three weeks of use.  Luckily, she let the battery run out and when she recharged, it unfroze.  We heard this happens often.  Also purchased one last year for my other daughter and we were 24 days too late past the warranty period to get it fixed.  She was away at school and it was exam time so no one did anything with it until after the holidays.  We can't send it anywhere and the Mac stores won't even look at it.  I'm out $189 and she's out an Ipod.  Sad

<Content>I recently purchased a G2 iPod nano and was disappointed with the quality of the new device. There is a reason why these are $50 cheaper than G1. The body is flimsy and there appears to be no improvement in battery life. In addition, the nano I purchased gets locked up and freezes for prolonged periods of time. I will be returning it.

<Content>before you buy one download Itunes, load all your CD's into it. Give iTunes a spin for a week or two. See if you are somebody that likes listening to music that way.  Then when you get your ipod you can just sync it and take it on the go.  One annoying habit of the ipod nano is for it to lock up if its banging around in your pocket too much. I though mine was broken!  Just press menu and the select dot to reset it and you are back in business! There should be a sticker on the box or something!

The earphones are useless. Expect to shell out some more bucks for some decent ones. The LCD shows a small icon of the Album Artwork. Waste to download that info if you can not see on the screen.

<Title>First Apple Product Ever
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a die hard PC user this is my first Apple product ever.  All my previous mp3 players had been non-ipods but I finally broke down and got a Nano b/c the price seemed right and I guess I am I lemming. Over all, I am fairly happy with it.  I was stunned at its lack of instruction manual ( Yes,  usually read the instruction manuals for things)but its plug and play-ness was such that I really didn't need much more than what was provided.  The headphones are not great as everyone has said but they are comparable with all the other headphones that you get with most mp3 players (I think).  I have a big problem with the fact that it seems difficult to turn off the device (it just goes to from play to pause then play to pause then FINALLY OFF). It has also frozen and I have only owned it less than a month.   Other people I know, have bought them and had them stop working within the first week. It is also kind of annoying b/c it doesn't fit into the nano dock for existing speaker devices b/c it is new.  (at least it doesn't fit in my KLH speaker ipod dock).  Keep all this in mind if you are going to buy this and get some sort of extended warranty if you are going to buy this b/c it is a pretty good mp3 player .

<Title>My first ipod
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I finally went ape for Apple. I had resisted purchasing ipods in the past due to the proprietary itunes site. I thought you could only put music in the nano that you bought on itunes.   I found out I was wrong and decided to give the nano a try as I am a runner and needed something light that I could also use for music while on vacation.  I felt the regular video ipod was too large to run with and that the constant jostling would break it. Other manufacturers hard drive based units had never lasted me long when used with sports activity.  I got my blue nano home and saw that it came with minimum accessories. A USB cable, a set of earbuds and essentially no manual. I knew this in advance, so I purchased it in a bundle with a carrying case suitable for running, and a wall charger. I charged it up and downloaded the manual and the itunes software from Apple's website. I can see why they don't include a disc, as the software is constantly updated. The pdf download manual was 60 pages long but you only need to read about a third of it.  I tried to use the nano without reading the manual and I was able to. I would recommend reading a few pages of the downloadable manual, however. I purchased about 20 songs from itunes at 99 cents each and it took me a bit of time to figure out how to transfer the tunes. Once I got the hang of it, I had loaded over 2 gigs from my music collection and created running, Rock/Pop, acoustic, electronic, and new age playlists.  The itunes software is slick. You can see the hottest tunes, search for specific tunes and downloading is easy. It really is a better way to get the music you want quickly. It works well for purchasing specific tracks and even has some free content, recommendations, and customer ratings of all songs and albums. I was impressed. I bought tracks from artists I had never heard of and discovered quickly due to the recommendations of others. It's nice to be able to preview a song and buy individual songs instead of a whole album. Many albums have only four good tunes on them.  The music sounds great on the nano. The click wheel takes some getting used to, but this is the first time I've used that control method on a player. Some of my other mp3 players have had better "on the run" controls that allowed easy use without looking at the screen, but I think I'll get used to this input method over time. By the way, this player gets really loud when turned all the way up (volume max can be set). My Samsung YP-T8 doesn't have this amount of volume. The Samsung has a bigger screen, and is better for viewing pictures. The small screen of the nano makes it a poor photo album device.  The tracks you purchase from itunes are downloaded as protected AAC files, which makes transfer to another non-Apple player a pain. Once I buy a file, I want to be able to do whatever I want with it. I had this same problem with Sony's ATRAC files. In the past, I purchased a file from Sony's store and it would not play on my Samsung player. There are workarounds for this, but it's still a pain. I'll have to save my purchased files to cd, then re-import them to itunes on my computer, changing the encoder to mp3, and then I'll be able to transfer them to my other mp3 player. I hope.  I made the nano decision partly based on peripherals and accessories. No other player line allows such access to third party accessories, although you have to make sure the product is compatible with the "2nd generation nano". I plan to buy an attachable speaker (JLAB Audio MiniBlaster) that will allow playback during running, lunch, etc. without wearing earbuds all the time.  One downside is cost. My Samsung YP-T8 came with a great case (paid $15.00 for my nano case) and it came with an AC charger (another $25.00 for the nano) and the 4 GB nano itself was $190, compared to the $100 I spent on the Samsung. The Samsung was only 1 GB though, which made it a poor buy overall. The nano screen size makes it less capable than the Samsung for picture viewing, but it's easy to fill these things up. I now wish I would have gotten the 8 GB nano.  Addendum 2/3/07 - I returned the blue 4gb nano and purchased the black 8gb model as I could tell I would need more space. I am now listening to several free podcasts a day in the car and have purchased an FM transmitter so I can listen to my black ipod in my car. Great device!  Bottom line: Sound and volume 5 stars Ease of adding music 4 stars itunes software 4.5 stars availability of accessories 5 stars price/value 3 stars coolness factor/color/design 5 stars AAC proprietary file issue for purchased songs 2 stars  Overall 4 stars

<Title>Good but with issues
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As with just about all technical products, I expect to have an issue or two. However, I can usually find a patch or an easy fix. This was not the case with this product but Apple does have a pain of a work around. My iPod Nano 2nd Generation is seen by my PC running Windows XP SP2 as an external drive with no problem. However, it is not found by iTunes. The work around involves stopping the iPod service and then connecting the iPod. Then you wait for the PC to find it as a drive. After that you start the iPod service again and run iTunes. I have to do this everytime that I want to put new music on my device. This is not very convenient at all. This is my first iPod and I'm not very impressed. I've had several other MP3 players in the past that have not given me anywhere near this amount of hassle to add and remove music from it.  However, the device itself is rather nice. The controls are easy to use and the sound quality from the provided earphones is decent, although I purchased a pair of Shure earbuds to help the situation anyway.

<Title>My Pod Blue is great
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a 30g video pod, which is lot of fun for waiting anywhere.  I just watch a video or movie  But I wanted a truly 'traveling iPod".  The toughest part I had was choosing the color.  I ended up with blue b/c I like silver, not the green and figured all the little girls would eat up the pink one.  So I have grown to know and love pod Blue.  I use my iPod mostly for music and Audiobooks,...especially that last one.  I'm a guadance counselor and take many trips on busses with students.  Besides work to get caught up on, I can "read" a book I've been meaning to forever.  There is a small quieting factor in which I dont hear the students quite so loudly and I think we're all happier when we get somewhere.  Right now, I have 25 books on my pod - everything from the Art of War, Zen and the ARt of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Tipping Point, 7 Habits for Highly Successful People and lots of mysteries, current and past.  Check out book titles at wwww.audible.com.  I think this is the invention that has affected a whole world, not just one generation or civilization.  It is an amazing product and has never given my any trouble.  I love it and would buy it again if I had to.

<Content>I had a 1st generation nano which I lost in a rental car (one of the low points of 2006). This replacement reflects true improvements in refinement, feel, looks and battery life. The case is tougher yet sophisticated. One of the best parts of the owning an iPod now is the tremendous amount of uses for it. I have bought into the Nike+ program and I am having a great time using music for running and some of the really cool training programs that you can now download.   Battery life is much improved and is essentially no longer an issue. I have never even gone below half of my battery life. This is a great new machine.

The ease of use, the functions, sound quality, the software, the size, the accessories, etc. This really is an incredible product for music, photo and personal information storage. And its just so much fun to accessorize with the plethora of Nano cases and such out there.    I do highly recommend getting a few cases that you trust are sturdy and multi functional to protect your Nano from damage and the elements. Happy Listening!

<Title>A great improvement over first generation
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cards on the table. This iPod replaced my first-generation Nano. That went back because of battery issues (get the two year replacement deal; you'd be stupid not to!). I loved the first one. I have an older computer, so I'm not interested in an iPod which can hold more than my computer's hard drive. I'm not a maniac audiophile, so I don't need crisp perfection in my music sound. A simple upgrade of headphones is fine with me.   That said, this iPod is a clear improvement over the first generation, which I loved. The screen is brighter and crisper, and the battery seems to last much longer. I like iTunes, and I've found that if I changed all my existing library from mp3 to AAC, I have much more space without losing that much sound quality. The 4 gb size is great. I'll never listen to a thousand songs in a row before re-docking. I can always switch songs in and out.  I do wish Apple would give me the option of removing games to increase space, but that's a very minor concern. I love the flash drive, and I don't think I'd consider an mp3 player with a built-in hard drive.  It floors me to realize that my first computer had about 20 megs of storage space, and this little guy has 4 gb.

<Content>About a year ago, I purchased a 2GB ipod nano, but found that it didn't contain enough memory for me. I decided I wanted 4GB, so I did a lot of research, mostly through cnet.com and customer reviews on amazon & other sites. I ended up purchasing the Sansa e260R (be aware this is a different operating system than the e260: the e260R is made to operate seamlessly w/Rhapsody, much as ipod does w/ itunes) which looks great on paper: the sansa has a voice recorder, fm radio, etc. I had the sansa for 1 day, and then exchanged it for the ipod nano. The nano is so much sleeker, lighter and elegant. The sansa is a lot heavier and the controls feel a little clunky. I didn't think the sound was as good either, and Rhapsody kept crashing on me. When something is a "standard" to which all others are compared, to me it makes more sense to get the "standard"; i.e., since all mp3 players are compared to the ipod, it makes sense to get the ipod (similar to many autos being compared to the Honda; yes, I drive a Honda, but I digress). I love the "search" feature available on the new nano, too. Plus, it's easy to travel with; when I went to Europe last fall, the ipod didn't need a special European adapter, as the charger adapts to the different electricity output. I love my nano, and I think itunes works pretty well; it has the greatest number of music and podcast choices. If you're looking for a great quality mp3, I highly recommend the 4GB ipod nano.

<Title>Great Device!!!! A review ex mini user
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>WELL, i just bought about a week ago the ipod nano colors. in blue.  ok so i bought my first mp3 player 2 years ago. and i chose an ipod mini 4gb, a greaaat! thing!! the best thing i could ever invest in!...and about 2 weeks ago i sold it. i gathered some more bucks and went all the way definately for the ipod nano color.  i always try to get the latest and hottest items. but i was never interested on the ipod nano, why? well it was really slim, and it looked fragil, a friend of mine bought the ipod nano as soon as it was released, and honestly i didnt like it at all, besides it was made of plastic, thou it looks elegant, and sophisticated, it looked fragil to me, and easy to scratch. so i thought, why to spend all that much for something that is almost the same, except for the color screen!!!.... so, a couple of months ago my sister bought the ipod video, and i was so tempted, but again!, why spending that much if i wont use the video feature!....ok so this friend of mine, offered me enough money for my ipod mini, and i thought it was a good deal since my investment would be about 30 dlls. i wasnt looking after selling it. but the warranty is a GREAT deal to me, and since i had my ipod mini since almost 2 years ago, so it had no more warranty, i sold it. and now it was time to chose....investing almost 100 dlls to get the ipod video 30gb...investing 30 dlls and getting the ipod nano or the nano colors.... ok so my ipod mini was a little bit bulky, and compared to nano, there's nothing else to say...and ipod video looks quite bulky compared again to nano, and since i wasnt interested on the video feature, ipod video was out. so between ipod nano and ipod color....my opinion? ipod color made of metal, just like minis so they dont get scratches that easy or at least they r less visible. but i was kind of bored of ipods with color ipod nano..white or black looks elegant and classy, but u gotta be more carefull. ipod color has memory flash ipod nano has hard disc i really dont care, since my ipod mini was as well hard disc and never failed, thou i dropped it accidentally a thousand times, and i excersice a lot and never had an issue. then i heard the nano 1st generation and second generation...thats what made up my mind....ipods come and go so fast that i definately wanted the latest, so i chose color coz its a 2nd generation. and in 6 months wont be as old as the nano 1st generation. first impression!!..... NO KIDDIN ME!!!,  my dad went to buy it, and he came back with nothing in his hands!!!....oh yeah! the whole package was INSIDE  his pocket! yeah in his pocket! I was like! no kiddin!, so tinny!! i opend it and as soon as i touched the ipod i thought it wasnt a real ipod!, is so tinny, at first i was against it, i didnt wanted such a small device (i know thats what old people think!) i was impressed! i thought it was really fragil! but hey as usual! you dont get to un-new something if you dont drop it! and guess what thats right! i opened it, it didnt even had songs in it and i dropped it!...nothing happened! and i said to my self! cool! im gonna like it! so far i like it and im learning to love it, thou i still dont love it as i loved my mini!.... i didnt have anyproblems with itunes or anything since i had what i needed already. id say,  to any NEW ipod user this will be the best thing ever! for ipod users, bah, isnt the last greatest thing ever. it does the same as my mini, but its of course lighter, and has "memory flash" and color screen. until 2 days ago i learned something good for the "color screen" and i started to upload the cover picture of the albums. i still dont know how to upload "my pictures" but anyways i wont since it has 4gb memory, and i rather having music than pics...so yeah compared to the mini its the same, but you can see in a tiny screen the album cover, the games are the same but in color. a new feature is a search feature, but it has a to z, but you have to use the wheel, to go from a to z, too much time, but a cool feature and ive used it. it also has a stopwatch, dunno remember if the mini had it, but i never used it if it did, and well the nano color has it, i havent use it thou..and it has sleeper, im sure the mini didnt have sleeper, it also has world clocks...and the secure feature, you can lock the screen. but ive had some trouble finding covers, or skins. there is something i dont remember what i guess a transmitter, a bluetooth or a fm transmitter...hmm...dont remember but it works in almost every ipod, including the nano buut it doesnt in ipod nano color...and the skins, the cheap ones are for nano, ive only found iskin, for ipod nano color, but they r kinda expensive right now. and the lanyard made for nanos, doesnt work on this nano color. so its way more expensive than the nano lanyard. i bought an iskin for ipod, coz it was on sale, and yeah doesnt fit exaclty with the nano color. the hold button, the jack, the usb connction, doesnt match perfectly but i extended the cuts, with scissors lol, just a little bit about 1mm or less. but hey its a 2nd generation.....whatever! lol!..... so here is my review i hope it helps. if you dnt have an ipod....buy this one is awesome! ipods are awesome!!! if you have a mini (and dont give a dime for size) and has warranty, keep the mini. unless u r buying the video. at least the video has a different feature that worths spending all that money. anyways i hope it helps! im happy with my new ipod, no problems so far. and easy to handle. good luck

<Title>Apple vs Creative and SanDisk
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We recently purchased the Apple 4GB nano, and a 20GB Creative Zen(both units cost the same)as gifts to replace the Sandisk MP3 players the kids had previously.  We have quite an extensive library already on our computer using Windows Media Player.  The Zen took 5 minutes to add all the songs onto the unit, without any special programing or downloads required.  The Ipod could do nothing until Apple itunes was loaded onto the computer-  since we are on dial-up- this would have taken 2 hours to download- so we made the trip to my husbands office to use the cable connection- and downloaded the itunes, as well as the users manual to a flash drive.  Once we got the computer all set- we had to convert all the songs that she wanted from windows media player over to the itunes program-  this took an additional 2 hours.  Now that we finally have everything we need- my daughter enjoys it- although she says its no bigger deal than the Sandisk that was replaced.  The unit froze up twice in the 2 months that she has had it- so I am glad we copied the users manual- as it was a quick fix to unfreeze the unit.

<Title>GREAT NEW IPOD!!!  
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>G'day pplz,  I bought this iPod about a week bak, n even now i am still finding new things about it!!! this iPod is deffiently worth $200 odd buks. the screen is nice as quality, n the click wheel is easy to use. i previously had a blue iPod mini, n i wanted to get a newer model one, n even after 2 n a half years of using the mini, it barely had any scratches!!! seriously, i rekon this is the one of the best cases on any iPod models!! the normal one gets scratched WAY too easily, but this aliminium case is really good on not absorbing scratches, but more hiding em.   In conclusion, its a really nice iPos, with all the bells n whistles, and at a fair dinkum price too. plus, the one year warranty makes u hav peace of mind for up to one year, or if u buy thr extended warranty then its up to 2 year!!!

<Title>Buy an iPod...It's GREAT!!!!
<Date>Sat Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Pink 4GB Nano for my 20 year old daughter for Christmas.  I chose to buy it from Amazon because I always have GREAT luck with my purchases, plus the price was $10.00 less, no taxes, & no S&H.  That's what finally sold me.  No going into parking lots with insane people who have got to buy their Christmas Presents as they swear and threaten your life for a parking space.   I had bought the 1 GB at THE biggest Electronic Store all over America.  Three Weeks later, they put out the same Silver Nano "2nd Generation" with 2 GBs!!!!  I had a FIT!  I called the store I bought it from and they basically told me too bad I bought it "just before" it was rereleased with 2GBs instead of 1GB at the price of $149.00.  I then called Apple on two seperate occasions asking THEM if they could return the iPod and give me the 2 GB one seeing that they KNEW they were rereleasing the same iPod with double the space 250 songs verses 500 songs.  I told them I once had a store and as small as it was I made sure my customers were happy.  The Apple Exec I was speaking told me "Tuff" and hung up on me.  I finally went to another store in their chain and told them the off button didn't work (it really was coming on when it was locked).  Because I had bought their $20.00 insurance, the Assistant Manager told me it was my LUCKY DAY!!!  They were going to return my defective iPod and did I know that a "2nd Generation" iPod had been released 3 weeks after I bought the 1GB nano I had?  Well, I was thrilled, but I thought I would NEVER fill 500 songs onto the new one.  I DID fill it and was sorry I didn't buy the 4GB.           When my wonderful sweet daughter saw and heard what a great toy this was, she wanted one.  Her Birthday is January 13th so my husband and I decided that we were going to buy her the 4 GB from AMAZON!! Let me tell you, I think that this iPod is the best gift my daughter has ever received.  It was sent to our house in about 4-5 days.  It was packed securly (the order I had right before that one had been ripped so anyone could have reached in and removed the items), and I do think that if iPod released a 3rd Generation with more space in 3 weeks, that Amazon would have taken care of it without a fuss.  Thank you for always letting me fulfill my addiction of books at such low prices.  And PLEASE do NOT start charging for S&H or you will lose a lot of your customer base.  It is GREAT to sit in my warm home and go to Amazon and buy presents.  I am also disabled so waiting for my gifts to come  to my home is a God Send! Thank You, Karen the Avid Reader

<Content>The iPod Nano is an excellent value for the money, and it is so easy to use.  The earbuds are great quality, I've used them for hours at a time.  The EQ function is impressive.  Battery lasts a long time.  This was my first mp3 player, and I look forward to getting an 8gb version as I have quickly run out of gb's.  iTunes is alot of hype, and the download games don't run on nano, the fine light print advises you of this usually after you get one.  Get the best and only cry once!

<Title>Somewhat overrated
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>PCWorld gave this a 90 in terms of sound.  The specs do not tell you everything and how they're even weighting this is messed up.  The new Nano has a very lean sound, with slightly deemphasized bass and emphasized highs.  That 3dB of imbalance has to be an upward slope from bottom to top.  You can indeed hear a 3dB deviation of that kind in such a trend.  One of the other reviewers said "If the bass is in the music, you'll here it."  That is almost always what apologists say about a component that is not doing the low-end justice.  "Well that music just doesn't have enough bass."  B.S.  Most music should have reasonably present lows.  Even stupid people know when a piece ought not to have any, and that previous statement is implying people who think the said component is bass-shy are stupid.  Even if they were, that wouldn't matter.  And they (we're) not.  The highs and mids on the Nano also lack the refinement and delicacy of the new 30GB iPod.  Didn't PCWorld rate that one as lower?  The only problem I had with the 30GB's sound was an overly warm, rounded quality...at least until the headphone amp was overdriven to the point of nonlinearity (relationship between frequency response and dynamic range), in which case it became brittle on top.  The Nano, in contrast, was never lacking in hardness in the highs unless it was turned down...not from the absolute volume, but the relative volume of the particular song.  This was not a symptom of overdriving the HP amp, but rather the sound being so low as to make this unrefined-quality imperceptible.  In this way, it often reminded me of a cheap computer soundcard.  Yet it is also true that many flash drives fall short of even this categorization.  The 30GB model also had far superior stereo separation and low-end extension.  Overall the HD iPod sounded far better than the Nano.  The Nano may be more neutral in the mids, but I'd say overall they're about the same amount of neutrality, just a different variety of it and different "quality" of those frequencies (e.g. the lack of delicacy).  The HD models are very inviting when you first start listening to them.  The Nano just isn't.  Thus, it needs to be paired with a warm, slightly bass emphasized, very open sounding headphone.  The Archos 104 also had a lean sound, but did separation much better, too.  I found the Sansa e260 to have extremely good bass, but very congested stereo separation and a tendency to become tinny (a non-linearity problem) in the highs when the HP amp was overdriven.  While the Sansa was less transparent than all the others, I did find its tonal balance and texturing to be more compelling and accurate to the original material, possibly the reason I kept cranking it up and messing up the HP amp performance on the top end.  Goldfrapp's second album's synths and vocal processing sound more "right" to me than the other players can pull off.  But the e260 could also be gritty, murky, and spatially far too narrow at times.  The Phillips GoGear 30GB just plain sucked.  Bad interface.  Bad sound.  Avoid.  For the most part you're left simply having to admit that the iPod Nano doesn't have some of the sonic defects of some of its competitors, but I cannot rule out the Creative products as being superior.  They certainly are in terms of separation.  That is something that measured specs will indeed inform you on.  All the Creative products do that well, but I cannot yet speak from first hand experience on the Zen V Plus's overall sound.  For the price of this iPod, you could get one with twice the storage.  Apple itself has become rather arrogant.  They don't even include a software disk with their iPods anymore.  If you're not already using iTunes or don't have a broadband connection active at that very moment, they don't want to even bother with you.  After all, if you're that lame to be using Windows or visiting your parents out in the country where they can't get broadband, why would you be buying a hip Apple product?  Most Apple users couldn't find their way around either the inside of a computer or their OS configuration & processes screens.  As someone who's used Final Cut extensively and use to tutor on OSX computers, I can tell you Apple has its share of problems.  There's a reason why Avid is still the standard.  I find those new Apple commercials to be utter jokes.  From a functional and aesthetic standpoint, I also find the iPod Nano to be too thin.  It should be shorter and thicker.  In that format, the HP amp and battery could have been improved.  There's just no utility to this shape.  I constantly feel like I'm going to break it in half.  It looks and works like it was made by and for small feminine hands.  I have average to slightly-below average size hands for a 5'10" Caucasian male and the design is clearly more to look at than to use.  What makes Apple think having a long, flat, rectangular object in your pocket with corners is a good idea?  I also cannot stand their interface.  After you do anything, you'd better put that hold button on immediately.  The touch wheels are far too sensitive.  I'd say a good 25% of the time you are either making menu mistakes or taking great pains to prevent them.  And even though I have used iPods before, I have blasted my ears at least twice from this touch-wheel.    Other issues: Works only with iTunes.  No microSD slot and no replaceable battery, though only the Sansa does.  When the battery finally needs replacing (possibly only 9 months later if you use it frequently) it will cost about $50 & two weeks, and you will not get your iPod back with the music on it.  There's no Mass Storage Mode for getting music onto it and you can't copy music off the unit, god forbid you should lose any original recordings on your computer.  Video, FM tuners, and voice recorders are extras, in my opinion, and don't really count against Apple.  However, comparable Creative Labs products with twice the space for the price certainly aren't hurt by including them.  So there you go.  Knowledge is power, and sometimes that power can simply come in the form of the courage to possibly buck a trend.

<Content>I know iPods are supposed to be the best. But, I think they just rip you off. Sure, you get some games, it's thin and slick. My sis got a CREATIVE ZEN 5 gigs for less money. Like a $[...] less. Her ZEN can play more songs, has a built in radio, and you can put a background on it. The iPods "is the best" beacause of the brand "apple". Sure, your friends may laugh at you because your "unapple" is fat or small. They won't laugh at you when you show what it can do. Trust me. You can find something much better and less expansive. I am mad at myself for getting this iPod. (it has a bad manual too)

<Title>Exclusive and loyal Sony consumer no more.
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was originally searching for any other player, but something produced by the hated apple computer corporation.  Soon I just kept reading about how good it was, and how it was actually the best.  So I gave in and decided I wanted an 8GB green Ipod Nano.  Problem was there was no such product.  Furthermore, it has no video capabilities; the Sansa does.  So I just decided to buy a green Ipod Nano with 4GB, the only one produced.  I got it home, the sound was awesome; unlike my brother's Sony MP3 player.  The Itunes downloads are of slightly better quality than those ripped from cd's, plus scratches don't transfer over too well.  I was afraid the Itunes program would slow down my computer, but it didn't.  Using it was a little confusing at first, but I managed through it.  I never thought Apple produced software would work so well on windows.  The included headphones absolutely suck, I prefer my old Sony headphones way more.  Trust me, just cuz headphones are expensive it doesn't make them great.  My $20 Sony (MDR-W08) headphones have so far been the best.  The only thing that damage them are my brothers.  Furthermore, for some reason my Ipod seems to freeze.  It has no restart or power button.  The thing to do is press the middle (select) button, and the menu button at the same time, that restarts it. Otherwise just enjoy!  I'm glad I chose this to be my first mp3 player.  Beware though, at 99 cents, Itunes can get expensive.  Especially considering this Ipod fits about 1000 songs.
