<Title>once again terribly disappointed
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This was sent from Nextar as a replacement for a defective MacVision MP3 I ordered for my daughter, it took 3 weeks to send in the original(they don't return calls in 48 hours as their voicemail states) and then it took another 3 weeks for them to get me a replacement(which was a step down in price and options from the one it was replacing).  For about a week this player worked and then it started to do the same things the original did(would not play a full song and then goes into a starting 'loop').  I would not buy another product from this company.

<Title>it's OK
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I paid only 30.99 for nextar 512mb mp3 player. (I think the reason was that this product is discontinued..) That is almost same price as the usb memory stick. So far I don't have any problem with it. And it also supports multi-language. The design is not so great but the price  and the sound quality is OK.

<Title>well worth the money
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This really is a great little mp3 player. I had one of these for when I worked outside and I loved it. The sound quality was great. It takes a triple A battery which gives you 6 to 7 hours of music. The only real drawback is the directions. They suck!! However if you go to there site and you stay with it you will figure it out. Once you do that the mp3 player is a whiz to operate and you can't go wrong for the money. Mine was stolen but I'm fixing to buy another.

<Title>Very hard to use
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this as a Christmas gift. I found it extremely hard to use. Cueing or skipping songs is easy enough, but hitting the "mode" key is very awkward. I can't store it in my pocket or bag because the "power" key will inevitably get hit. I went through 3 batteries in 2 weeks. Even the directions (on CD and in writing) are very confusing. At first, I thought I couldn't use it with Mac OS.  On the plus side, I had no problem loading songs onto it or getting them off (with Mac OSX). The backlight is easy on the eyes.   This is basically a gussied-up flash drive, which is fine. I'm not looking for something that plays vidoes. However, it shouldn't be so hard to play a  podcast or some tunes. On the whole, I'm disappointed.

<Title>Great Alternative to the iPod shuffle.
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I personally know that iPods break really easy, and shouldn't be used by a kid. Exspecially because of the cost. But I think this small fits-in-your-palm Mp3 player is a great alternative to an iPod shuffle, better yet, this one has a screen!  Mine right now is holding over a hundred songs, and is about 1/3 full. SO I estimate it can hold close to 300 songs, depending on size. It is extremely easy to use, though the main key can get hit really easily and inturupt a song. To load a song, all you have to do is go through Windows Media Player and Sync, or right click on the song and press send to USB drive (then the appropriate number according to your computer).   The only draw backs to this MP3 player is that you can only have one main folder with all your songs in the folder, and have to scan one by one through each to get to the desired song. And some songs don't appear with their real name, a lot of the songs I loaded (about 10) appear with the name, YPS or YPT with weird symbols, and I don't know how to correct that.

<Title>Good product at cheaper price
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this MP3 as it is easy to load music and play. The quality of sound is also good. However it takes me few days to understand choosing different music folder to play the music. Hence it would be better if manufacturer can provide more details in catalog for the easiness of users.

<Title>One Huge Flaw
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This really isn't bad for $30.  However, it has one major flaw:  it continually stops while playing.  This is not caused by accidentally hitting the power button (if you use the 'lock' feature, deliberately hitting the power button won't work until you unlock).  This is not caused by playing protected MP3s.  It seems to be worse in the cold and when it's first started, and jiggling the thing seems to be the trigger.  On the other hand, it's $30, and if you mostly plan to use it while sitting still, it's adequate.  I didn't find it particularly difficult to use (it worked well with my MusicMatch software).  However, having bought it as a cheap 'just to get me by' player, I've become fed-up with the stopping and I'm buying a different player.

<Title>John Ellick's MP3
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So far so good! I bought it for $19.99. It was easy downloading music.Took a bit to figure out the mode settings, but the more you mess with them the bigger chance for failure. The sound quality is great and so far it's well worth the money. I just hope it holds up for awhile. I bought a different mp4 player from ebay that died in a week of use. If I get a year out of this one I'll be a happy camper. I like the AAA battery power supply, (no frills  is better sometimes.) Buy it, if it breaks it's cheap enough to replace! Don't take it jogging it's fragile!
