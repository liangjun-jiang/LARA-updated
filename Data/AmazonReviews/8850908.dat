<Title>Nice little device
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Samsung YP-F1 1 gb mp3 player is a small, but useful little player.  The display is easy-to-read, it has a built-in clip for easy mounting on your person, and it is one of the very few players that still supports the Mass Storage Device protocol, meaning that you can drag-and-drop files on it as though it was a little hard drive (my favorite part, as I can't stand most of the sync programs).    Sound quality is good, even with the included headphones, and the controls are intuitive.  The only real drawback that I have found is that the battery life is not what was advertised.  I tend to get three to four hours before it needs to be recharged; less if I have it plugged into the car stereo.

<Title>All about the Samsung YP-F1Z
<Date>Mon May 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'd like to start off this review by saying: I throughly enjoy my Samsung YP-F1Z mp3 player.  There are a few problems with this device that I have found, and I ordered them in their importance to me.  1) Battery Life - Battery Life isn't 10 hours, I would estimate, with near constant usage, the battery life on this mp3 player is closer to 6 hours.  2) Cost of accessories - With this model, I had believed that Samsung was planning to allow for various different accessories for it, you can by bits and pieces for it (MP3->USB Cable, faceplates, etc) but they are extremely over priced.  For example, on Samsung's website, the price for a different colored faceplate is outrageous, its like $30+.  The USB cable is ~$20.  The plastic faceplate is essentially the size of two US quarters, and it costs $30+ to get a new one?  c'mon. . .  3) Buttons - The buttons on this device feel "cheap" sorry I can't describe it better than that, but they are made of plastic, and don't feel very solid when using the controls.  4) FM Radio - The FM Radio is a great thing to have, but it can be a little aggrivating, moving an inch or two can make all the difference in the world with the fm radio signals.  The things I like about this MP3 player:  1) The size - The size is probably the biggest selling point of this device, an excellent size for something to take to the gym, or to run with.  2) Memory - 1gb is a good size of memory to have, while it isn't the most memory out there, 1 gig is enough to make me happy.  3) Display - While very simple, the display is clear, and easy to read.  4) FM Radio - This MP3 player has an FM radio built in, very nice to have, especially at gyms where they broadcast tv audio over fm bands.

<Title>Great for the gym
<Date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using a Samsng YP-F1 since last Christmas 2005.  As others have mentioned, its greatest attribute is size.  I clip it to my shorts or slip it in a pocket and would never know it is there if it weren't for the music.  This is a vast improvement over armbands, etc.  Ipod may hold more songs, but it seems large and bulky in comparison.  The stock earbuds are of high quality.  I tried others, include some high end Koss buds, but come back to the stock items.  Using i-tunes for music management works very well.  The only down-side I have found so far is that the only way to recharge the battery is with the usb cable that plugs into a computer.  My primary computer is a lap-top, which hybernates after 30 minutes, and the USB port goes down with it.  I don't like to leave the laptop on for hours just to charge the mp3 player, so I'm looking for an alternative 4.5 to 5 volt charger....maybe Radio Shack....

<Title>50/50 GREAT PLAYER, BAD Playsforsure
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I tend to have the smallest and most 'workout compatible' players available.  This is the GREATEST WORKOUT player I have ever owned.  It is perfect for working out, clips on anything, light and has all the features needed... but it claims to be playsforsure enabled, but after sending this unit back to be fixed 3 times it has come back to me 3 times and has not worked!  FRUSTRATION is an understatement.  Not only have I gone without a player when I workout, I have had to sit on the phone and pay shipping back to Samsung.  Again, GREAT player for MP3s only... BAD player if you are interested in playsforsure.  If you have not heard or do not use playsforsure... this is the best EVER... basically netflix for music, but unlimited rentals!!!

<Title>Great Player with a Bad Battery
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you like to run or workout, this player is AWESOME! As other reviewers have expressed, it's so light that you can barely feel it on and you don't have anything dangling on your arm. 1GB for me is more than enough, but this may be a negative for some else.  Ok, so my biggest complaint is the awful battery and it's a battery charged through USB. I much would have preferred 2 AA batteries, it's more convenient....you only get about 3 o 4 hours on each charge.  One last complaint, the interchangeable faceplates are ridiculously expensive! C'mon Samsung, this little MP3 is expensive enough don't be greedy!  Other than that, the sound is awesome, the earbuds are a litte uncomfortable on the ear but on the whole they are good.  I'd definitely recommend this mp3 player, there was no way I was going to buy an Ipod just to look cool!

<Title>Battery/buttons dead after a year
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nice unit at first.    + Slim, light, great sound.  - Combination volume/control button on the side stopped working so unable to manipulate menus, and battery holds about 1 hr charge after 1 year of intermittent use.
