<Title>A Great Product
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm checking out some of the reviews here, and have decided to post my *complete* thoughts on this topic.   First off I'd like to say that it doesn't matter if the iPod is black or white.    Second:    Alot of people here seem to be angry about the "freezing black apple screen".  It can be frustrating.  If, however, you depress the center button and menu button at the same time for about five seconds the iPod will reset it self (this process requires about three minutes to complete).  My songs have never been lost when this happened.  I'd also like to note that I've had this iPod for 14 months now and use it from 4 to 10 hours in a day, every day.  I'd again like to note that I bought a rubber case for my iPod 14 months ago as well.     It has only frozen about 4 or 5 times, which has only cost me about twenty minutes of silence in 14 months.      Some of these reviews speak of the low quality of this product, like saying it has crashed, or is now completely useless, or apple is an impossible company to deal with (this I agree with), or the procuct is over-hyped, or... well this is just a montage of thoughts and quotes.       I am very happy with this product and I expect it to work for at least 3 more years, but I'll never know because It's practically filled up and will have to move on to a much larger allotment of space. I have about 3 gigs left.  At 160 kbps I have 10,419 songs I have 152 songs that are over twenty minutes long, some album sides burnt to CD then ripped to my iPod.  This is a product to take advantage of people, while It's still around.  I bought mine new for $400 dollars, I just saw a 5 Gig on sale at the mall for $189 dollars thats half price with TWELVE TIMES LESS SPACE!!!! A rip off if I've ever seen one, especially when you can buy the 60 gig on this site for considerably less than I bought mine for.   I do not work for apple of amazon email me for more details  buyers.

<Title>Awesome...
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been an iPod user since I bought a 5gb way back in '02, and they just keep getting better!  I have owned a 60GB white 5th gen iPod for several months now, and I'm very very pleased with it.  I use it for upwards of three hours a day, since I not only have all my music on it, but lots of TV shows, podcasts and audibooks.  I also recently bought the AV connection kit, and use that to watch my TV shows from the iPod on my TV  Things I like about it: * Easy to use and look good * Excellent sound quality if you encode your music at a high bitrate and use a decent set of headphones * Plays TV programs on my TV with surprisingly good quality * iTunes is awesome - probably my prime reason for sticking with the iPod * Podcast support is wonderful - I look forward to new episodes every time I use the iPod (I'm a Scott Sigler junkie too)  Things I don't like so much: * Poor battery life if using the backlight * 60GB ain't enough for me now, but that's not the iPods fault..

<Title>Great music player, Video an added bonus.
<Date>Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unfortunately my 4G iPod photo that I was very happy with was lost/stolen.  This led me to buy the 5G video product soon after it was released.  I bought it as a music player first and foremost, with the video as an after thought, assuming I would rarely if ever use it.  After 5 weeks of ownership, I am very pleased. - Considering the 60GB size, I was happy that this was still smaller and lighter than the 30GB 4G.  - I have been nervous about the screen scratching and have been looking for a better case than what was in the package...but so far not even a minor scratch. - Had no expectations for the video, but the quality is excellent considering the screen size.  Watched an episode of Lost on a plane (irony) and found after taking a moment for my eyes to adjust to the size, that it was really easy to see and the size posed no problems.  It's been fun to download some free trailers and so forth...but still overall, the video seems like something I will only use in the air. - Sound seems slightly better than the 4G, but I do not have a great ear, so it's barely noticeable.  Battery life is definately a concern if you plan on using it for video, but the 40% more batter life for the 60GB versus the 30GB was worth the additional $ to me.  The exclusion of the AC charger is dissapointing and would pose a problem for those who travel without a laptop.  Thankfully, I didn't lose that on my old one, so I'm set, but others should take note.  Well, I wish I didn't lose my 4G and could have waited for a few more upgrades in the product, but considering my expectations I am a happy camper.  As the title says, a great music player, with massive storage and good sound, with the added bonus of a quality video playback device with a vivid picture making up for the size of the screen.

<Title>Apple Service is woeful
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm looking at this jazzy 60 GB iPod with Video Playback, but I have a problem.  About 16 months ago, I bought a 40 GB Wheel iPod and loved it. But just over a year after buying it I had difficulty in getting the iPod to charge. So I paid Apple $65 for the battery replacement service and sent my iPod off. Nearly three weeks passed, without hearing anything from Apple, so I called Apple Customer Service. After waiting on the telephone for 25 minutes I got a customer service rep who, after finding my record, reported that there was nothing wrong with the battery, but there was a hardware problem, and that in order to get it fixed, I would have to pay $265.  "It would be cheaper to buy a new one," my customer service rep said.  So naturally, I thought about upgrading to the new Video apple. But I have a problem:  what do I do with the piece of junk that my first iPod turned into?  And there is an additional potential problem: what happens if I spring for $400 for the upgraded Apple, and THAT turns into a piece of junk?  The lesson learned (the tough way) is this:  Apple turns out junk and then doesn't stand behind its product.  The iPod is a nifty creation, but if it doesn't work for more than a year, it isn't worth a damn. And if Apple itself doesn't stand behind their products, then one has to wonder whether buying an Apple product is a wise investment. From my experience, Apple is more concerned with its profit margins then supporting the products it does produce.

<Title>Great Music and Video , AWFUL BATTERY
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the IPOD this week.  The music, photos, videos are great but there is one draw back.  The 20 hour music playback time is a bunch of garbage.  I did the test where the backlight was on maybe 10 seconds at the most, had the hold switch on and had the playlist on repeat until the battery died.  It died after 8 hours.  I called support and he said 10 - 12 hours is the norm.  I said the advertisement claims up to 20 hours and he said well i don't know about that. I now have to test if the video will last 2 - 3 hours as they claim.  Not sure how they can get away with this deceptive advertising.

<Title>Looks good on the outside
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Beauty is in the eye of the eye of the beholder so if you like the astethics and beautiful video screen technology, you will love this.  I have an IPOD Video 30 Gig bought right before Christmas 2005.    If you are like me and like simplicity, relatively bug free software (I can live with minor bugs and expect a few), and ease of use, then this is an overpriced duckling.  I have tried to get this to work on my Windows XP and my Windows 2000 operating systems with no luck.  The interface hangs indefinitely.  I have patience, having no children and not much else to do, so if it ever did decide to "unhang" I'd be here ready to use the loading of media software.  But it doesn't wish to be compatible with any of my Windows operating systems.   I am a stockholder of AAPL and wish it to make me lots of money.  But I'm more beholden to good technology than increased shareholder value and this, my dear reader, is a POS.  The screen of the IPOD always seems to read "Do not disconnect" no matter what I do.  It doesn't like to turn off.  I can't load anything easily.    If I were to design this, I'd want a cableless interface where the USB connection pops out from the unit and plugs directly into the computer.  Of course the software would work with all standard operating systems...duh.   I never got far enough to see if the file structure supported multiple sub directories.  If not, that would be very important to me.  It should function like a normal hard drive fur chrissakes.    Anyway, I'm going to wait for their customer service complaints to go down and to get an later version.  It's not the smartest thing to buy the first version of software or hardware kits.    Not recommeded.

<Title>Scratch Prone Display, Expensive Accessories Needed
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have to say, I was all for the new 5G iPod until I started getting into making the portable device usable in various settings. Apple is killing their customer base by turning a highly priced $400 portable music device into a $600 item by gouging customers for every single accessory needed - even splitting up the wall charger and the cable needed to connect the charger to the iPod ($60 to charge your iPod through an outlet)!  The screen scratches, even with a soft cloth.  You will have to buy a screen cover of some sort right away. The class scratches easier than even the most fragile coated sunglasses I have ever owned.  Why can't they just use the same scratch resistant glass everyone uses on PDA screens?  Here's a break down of what I've spent so far on my $400 iPod:  $400 - 60 Gig 5G Ipod Video (comes with a usb cable and worthless earbud headphones that will have to be replaced. $30 - usb power adapter (allows the iPod usb cable to charge the iPod. No usb cable provided, so you'll have to use the one that was provided for your computer synching (a pain, I know). $30 - usb cable for the usb power adapter $40 - universal dock for my home stereo $30 - usb cable for my universal dock (none provided with the dock) $22 - 1/8" mini headphone to RCA cable for connecting to my home stereo (Monster Cable brand, could have gone cheaper for basic Radio Shack cables) $20 - 1/8" mini to 1/8" mini cable for connecting the iPod to my car stereo or other speaker systems (Monster Cable). $20 - for the cheapest rubber protective sleeve offered to keep the HIGHLY scratch prone screen from scratching.  This turns a $400 item into a $592 item.  If you want the remote for the dock or any other accessories, the dollar figure continues to grow. In my opinion, if you haven't already heavily invested in the iPod, go another route. There are a plethora of other portable media devices out there that give you much more bang for your buck.  From companies that actually have the customers needs and best interest in mind. And besides, you'll be cool and unique and not like every other conformist out there (yes, I am one of those conformists, but learn from me).   If this review was helpful to you, please click on "yes". Thank you kindly.

<Title>Well worth the Price!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have just gotten the white iPod Video 60gb for Christmas and I am amazed! It is surprisingly easy to put photos and videos on it, contradicting what I have heard so far. But if I were you, I would buy a case that protects the iPod and the delicate screen. I recommend the InvisibleSHIELD. Here is the link: http://thinkdifferentstore.com/product_info.php/products_id/1431         The graphics and the quality are exceptional for such a small device. But a word of caution, the battery drains faster.

<Title>This is a great digital music player!
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great music player.  It work well.  It is also easy to use.  I have news for you.  When the iPod says do not diconnect you have to go to iTunes and eject the iPod.  Read the Adobe iPod features guide to learn more about that stuff.(It comes on the installation CD.)  I recently had the Creative Zen Portable Media Center.  I didn't even have it for a year and it broke.  It might have been defective.  Though this iPod is smaller and lighter.  They pretty much do the same thing.  If you want a small music player, a photo viewer, and a video player get the iPod Video 60GB.  It is the 5th generation of the iPod.

<Title>L-O-V-E my iPod, love my hubby for getting me an iPod!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I couldn't decide if I wanted the Nano or to bite the bullet, and get the new iPod video ($400 is pretty spendy).  Well, hubby surprised me with the 60 gig iPod video.  Everything about the iPod is beautiful, right down to that packaging.  The video quality is UNREAL.  The sound quality is bright, crisp, and I can hear things in songs that I've never heard before.  I highly recommend a case for the iPod, to protect from scratching (I chose a pretty pink leather one).  I've been using the iTunes software for about a year for downloading music, so I'm pretty familiar with it, but a first time iTunes/iPod user should have no problems using this.  I plan on investing in a docking station for work and an adapter for my car very soon.  This item is a MUST for any music lover.

<Title>I bought one as a gift , then caved and got one for me!
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I must say -- I was a holdover and didn't own an iPod.  I wasn't big on the security rights limitations on iPod music -- which is kindof freaky.  Recently though, I bought one as a christmas gift and of course part of the gift was organizing her music...Wow...it was easy to upload music but loading 120CDs took a while but iTunes recognized most of the CDs and labeled them for me.  All in all, the CDs used up 10 gig or about 1/3 of her 30gig iPod.  In the process of doing this, I came to realize what I'd been missing ... organization.  iPod makes it tremendously simple to organize, sort, find All your music...so I got one too! only I got myself the 60gig option as mine had to be bigger (I am an avid photographer and plan to move pictures from my camera, and I'll also use it as a portable hard drive).  Two things I noticed after I held both units, the 60 gig iPod is twice as thick as the 30gig -- something that the sites don't really tell.  So if you want shiek thin, get the 30gig and if you want cavernous storage get the 60gig...hehe I've always wanted to use the word cavernous in a sentence :-).  Two, the battery lasts 16 hours on the 30gig and 20hours on the 60gig.  I also downloaded a Podcast just to see how it would work...wow, the screen has some very high resolution and everything looks really sharp with very smooth playback.  David Hasselhoff of Knight Rider looks a bit anachronistic against the shiek white of the iPod.  Hats off to you Dave, was a big fan of the show as a kid and now its the first video on my iPod. I should've downloaded Galactica -- not a ton of choices out there for TV but I'm sure that will change soon.  I also played the Podcast on the computer and its not as sharp although pretty good quality -- I definitely think they're made to be viewed in the iPod.  Download from the site for a 45minute episode over broadband was slow about 2mins but download to the iPod from my computer was pretty fast 10-20 seconds -- not as speedy as music but then again its video.  Ok but then I discovered Podcasts...basically you go into iTunes and you can subscribe to news shows, comedy shows, sports shows all for free!  There's a gazillion free newsvideos etc out there. Example, I love Meet the Press -- I can watch it whenever I want.  If you love sports, there are tons of sports related podcasts etc.  Its great!  I think this 5th generation is amazing.  If you own an older model...I think they're awesome and I'd upgrade. I have the white iPod and I'm enjoying the music that was buried in CDs at the back of my TV armoir for years. I hear black looks cooler...but that it shows scratches easier (don't know).  So there you have it, hope it helps guys.  Of note, I own a pair of Shure headphones and I must say...whencombined with iPod, I can hear nuances to music that I didn't know where there!  Amazing sound.   Got both (and the Shure) from Amazon -- shipping was fast and everything looked great.

<Title>Please Read This BEFORE BUYING
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>To start off, this is overall a very good product, but there are a few setbacks that need to be considered before buying. Here are some pros and cons:    Pros: -Simple to use. Like most products made by Apple, the IPods interface is very user friendly with the simple click wheel for navigation. Uploading music and Synchronizing Photos is also very easy to do with the Itunes software. Working with video is another story (explained in cons).  -Size. While the 60gb model is not quite on the small end, it does pack lots of features for its size. Apple was able to fit 60gb worth of space into an IPod, which is actually smaller than the original IPod. Not bad.  -Clear video playback (if you can get it to work)  -Battery Life. The 60gb model comes with a bigger battery than the 30gb, giving it very good battery life. For playing music, I can leave it running all day and still be at half charge. For watching videos, I can manage to get all the way through Lord of The Rings before the battery dies.    Cons: -Screen. The Screen on the IPod sucks. It is so bad that if you rub your finger along the screen, it will put in scratches. On a normal IPod, this wouldn't be bad, but if you want to watch videos, scratches on the screen distort the image. If you are going to buy this you NEED a hard case that completely covers the screen, or one of the sticky screen protectors.  -Video Playback. In that area, Apple has tried very hard to limit you. The problem is that the videos need to be in MPEG4 format with a size of 320x240. You can buy nicely formatted shows off Itunes Music Store for a price, but that would add up fast. You can put your own videos on, but since Itunes is not a video converter, you need a 3rd party program. The only one I found that works is Videora IPod converter, but even this takes an expert to convert it the right way. If you are good with computers and have a lot of patience, then you can get most any movie on (even DVD movies). However, most people who buy this IPod never manage to get movies to work. Keep that in mind if the video feature is one of the main reasons you are looking at this item in the first place.    Overall, however, this is a very nice product. I have enjoyed many hours of use and continue to enjoy it. The cons it has need to be taken into consideration, and so do the other options out there for Portable Video Players. These include the Creative Zen Vision, the Archos AV500 Mobile DVR, the Sony PSP and others. Look into all of this before buying the IPod.
