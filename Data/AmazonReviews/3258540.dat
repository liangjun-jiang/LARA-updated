<Title>Don't buy. Waste of time.

<Content>HDD Read error when opened the box. I searched the internet and found it hapened to many others (I made a mistake not searching about the prodcut before purchase). No resolution was suggested. I packed it back and shipped it for refund.

<Title>You get what you pay for...

<Content>When I first purchased my Coby MP3 player, I was very satisfied.  I would have happily given it a "5".  It worked wonderfully.  I have had it for about 3 or 4 months now and am starting to have many technical and other problems.  First, my battery lasts about 1 hour when the player is fully charged.  Second, I have a lot of trouble getting the screen sensors to register.  In other words I have to push on the screen many times before it registers what I want as far as switching songs or turning down the volume.  It often changes screens without my asking it to.  Right now, I can not get the player off of  the radio and continue to get error messages.  Additionally, I purchased one for my 17-year-old son.  His broke within one week.  He put it in his pocket and the heat caused the screen to go black.  He is not rough on his electronics.

<Title>AWESOME Alternative to an iPod!
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3 player because there was no way that I was going to fork over $200+ on an iPod with 1/10th the space.  Also, I have a lot of music files in .ogg format, and I was ecstatic that this player supported them!  It's also very easy to use - I didn't even need the manual to figure out how to set it up!  How it works: Plug & Play - it comes with driver software, but Win XP and newer versions of Mac (OS X+) will automatically install it and recognize it as a USB drive.  From there it's just drag & drop files from your computer to your player!  It supports .mp3, .wma, .ogg, and .wav files, but not .mp4 (iTunes), so you'll need a file converter if you so wish.  It has 20GB of space for songs and other files - I use it in place of a USB drive for some of my classes at school.  It works perfectly!   Appearance:  It's super sleek, perfect size for a cell phone pocket if I want to take it on the go, easy menu navigation, and excellent play quality.  Unlike the picture, it is EBONY BLACK with red undertone lights (menu, arrows, play/pause).  The screen is about 2 x 1.5 inches & full color - very awesome!  The whole player is about 4 x 3 inches, and 3/4 inch thick.    Functionality:  This player works super well. Excellent audio & very clear/thorough menu.  I've had it freeze on me a couple times, but it's nothing that will damage it, and it's fixed by turning it off and back on.  I can't complain - but I don't use it as often as some people would.  It's probably too bulky to go running with, but it's perfect for plugging into my computer speakers and just chilling out.  It fits perfectly in the cellphone pocket of my purse for those long walks to class.  It has a locking function to keep songs/volume from changing if you accidentally hit the touch-sensitive pad.  All in all, I really love it!  Battery life:  The battery life is a drawback - it gets a max of about 3-3.5 hours.  But the A/C adapter charges it very quickly, so it's good to go in less than 20 minutes.    Video/Photos:  The full color screen is like a tiny computer screen!  I haven't experimented with video yet, but photos of any size are fine.  Video specs have to be within a certain screen resolution (I think), and it doesn't support iTunes videos - just .avi videos.    FM Radio: Almost CD quality sound.  My favorite stations are local, so the playback quality is very good.  I was surprised - usually FM tuners are quite poor in quality!  Other:  The only thing I'm having a problem with is figuring out how to make a playlist.  There's a default "favorites" playlist that holds up to 100 songs, but I don't know how to create another playlist.  It's probably in the manual and I just haven't read it, though.    I'm sure I'm forgetting to mention something about this product, but I love my purchase, and I highly recommend this player to everyone who asks me about it!

<Content>This player is great. I bought it because of the price and was very skittish about buying it. But I am in the military and don't have much money. Let me tell you it has lasted in IRAQ of all places. Easy to use and the back it metal so it is durable. I recommend it.

<Title>Just what I wanted
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Coby MP-C951 is an excellent MP3 player. I wanted one that did not require a special program for transferring music to it. I had organized my music files in different folders on my computer and wanted an MP3 player that would allow me to simply drag and drop the folders in Windows explorer. The Coby MP-C951 is recognized as a USB drive and can be used as such. Navigation is excellent and so is the sound quality. You can also view text files (not pdf files, though). The battery charges very quickly (with the option of charging with an AC adapter or by connecting to a USB port) and lasts many hours. I am very happy with it and recommend it highly.

<Title>Only thing that worked was charging and FM radio.
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Package arrived doubled boxed. Shipping box was acceptable, product box was mint. Immediately charged item for about 6 hours until the unit notified me the battery was fully charged. Turned on the unit but never got to the main menu. An error message saying, "HDD Read Error" appeared. A couple seconds after the message, the unit jumps into the FM Radio feature. I then attached the unit to my PC with the USB cable. WindowsXP failed to detect any connection. The only driver available is for Windows98. I spoke with two different Coby tech support people at different times of the day. Both had little computer experience and no Coby product experience, they're like temps hired to search through Coby's knowledge base. Just as Coby's troubleshooting tips and FAQ failed to help me, tech support failed as well. XP on my PC has never had an issue detecting USB devices in general nor different types of removable storage devices which this unit is supposed to behave like. This one's going back and I'm out the shipping both ways. The kicker, the product box comes sealed with Coby quality control stickers saying the item has been inspected to work, right! Btw, looking at the screen I concluded I would not enjoy watching video with this unit. (Draw a 2" diagonal and see for yourself.)

<Title>I didn't know Coby was a synonym for WORTHLESS
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Read the previous reviews of this product, liked what I read.  This seemed to be one of the few mp3 players on the market that has software-installation-free usb connectivity so the user can drag files of any type onto the device and from the device.  It also has a screen for viewing videos.  What more could someone want?  Oh WAIT, HOW ABOUT NOT GETTING "HDD READ ERROR" THE FIRST TIME YOU TURN ON THE DEVICE AND IMMEDIATELY BEING FORCED TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO.  That's right, this thing ain't playing music, it is about as useful as a paperweight, only my paperweight is prettier and is better designed.  This thing is useless and I am returning this to Amazon, J&R music, whoever.  I would recommend to everyone to stay away from this device.  It is not as small as the majority of the other players and the screen is very small in comparison to other players screens.  Also, for ANY mp3 player to be the least be useful, it absolutely MUST contain a WORKING hard drive, guess Coby didn't think about that.  There ARE also two little plastic stickers which seal the box shut when it arrives.  Each one has written on it "Quality Control."  BAAAAAAHAAAAAA!!!!

<Content>I can echo the complaints of other users of "HDD Read Error!" straight out of the box (even with the manufacturer "quality control" seal intact). After receiving two defective units, I'm returning it for a refund and going with another brand. This MP3 player is a lemon - don't bother.

<Content>I have to mirror the previous posters; after ordering one of these and having it give a HDD Read Error after charging, I returned it to get a new one and had the same thing happen with the newer unit. Stay away from this one; units are no good.

<Title>Nothing good to say
<Date>Fri May 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recieved the player and charged the battery. 1/2 way through the download process, the hard drive failed and became unreachable. Product was returned and replaced. Charged the battery, downloaded the music, used it for half a day. Found the music menu was very limited and did not provide access to all the sub-folders. I attached it to the computer to edit it. Did some editing and tried to disconnect the player and the hard drive error came up again effectively making the player an expensive portable radio.   Because of this I will never buy a Coby product ever again.

<Content>Item broke in less than 2 months.  HDD ERROR...... Too good to be true.    My COBY MP-C951 20 GB MP3 player works like a charm.  Being in the military and having limited funds.  This item is worth what I paid for it.  Great sound and video quality.  Durable when working out in the gym or while running.  Very easy to upload music and videos.  Charge lasts all day long with continous use.  I recommend this item.
