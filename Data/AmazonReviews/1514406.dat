<Title>A great player at just the right price!
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I researched many an MP3 player.  There are other players that have features that I think are cool (alarm clock, ability to change colors and font, expansion slot, etc.) but these features cost more, and though cool I really don't need them.    The Philips Go Gear is just what I needed at an excellent price.  I do not have an extensive library so the 4GB model is perfect for me.  The player is really easy to use (I would consider myself moderately tech savvy.)  The player shows both track time and elapsed time.  It also shows the time and date.    This is a good looking player with a bit of heft so that it doesn't feel like a toy.  I like the turquoise backlight, and you can set it for various time intervals.  Additionally, I find the font size easy to read.  The player is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but I am not terribly bothered by this.    The sound quality is excellent.  You can turn the volume down so that you don't hear the music (if you need to talk to someone.) or you can jam at max volume.  I personally would love to be able to listen at a quieter volume when I am in a quiet space but this is not a big deal.  There are also various built-in equalizers (jazz, rock, pop, etc.), and you can also set it to your own preferences.    WMP has been really easy to use.  I love the sync feature.    I have great reception from the radio and I really like that you can set the radio for reception from Europe, Asia, and the US.  Great for travel.  The included earphones are typical of most MP3 players.  I prefer to use my own.      The battery life is adequate.    I personally can't imagine using the video feature often with such a tiny screen, but the included Philips video looked fantastic.  The included Philips pictures also had great clarity.  I definitely plan to download pictures to share with friends.    I think this is a fantastic player, and I am really pleased with it!

<Title>Very Satisfied
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the money, you're not going to find a better player out there.  Great sound, great video playback, easy to use, simple interface (no click-wheel), and good battery life all add up to a great little player.  Why didn't I think of Philips before?

<Content>I was very pleased with everything about this player.  I'm only using it for the music but the sample photos and the sample movie look great and it was too easy to load music and the quality of the sound is great.

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player is amazing, and for the great price it is at, you can't go wrong with it! Even if Apple is a better-known brand, I guarantee you that this mp3 player is better than most other Apple products out there! It has great features, great sound quality, and easy-to-read print!   Video- If you install the software that comes with the player, downloading videos onto the player is so easy! You simply choose a video that you would like on the player, add it into the software and convert it over to your mp3 player! I already have 3 videos on there!  Photos- Even easier! I don't have that many photos on my computer, so I don't have that many in my player, but if I did, my player would be overflowing with photos as it is so easy to put them on there and the quality is great!  Music- With the right music program, downloading music onto the mp3 player is very easy and I have a TON of music already on there! The sound quality is great and as I said before, it has VERY easy-to-read print!  Radio- Although I haven't listened to the radio that much, I have listened to brief listens of it, and from what I have heard, the radio quality is amazing and it has some really good stations!  Recording- Another awesome feature of the player is that you can record yourself talking (or singing or any other thing like that)! Although the quality of the recordings is not fantastic, it's still very good and it's another cool feature of this mp3 player!  Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this mp3 player, as many other ones out there are very overpriced and aren't worth all the money. This player is priced just at the right price and it has some amazing features and GREAT sound quality! Highly recommended.

<Title>Couldn't be happier
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cash is kind of tight for me and I have been putting off getting a new MP3 player for a while. I just purchased this same one, but with 8GB. Very user friendly. I hooked it up to my laptop, which uses windows VISTA and it automatically downloaded whatever software or drivers it needed. It was recognized in windows media player right away. It is so much better than my previous mp3 player. The battery seems to last longer than what I'm used to, and I am enjoying the larger screen. I love it so far, especially because I got such a great deal on mine. I would totally recommend this for someone who doesn't want to dish out the cash for a new Ipod.

<Title>Freeze Up Problem
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I returned the second one today after it froze (locked-up) like the first one.  After installing both music and pictures, 6 hours later I could not turn it on. I had no success with the reset on the player or the repair software that was installed from the CD that came with the player. I would be very interested if anyone else has encountered this problem because I liked many of the features and size of the screen because pictures are my primary interest, and I still like the player.

<Title>Excellent quality and the price is right
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player primarily for the video function. The videos that you add look very crisp and colorful, and the sound quality is impeccable. The converter software included on the install cd is amazing as well. It converts many different formats of video into WMV without losing quality, or changing the size of the file. It couldn't be easier to add music or videos with the sync feature of Windows Media Player. The radio also has great quality, which is an added bonus. At first, the interface is a little difficult to use, if you are used to ipods or other mp3 players, but you will get used to it very quickly. I highly recommend this player for anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, high quality mp3/video player.

<Title>Not all Wine and Roses
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compared to the iPod Nano, the Philips 4GB is way overpriced.  After using one for about 30 minutes, I have come to the conclusion that the Philips interface is slow, there is no support for album art (surprising since the player supports photos and video), there is no equalizer, and the volume control has all the subtlety of a moose. The volume ranges from *quiet* to DEAFENING in 4 discrete steps. The overall look-and-feel is very bland.  For $18 more, the 4GB iPod Nano gives you: * Better Volume Control * Album Art (via 3D animated Cover Flow) * Equalizer * Video and Audio podcasts * Calendar * Contact List * Games (solitaire, etc.)
