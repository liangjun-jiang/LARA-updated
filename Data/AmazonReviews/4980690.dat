<Title>Terrible unit - returning mine to the store!

<Content>Did the product reviewer actually use this thing?? I doubt it. The battery (fully charged overnight) lasted only 2 hours. A bad deal on a 3 hour marathon training run! The little screen is unreadable. The unit could pick up no radio stations (in a metro area where there are many). Don't waste your time or money on this one.
