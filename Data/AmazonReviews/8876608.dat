<Content>I bought it because I have an Alienware computer and have been very happy with it, this has been a good player but not on the same level as their computers.  It playes MP3s, it has been durable, will it change the world or set the bar... no, but it was fair price.

<Title>WARNING!!! DO NOT BUY FROM ALIENWARE

<Content>Buyer beware...this is a horrible company...check the BBB of Miami site and you will see how many complaints this company has filed against it. They will not give any customer service not allow you to speak to a supervisor and most certainly tell you that even if your product is defective thet cannot refund. Had to write to the BBB myself to get a refund on a laptop that had not worked from day 1 or after sending to the repair center 5 times, also they replaced laptop with a new system that did not work out of the box either. They finally agreed to refund my money after several letters to BBB they received product back over 2 weeks ago and still haven't receive my money back. Deal with this shady company at your own risk.
