<Title>a bargain...
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For a mp3 player / recorder / thumb drive this price and for 1GB, this is a good bargain, but there's always room for improvement:  1) ear buds: without cushions, it will always fall from your ears; 2) the headphones cable sports a "heart". What was that? 3) not much contrast from the LCD. 4) only red colour.  Despite the aforementioned, I liked the sound, the EQ options are quite good. And - important - it has a USB connector - a plus!

<Title>does what it's supposed to
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I use this primarily to listen to talk shows that I record so most mp3 are 2 hours long.  This creates issues that don't exist with just music use.  Files are larger so playing off the player directly from the player with a PC or when attached to the PC is a must.  Fast forwarding speed is extremely important for getting past commercials or queuing up to the middle of the file.  Too fast will make getting the right place difficult, going to slow will be frustrating to get to the right place.  I really wanted a direct insert device so I wouldn't have to carry around a cable.  I purchased a Samsung &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-YP-U2JXB-Direct-Insert-Digital/dp/B000ET7668/sr=8-6/qid=1162751966/ref=pd_bbs_sr_6/104-1252734-7579144?ie=UTF8&s=electronics">YP-U2J&lt;/a> but was disappointed with the fact that files couldn't be accessed directly by an operating system and it required Windows XP with Media Center 10.  There are 2 categories of direct connect USB mp3 players: mp3 players and thumb drive/mp3 players.  The difference is thumb drives do not require drivers or software to sync or transfer files.  I prefer thumb drives/mp3 players.  Pros: 1. Works as portable storage device: no need for Media Center or other software.  Works in any OS.  No need to sync.  Can play songs with PC directly from device.  99% of mp3 players can not do this.  Very frustrating for large files.  2. Fast forward works fairly well.  Starts at 10x (10 seconds per second), speed ramps up to 60x (1 minute per second).  This works very well for me.  3. Uses AAA batteries so you can have backup power when you need it.  4. Pretty colors for back-light.  Green, Cyan, Blue, Red, Purple, White.  Cons: 1. By far the most annoying thing is that it does not resume.  When you pause and the player turns off, when you turn it on it starts in the menu.  When you go to music it starts at the beginning of the first file.  Ridiculous.  2. Song order is difficult if not impossible to manage.  No play lists.  2. Battery life is terrible.  With included alkaline, battery lasted 40 minutes.  I've switched to NiMH 600mAH and they seem to last about 2 hours.  Still not good for such a limited device but I can manage since my commute is only 20-30 minutes.  Would be nice if it included charging for NiMH and NiCd batteries.  3. Shoddy construction.  Glass screen cover broke when I was changing my oil.  I was careful not to roll over on it but it still broke.  Took it off and it works fine.  4. Kinda big.  I really like the Samsung's size better.  5. Menu system is annoying.  Samsung was very intuitive.  6. Fast forward same as next track.  Hold button to fast forward tap to skip.  Obviously annoying when fast forwarding 60 minutes into a show just to skip to the next track.  Even with all the problems, I like it better than any mp3 player that requires drivers or special software.

<Title>works well enough for the price
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought this because I wanted a good bit of space for as little money as I could manage.. and with that in mind, it's not bad. The controls are not at ALL intuitive, unfortunately (and the manual is NO help with anything), but I eventually sorted out all its quirks. Files can be sorted into folders, which is very nice. The main drawback I've found with this is that you CAN NOT put more songs on it without completely wiping off everything else first. You can delete just fine within the player's interface, but you cannot delete tracks from (in the case of Windows) the My Computer window. And it tells you everything is write-protected if you try to add something more on without having deleted everything first. Given that I only swap things out once a week or so, this is a managable flaw, but still a needless one. Apart from that, battery life is decent, and so far mine's put up with rain and pretty large temperature variations, as well as being dropped a good bit. Sound quality's not fantastic (most of the equalizer settings sound atrocious), but it's not to the point of being irritating.  Again, for the price and the amount of space, it's decent enough. Works just fine, once you sort out the controls. The size is also very convenient, it's perfect for just casually dragging it around with you everywhere in a pocket or what have you. (And much less to worry about than an iPod!)

<Title>Great for the price; has some bugs
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Good if it meets your needs.  That would be a player that demands small size and low price.  Music during exercise, shopping, computer lab, falling asleep, or just as a flash drive.  You must be willing to accept these limitations.   1) Random play.  Serial browsing is obviously ridiculous for 1 GB (probably 350 songs at 128Kb), and it doesn't have resume, so you must like random.  e.g. you don't mind skipping through selections until you find one you want to hear.   2) Power on / off.  Sometimes the unit decides to shut off during power up.  You have to briefly disconnect the battery to fix it.  Also, you have to return to the main menu (vs. song play) before power off works.   3) Battery.  If you fall asleep listening (that's me), your battery is of course dead in the morning.  Bought a cheap ($10) nimh charger that comes with some batteries (ray-o-vac).   4) User interface.  You have to learn two durations of button press to navigate.  Also, the unit appears dead (like 1-2 seconds!) when entering and leaving the play menu; indexing songs I suppose.  (This and #2 are probably generating a lot of product returns.)  Sound is fine.  I've had equalization problems with more expensive players (GoVideo, Rio).  Random play is fine.  Random on some players is a joke (Memorex mp3-CD).  Removable battery is great.  Who wants to get stuck with a dead lithium that costs more than the player to fix?  I'd rather carry an extra battery in my pocket.  Has a hold slide switch, so you can put it into your pocket.  Being able to choose the backlight color (from a rainbow) is cool. [...]

<Title>software upgrade for this great player
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player for a month now. I really like it.  Sound is OK It drains on battery quick....since I use rechargeable its ok for me. There was no folder browsing - which made me hate this player in the beginning. Now Machspeed has a software upgrade for this player. You download from their site and upgrade your player. This upgrade allows you to browse folders and go to the music you like. I just discovered one more - may be a feature -  I turn the recording on and speak into the headphones ( that come with this player). It records them. Even though the clarity isn't that good this way it is good for taking quick notes.

<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I give this product a one star rating because there's no option for zero. Got one for myself and my husband and as soon as it arrived I immediately put it to use. it was working great, i even fell asleep listening to it, up till the following morning when i changed the battery and then the damn thing wouldn't play. It got stuck at menu and non of the buttons were working  worst of all it wouldn't turn on at all after an hour no matter how many batteries i replaced it with. This product is not worth $39.99, a dollar or even this web page that it's on. will never try an off brand again.

<Content>I bought this same MP3 player, only it was marketed under a different name. It worked awesome for about two months and then started shutting itself off and on continually until the battery dies. When I called tech support they essentially said "tough luck." Mine looks EXACTLY the same but is silver and has the manufacturers name "Kanguru." I wouldn't recommend it and I hope that the Coby 2GB that I'm thinking to buy doesn't do the same thing to me.

<Title>Broke on day three
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was satisfied with the product - until I actually used it in the real world. The second day I carried it in my pocket (with nothing but my cell phone knocking against it), the glass screen cracked and broke apart. In my pocket. Guess what happened when I reached my hand into my pocket which now had bits of broken glass into it?  The third day I was using the Machspeed Trio was when it died. I put some documents onto the drive and went to Kinkos to get them printed. When I gave the clerk the drive, he was unable to get information off it. He couldn't even get it to register in the computer. He tried it in four different computers, and none of them worked. He gave it back to me, and I couldn't even get it to turn on. I changed the batteries - no good. It just died.  Thanks, Machspeed Trio. I really enjoyed your product for about 18 hours. But $30 for 18 hours isn't enough.  Please don't buy this product.

<Content>I use this to listen to audio books while I exercise.  You CAN have it pick up where you stop.  You just first of all pause before you turn it off.  Then the next time you start it up, it begins where you left off. I found that it is much easier to see if you change the back light to yellow from the default blue. The battery lasts a long time.  Since I don't use this for music, the sound is just fine, and it is about the cheapest one you can find for 1 GB.

<Title>Good enough, despite some issues
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've got this player for my B-day two and a half years ago. It's still alive, after a couple month in coma.  For the first year I was quite happy except it refused to read names of files in the form I saved them. It is inconvenient if you listen to foreign music: be ready to recognize songs by how they sound, bitrate, length, etc. 'cause you won't see the title in a readable way. After a couple months the cap started slipping off. They really should include a roll of tape in the set. After a year the start button started to malfunction, and image in the window shifted up about 1/4 of an inch, so track # and other info was no longer in the field of vision. In addition, the paint on plastic easily scratches. Back then the player used to cost $170. Today it worth of 30 bucks, I think it's a pretty good deal comparing to pathos i-pods.

<Title>Poor Product and the Manufacturer Knows It
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Like the former reviewer, I also would like to give the product a zero rating, but one was the lowest available to me. I echo all her sentiments and would like to add two additional comments.  First, the writing in the instructional manual for this device was atrocious; it was full of errors as well as confusing due to poor construction.  Second, the tech support line for this product is nothing more than an employee fielding complaint calls.  There was no effort made to help me solve the technical problems I was experiencing; the way the call was handled led me to believe that the whole operation was a sham.  The only help they would give was to offer to, "look at the device if I sent it to them and they would replace it IF they could re-create the problem I described".  At that point, we saw no reason to mess with the company and simply sent the devices back to Amazon for a refund.

<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Uploading music was easy on this mp3 player, but then very difficult to operate the player and play the music.  I was about to give up, assuming the play button was defective but then I realized it just needed a very quick tap.  I was pushing the button down too hard and I'm guessing that's why the mp3 player appears to be defective to others when it just requires a lot lighter touch and a bit of wait time until it loads.  So while this player gives you what it advertised, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a lot of patience (the instructions do suck).  You get what you pay for.

<Title>broke within 3 weeks
<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player is very basic, which was all I wanted in my first mp3 player -- well, I also wanted one that would last longer than a gallon of milk in the fridge.  After working acceptably for three weeks, this piece of junk simply stopped working one day, mid-song, and I haven't been able to turn it on at all since then.  I've tried other batteries, but none work.  I've tried reloading the software (which is what the nearly incomprehensible instruction booklet suggests), but the computer doesn't even recognize that a device is connected when I hook it up (and I've tried every USB port on the computer).  The USB connector on the mp3 player began to rust after about 10 days, so I can only imagine what the inside of this thing looks like.  This player also sucks batteries dry like you wouldn't believe: one AAA battery was enough to power this thing for about 90 minutes, then the battery would be dead.  The only good things about this mp3 player were (1) I learned that I really like this method of listening to music, and (2) I was only out a small amount of money in this learning experience.  So, if you're looking for an inexpensive, disposable introduction to mp3 players, this one might be a good choice.  Otherwise, I recommend that you spend some more money to get a better-quality player.  You'll either pay more now, or pay more later, because this one won't last.

<Date>Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not only wouldn't my product work, but it discharged the battery so fast the player was almost too hot to hold. I was on a move to Japan so had no time to demand a replacement.  I'd like to try a working model to see if it can deliver a satisfactory performance.

<Title>Decent, but not durable
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was thrilled with this unit when I got it; for the money it is a decent little player packed with features.  My joy was short lived, however, as I began to encounter problems:  * It eats AAA batteries like a ravenous wolf.  I probably should have looked for some rechargeable batteries for this thing.  * I found that bumping, jostling, or dropping it, even lightly, can cause it to die and require restarting.  Really annoying if you're exercising or using it in the car.  * After about two months, I lightly bumped into a metal banister with the device in my pocket.   It cracked the glass, making the screen unreadable.  Seemed like it should have withstood more than that.  * Another month after that, the jack for the headphones got messed up.  I had to hold the headphone plug in it just the right way or the ground terminal would disconnect and the channels would cancel out.  This got worse, and happened with any headphones I tried.  Eventually the device became unusable because of this.  Like Dad always said: "Buy cheap, buy twice".  Should've listened.

<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device its suposed to be USB 2.0  That means that a single 4MB mp3 file would take about a second to transfer. Oh no, it doesn't. It takes about 8 or 10 seconds per track. Now, multiply that for some 200 songs? Ridiculous. However, Amazon has nothing to do with this total failure.

<Title>Great deal, confusing instructions.
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product for my sister who is a PC user. I have an iPod which was plug and play. This required a driver to be installed on a PC and when plugged into a Mac didn't even show up - so it's not Mac compatible as the description had said. The driver pretty much just wipes the stick clean - you must have windows media player already installed on your machine to upload to the player. The instructions did not state this and it took a long time to figure out on my own, not being familiar with MP3 players. The sound quality is good and it can handle a lot of music as it is 1GB, it can also record small messages and be used as a memory stick but with it not showing up on the mac - it can only be used on PC. It's a good thing I got it as a gift to a PC user. The battery seems to also last a long time so that was nice too - because it wasn't a rechargeable unit and you don't need a battery at all to upload. Just wish it had clearer instructions. I was also under the impression that it had an FM radio too - but that's an option on the model and you have to buy a different model for that.

<Content>I just received this product today and I am slighty disappointed already and I haven't even used it yet.  The product description says it comes with a neck band thing so it can hang from your neck, but there was not one in my package.  Also, the earphones that cames with it have a short in them.  Because of this, the cord must be angled just right so the audio does not cut out or sound as if it's under water.

<Title>cheap plastic and poor programming
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player has served me well, it is nice that it can be used as a thumb drive and an mp3 player simultaneously, you don't have to format it like you would a true-blue player. The programming on the player is kinda crappy, which makes the user interface inconsistent and hard to use sometimes, especially when navigating your music library.  I do like the price and the memory capacity, and you can change the EQ settings and play configuration and backlight like any other player.  The backlight is stuck on, but it doesn't seem to affect the battery life that much.  I had it in my pocket with something else and I shattered the plastic over the screen... no biggie, the body does seem cheaply made though.  You get what you pay for, but so far I have been satisfied, still works like a charm after 6 months.

<Content>I don't know who wrote the English directions for this product but they suck-there is hardly any info at all- my product did not come with any info as to how to get in touch with the company if there were problems on the pc. Don't even hope for troubleshooting advice.  My windows XP keeps asking for some disk that didn't come with the device. The only disk that came with it was driver for win 98. Of course there is no number, email or snail mail addy to use to ask for help.  I wish I would have spent a little more money to buy a name brand MP3 player.

<Title>Bargain MP3 player
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I took a gamble on this player, and I've been pleasantly surprised. I agree with a previous reviewer about the manual: it's pretty poorly written. But I got the gist of what they were saying, and after 10 minutes of exploring the player I've figured out most of its features.  As for the player's features... the sound quality is good, and the random track feature is surprisingly good when compared to other (admittedly cheap) players I've used. On many other players I've used the random track algorithm has been far from random. But this one seems quite authentic. The controls are kind of odd, but the UI is fairly good. The headphones that come with the player are poor quality, but the player itself seems fairly well made.  It's not an iPod, but for this price you can't really expect the same level of quality. I didn't have to deal with a rebate, so I can't comment on that possible issue. I also didn't run into any OS issues: it just worked seamlessly with XP from the start.   Considering the price, and the fact it's got 1GB of memory, on the whole this is a good little player.

<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The unit is compact, has a nice feature to attach the headphones to the unit so if dropped, all the weight doesn't fall on the jack. My issues are the manual talks about a radio function - which the unit doesn't have. And the unit has a telephone address book - which the manual or CD has no information on. Otherwise it's a very affordable system and you get great storage and MP3 capability for your bucks.

<Title>Poor Construction
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player due to the price....and as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  Overall I find the player poorly made.  Somehow, dust has gotten on the underside of the plastic shielding which covers the LCD.  This has made it very difficult to read.  Additionally, the button to select items in the menu has gotten extremely touchy and normally registers two "button presses" when I press once.    There are many better mp3 players out there with more capacity and features for the same or less cost.  I have relegated this one to a thumb drive.

<Title>Don't Waste Your Money
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this and was dissapointed more and more upon getting it. It was cool at first - it's compact and doubles as a USB drive.  But I found it difficult to use, and I'm pretty good with electronics. Aside from the volume and hold buttons, there are only two working buttons. One turns off/turns on/plays/pauses and the other is more of a switch to go from one song to another.   It was difficult to figure out what the button was going to do when you pressed it - was it going to turn the unit off, was it going to play the song, etc...  You cannot see anything in the dark - the only way to get the light to go on is to press on of the buttons, when then either changes the song (so you can't see what song you were playing), turns the unit off, or puts on the volume display which goes away only after the light has gone off.  The switch you use to change songs is ridiculous. There's no fast changing but it fades out and fades in for every song - so if you were on the 1st song and you wanted to play the 50th song, it would take you a while to get there.  The menu is hard to navigate - there is no easy way to get out of it once you are done, as you only have 1 button to use! The manual was useless. I returned mine within a week and instead, I purchased a Sandisk Sansa m240 and was not dissapointed at all, and the price was only $5 more.

If your just looking for something simple and sleek then this is it, but if you want something more advanced then this porduct is not for you. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't select by genre, artist or track title. I like it and I would recommend it to first time mp3 buyers and kids or a person who really doesn't know anything about a mp3 and just want some music to carry around.

<Date>Thu Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I decided to purchase this product on the fact that it was a 1 gigabyte mp3 player, that cost only around $30. It worked perfectly two for the first two days of use, however on the third day, the buttons started malfunctioning. I used this for two months, the volume does not increase, rarely does it happen, you either have to press really hard or hold the button for a long time. Besides that the power button that is used to turn the player on/off, and to play and pause songs, completely collapsed, and does not function anymore, leaving this mp3 useless. All this after only two months of use....the best thing to do is buy an ipod or a Creative mp3 player,,,something that many people have....that has a proven quality.

<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I read most of the comments before buying this mp3 player. I was thinking I might be lucky without suffering what people complained. Indeed, I am lucky. Mine works fine including browsing folders, etc. The voice recorder is not that great. I think that is due to the mic+ADC sensitivity. The manual is indeed not clear but the principle of operations is pretty much the same as other mp3 players especially on the short press vs. press-and-hold. So, I end up figuring out most of the operations myself. The manual has some strange grammar in the text. It was probably written by a foreigner. It would be nice if this unit also comes with an FM radio. But you pay what you get.

<Content>This is a very CHEAP player.  I bought 2- one for my wife and 1 for myself.  the faceplates of both broke within a few weeks.  In both cases, my wife and I just had them in our pockets and our keys (I guess) broke the faceplates.    Also, if you listen to longer podcasts or ebooks and turn the player off, it does not start where you stopped it at.  The navigation is difficult.  Another problem is that the microphone button is in a bad location and I constantly hit it and it is difficult to get it to stop and change back to the player. Overall, avoid this player
