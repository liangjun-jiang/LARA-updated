<Title>Not Good!!
<Date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just purchased this item - I am returning it.  Tigerdirect has been great however, the product does not accept .wma files with licensing.  So, if you download a song from a digital music store - you can sync it but it will not play because it doesn't support the licensing file.  If this is not an issue - the buttons worked but, there was a slow response time from pressing them and the unit responding.  Features were good but product definitely came up short!!
