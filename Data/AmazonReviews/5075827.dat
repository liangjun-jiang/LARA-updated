<Product Name>Wolverine Data 8080 80 GB FlashPro Portable MP3 Drive
<Title>Not as easy to use as other MP3 Players
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Wolverine FlashPro 8000 to replace my aging RCA Lyra. I was looking for a simple HD based MP3 player with a large storage capacity, which this unit has.  I do not use playlists and other advanced MP3 player features, so I just wanted a player with a LOT of storage for a reasonable price. It also has the added bonus of being a multi-format memory card reader. Unfortunately, right out of the box, I had trouble with it.  Since I am running Windows XP, I knew that I would have to format the drive with the included software (as instructed in the manual).  Well, the format failed, sort of.  My computer will recognize the unit as another hard drive (great), but I cannot read or write to it (not great).  My computer tells me that the unit is formatted correctly using FAT32, but then when I try to access any files on the drive, it hangs up my computer, and then I get a message saying the drive is not formatted.    I was able to load some MP3 files by putting them on an SD card first and then putting the SD card into the unit and copying them.  That was very cumbersome, so I am trying to get help from Wolverine Data's support to help me format the thing correctly.  This unit is definitely NOT for someone that isn't comfortable with computers, partitioning and formatting hard rives, etc...  It is not overly user friendly.  It makes my old Lyra look like it has advanced MP3 technology, which is amusing.  The unit doesn't come with any type of MP3 software, which would be fine if I could get Windows Media Player to recognize it!    I am going to remain optimistic until I hear back from Wolverine Data that this unit can be correctly formatted and more easily used.  If not, it's going straight back for a refund.
