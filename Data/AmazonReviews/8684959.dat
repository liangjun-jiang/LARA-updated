<Title>A Technical Marvel
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is quite simply the most amazing product Sony has come out with yet. I would give it 5 stars just for the sheer coolness factor this little gizmo offers. I got mine several weeks after it came out and i dont leave  home without it. It plays MP3 at surprisingly high quality, and nice and  loud unlike most MP3 players. It's quite expensive, so if money is an issue  I recommend waiting for a price drop, but other than that, buy the Memory  Stick, its just the coolest thing I've seen in a long time.

<Title>Trashware
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I bought the music clip version of the sony players. These products are a total waste of money. True, they have a sleek, compact design but are functionally worthless due to the multiple limitations of the software  (open MG jukebox) which must be used to download or convert files. As best  I can tell they are not really MP3 players but only play reformatted MP3  files. As a result you must clog up your hard drive with all of the  converted tracs in addition to the original MP3 files. To make matters  worse, you can only check out a song from 1 computer to one music clip  player. But wait, it gets worse. You can only check a song out to that  specific player 4 times. This is SONYs effort to protect copyrighted music  for which it has a vested interest. But the ads are misleading and the  product worthless to me. This is SONYs next Betamax. I've gone back to my  prior, somewhat chunkier player which is convenient if slightly larger

<Title>Expensive and Useless
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Sony has made a nice piece of hardware, but you can only get music onto the thing using their sites when downloading emusic. And, if the song is fairly popular, chances are, you will have to pay to download it. The real  surprise is that you do not get to keep the song, you have to check in and  out of Sony's mainframe to &quot;check in&quot; and &quot;check out&quot;  the songs, plus, they will erase your song if they decide you have had it  too long. Basically, its an MP3 player that is expensive, and you can not  even get the music you want. I bought mine, and returned it furious 3 hours  later.

<Title>MPWhat?
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The Sony MemoryStick would and could become one of the best portable MP3 players on the market...if it weren't for the fact that it isn't an MP3 player!<p>     Technically, because Sony only allows its proprietary ATRAC  music-compression system on its player, it isn't an MP3 player.  Thus, any  MP3's you might have already on your computer would need to be converted to  the ATRAC compression system first.  Unfortunately, this causes a lot of  hassles, and if you already have a huge amount of MP3's (legally, of  course) on your system, you might want to look at another of the player's  out there.<p>     However, if you are looking to digitally manage all of  your music on your computer, and you have a huge hard drive, then this is  the best player on the market for you.

<Title>I can't believe it sucks
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I recieved the Memory Stick Walkman under 5 impressions.<p>1) It played MP3s. 2) It had no copyright crap that Metallica's whining about. 3) Memory Sticks were pretty inexpensive. 4) It used normal Memory Sticks. 5) I could  use my existing media player to upload songs.<p>Boy, was I angry when I  faced the brutal truth. This thing takes like an hour to convert MP3s into  OMGs, it has MagicGate Memory Stick technology that makes no difference  except that it's more expensive (which is a lot, considering a NORMAL  Memory Stick's price), I had to use OpenMG Jukebox, which is a piece of  crap compared to Windows Media Player 7, or even RioPort. This copyright  stuff will hurt Sony badly, and I'm so ticked off, I refuse to buy Sony's  products!

<Title>Not so bad
<Date>Sun Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is a very good portable digital music player.  It is one of the  smallest ones available, has excellent sound quality and loading it is very  fast.  The rechargable battery charges quickly and lasts me about 12 hours.   The only drawback is the OpenMG software it uses, and its restriction to  Win98.<p>One of the other reviews mentions that you can only check out a  song 4 times, and makes it sound like it is 4 times ever.  Not true!  You  CAN only have 4 copies checked out at one time, but when you unload the  player it checks the copy back in.  I haven't had more than 1 copy of any  song checked out at any one time, so it isn't an issue.

<Title>Sleek style and size makes up for time consuming formatting
<Date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Lets face it, almost 95% of prospective buyers of a digital music player are in the market because they are downright cool gadgets.  With Sony's MS7 walkman you definitely get a cool gadget that would make all of your friends quite jealous.<p>ATRAC3 WHATS THE BIG DEAL?<p>As you have read in earlier reviews this &quot;walkman&quot; uses the ATRAC3 format over MP3. Technically there are many differences between the two formats but audibly they are one in the same.  The big deal with the ATRAC format is not the sound but rather the convenience issue of the player.  For those of you who simply want to be able to drag and drop your MP3s onto this player you may want to double think purchasing this model.  Though dont be fooled, the Jukebox software that comes with this player allows you to convert your MP3s into the ATRAC format (as well as your CD's) <p>CHECK IN/ CHECK OUT<p>Once converted, the jukebox software will display all of your songs originally with three musical notes next to them indicating the amount of &quot;rights&quot; that song has to be transferred. Once you select an ATRAC file that you want to send to your player you then must continue with the check out process.  Once stored on your player you now only have two notes, indicating that you only have &quot;rights&quot; to that song two more times.  The only way to get your &quot;right&quot; back is to check the song back into your hard drive.  When you think about the system it is quite ingenious and would make any Sony lawyer happy.<p>MEMORY STICKS If you are buying this player thinking that you are going to stock up on Sony MG memory sticks think again.  64MB MG MS are over $100 a piece.  If you are looking for a player that would allow you to keep separate &quot;mixs'&quot; on different medias that you can interchange in your players, look to Iomegas new Clik player. <p>SLEEK STYLE  As seen in the picture this player is very ergonmically built.  It fits well in your palm and has a very intuitive menu. A &quot;rocking&quot; scroll bar on the side of the unit allows you to scroll up and down between your checked out songs and also allows you to FF and REW.  There are also options to change display types of your song readouts and time counter playback options. The look and feel are truly state of the art and worth the price tag.<p>ACCESORIES The player comes with a very tiny (and easy to lose) cradle that recharges the units LITH battery and also is the specially designed input of the included USB cable. (The input on the cradle almost looks like an 1394 port)Also easy to lose is the adapter for the headphone jack. The headphone input is not your standard 3.5&quot; mini plug but rather a 2.5&quot;.  The included headphones are 2.5&quot; and comes with the aformentioned adapter.  Also included is a very hard to install strap to hang the player around your neck.<p>All in all this  is the most sleek and best looking player on the market. Purchasing this all comes down to looks over convenience, shes very pretty but a definite pain in the arse.

<Content>I love Sony. I think there inovators and leaders in the electronics industry. This product shows just that. Easy to use, attractive and a nice peice of equipment. Setting up was easy. The registration process was a little overboard. I dont think you should have to register a product just to use it. &quot;Big Brother&quot; But you gotta do what you gotta do. Nice features and decent software but the conversion time is way to long. Also whats up with them crappy [cheap] earbud head phones? When you spend[this much] you should at least get some rockin head phones to go along.  In closing worth $400.00 no.  Worth $200.00 yes.  Bottom line.

<Title>Sony MS-7, Great Design Poor Interface
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Like many Sony products the MS-7 is a study in top-notch industrial design.  The MS-7 fits perfectly in the hand and pocket, the controls are intuitive and it has the feel of a rugged piece that will take some abuse.  Unfortunately all the efforts put into the superb design are lost by the proprietary SDMI memory sticks and clumsy software. The music files loaded into the MS-7 are not MP3 rather ATRAC3.  While ATRAC3 has a bit better compression ratio, approximately 12:1 vs. 10:1 for MP3, it is hardly worth the nuisance of having to re-rip your MP3 files after downloading from your computer to the player 4 times.  Had it not been for the fact that mine had a bad left channel I probably would have kept it just because it is so cool.  I wound up with a Nomad II, which I like very much.  The Nomad II cost less, comes with a 32 preset FM tuner, nice headphones, not ear buds and uses a replaceable AA alkaline battery.  If Sony reissues the MS-7 sans SDMI and ATRAC3 I'll be the first in line to buy one.

<Title>quality is all
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I can understand that people are concerned about the check in and out procedure (I don't think it's too complicated anyway and I understand copyright problems very well), but if you want the realy best sounding mobile piece of sound this is the only choice. ATRAC 3 definitely beats mp3 by far when it comes to dynamics and distortion. and in combination with sony fontopia earphones ... you almost get the sound of a good home stereo into your shirtpockets. Even classic cd conversions don't lose any of their transparency. Don't listen to mp3 freaks. They are deaf anyway. The ms walkman is a serious piece of mobile HIFI! Believe it!

<Title>Not  really MP3 - or Windows Media Player Compatible
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I own this and I really wish I had not purchased it at all. I use windows ME with Media Player and have a fairly extensive collection of MP3 files recorded from my own collection of CD's. I purchased this for use while traveling due to its size and storage capacity. The box and advertising is extremely deceptive with respect to its use of the ATRAC3 format instead of MP3. Even the windows Media Player site would lead you to believe its compatible with MP3 directly - it is not. Sony's OpenMG software is very primitive and hard to use compared to other Juke Box software packages. I really dislike having songs taking up my hard drive in both formats. I own a lot of great Sony products. This is one I wish I never purchased.

<Content>This product is a PERFECT example of how stupid big corporations can be.  They think that since everybody's copying and exchanging music, the best thing to do is make it such a pain-in-the-ask to to copy music.  Sony you are dumb.  This is such a beautifully crafted peice of hardware, but NO, you just had to RUIN it with ATRAC.<p>I got one as a present from my brother in law.  I was shocked that he managed to buy this without knowing that it was a mp3 gimp.  I love sony cameras and vaios, but this walkman is a marketing audacity of sony music.<p>People dont have time and energy to convert files into something else and check them in and out.  Mp3 activities end up consuming enough time as it is, like a hobby or something.

<Content>You know, in reading the other reviews, one has to wonder what it is they were expecting when they bought their Sony MS. It's a gadget, a toy, and it is a prized possession of mine. I found it easy to use, easy to download music, great to carry around and take music on the go without carrying a cumbersome CD player and CD's. Maybe if I was a techno-freak I would have knocks against this product, but for the general consumer I think it's a great toy.<p>Just wish it came with a case or clip so I could more comfortably take it running.

<Title>It's not an MP3 player - It's better
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I have been a proud owner of the Sony NW-MS7 for a couple of weeks now and it is one of the most beautiful and best sounding  portable audio machines I have ever used.<p>Before I bought the NW-MS7 I researched the product on the web and in the stores (Tottenham Court Road, London) for about 2 weeks. I wanted a player that can use MP3, WAV and also record my CD collection. It was also important to have playback  without skipping (unlike portable CD players). However, during this time I became concerned about the conversion to atrac3, memory storage and battery life.<p>It has to be said that there is alot of confusion on the web about the atrac3 conversion. The NW-MS7 is not a mp3 player. So you will have to convert all your mp3's into the atrac3 format. If you have alot of mp3's then it will be very time consuming and once converted you cannot play the atrac3 files in anything other than the software provided with the walkman - so the chances are you will have two copies of your mp3's.<p>When you have converted your favourite tracks you will have to go through a process of checking IN and OUT the music onto the memory stick. This is a very simple process. Some (over-reacting and panicking) reviewers seem to think that you can only check out a song four times and after that you have to go through the hasstle of re-sampling the music. This is WRONG. Yes,  you DO have to check OUT the songs and you do have the limitation of checking them OUT FOUR times BUT as long as you check them back IN  when you change the music on the memory stick then you're not going to run into any problems because this will restore the count back to four.<p>Also, this product will only work on one computer running ONLY Windows 98 ( Windows 95 upgraded to Win98, Windows NT and Windows 2000 are useless with this product) - so you can't update the memory stick on a work or friends computer - This limitation could be a real disadvantage. Sure, some music may need to be copyright protected but what will happen if you decide to upgrade to a new system or operating system or if the computer you currently own has a major meltdown. As far as I can tell the NW - MS7 will not work on software re-installed onto another system. <p>The sound quality is awesome. It has the same sound definition as a CD player but at a fifth the size and weight. This unit will not skip as everything is stored on a chip with no moving parts. One 64 MB memory stick will hold approx 80 mins of music at the default setting of 105 kbps. At this setting you're not going to be dissapointed - especially if the sound is converted from a CD ( the converted sound quality can only be as good as it's source ). Initally I did have a problem with the music ripped from my CD's. The converted files  skipped slightly when I played them back with the atrac3 software player and NW-MS7. I worked out that this was because in the setting for the Open MG player I was using an 'optimise cd drive' ( in this case it was a creative encore DVDx2) option. When I reverted back to the default settings the skipping stopped. <p>If you make your own music on your PC this is one of the best ways to listen to your creations. The sound is breath taking. It's converted with depth and clarity.<p>The unit is very easy to use,  you have the opportunity to upgrade the memory and above all it has a rechargable lithium ion battery. This will only give you 4 hours of playback  but you can use it with the AC power cord connected. So it will recharge as you listen to your music or check in/out your next compilation. I have found having another 64 MB memory stick around an advantage. I have one memory stick with my favourite music and I use the other for daily re-arranged compilations - just for variety. This works out a little expensive for 160 mins of music EXPENSIVE - but - this is new technology - remember the price of VHS films when they were first released in the early eighties.<p>It wouldn't have hurt for Sony to install an FM radio into this unit. I think it would have been a nice touch considering the limited storage space. And the headphones  - while excellent for listening to music - I had people staring at me while I was walking down the street. Not because they're cool but because the tips of the earpieces are so shiny they looked like a pair of dangly earrings. Not cool! especially in Hackney Central, London. I  replaced them very quickly.<p>Overall this is an amazing player. I was going to go for the newer NW-E3 but the ability to upgrade the memory and rechargable battery won it for me. In terms of sound reproduction I could not tell the difference between the NW-MS7 and a CD player (even on the default setting) and it looks veryattractive.  However, there are a few niggles with the software and compatibility with other Windows Operating Systems. Most of which, I hope, will be sorted out with upgrades and patches in the future. But, if you have the full installation of Win98 on your system and abit of surplus cash you will be in for a glorious audio experience.

<Content>This is simply the coolest and most functional player out there. It seems as if half the people writing reviews don't even own the player, they're just commenting and adding to what other people have said. <p>What's the big stink about ATRAC? Are you people worried about space on your HD or something? Because if you dont have 200mb (or less) of free space on your computer then what are you doing with something so new and technological as an mp3 player in the first place? The music quality itself is awesome and the player as a whole package really is great.

<Title>Read this before you buy it!
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Two positive things to say about the player: 1.It looks very fancy and is supposed to have good audio quality 2.It is light and easy to use and just looks cool in your hand!<p>But... the provided Open Mg software is awful. It is the worst Jukebox software I have ever seen in my life. I have a feeling that it still runs in a pre-beta. I use win me and when I connected the device with my computer, started the software...&quot;kaboom&quot;, and I recieved a bluescreen message(fatal error). After reinstalling the software for at least 5 times, it still did't work so I called Sony and asked them why it is not working. A friendly person told me that the Open Mg Software doesn't work with windows me and only works with preinstslled Windows 98. He also told me that I can wait till a win me driver will be released. Thanx a lot! I spent [a lot of money] on this thing and now it doesn't work with a new operating system. Tss, tss bad bad software. A stupid thing is also that the player doesn't support mp3, but instead converts mp3 files into atrac3 files which take much storage on your computer together with your mp3's. Now the second thing is, the NW-MS7 is too expensive for a 64Mb mp3 player. You can buy the Rio 500 and spend less money and even although the Rio 500 is pretty old, the software still works better that the Sony NW-MS7. Now I own the Creative Nomad Jukebox and it is so much better. For only 100 bucks more you'll get a 6 Gig storage space with the size of a portable CD player. So if you still use windows 98 and look for a awesome designed &quot;mp3&quot; player and don't care about the software and the price then buy it! If you use win me or 2000 and look for a good working mp3 player and a good software then you should look for something else and don't spend [this much] on a 64 MB player.

<Title>Don't Overlook The Memory Stick!
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I have had my memory stick for around 7 months.  I normally do not write reviews, but I think the reviews on Amazon are unfair to the product.  True, it is not an MP3 player.  True, it takes some time to change files from MP3 to sony's format (the only reason I give it 4, and not 5, stars).  I am not a computer guy, nor am I an electronics guru, and I have no problem converting my music with the sony software.  The rechargable battery, size, weight, ease of use and plethora of features completely outweigh the two cons from above.  So what if it is not a &quot;true MP3&quot; player.  It has operated flawlessly, travels like a champ, is a perfect companian at the gym and gets tons of use.  The magic gate memory stick is a huge plus.  Add more sticks and it's like bringing multiple cd's or mixes with you.  I could go on, but like I said writing reviews is not my thing.  This NW-MS7 is.  If you are in the market for a portable music player of any kind, check this one out.  It truly is awesome.

<Title>EXCELLENT PLAYER!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The functionality and ease of use of this player is so amazing..oh and about ATRAC3, do you people realize that what an mp3 is converted to ATRAC3 it is compressed?! I listen to full-fledged hard rock, not some drum-and-bass junk so listen to this: I had a FOUR MEGABYTE mp3 but after it was converted to ATRAC3 it was ONE AND A HALF MEGABYTES! and it doesn't lose any quality at all!, in fact it sounds even better than mp3 when you're listening to it on the player. Because of this I was able to fit 24 songs on this player with the stock 64MB card!! With a normal mp3 player the files aren't compressed and you can only fit about half the amount of songs as when they're compressed using this player's software. so go buy the Sony NW-MS7 now .... it's the best one out there.

<Title>Come on Sony, you can do better than this!!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I concur with many of the views expressed already:  The hardware unit itself is very much in the tradition of &quot;Sony&quot; quality, which means excellent.  The buttons, especially the jog dial, are easy and intuitive to use, for instance.  It comes on instantly with a press of a button and it also remembers where I left off the last time, both of which I felt were desperately lacking in Creative Nomad II, which I also own.  On Nomad II, it takes at least two push of the Play button (once to turn it on and again to play music) to hear music and it does not have memory function like Sony's MS Walkman, so every time I turn it on, I have to scroll down the list of song titles (which is abbreviated and thus hard to figure out) to get to the last song I heard.  Just by comparing these two features, you can see how I came to regard Nomad II as a computer peripheral (as perhaps should be, considering it is from Creative), while MS Walkman is clearly a portable AUDIO device (again, because it is from Sony). The new MS Walkman (announced in Japan) that has magnesium body casing looks even better.<p>As for the software:  Again, as many reviewers have pointed out, OpenMG Jukebox 1.2 needs a lot of improvement.  However, I might point out, it is not so bad when compared to the software that came with Nomad II (Nomad's has problem handling long file names, for instance).  OMG Jukebox Ver 2 (also announced in Japan) seems like a lot of improvement.  I think Sony should distribute this new version for free to existing users.<p>My biggest complaint is its use of copyright protection technology.  I don't have problem with ATRAC3 per se; I think it actually sounds better, even at lower bitrate (I usually use 66 bitrate to store around 25 songs on 64M Memory Stick), than MP3, though it does not do any better job at compressing (I think WMA and TwinVQ does much better job at making smaller file sizes for similar sound quality than either ATRAC3 or MP3).  The problem is OpenMG, which is Sony's proprietary music copyright protection technology that makes this player SDMI-compliant.  Only the mad scientists participating in SDMI can come up with a stupid idea like &quot;check-in &amp; check-out&quot; for transferring music between PC and portable audio player.  This concept severely limits copying or moving of music, which I suppose is good for music labels and artists, but terribly flawed in context of everyday PC usage.  After ripping from CD, OpenMG-enabled ATRAC3 files cannot even be moved from one harddisk drive to another, let alone copied.  Whereas MP3 file is very much a computer data like any other, OMG ATRAC3 is untouchable as far as your normal computer operation is concerned.  Realizing its limitations, Sony belatedly came up with a backup tool for OMG, which only allows backing up the entire collections (no selective backing up is possible), and only onto a local drive (no network drive).  Since I received MS Walkman, harddisk drives of my notebook PCs (both of which are Sony VAIOs, incidentally) crashed twice, instantlly destroying my entire collection of OMG ATRAC3 music files (just before the second crash, I was thinking about doing a backup but could not get to in time) which were measured at around 4 GB (a few full days worth of ripping CDs...).  Through these crashes, all of my MP3 files survived because I had them backed up in other places (which is easily done).<p>To sum up, MS Walkman (along with its cousins, Netwalk Walkman and Vaio Music Clips) are excellent digital portable music players that can potentially wipe out in one swing all the pretenders and look-alikes from the likes of Creative and Compaq (those are thinly disguised computer peripherals, not audio devices), only if Sony stops fooling around with SDMI and OpenMG (there is nothing OPEN about OMG) and produces straight-ahead &quot;MP3 players&quot;.  Until then, I will stick to my &quot;computer peripheral&quot;, a newly-acquired Nomad Jukebox.

<Content>Three times the software has locked up the computer and then when I rebooted found that it had trashed my drive.  I had to rebuild it from scratch each time.  Very poor. I have since upgraded my computers to Windows 2000 which Sony seems to think noone is using.  They don't support Win2000 or WinME both of which are far more stable than Win95/98.  So, I have shelved my unit and purchased an IGO MP3 Player which is far easier to use, works with modern OS's and is supported.  Sony has failed it's customers because of it's lack of timely upgrades, poor/non available support and lack of support for other operating systems.  If you're smart, stay away from this until Sony changes their bad behaviour.

<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>After much research in the area of portable digital audio, I bought the Sony memory stick walkman. Three days later I returned it. First of all, the software is not compatible with my computer (a Dell Inspiron 5000). I could rip songs from one CD and then it refused to recognize the drive. I'm sure it works fine with a Sony computer, just not with mine.<p>Additionally, I thought a memory stick walkman would be a nice addition because my Sony digital camcorder also uses memory sticks. However, you have to buy a magic gate memory stick to use with the walkman, which costs three times more than the already expensive regular memory sticks.<p>For the money, Sony should really do better. I have since purchased the Nomad Jukebox. I have had no problems at all, plus I don't have to worry about losing a collection of memory sticks since I have 6 GB in one solid piece.

<Title>perhaps a big, huge problem
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I heard from numerous sources that once a song has successfully been stored onto the player then deleted that same song can not be re programed onto the player. This may pose a huge problem to many people, it would certainly annoy me.

<Title>Beware if you have Windows 2000
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>So, you buy a Sony product and expect that the company will support it.  Well, beware!  I have a new computer and can no longer use my MP3 player.  Not only was it unbelievably difficult to figure out how to use the software, but I had to reboot my machine every time I wanted to rip a CD.  Now I can't even use the product.  YIKES!

<Title>Mp3 is great
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I have just purchased this product and I am amased by it's simplicity and how versitle it is. When you buy any new product to do with Pc's you never know what yur gonna get. With this Mp3 player you get great software which makes the transfer of Mp3 from computer to the stick very simple and easy.<p>The stick itself is very small and compact and it looks cool too. There are good clear instuctions on how to install and run it and you can even store all your CDs on your computer. What I do,to save money on buying lots of mg (very expensive), is to get all of my favourite songs and just simply put them on when I get bored instead of storing all the hefty mp3 files on cards(that is what the computers for duuuu). The transfer from Pc to Mp3 is very fast and the big plus for thoughs of you out there with loads of dosh is that it is upgradable which is not avalible with all Mp3 players. The Memory is good as well it is sony's own brand offering MAGIC GATE memory which means it is dead fast. The stick will tell you if it is connected to the computer which is always good to know. Also the stick does not take batteries it just charges up like a mobile phone so you will save loads of money on all thoughs battries that you would have used. <p>Overall this is a very user friendly peice of equipment that looks very cool and beleive me this will make all of your friends gealous when you slap this baby on the table.

<Title>Wake up people!
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Alright...people need to pull their heads outa their butts...HELLO!  The new version of Sony's OpenMG jukebox software is out and it supports ALL windows systems except for Windows XP!  Currently all their players are being sold with the new version and not the old one that all of you are complaining about anymore.  You should have known in the first place that the original software was only compatible with pre-installed windows 98...try looking at the box and the specs before you buy!  It was you at fault, not Sony...<p>Ok, onto the review...this player is simply sick, ill, dope, outa this world.  It's by far one of the smallest I've seen, and even though it is made of plastic like most it is still extremely durable (i've dropped it on my driveway twice and all I got was a tiny knick in the screen)  It's very light and I always forget I have it with me.  Sound quality is great also, I agree with the other guys review about how Sony's OMG format does a great job at compressing those overly large mp3 files into smaller more managable files.  Now...you people may be thinking that you'll still use up all your hardisk space since you'll have both your mp3 and OMG files on your computer...well think for once...convert your mp3 files into OMG,and once your done move all your mp3's onto cd's!  Fast...easy..simple, and saves both you and your computer a headache.  So space isn't even an issue if you only got a couple gigs of space on your computer...I have a Dell Inspiron 8000 with 10 gigs and 600 songs on my computer and have never had a problem!  I think some people are trying to load too many songs on an outdated computer and when something goes wrong they blame it on the software, learn to take responsibility for your actions.  if your gonna buy a 400 dollar player, make sure you have a 4,000 dollar computer!<p>On a closing note, congrads to Sony on another great product.  I have not seen or heard anything better than this player.  I give the NW-MS7 walkman 5 stars...the only reason I may have given it 4 is the price, but I feel like it was worth every penny.  It's the memory stick media itself that will need to go down in price so those fortunate enough to own this player can expand it's memory with additional cards.  Also, for reference...those of you headphone geeks like me who own a large pair of Sennheissers (or the like) you may need a headphone amp if you like your music very loud (my phones have an impedance of 64 olms and without an amp it's loud enough for me...it's only airplances where it gets difficult)  That's it, I apologize if I was rude to those of you who had complaints, I was just makin a point.  Peace out

<Title>Has proprietary  power supply and data storage
<Date>Thu Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>After having this product for a year, I'm shopping for another MP3 player. I've realized that by this product having proprietary powersupply and storage, we are initially forced to stay loyal to this product at exhorbitant prices (i.e for replacements or accessories and sotrage).  It gives me the impression that such companies are insincere towards customer satisfaction in the long run or are not far sighted enough to maintain long term customer relations. My next Mp3 player will have AAA or AA batteries, which I can change anytime without having to replace the entire rechargeable unit after it dies, it will have standard storage as per what market requirements are either MMC/Smartmedia/Compact Flash.  If would be ideal if it also has an FM tuner on it. It should be small and light weight and can be clipped to the belt or arm for purposes at the gym.

<Title>Sony NW-MS7 ups and downs
<Date>Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>After getting my player, it took me about 3 hours to get the software running between my home pc with win xp and my laptop with win2k,  the software is necessary to put mp3's onto the memory stick.<p>here is the dissapointed, this is not an mp3 player, mp3's are converted into another format due to "copyright" protection<br>using the same excuse sony forces you to buy the sony memorygatre memory stick, so you can forget about using generic or even regular sony brand memorysticks, you have to pay more for the magicgate<p>after installing the software and utilizing real player plus to transfer files, it was smooth sailing, encoding of mp3's is bit slow but its more due to my slow pc. <p>Actual preformance and ease of use is classic sony, its small compact user friendly in operation, quality of the music is great, the display is little unsharp in sunlight but its back lit and it helps.<p>over all you will be satisfied if you get over initial installing of Sony open MG software and learn to go around it.

<Content>Great little walkman, however, its not a true MP3 player.<p>It uses its own format similar to MP3, also you can forget downloading MP3's of the net. Idealy if you have the original CD then no problems, otherwise not so good.<p>Also if you want it to run woth XP OS then you might have to send it back to sony for a firmware upgrade, dependant on the age.<p>Happy MP3ing...........

<Content>Awsome little bugger, but the coler is not my cup of tea. I love the ability to switch memory cards, it is a must have extent. This is a great way to listen to music, I love everything but the charger thing on the bottom. I broke it in one day! I am now searching the web for a new one. But still you get what you pay for.

<Title>this is *not* an MP3 player
<Date>Tue May 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>almost too shocked for words - the advertising and packaging clearly mentions MP3. I was very dissapointed to learn that *IT DOES NOT PLAY MP3 FILES*. The player only plays files of the ATRAC format.<p>If you want to use this, be prepared to use the proprietry software and have to re-convert your entire collection.

<Title>Awsome
<Date>Tue Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>An awsome device, handy portable and easy to use (if you are capable of installing for windows xp, and if you cant you are a moron any way) But anyhow do not listen to people saying it is not an mp3 player, all you need to do is go into openMg and turn your mp3's into atrac, it takes meer secconds.  (DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE TECHNOPHOBES WHO SAY IT'S HARD TO USE!!!!!!!!)
