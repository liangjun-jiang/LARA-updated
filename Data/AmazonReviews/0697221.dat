<Title>Very bad company!
<Date>Sat Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I paid over $200 for this product and have owned it for over a year. It stopped working altogether. No music, no nothing. So what will the company do about that?... nothing! By checking their website, I have found out that after 60 days of use of the product, they charge $12.99 just to talk to you about any problem. So I sent them an e-mail instead. Their website said they would respond for free. Four days later... no response. So what to do?... throw the $200 product away and buy a new one or pay them their $12.99 just to ask them what if anything I can do? The Creative company sucks big time and should be avoided.

<Title>Don't waste your money
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After just several months my Zen Micro stopped working. Won't charge, won't come on, nothing. I never even dropped it or anything. I looked on the web for tips and found TONS of people have had the exact same problem with theirs. I wish I had just bought an IPOD like I wanted in the first place. It also looks like creative isn't helpful at all. Research the web  before you buy this product!

<Title>Reliability Issues
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product over two years ago.  I had to get used to having my music organized by album.  The device has taken its fair number of falls.  My first problem with this player happened a few months into use.  The back battery cover became loose; it would slide off if I kept it in my pocket.  The user replaceable batter was part of the reason I bought the devise.  The battery life is now at around three hours when fully charged.  A replacement battery would be $40 and not worth the price.    There were several times in which I thought it would never work again.  At one point I had to delete my entire library and get new firmware.  One of my friends had to do the same with his Zen Micro.  My friend's headphone jack became loose after less than a year.  The mp3 player is useless when the headphone jack goes.  You can only hear part of the music (e.g. the vocals or bass).  My headphone jack became loose a few months later.  I couldn't just put the device in my pocket and go.  It needed to be held in just the right position for the headphone jack to function.  Now, my Zen only works in the docking station I bought for it.  The docking station is not portable.  I invested over thee-hundred dollars into the device and attachments and it doesn't serve its intended purpose a few years later.  I had expected long-term use.

<Title>Great sound...poor battery life....
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great sound on this sleek Micro Mp3. However the battery charge is poor... it only last a little over 3 hrs of playing your favorite tunes. Then it shuts off.  The AC chargers sold here are not comparable...I already bought 2 and they did not work. I'll have to buy the creative charger connector. Should have bought them in the first place, would have avoided all these  extra$$$$$ cost.
