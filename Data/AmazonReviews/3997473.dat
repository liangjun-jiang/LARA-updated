<Title>Awesome product
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product couple of weeks ago and this product is better than what it looks and talks about. Compared to all the MP3 players available including IPOD, this 2GB has along with MP3, the FM, Video, text and the photo  viewer option. Also, there is no iTunes. The browser is very pretty and the the player itself is very sleek. Looks like a very hifi cellphone. Havent found any dislikes yet and I dnt think I will.  Forgot to mention since it is so good, the sound quality. Never thought samsung can come up with such a thing. Buy it.

<Title>The darn thing froze up
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got my player last night after 3 days.  I am very happy in the time that it arrived, however when I went download my music, which was only about 131 songs, the thing froze on me.  Now all I have on my screen is "Transferring files, Do not disconnect"  and it has said that since 11:30pm.  Now it is 5:35 am and it still says that.  Unfortunately, I had to disconnect it so that I can return it.  Little thing is still on.  I mean the sound out of it was great and the size is great for the price.  Didn't find any cases or accessories in stores for it.  So now I have to wait until Samsung opens to call and see if I can't get a new one.  Overall, besides this problem, I liked it.  I even came fully charged and with sample music so you could hear the quality.

<Title>Don't be fooled, keep shopping
<Date>Thu Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In short, the product looks nice and has a cool looking menu with pleasantly futuristic sounds the beep as you navigate throughout. This however is the product's ONLY redeeming feature.  I read some skeptical reviews on my blackberry before making the final purchase, but I figured all the bugs I read about were probably infrequent and would not happen to me.  The problem most likely originates from the proprietary software, included in order to sync up your media with the player. At first glance, it looks simple and easier to use than itunes. While itunes can be a pain to work with, at the end of the day it WORKS, which is more than I can say about Samsung's software.  After adding media to your library, you drag it onto the player, simple enough, except however if you attempt to bring over too many files at a time, the software shuts itself down, refuses to restart, meanwhile the unit itself continues to beam "Transferring files, do not unplug" although it is actually doing nothing.   All you can do now is it unplug the unit and reset it. Attempting to simply power the product off or back on again does not work, and there are no instructions (naturally) with what to do in this case. I managed to figured out on my own how to reset the unit, by pressing the 4 side buttons simultaneously.  At this time the unit restarts itself, with the media you have loaded ready to enjoy! However, you can not add any additional media because now the software (right along with windows itself) no longer recognizes the unit (most likely due to a corrupt file caused by having to reboot the unit or by the bogus software shutting itself off).  I had the pleasure of repeating this process 3 times before I did my blood pressure a favor and returned it to the store.   At the end of the day (literally), I wasted HOURS trying to load this player with 1GB or so of music without success.  I was initially attracted to the products by its slick exterior and the marketing material behind the product at best buy listing it's additional features (video, picture & text viewer, voice recorder, etc). I didn't have the opportunity to sample it in store because the display unit at Best Buy did not work, which would prove to be clever foreshadowing.

<Title>Great Little Package
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Far from a tech junkie I found this small wonder perfect for my needs. I'm 59 yr.s old and wanted a FM radio to listen to while sitting on the beach or mowing the lawn... since receiving it I've downloaded many songs and was  surprised to learn how easy it was to navigate. I am absolutely amazed of the sound quality coming from such a tiny package. Battery life before a required recharge is great. Very pleased with the product. Highly recommended...<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXMVGU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9764866-8178068">Samsung YP-T9JQB 2 GB Digital Multimedia Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Great player... if you can actually get your music on it
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am going to echo many of the other reviews on this product.  The pro's... 1.) affordability.  I bought my 2 gig version for about half the price of an IPOD. 2.) player functionality can't be beat.  In terms of what this mp3 player can do, it blows the IPOD out of the water.  Disregard the fact that I'd never use a voice recorder or an FM tuner, the player itself has cool functions for everyday listening.  My favorite is the 'Street Mode' that seems to give it a bass boost and cancels out noise without increasing the volume and shattering my ear drums.  Con's... The only thing I can say is I would not buy this product ever again, and urge anyone shopping around to look at the CREATIVE players or just go with an IPOD over this Samsung.  The software that comes with it is probably the most user unfriendly thing I have ever encountered in my entire life.  Some of the reviews before spoke of the player freezing in mid download, but I've never experienced that.  My issue is that dragging music onto player, or making playlists and then putting the playlist on the player doesn't actually do anything.  The worst thing is, if you want to add a song to a playlist, you can't just add the one song.  You can try, but what happens is you end up with a playlist with ONLY THE ONE SONG YOU WANTED TO ADD!!!  Instead, you have to recreate the playlist and have the player download all the songs all over again, overwriting the previous ones, JUST TO UPDATE the playlist with one song.  It is the most time consuming and frustrating experience I have ever encountered with a piece of electronics equipment... and I work in the IT industry!  Do yourself a favor and go with something else.

<Content>This is a very good mp3 player. I like all the functions especially the record fm radio for if i have something i can't listen to right away, i could take a listen later. The battery life is great, one 4 hour charge lasts me about 5-6 days for about 2-3 hrs a day. The size is also a plus, No big Bulge in my Pockets!! The only thing i don't like about the player is the ability to manage playlist. Otherwise this is a very good mp3 player.

<Title>inexpensive and nice bright display
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The display on my SanDisk was just too dark to use in normal daylight so I ditched it for this Samsung model.  I'm glad I did. The sound quality is a notch better than the SanDisk and I like the custom equalizer option.  The display is BRIGHT.  I also like that i can simply dump mp3 files into the samsung's music folder directly from My Computer in WindowsXP.  No media player software needed to move music files onto the player.  It isnt perfect though.  The are a few important buttons on the side and you cant easily feel the difference between them when you are walking around.  They are way too small and too easy to accidentally push.  The large front button is great but the side buttons could use a redesign.  The earbuds that come with it are huge!  I dont know who has ears that fit these things.  You'll want some better headphones than what they give you.  Overall a great player for the low price.

EASY TO TRANSFER SONGS ONTO IT FROM EITHER WINDOWS MEDIA 11 OR SAMSUNG MEDIA STUDIO.  DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD FOR IT'S SIZE AND ALL FUNCTIONS ARE EASY TO NAVIGATE AND USE.  ONLY 2 PROBLEMS, THE HOLD BUTTON ON MY UNIT STOPPED WORKING AFTER A FEW HOURS USE AND SOME OF THE WRITING ON THE DISPLAY IS SO SMALL IT IS DIFFICULT TO READ.

<Title>Lousy quality control - STAY AWAY!
<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved my 4GB version, so I ordered the 2GB for my wife.  BIG MISTAKE.  First 2GB arrived previously opened, so I sent it back to Amazon immediately.  Second 2GB arrived unopened and has serious flaw:  it skips MP3 playback anywhere from seconds to minutes.  Sadly, my wife reported the problem 35 days after the order, so Amazon will not take it back.  Samsung will charge $6 return postage and will replace it with "factory reconditioned" model.  STAY AWAY from this product!  If you're lucky and it works, good on you!  If not, too bad.  Might just as well pay $50 less and buy a refurbished one first, rather than wait to have Samsung foist one off on you later.

<Content>I bought these for my sister, and now I want one for myself!! Nice crisp display, great sound, menus and features. For the price tag you think you will get an entry-level player but still, this one has many features other more expensive players DON'T have. I love the FM Radio feature, although sometimes reception is not perfect, but it works. Videos look nice on the screen, and very bright. Photos look awesome. With 2 GB fitting in such a small player and with all these features, AND the ability to dump music directly from your PC, you wonder why people are STILL are buying Ipods. I'm buying a 4 GB for myself.

<Content>Very good player, with all the features listed on the Amazon website.  Battery life is good, playback sounds very good as well.  However, if you are like me and read a review of this product on a certain tech website, and you were expecting Bluetooth, you will be disappointed since this player does not include it.  The model that comes with bluetooth is the T9B, which doesn't appear to even be currently availabe in America.  I can't really take a star off the product or from Amazon, since it was the mistake of the tech website and not Amazon.  Still a very good MP3 player.

<Title>Fantastic value!
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Samsung 2 GB MP3 player to use while working out.  I purchased a refurbished unit and I could't be happier.  The player has workded flawless and I don't know why it was refurbished since it doesn't look like it was ever out of the box - not a scratch on it.  As far as the player itself it has great sound and is sleak and very sturdy.  The screen is bright and actually there is is little I can say that is 'bad'.  The software provided to organize files is not very strong and not as user friendly as it might first appear.  One weakness in that software is that some file manipulations can only be done on the PC and not within the MP3.  Therefore, one has to delete the file from the MP3 player, rework the file, and then transfer back to the MP3 player.  Not too difficult but I would have like the player to performed like another drive of the PC.  One more thing, plan on buying another set of earphones.  The ones provided have excellent sound quality but they are a little large.  All in all - if you can find a refurbished (or new) Samsumg T9, buy it.  I'd do it again for sure.

<Content>This thing beats sparks off an ipod. This unit does 3 times more than an ipod at 3 times less money. It has phenomenal battery life, a simple and easy to use menu and looks good too. My only complaint with the unit is that I can't get it to display album cover art during music play. If you take advantage of Amazons free shipping don't expect to receive it anytime soon, they won't ship for at least 5 days (i guess it's a punishment for not paying for shipping) 09/26/2007 My unit has started displaying album art so now I have no complaints about this MP3, I've owned it for several months now and still love it!

<Title>If you want a great player for podcasts (and music) this is the one for you!
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks. I was looking for a player that would be great for that and I found it. The T9 is about the same size as the ipod nano and has a feature which the ipod (as far as I know) does not - the ability to playback at various speeds. I know for music fans this is not a helpful feature, but there are also extensive sound options as well which the music lover would find helpful. Other features which are great are the bookmarking and accelerating fast forwarding  Video playback is pretty good as well as recorded voice and FM radio. The playlist program is also fairly simple to operate.  The only downsides I have found so far is that upon power up, the volume always resets itself to about 20 (out of 40)  Also, there are some user interface tweaks that would make things a bit more helpful.  All around a great alternative to Sansa and Ipod.

<Title>Great as far as I can tell....(for now)
<Date>Sat Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not really a connoisseur of Mp3 players so I speak not from experience. So now that you've been warned, let me say that the Samsung 2GB is a great product (so far). I've had it for about 2 months now and so far so good. I've read all the other reviews on this product before I purchased it and decided that this was one (of a few) where the pros outweighed the cons. Have I experienced any lockups? Yes. One to be exact. But with the press of a button (well, you hold down 2 buttons really) it resets and you don't lose your songs or your playlists...cool.  I also saw one review that stated that it was (almost) impossible to add just one song to your existing playlist (which I thought sucked but I bought it anyway) but I found this not only to be untrue but also quite easy. Of course I don't know anything about the person who wrote this review... if it were a un-tech savvy  elderly person who's grandchildren  bought him/her the MP3 player so he/she could enjoy their favorite bandstand music while in the park, then that review might make sense (Jeez that was snide and I apologize for it). You simply add the new song to the playlist and then hit "transfer to portable device". Samsung's program then asks you "what songs do you wish to overwrite in this playlist" (I don't know why it asks this, it just does) you simply click on "uncheck all" since there's no reason to spend the time re-downloading the songs that are already ON the MP3 player and hit "continue." It will just download the one song and BAM you're done.  Another cool feature is that you can listen to and record FM radio (also voice). So I can save up some of my favorite morning shows while I sleep and save them for later like when I'm stuck in a long line (yeah, it's a nerdy thing to do but it's a lifesaver when you're bored outta your skull.)

<Title>The Fabled Nano-Killer
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall, I've had good a experience with this player.  PROS: 1) It's small. 2) It's durable (I've accidentally dropped it several times). 3) It's easy to operate one-handed. 4) You can drag-n-drop standard MP3s onto it. 5) It can hold a lot of content. 6) It plays well with Napster. 7) It supports playlists created with a music service. 8) The screen is nice to look at (unless you're in direct sunlight). 9) The battery stays charged for a lot longer than I thought it would (three or four days at about two hours per usage).  CONS: 1) The position of the play/pause button. When trying to clip it onto my pocket while it's in the case I sometimes press it down by accident for too long and turn the player off. 2) The shuffle function. It doesn't shuffle every time you power it on, you have to force it to. When I add/delete songs it will shuffle, but otherwise it won't unless I change the play mode to normal then change it back to shuffle. 3) I haven't figured out how to delete the games so that I can have more space for music.  To me, this MP3 player is truly the fabled Nano-killer.

<Content>Well I don't know about other product but I can compare this mp3 player with Ipod and sandisk sansa c250.   I have an Ipod mini but my husband wanted to have a mp3 player as well. So we searched a bit. At first, we bought a sansa c250 since it was very cheap and the review were not bad. But in 5 hours, that thing started to turn off randomly whenver we just tough it. So we just returned it. Then we thought maybe we just should get Ipod although that is pricy. But Ipod does not have FM radio feature. So we ended up with this one. We thought that samsung won't break down as easy as sansa..   Then,.. here it comes yp-t9. Wow, really wow! We did not expect this thing to be this good. The sound - not even comparable with Ipod. And very very clear FM radio. And this look very cute too!   We are 99% satisfied with samsung yp-t9.   The only thing my husband complaining is this mp3 player is so tiny it is somewhat hard to operate the button with his big hands, specially the one on the side.

<Content>You know the expression, better to do a few things very well then try to do everything half-baked. Well Samsung really delivers here and more so. This is my first post-IPod-Nano generation type player and it's awesome from the look and feel. The best aspects are long battery life and ability to manage the files through Windows Explorer. That's an absolute must for me, I hate to have to transfer files with clunky bug-ridden software and famous "auto-sync".  Pros:  * long battery life * Windows Explorer access  Cons:  * only 2 GB storage

<Content>This is the first player I've had. I researched several players online and chose this one. I initially wanted a music only model but the more I researched the more I realized the usefullness of having the photo option. I take digital pictures and keep them on my computer and cd's. That's great for storage purposes but doesn't allow for sharing them at work or with extended family. This little player has great screen quality. The pictures are clear and the color is great. I can show off my kids pictures anywhere. I also appreciate the ease of navigating the menu's. I had to get used to using the included software. I would prefer to just use Windows Media Player for syncing my music and pictures. It is very easy to drag and drop the music files into Samsung Media Studio5. All in all I would give this player very high marks for ease of use and quality of sound and picture. As with any of the players out there the ear buds included seem to be designed for people with freakishly large ear holes. I bought my own pair at Wal Mart for 20.00.

<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This little Samsung is an amazing MP3 player.  I bought if for my son for Christmas 2007 and he just loves it.  It is a great size and he loves the look.  He wishes it could use Itunes to download because it is so easy, and is getting used to using the Samsung included software as well as Window Media player.  He likes the recorder function and the speeding up function so every song sounds like the chipmunks are singing it.  Don' we love 12 year olds.  He asked for anything but and Ipod and seems happy with it.  I will probably get him another player in year or so, but at this amazing price if he loses it it won't be $200-$300 lost.  He is proving his responsibility.

<Title>Explanation: How to put videos into the player
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After buying my great player, I was looking at the reviews page, when I saw someone saying that the player does NOT play videos. This is absolutely a lie, and I'm going to explain why.  The Samsung Media Studio, that COMES WITH THE PLAYER, before getting your video in the player, convertes it into a different type of video, the svi.  FOR EXAMPLE: I made a beautiful video on the Movie Maker, and then, using the Samsung Media Studio, I was copying into my yp-t9. In this process, the software was also converting my video from WMA to this SVI format that only the player accepts.   So, if you don't have the software, you really can't put videos on your player (because only the Samsung media studio can convert your videos to svi), but the thing is: THE SOFTWARE IS INCLUDED! So, there's nothing to worry about.  About the player, the only thing I can say is that it's absolutely awesome! It's a great player, with a great price, and all the dollars I paid absolutely worth it! I recommend it!

<Title>I bought this because I am not a person who buys iPods because I know there are other alternatives.
<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am not someone who walks into the Apple Store at the Shops at La Cantera and buys an iPod because those aren't the ONLY ALTERNATIVES to portable CD players. I bought this Samsung Yepp T9 (2 gigabyte) at Best Buy.(Sorry Amazon you didn't have this on your site on October 4.)I bought this because My SanDisk Sansa M240 got broken by this jerk in My BSA troop because I didn't buy an iPod like he expected. (What a Jerk!) After a few weeks using my 8 year old Sony walkman CD player I bought this to break away from the iPod/iTunes life, and I like it.  PROS: Video Photos Games Text viewer Flash games FM radio Voice/FM recording Color screen Not an iPod  CONS: No Audible support yet No accessaries yet because this is new Making your own playlist is weird because if you have the same songs on your T9 they show up twice. i.e. You have White and Nerdy on your T9 and that song is on a Favorites playlist you have an extra White and nerdy.  I hope You like my review. Oh yeah, I'm really 16 ,but I have no email address.

<Title>Love it
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought this for my 9 year old for her birthday. It is great. It is small and light. Easy to use. My daughter was navigating around this without ever having looked at the instructions. We downloaded some of her favorite cds in minutes and she was walking around like a teenager in training. It has great sound and comes with a cute video that plays so amazingly clear. We still haven't added any of our own videos so I'm not sure how easy that is. The main thing I find to be a problem is the radio setting. The stations don't come in very clear. This has so many more features than the ipod at a lower price. You can record yourself, display pictures, play video, has fm radio-though not very good- and of course play lots of songs. Really great mp3 player.

<Title>Not bad at all-  does support drag and drop 
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the purple one but otherwise they are the same.  I just got mine today so I cant comment yet on durability. It's small, light, no hard drive, headphones aren't bad.  The screen looks really good for what it is. I too have yet to try and put a movie on it so i don't know how well that works.  The short clips on it look pretty good. Pictures look decent enough.  It does have drag and drop functionality i was a bit leery it would be tied to the software but it's not WMP will work too i guess.  Mine came with latest firmware on it so this may be a new feature.It does have its own proprietary plug would be nice if it was straight usb but it does the job. Song transfer via explorer was fairly quick about as fast as any other flash drive imo.  All in all this thing is pretty cool. Will update if i remember too after i use it for while.

<Title>Samsung T9 -- the best quality and the best value
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let's see.....my new Samsung T9 plays MP3 music formats easily and clearly (put in about 350 already), plays video clips in a beautiful TV-like display (put in about six animes), plays flash games (has two and I plan to put in some), is a text reader (put in five long .txt files already including an English Dictionary and The Complete Brothers Grimm Stories), has a voice recorder (I recorded my professor's entire 40-minute class lecture), has super clear FM reception, and at least 34 hours of battery life (which exceeds the rated 30 hours). On top of this, I got a shiny and smooth, solidly-made and durable, and concise but complete high-quality entertainment gizmo that I can enclose in my hand and that is my new Samsung T9 Multimedia Player.    Now my Ipod Nano (which costs at least 40% more) plays MP3 and....uh..... well.....that's it I guess.

<Title>Had a lot of issues at first
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had a lot of problems with the first generation firmware. I believe part of it was also my using Windows Media 11 (which was on Beta stage when I purchased this in October). Windows media 11/ MTV Urge wouldn't always bring up the player to sync. I would have to reformat the player using Samsung Media Studio 5 to have WMP 11 see the player. I recently updated the player's firmware to 1.27 (released Nov 11, 2006) and it seems to be working fine now. Having used firewire transfers on iPods, I find this USB transfer/sync to be really slow. Now, the good things about this player are its durability, attractiveness, well-designed user interface and excellent sound quality. It has more features than I need or use--such as voice recorder, FM player, video player,and (Adobe/Macromedia) Flash-based games. All in all, this is a great player for someone looking for a small MP3 player capable of playing subscription music.

<Title>Satisfied
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very happy with this MP3 player. I have shopped around looking at different options and am glad I chose this one. The only issue is that it is not exactly 2GB it is actaully 1.83. My freind bought hers at a electronics store, not amazon and hers has the same issue. So my best bet is that all of them are like that. Which is a rip off. But it's still a great price.

<Title>Nice MP3  Samsung T9
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm OK on a computer and can do about everything that I want. This is my 1st MP3.  Pros: Small and seems durable.  Plug for headphones is strong Sounds great Easy buttons and menus Pics are good for such a small screen. I saw smaller when I was looking at others.   Cons: Downloading is confusing. Sometimes you have to use Window Media, and sometimes Samsungs program. I'm still not comfortable with it, but it does work. When I download something it wipes out my favorite list and organizing your files with the Samsung program it tough. I'm hoping I can figure it out. The foam pieces on the headphones fall off and get lost easily. I found replacements at Radio Shack. Manuel on disc isn't much help.   Overall I like it. It plays my songs, shows my pics of my grandaughters and is a well built unit. And thats what I was looking for!!

<Title>Flash - Yes, but No, Not Really
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I didn't actually buy this device, but I suggested it to a friend who did. He was very impressed by my IRiver U10 (now Clix) because of the Flash Games. Come to find out the device will only play the two games that come with the device. The flash files are part of the firmware and thus are not visible or removeable, and even more important, you CAN NOT add new games or programs. This is a shame because there are a growing number wonderful flash games and applications available. This was confirmed on the Adobe site, but is mentioned nowhere on the Samsung site or manual.  If you want this MP3 player, buy it. It's really pretty and seems totally awesome other than this major oversight on Samsung's part. Hopefully Samsung will get it right and release a new firmware version that supplies the functionality advertised. For now my buddy will return his and I won't recommend it.
