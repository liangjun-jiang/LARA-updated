<Title>Small things comes in small package
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>5-12-07 I started with the MUVO when I first joined Audible, then I graduated to the MUVO TXFM 1GB.  I couldn't be more happier. With my initial MUVO I could load up to 7 unabridged books into it.  Now with the 1GB, I could load up to 15 unabridged book with several more to spare. I take this little MPlayer in my travels and it has never let me down. For the price it is well worth it. I would recommend it anytime. Oh and I am 62 yrs old too!!

<Title>Excellent portable music player with many features
<Date>Fri May 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1 GB of music is plenty for the average person on the go.  Flawless, no-install use as a USB drive makes this device ultra-compatible.  FM tuner works well as a bonus.  The only drawback encountered so far is the sheer smallness, which unfortunately makes it easier to lose.  Luckily, there's a built in lanyard loop for attaching the Muvo to keychains, lanyards, or whathaveyou.

<Title>Good value.
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is not as intuitive as my Rio but once you get used to it it works well. What I don't like is having to use the included software to load it. It doesn't work with the third party software I use with the RIO. Not sure if that's Creative or the software vendor. My only complaint with the player is that it doesn't come with an armband and instead includes a necklace from which it hangs. That's ok if you're hanging out, but if you are working out or playing sports it bounces off your chest.

<Title>Tough little unit
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the 256 MB version for a year and just upgraded to the 1 GB. The scroller wheel is easy to navigate and I don't even need to look at it to change certain functions. I work (cleaning carpet) with this daily and it has taken a beating and still works fine, the glass window is even cracked and I won't get rid of it. I'm very tough on things and have been surprised at the backbone this player has, I've been through three sets of headphones in this time. There was a firmware upgrade for my player but I never took it because it was working fine with no bugs. Since it's windows friendly putting on music is as easy as it gets, no software installations required unlike ipods. If mine ever break I will buy another one with out a doubt.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Sat Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the 256 MB Muvo mp3 player for 3 years and just bought the 1 GB player.  The Muvo is superior to most players.  Although I am not as happy with Creative's Zen mp3 player, this player works very well. If you are not looking for a player with a large storage capacity, this is a great option.   Unlike some other players Muvo does not have a touch screen, which makes it possible to navigate without having to look at the screen (very convenient when working out).  The scroll button is quite ingenious - one pull forward allows you to skip forward one song, and one pull back to go back a song.  Pressing down on the scroll button twice allows you to access the album list, through which you can navigate in a similar fashion - one pull forward to go forward an album, and one pull back to go back an album.  And the size of the player is just right - fits in the palm of your hand.   There is no need to carry around any cables because the player has a built-in USB plug for transferring files and it uses a AAA battery.  Not having to look for an outlet when the player dies makes this player great for long trips.  I use Rayovac rechargeables and get at least 10 hours of music out of each. I prefer players with removable batteries, because any rechargeables gradually "drain" over time, and it is much easier to get a new rechargeable AAA battery than to replace a custom built-in mp3 battery.     As for the special features, the voice recorder is quite convenient and I have used it to study, mainly to memorize vocabulary. Note that there are two Muvo models - one with and one without an FM radio. The player with the voice recorder and FM radio also allows you to record radio.  Lastly, the player is quite durable - I've dropped it a few times and got it wet, but it still works great.  All in all, a very versatile player; an excellent choice for those on the go.

<Title>Nice but...
<Date>Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was my first MP3 player. I read tons of reviews before deciding which one to purchase. In the end I settled on this one.  Likes: It is light and easy to carry around. Comes with clip and armband so that if you wish to walk, run or go to the gym this one is for you.  It is really simple to use. Downloaded songs from Rhapsody is so simple just drop and drag and you're done!  It takes 1 AAA battery that seems to last forever! It's nice to have a battery that you can get from any store in case you run out.  Dislikes: The most disappointing thing for me was the way the player organized songs. It did so in alphabetical order, instead of in the order that I wanted to listen to the songs. I work as a DJ and it was one of the reasons that I bought an MP3 player. So that I could download my playlist and simply press and play and pause on air without having to shuffle through songs. I tried everything, even renaming the songs a,b,c d. etc... to get the player to order them like I wanted. Nothing worked. I called creative and asked the rep if or how I could change this feature. He said there was no way to do so. That the player would always alphabetized the songs by title and play them back that way! AGGGGGGGH!!!!!!  The head phones hurt my ears. So I bought another pair.   The FM radio tuner is not very good and hardly ever picked up a radio station. I live in the boonies so maybe I'm being unfair. An urban environment might produce better results.  Anyway I LOST the player after only having it for about three weeks. My spouse says I need something bigger. I disagree. I just need to be more careful. I would have easily purchased another one of these for the cost and ease of use it was worth every dollar. BUT since it does not allow me to list my playlist to my listening preferences I'm going to have to search for another product. If anyone has something that he/she would recommend to fit my needs that would be great.  Thanks.

<Title>MuVo is EASY!
<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It actually a bit startling to find out how easy this little thing is... We use it just during flights and the battery lasts forever (a minimum 15 hours but possibly longer...). Sound is clear and crisp, bass is sufficient, and the LCD control is very intuitive. The set-up on the computer take less than 5 minutes even for a computer idiot like me, the fact that it is it's own USB simplify things to no end. For loading and rearranging files or songs you just need to know how to drag items with your mouse - no kidding - that's it! Five left thumbs up!!!

<Title>Built Ford tough
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this back when it was over $100. And even though it has dropped to the 70's, i'm still glad i bought it back then.  I love all of its features including: detachable USB, AAA battery, FM tuner, voice recorder, SUPER easy drag and drop capability. No need to use any software with this baby, just plug it in! Using a AAA battery instead of a built in means this thing will only die when the little harddisk inside dies!  I use an Energizer rechargable battery and keep a spare one charged up all the time so i never need to be around an outlet or computer to charge this mp3 player.  I've read reviews that badger its detachable usb, but i'd say its the thing that makes it stand out from an ipod! I use it for load homework to bring to school, and basically use it as flashdrive that i'll always have with me.  As for my review title, I've labeled this thing the toughest mp3 player i've ever met is that because i'm an on the move, and forgetful guy. So sometimes i leave things i need in the wrong places. i've left this thing [with and without beltclip/cover on] in my pants that eventually end up in the wash! It has survived two separate trips in my washing machine. All i had to do was air it out with a can of compressed air and it was working like new!  Now for the downside. I would take away one star though because i bought my brother a 512 version and it died before mine did. That may just be a coincidence though. Also, the "scroll" key to go on to another song/fastfoward can be a little troublesome at times.  All in all i'd give MY mp3 a 110% rating. As for the mp3 in general, a 93% would suffice.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my wife's birthday.  It was her first mp3 player, so I chose something that had sufficient memory, but not too pricey.  She uses it primarily for exercise, so the flash memory was a must.  I've also recorded a live event (speaker) for her, and the voice quality was exceptional.  For the $$, this is an excellent product.

<Title>1 GB Creative Muvo TX player is great!
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is a great mp3 player.  It has sufficient power to drive decent headphones and battery life is long.  I like the AAA battery better than having a rechargable battery internally because if you're on the go and your battery dies, you can just pop in a new one instead of having to stop and recharge it.  The controls are very intuitive and easy to use.  The radio works well and has lots of preset options.  You can also customize the EQ on 5 frequencies.  I have a belt clip and an armband for mine and like them.  The thumb drive feature is nice as well.  I enjoy all features this player provides!  I bought one for my wife, then got myself one because it is so nice. This player also recieved the c-net editor's choice award.

<Content>Fine product, I've owned one for quite some time, I believe over two years.  (I'm old and over 65)  I bought this one for my wife, so she would give mine back .... she kept stealing mine to use at work.  I love to use these mp3 players while I work, just load them up with your own music and boogie on with a pack of "disco duck" tunes. My only complaint is that they only come in red, our situation with two of these is that we mix them up, my wife doesn't have the musical tastes I have ......  so a "baby blue" and a "girlie pink" would just make everything much better in our humble abode .....

<Content>This MP3 is small, has FM, and serves as a flash drive so it doesn't need wires to connect to a PC.  Perfectly suits my needs.  I gave it only a four because it did not connect to the pc directly out of the package and the instructions didn't help.  It took me a while to get it to connect.  But now it works perfectly.

<Content>I like the compact size of this.  I got the armband and it's great for taking to the gym.  I don't use the headphones that came with it.  They won't stay in my ears. I downloaded alot of songs on it but sometimes the songs don't show up.  I find the Creative tutorial for downloading the songs confusing so I go thru WMP but I still have problems now and then.  I like the fact that there aren't alot of bells and whistles on this.  It's pretty user-friendly as far as scrolling through songs and the volume button.

<Title>Work horse that does it's job
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:  Small size, slips easily into your pocket  Looks great, slick red color  Durable and simple. No worries that you will crack the screen. You can take it to the gym and not worry about breaking it.  Flash based. No moving parts to fail or hard drives to crash  Comes with a nice clip-on case that attaches to your belt or waist band  No adapter cables necessary to connect it to your computer  Can double as a flash drive  Uses one AAA battery that lasts a long time, no fooling with a USB cable to recharge, just pop in a new battery. Great for when you are traveling and don't have a computer around, or you are hit by a hurricane and the power is out       Cons:  Tiny display, but at least it's backlit. Some players in this price range have no display *Cough* Ipod Shuffle *Cough*  Small capacity compared to other more modern flash based players  Awkward controls. Scroll wheel thingy is small and doesn't feel all that great  As of the date of this review - for just a little more money, you can get an MP3 player that has more capacity and a much bigger color screen that can show pictures and even movies       Summary:  this player is good for doing it's job, which is to play music. I take away one star because the scroll wheel control isn't that good. The Sansa M series, which I have also owned, is similar and has better controls. I like this player better than the Sansa M series because it just looks so much cooler and plugs into my computer without an adapter.  Overall, my Muvo has served me well. I'll keep it as a backup and for jogging etc, but for a little more cash you can pick up a player that does much more. This one is good pick up if you can get it for a low price as a backup player.

<Title>SO far, SO good!!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I actuall give this player 4 1/2 stars!  I've had this player for a month now.  I must say, for the money this is GREAT!!  I've had no issues and like all the features it offers!!!  It is very simple to figure out and was no fuss to transfer songs to.  The only thing I really need now is a clip for it.  I do really wish it had one.  I don't like the neck lanyard very much.  When i run with it around my neck I feel like it is pulling and it just bounces everywhere!  I've been holding it in my hand with the lanyard in my hand too.  That's not too bad to do.  During winter it should be easy... Just make sure you run with a sweatshirt that has a pouch pocket in the front and you can stick it in there(put the player under your sweatshirt at the top and pull it out the bottom).  I did that a few days ago when it was 50 outside.  It worked like a charm!!! VERY GOOD product though.  NO other complaints.  Just put a clip on it!!!

<Content>My wife does not like the menu system where the MP3 ID tags are read and used to select songs and create playlists. She much prefers this unit's simple style of creating folders via an Explorer Window. When her first Creative MP3 player died (after ALOT of usage), I replaced it with a competitor's product and she hatd it. She is so GLAD to be back with this unit's menu system. She loves the player and takes it everywhere with her!

<Title>Simple and good
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and I quite enjoy it.  Mind you, this is my first mp3 player and I don't own a computer so I wanted something that didn't require me to have to keep a program on my computer in order to listen to it (i.e. the IPod).  This little player is really just a 1 GB jump drive with a headphone outlet so you can't get more simple than that.  In hind sight, I think I should have bought the 2 GB version since I hardly listen to the radio these days.  Other than that I like it.  Sound quality is good (the earubuds are comfortable and work well).  I can even plug this thing into my stereo at home which I really love to do.  I'll eventually invest in a much larger mp3 player (possibly even the IPod, gasp) but for now this suits my needs.  It travels well and is perfect for the gym since you don't need 5,000 songs to generally get through a workout (and if you do, then you must be exhausted).  Also, a good thing to note is that you don't really have to worry about jostling this thing too much since it uses flash memory versus a hard drive.  Overall, a good product for the money, but I wouldn't spend much more on it than I did because as I said, it's just a jump drive with a headphone outlet (so shop around to get the best price).

<Content>Having bought three very expensive Ipods for my sons, I thought I would take a different tact and try this product and I couldn't be more pleased.  It is extremely easy to load music into it and the playback sounds great.  There are so many features packed into this tiny, lightweight package that I cannot believe the price I paid for it.  The only minor drawback I would mention are the earbuds.  They are a little tricky to get seated properly but having tried a couple of other brands, I came to realize just how great these were sound-wise.  Overall, I couldn't recommend a product more highly.

<Title>a classic
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've bought one of these for 4 members of my family and have 2 for myself. They're  basically a 1 GB flash drive that plays mp3s. It is the size of lighter, needs no cord to plug into computer, and needs no software (just drag & drop your mp3 or podcasts).  It is Extremely kind on batteries.  FM reception is just OK and needs headphone cord as antenna (if you're a radio junkie and far from your favorite station, check out the portables by Sangean).  Caution: some older desktops (with USB in back) will have trouble accommodating this.    There have been frequent firmware updates, and I will mourn the time when I have to replace mine (assuming @pple squeezes every other model off the market).  I've used the voice recorder rarely but it is a nice bonus.  Incidentally, I've had my current one for 3 years w/o trouble. My wife has one of the original 256 MB 5 years and going strong

<Content>I needed a voice recorder with portability and usb flash.  I read almost all reviews before I made a decision.  After a few tests, I couldn't agree with the positive reviews here.  This product can be used as a usb flash drive. But if you want to expect a nice mp3 player that can record voices and play it back, you will definitely be disappointed.  I tried to return this product after a few tests. Unlike this seller's pledge like "buy with confidence," this merchandiser does not allow a return of any opened item.  I really hope no one gets frustration by purchasing this useless junkie from this vendor.
