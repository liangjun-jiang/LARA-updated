<Title>Didn't work
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I could not get the songs to download to the MP3 player.  I followed the instructions word for word and it would not work.  The system froze and when I unplugged it from the USB cable it stopped working all together.  I attempted to contact Coby's customer service but you can not get through on their phone lines.  I finally emailed their technical center and received a generic response.  I continued to question them about the problems with connecting and downloading and COBY instructed me to return these to Amazon?!?!?!?!

<Title>It works.....
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this for my Girlfriend to use at work.  I gave it two stars because it's functional, and it looks good (she really likes it).  Memory expansion is a plus.  FM works fine, decent reception.  The third star is because its relatively simple to use/figure out.  Documentation is minimal, transfer connection was picky using the cable.  Memory card works fine (Corsair 512mb), and is fairly straight forward....almost.  Would have gotten more stars if not for:   Battery indicator flashes empty at about 2 hours use...but will run for another 10-12 hours.   Files are stored in 4 unnamed folders under the menu, different for recordings, voice memos, files on the player, and files on the card, but with no labels, its certainly not straight forward.   Headphones that come with it are garbage...the $3.99 gas station special is just as good/better.    If it could handle a larger memory card (1-2GB) that would earn a star alone....says it only supports up to 768 total (untested by me).   Coby support (website) is terrible.  But hey, what do you expect for $35?

<Title>Coby MP-C741 MP3
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a novice, I needed some help figuring out how to load onto a data card instead of to the memory, the directions were not clear about how to do that. The single AAA battery only lasted the length of 4 mp3 cd's. On the plus side, it is light and easy to read and I love the data card option to take extra music and audio books with me. It's a keeper at a great price for someone like me.

<Content>Priced right, works fine.  I'm not happy with the usb connection, it broke in the first week, so all of my music is on the 1 gig sd card I put in.  Battery lasts maybe 5 hours.

<Title>doesn't work
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I put it because one of the reviews here said the player came with a CD that had the Windows 98 driver. Well it didn't. And the driver at Coby's web site doesn't work. I installed it but Windows reports no driver. Fortunantly I bought it locally and can return it. But I'm agrreivated. Don't lie in reviews.
