<Product Name>EZMP3 Player 128 Mb Built In Sd Card Slot Upgrade To 2.0 Gb
<Title>3.5 Stars....Very Basic and inexpensive MP3 player
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this unit mainly because of its price because there doesn't seem to be any 128mb MP3 player with an SD slot with a price less than this model.  Overall it is not a bad unit. Sound quality is average (although there is NO bass). It is lightweight and very easy to use.  The first unit that I bought has a factory defect where the USB port is improperly aligned so I cannot get the cable to connect.  As a result, I have not been able to try the products internal memory (I have only used the SD slot). Hopefully this was just an early production defect... I will exchange this unit and update this review if there are any problems or changes with the replacement.  *** Positive Points of the Irock EzMP3 model 930 include: ***  - Decent construction that seems like it will be able to take a beating.  Also it is very lightweight and small in size making it easy to carry.  - Rubberized plastic case that surprisingly feels nice and upscale.  - Battery compartment has a hinged cover so you don't have to worry about losing it.  - Decent battery life from a single AAA battery.  - Tech support was easy to reach and you get to talk to human and not a machine!!   *** Negative points include: ****   - Sound quality from the earphones is only average. There is no bass and there is no sound equalizer to adjust the music.  Also the earphones have the neckstrap integrated with them so if you buy better quality earphones you will not be able to use the neckstrap.  - There is no LCD screen and no battery level indication  - Will only play MP3's so you are out of luck if you have WMA or any other type of files  - instructions are very minimal, then again the unit is very simple to use so they cover the basics (although I still don't know what the green LED is for!!).   All in all this is not a bad MP3 player if you are looking for something that is durable and cheap... just don't expect 5 star sound or features!!!

<Title>Terrible product!!!!
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The price was great and that is exactly why I bought it.  But, I got just what I paid for!!!  It worked great for the first 2 weeks and then it was downhill from there. The volume turns down on it's own! I would lose all of the music on the player for no reason and finally the thing just died after about a month.  The company was great and gave me a new player to replace the original piece of crap I bought.  They didn't give me a hard time or didn't question me at all.  I was very pleased with that.  I still have the replacement and it's been at least a year.  It works good except for I don't get sound into both ear pieces of my headphones unless I push the headphone slot to the side and it works.  Anyways, this product is not worth the money.  spend a little more money and get a good product.

<Title>Very unreliable - avoid

<Content>I bought this for my sister for her birthday.  It didn't work.  I contacted the company, which took way too long to respond.  They said the problem was mechanical. I sent it in for repair. They sent it back and it worked... for a few weeks. Now it won't start up anymore.  Do NOT buy this product.

<Title>Little But Mighty...
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have 2 of these MP3 players. The sound is great. Because they're rubber coated you don't have to baby them. They're small and made for the small pocket in your jeans. Very user friendly. So easy to work with. I use it in my car. I have yet to have any problems with this critter. This is a "must have" item. No regrets :) Danny-N-Oregon

<Title>forget it

<Content>The reason the previous reviewer could not get the built in memory to work is almost certainly that there is no built in memory.  Or at least, there isn't any in the unit I received.  Not 128 mb, not any mb.  So don't buy this thing unless you also buy a memory card for it.
