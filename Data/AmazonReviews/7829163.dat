<Title>User interface is slow!
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After trying several units at different Apple stores, all of the new iPod Classics suffer from a slow interface. Apple added Cover Flow and additional graphics but apparently underpowered the device and menu items have a noticable delay, Cover Flow is slow to refresh and even the clickwheel navigation is sluggish. These problems are not shared by the new Nano, which operates beautifully. I wanted to buy the classic, but now will go with either a Nano or a Touch.

<Title>Still great for Music and awesome storage space
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have 4 iPods including a 2G refurb I keep in my car.  So obviously they work well for me.  There are a number of solid alternatives to the iPod and depending upon your needs one of those could be better value.  For the classic the screen is too small for video but that is true of most "video" players and cell phones.  Overall the Apple iPod + iTunes experience can not be beat.  It is an elegant seamless integration and experience.  An often overlooked feature of getting an iPod is that there are tons of accessories to select from and that alone is compelling reason to go with an iPod.  If video is must look elsewhere perhaps to the iPod touch (great screen and makes video actually an option) or one of the Archos options (better screen size and storage then the touch and some with video in option).  If you need a voice recorder or fm tuner other options such as those from Creative might suit you better.  These can be added to the iPod but only at additional costs.  But the core - the simplicity, power of use, battery life and organizing and storing music, photo and video files the iPod is still the best.  Don't get distracted by bells and whistles that really are not important to your core end user experience.  Don't focus on  marginal battery draining features like Zune's wifi unless you really think that those feature are important to you.  If you are on a budget and are willing to forego Apples legendry and well deserved elegance, you can find a decent player for much less.  If you have more specific needs add them to the vlaue equation and figure if the iPod + accessories is worth the extra cost to you.  And if you want a great music player that simply works go with an iPod.

<Title>Too good to be true!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always thought that an ipod sold solely because of publicity. I assumed that most people who bought it didn't research well or didn't know what they wanted to buy. I was often surprised to see people buying one ipod after another for their family and friends!   Now I know how wrong I was!   I am finally a proud owner of the 80 GB Classic (Black)! Now, I'd like to jump to the list of pros and cons for this great product:  PROS: 1. Unbelievably slim for an 80 GB player. 2. All metal design is really impressive (less scratches). 3. Cover flow definitely adds a lot of pleasure to the user experience. 4. Preview for the selected menu option is impressive. 5. More controllable click wheel. 6. Great Battery life. 7. Great Extras (especially the games)  I guess, I could go on n on n on...  CONS: 1. Menu to Cover flow transition is slow. 2. iTunes consumes all your resources on PC. 3. I'm not sure about the datastructure in an ipod, but it seems that if there is an album in which there are songs by various artists, the album shows up as many times as the number of artists in the cover flow mode. 4. Although certain photos get copied but they don't open (Note: They are visible as thumbnails) 5. Need more menu options for photo viewer. 6. Can't change EQ settings from a song. Need to go to the menu->setings->EQ to change it. 7. Artwork for certain albums don't show up even though iTunes shows them correctly.  Finally, I would definitely like to say that this is a great product and one of it's kind. Once you own it, you would never wanna part with it!

<Title>Nice capacity, but that's it...
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is definitely a great gadget, but not the best out there. It still gets scratched just as the other ones, but that's no surprise. I was excited to see how the cover flow feature would work, since it was on the iPod Touch also, and it was not that great. It is slower that the touch and freezes on some occasions. I did like how they kept it sleek and thin as it used to be. It didn't come with many accessories (this means no protective sleeve either), but I didn't mind since I didn't end up paying for the iPod. It's also very affordable, unlike the other iPods. And for those wondering how I "got" my iPod go here -> http://flingk.com/n21v9v1 I saw it on CNN, FOX, G4TV, so I tried it and it actually worked! Overall this is a great MP3 Player, but not the best.

<Title>Music Great.... Video lets hope for a update
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the Classic now for 4 days.  The interface is much better than Gen 5 but the Classic is slower.  All and all for for Music and watching video on the iPod its self the Classic wins.  The bad.  Most of all the iPods docs and ALL Of the past iPod cables do not work with any of the new iPods. Apple change the computability so that you have to buy new cables and docs. They say it is because the old ones put to much drain on the battery(whatever I have had no issue). So if you are not upgrading from a previous iPod it may not be an issue because you will have to buy the $50.00 cable any way but if you already have all your iPod accessories you may want to keep the iPod you have until they fix this issue.  By the way if your car radio has a adapter for a iPod. Like the Pioneer D3 I just bought.  You guessed it none of the new iPods will work.

<Title>not good if you want to watch video
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple won't tell you this before you buy this product. If you use this with third-party video products it wont let you switch the TV OUT selector to ON. This means it won't work with those products. Apple sells two special cable sets you need in order to watch video. Each of these sells for $49.99. There is currently a four week wait for these cables. I have a laptop-like Vision Video 55 that allows the ipod to drop into a special bay so you can watch videos on a bigger screen and carry it around. Its great for traveling etc. My previous ipod videos worked great with this and a similar unit sold by Phillips. Now if I want to use these portable video devices I need one of these special cables partially defeating the point of having these custom devices. And this isn't a fit issue. Apple has purposely done this to prevent users from using third-party devices. Don't look to future after-market video devices to fix this problem. Apple has decided to be greedy on this point. If you just watch video on the ipod itself or on your home TV this will work fine (if you buy one of Apple's $50 cables). I wish I could return my ipod but they wont take it back :-(. Maybe I'll start calling mine the ipoop :-).

<Title>Good but not Great (yet)
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a 5.5 Generation 80G and I got a 80G classic, so I quite literally did a side by side comparison. True, the new interface is lovely, the screen is a touch brighter and its a thiner design, but even after the update from Apple, the spin up time on the interface is just so slow. Its especially horrible going to a listing of movies, it once took nearly 2 min for all my movies to display. The classic is sluggish and for me that is a bit of a deal breaker. I'm a huuuge Apple fan, I have 3 ipods (iPod mini 1st generation, Shuffle 2nd generation and my 5.5 generation 80G), a Mac Mini and will be shelling out for a Mac book pro next month when Leopard comes out, but this one is going back. I have a feeling the next generation Classic may be the one to watch for but for now its all Style and not enough substance, if your going for a ipod video get the 5th generation while you still can or wait until Apple has a chance to get rid of the glitches in this one.

I give it 1 star because you have to buy a universal dock to use it Apple does not tell you this When you buy the unit. just what i need is more gear to carry on a plane if you don't want to mess with docks and stuff to plug an i pod into a tv at a hotel stick with the 5 gen.

<Title>Posting User C. J. F. Was mistaken. It works. Here's Why...
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just as someone else stated, you do not need a Dock, for this or ANY iPod to work for that matter. That is an optional accessory, but not really needed.  Just use the USB cord that comes with it.  It's fastest if your computer has USB 2.0 ports built-in, but it also connects with older slower machines like mine that only have USB 1.1 ports.  It's great.!  USB 1.1 has a much slower data transfer rate than USB 2.0. Just be patient when doing your very first sync. Other syncing is faster just because you will be syncing less data at one sitting.  I love it. 80 GB, well worth it.

<Title>This product rocks!
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>THE GOOD: Good price, lots of HD for the price, has an equalizer, is basically easy to use; can be recharged via a USB 2.0 port on a PC. Also, it looks good (if you need a snappy-looking MP3 player), the touch-pad control is very convenient to use and it's good for audio books too.  THE BAD: No FM tuner, dinky earbuds, weird (incomprehensible to me at least) filing system if you're using a PC running Windows and you try to find individual files in the iPod using Windows Explorer. So, instead of being able to easily delete a few files here and there, it's easier to just restore (ie reformat) the HD and start from scratch. AND, the battery isn't meant to be changed by the owner - you're supposed to mail it back to Apple when the battery dies (although aftermarket batteries are available for the more technically adept owners).  OTHER POINTS: Uses iTunes software to upload & download from, won't support music purchased from anyplace other than iTunes. iTunes is pretty easy to use, make sure your PC can run iTunes 7.6 before you buy an iPod! RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES: Speck ToughSkin rubberized case for iPods & a decent set of brand-name earbuds. CONCLUSION: The pluses outweigh the minuses as far as I'm concerned - I love my iPod! If you disagree, check out the Microsoft Zune or Creative Labs MP3 players.

<Title>No problems or issues at all, complaints seem overblown
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We have just upgraded from a 30GB gen 5.5. video iPod to this model, and are happy overall.  Any complaints regarding software glitches, cover flow, etc. can be fixed quite simply by downloading the newest software update as soon as you first hook your new iPod up to your computer, and it takes about 10 seconds to disable the cover flow feature.  It's a good price for the amount of memory.  I haven't noticed any drastic reduction in sound quality, but on the other hand, there isn't any improvement either.  The only reasons this doesn't get five stars is because there doesn't seem to be any upgrade in sound quality, and even with the software updates, the click wheel seems a touch slower than the old Video model.  But for the extra storage and price, and the improved exterior casing, it's still a great deal.

<Title>INCOMPATIBLE with Accessories
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought into the iPod despite concerns about being locked into a proprietary format.  This buy-in was based on the ecosystem of accessories available (and mainly options to integrate in my car).   I just "upgraded" to the 80GB iPod classic.  Everything I own that used to work with my previous 5G iPod video no longer works.  Anapod Explorer - BROKEN.  Never liked iTunes, and this was my solution.  It no longer works, which is, in Apple's Defense, Anapod's responsibility.  Fortunately the newest WinAmp integrates well (although it can't seem to get cover art right).  Still important to note that whatever file system changes were implemented here are likely to impact other products as well.  Auto OEM Adapter Kid - BROKEN.  My $600 OEM iPod car adapter no longer recognizes the iPod.  This is what I used my iPod for 90% of the time.  No auto connectivity, and this product is borderline worthless to me.  Logitech mm50 Speakers - PARTIALLY BROKEN.  Plays music but no longer charges the iPod.  How tough is it to make sure the newest iPods can still be charged with older accessories???  All in all, a MAJOR disappointment.  I'll be looking for a used or refurbished iPod video to replace this as soon as I get the chance.

<Content>I had been hesitant to buy a new iPod because of the high price tag for any of them, but I finally decided to spend the money and upgrade from my old iPod mini, which the battery was starting to becom bad on. I first looked at the 8gb Nano, but decided to spend $50 more and get 72gb more space, and the larger screen. Let me tell you, this device will change you life. The video and picture quality is unbelievable, and the music quality is also tremendous. For someone like me who travels a lot, this is a great product to own.

<Title>A worthy upgrade
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The most important thing to consider about purchasing this iPod is what you're coming from or comparing it too. Sure, it may not be that much different than the 5th Generation, but for people that have held on to older models (I had a 3rd Generation) or for whom this is their first iPod, it's absolutely as good as it gets. Sure, the scroll wheel isn't perfect, but it's better than the significantly older models, and it's definitely better than nothing! The only real major that I can see from the 5g is the new hard drive capacity. When I was considering getting a new iPod, I knew I wanted space, but I wasn't quite willing to sacrifice the slimness of the 30 gig. Now that's not at all an issue and all my needs are satisfied. On top of that, the new cover looks terrific (not nearly as rounded as it looks in all the pictures) and the cover flow is nice, though not perfect. So I would say that if you've got a 5g, it would probably be wise to hold out for a bigger iPod touch or something, but if you've got an older model or nothing at all, then this is just about as good as it gets.

<Title>A believer at last....
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been a PC guy for most of my computing life and recently switched to a Mac. I bought the Classic when it became available and am amazed at its ease of use, user friendly interface, capacity and most of all the quality of the sound that it plays. I am very picky about my music and until I bought the Classic I thought my Zen was a good player. This player puts the Zen to shame! It works seamlessly with Itunes and is all in all a great player. The only thing that I can negatively say about it is that when switching between playlists/songs etc there is a lag of a few seconds that takes a bit of getting used to but I guess thats the difference between flash memory and a hard drive. Other than that little quibble, the Classic is the way to go if you have a pretty good sized music collection. Set up was a snap and there were no issues with the OS. Another winner from Apple!

Had NO idea that Apple has totally removed the capability to run on W2K until I tried to install the software (Amazon, you should have put a warning somewhere). Spent several hours searching forums and looking for 3rd party SW to make it work but found nothing. I have way too much $ invested in SW that will not run under XP to switch operating systems.  Apple, gotta give you credit, you can shoot yourselves in the foot better than any company I know of (except maybe Microsoft).

<Title>Beware J&R for purchases
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had no idea there were different generations of the 80GB ipod, and J&R saw an opportunity to dump old inventory. My wife originally ordered the 30GB ipod from J&R through Amazon back in August. After much delay on the order, she called for an update on Sept 8.  She was told by their sales person that the black was out of stock and so she asked if there was something comparable. He said he had an 80GB he could send for the same price ($249) - sounded to my like it was the new ipod.     That arrived in the mail the second week of September.  Today, I walked into Circuit City to buy her the same 80GB ipod.  I spent the same $249. I was shocked to see that the one I just bought is much thinner, lighter, the graphics are more advanced, and there are more games on it. It's a totally different ipod.  J&R did not inform my wife as to what they were selling her.  They tricked her into thinking she was getting 80GB for the price of a 30GB when they actually sent her one of two (older gen) ipods they had lying around in stock, just when the NEW 80GB's hit the stores and the 30GB's were being discounted. The one they sent her is white with a gray dial, not silver with a white dial.  The ipod's themselves are wonderful, but beware what you're getting for the price when buying anything from J&R. They mislead and mis-inform people.

<Title>major problems with thumbwheel
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I strongly urge anyone considering this product to do a test-drive first.  Apple has redesigned the thumbwheel and it just doesn't work properly.  Its virtually impossible to stop on the desired album or track.  Also, the album art is a disaster - images don't load timely and as they do, it causes the flow to freeze and then release 10 albums away from where you were trying to get to.  The Nano doesn't have this delay issue, so it must be related to the hard-drive slower access times.  But both the classic and nano both have the same redesigned thumbwheel that is very hard to control.  I was completely frastrated with my experience.  I'm not going to recommend another product, just don't buy this or the redesigned Nano.

<Content>I had a 5.5 gen IPOD before but decided to get Classic this week since it has larger storage and is thiner.  I got it Friday, but I have been disappointed with the issues I encountered.  1) The new IPOD already crashed once and I have to reboot it. I never rebooted my previous IPOD 5.5. 2) Sometimes I connect the IPOD with computer, the IPOD didn't show  the connected sign. Replug the cable didn't help and I have to reboot the IPOD to make it connected. 3) I upgraded Itunes to 7.4.2 so that I can use this IPOD. The iTunes  told me there is a IPOD software version 1.0.1 available which I expect they have some patches. But the upgrade failed because of some "1415" error.  I believe all of those issues will get fixed in the following few months. But I'm still disappointed, they should have done more testing before  putting it on market.  2 stars for what they did. I'll keep this ipod for 1 more week and will  return it if I still have problems with it.

<Title>So far so good...
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this ipod as soon as they became available at Apple stores.  The main problems that I have encountered so far is of course the clickwheel not being as sensitive as previous ipods.  I tend to wear my ipod on a belt clip, and before if I had a t-shirt over the ipod, I would be able to adjust the volume over the shirt.  However, I can no longer do that.  But that's not a big issue.  The other problem seems to be with the USB connections.  Sometimes when I sync my ipod or try to charge it, I have to adjust the USB cord a little bit to make a connection.  It's a bit aggravating but manageable.  The cover art flow does lag but fully loads in about 2 seconds.  I don't mind waiting that long.  The positives in regards to this ipod are of course the 80G space (my previous ipod was a 30G), the cheaper price (my 30G ipod was $300 when i purchased it) and a sleeker overall feel, whether it's the main menu flowing cover art or browsing by category.  In the end, I am satisfied with my purchase, so far.  Luckily, I haven't crashed yet.

<Title>Not for first timers
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this as a requested Christmas gift and was very much looking forward to having an easily portable drive that could play my CD collection at home as well as at work with docking stations, or, wherever I chose with the headphones.  The unit I received was purchased new at Best Buy, along with a charging cable.  Upon opening I found an 8 page simplisitc folder that tells you how to turn it on and off, but not much else.  No problem - go to the iTunes website and download a 70+ page instruction manual.  Great!  Here we go - loaded 700 Cd's worth of music onto the iPod, and enjoyed it for three weeks.  Then the iPod froze.  I tried to re-sync but it would no longer recognize several files stored in the iTunes library.  Deleted those files, "restored" the iPod to factory settings and tried to re-sync.  If collecting different "unknown error messages" is your hobby you might be happy with this.  Unless you're a big fan of user forums that offer multiple solutions to problems that should've been resolved before putting the product on the market I'd suggest that you seriously consider other options before purchasing this product.  (And no, I'm not an 80 yr old who knows nothing about them 'puters'.)

<Content>80 GB is a great size.  If you're planning on doing anything with music videos or DVD's, perhaps go for the larger one.  My ipod arrived new and undamaged within a few days.  I've been loading stuff on it for a couple of weeks and only have 12GB on it.  I'll have my life back soon.

<Content>I just joined the "iPod club" and purchased my first iPod from Amazon.  Fast delivery, lowest price anywhere and it's a guaranteed Apple product.  I've already downloaded my music library and I'm slowly (VERY slowly) filling it up.  80GB is HUGE!  I even downloaded a movie from iTunes and the clarity was so much better than what I was expecting.  This will be great for road-trips back home from school :-)

<Title>Better than the 20 Gig model (so far) but it doesn't have a 40 hour battery
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was one of the first people to buy the 4th generation 20GB ipod when it came out a couple of years ago and I really loved it but A) after a year of so of use it started to freeze a couple of times a month every month and B) it just totally died after a year and a half of use.  That being said, that made me a little reluctant to get a new iPod. So I got the 80GB two weeks or so ago and I'm liking it so far. I like the idea of being able to watch the movies and TV episodes I have on my computer  on my MP3 player and I think the coverflow feature is cool but I'm pretty disappointed with the battery life so far. The ads say you should get about 40 hour of music playback but the last two times I've listened to the music before a recharge I've gotten about eight or nine hours of battery life at the most and that kind of concerns me seeing as how I just got the thing two weeks ago and the battery life is already a little crappy (hence a four star review and not a five star review). In the unit's defense though my iPod did play for two hours this afternoon (with the backlight set to the "always on" setting) with the smallest sliver of battery life left so I was impressed with that (I set the backlight to "always on" when I'm trying to finish off the battery's life so I can recharge it sooner).  So all in all it's a really cool improvement over the 20GB model in most respects and the video option is really awesome as well but the battery life seems as poor as the original iPods and that's kind of a shame seeing as how that seems like something Apple could and should improve rather easily.  So I would recommend this baby if you have an eight hour flight or road trip but I don't know if it would be that great if you had a ten to twelve hour flight or road trip. Maybe a Zune would be better for that. I don't know.

<Title>Worth every penny, cover flow is just a minor flaw.
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iPod is amazaing especially for people with huge music collections like me. But everyone keeps putting it down because the coverflow is a litte slow at loading the album art. Can you blame it? If you have 50 albums on the iPod do you think it can just load them up effortlessly? It's the same way on the iTunes menu on the computer. If you let the cover flows 2 second load up time get in the way of you enjoying your iPod then you have missed the point.

<Title>My Ipod after a 3 year trial.
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received my ipod 3 years ago as a gift from my company. I was so happy I couldn't see straight. Since then I've used my ipod almost every day. I walk to work 5 times a week and the ipod really helps my travel.  So here is a short of my journey with the ipod.  The day after I received my ipod i put my entire mp3 collection on it and was thoroughly satisfied.   6 months later I bought a new computer and when my ipod tried to auto sync it erased my entire music database. I went back to miniDisc.  3 months later I rebuilt 50% of my music base and tried my ipod again and used manual sync ever since.  Then the next 2 years I spent enjoying the ipod with little or no problem.  3 months ago I experienced my first ipod freeze.  2 months ago I experienced more frequent freezing and very quick battery death (Even with no backlight).  Today: I have about 20 to 30 minutes of a functioning ipod (barring no glitches happen).  I was never rough with my ipod, I do walk in cold weather when it's cold im not sure what effect that had on it.  But for the price tag I would have expected a MUCH longer life span.  I had my miniDisc player and I used it the same way I did the ipod and it still lasts today and is going strong.  For the price point Apple needs to make a better product or give a non-soldering option of trading out the battery if that is the problem.  Not that I paid monitarily but I did pay in a way because when I moved my music on to ipod they changed my files so now my miniDisc can't read.  So now im forced to buy another ipod in order to listen to my music.  Bravo.  I am not excited of the idea of paying 200+ dollars just to have a product of a 3 year life span.  My super nintendo and my playstation cost that when I bought them and they are still running fine.  I will admit it is a good product but it has a very disappointing life span.

<Content>Following the recommendation of my Daughter and Son in Law, I finally bought this unit.  With a little work and an ION turntable I have added a 55 year collection of records and tapes to a tiny device that fits in my pocket.  I have collected vintage juke boxes and loaded them with 45's.  This device is like carrying 2500 juke boxes in my shirt pocket.  I work outside on our tree farm, and love having this with me daily!  This is my first iPod so I don't have a history, but I can't find any fault with this great little musical miracle - except I needed over the ear phones to muffle out the engine noise of the tractors, mowers and ATV's.!

<Title>Works great and looks even better!
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First of all, let me start by saying that the only reason I bought this was because my 30g fifth gen. ipod was stolen. If you have that ipod, then I don't see why you should upgrade to this one, unless you're rolling with cash. This ipod, however, is a really nice mp3 player and accentuates all the reasons why apple owns this market. It has lots of space with 80gb and can hold my entire music library.  This ipod looks really nice as well, with a nice sleek design. The new face plate gets rid of all the finger print issues with the old one and just looks great. They rounded out all the edges and made certain things black which is a nice touch.  The touch wheel is really responsive but their is no ability to change the sensitivity. The new interface looks really nice, but cover flow isn't the fastest thing in the world. I haven't had us much trouble with it as others have said, but it's not that useful.  The only thing i've had problems with is when I transfer music onto my ipod, some of the songs are recognized as different albums. It's not a big deal, but it's frustrating because songs from the same album are listed as different albums and I can't figure out why.  It has something to do with the fact that I download music, rather than buy it off itunes. If you buy all your music, you should be fine.

<Content>I didn't want to upgrade from my ancient iPod, but a hardware failure gave me no choice.  I have been delighted with my replacement, however.  The 6G 80 GB iPod classic is a very elegant unit.  Lovely screen.  But the biggest plus is battery life. An amazing increase over my previous player.  I have hundreds of songs, symphonies, operas, and all the Harry Potter books rattling around in about 1/4 of the classic's memory.  Don't know how I'm going to fill up the rest.  Bought an FM transmitter for the iPod when the CD player in my car jammed.  Don't miss the CD unit at all now.

<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this player.  I can watch TV shows (at the doctor's office) and not feel like I am going blind because the picture is crisp and the colors are vibrant. But I wouldn't push it.  Don't be dumb.    The music quality is excellent as always for an iPod.  I only wish it came with a charger and a better case.    Pros: * Great sound and picture quality * Battery life has been vastly improved.  When playing video, the battery is used up quickly though.  * Accessories are plentiful when you buy iPods * Durability -- I've dropped it a few times accidentally and it's done no permanent damage, although the player has had one freezing period that required a hard reset.  Cons: * Pricey * Dealing with iTunes and reformatting issues is a drag * Screen is a bit too easy to smudge even with a cover on it

I have applied all the "patches" and I have the latest software from itunes. The iPod works well.  In retrospect, I wish I bought a different product. Apple has a monopoly on the music and in my opinion does not care about my problems. After reading the reviews and recommendations from Apple, I was afraid of loading iTunes on my Vista-running computer. After reading horror stories on the web, I would wait till Apple and Microsoft certify that iTunes works with Vista

<Title>Good...not perfect.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Before reviewing this iPod, I should say that this is my second iPod, my first being the original, 20GB model.  Considering that that and this were about the same price, I think it goes without saying that I'm thrilled with the improvements that have been made over the years.  The color screen is beautiful, I enjoy seeing my album art, and this model is an all around better player.  In general, I'm very very happy with this purchase.  I do feel that some other customers' complaints are valid.  The click wheel can respond slowly, especially when in the "Cover Flow" menu.  This is easily resolved by either not displaying cover art on your iPod or by using the other menus (artist, playlist, etc.) instead.  I would imagine this will also help to prolong battery life.  My only other complaint is that the earphones for this model seem to fall out of my ears.  I don't know if this is a common problem, but it was easily fixed by using my old earphones.  No big deal really.    Otherwise, it's a product that I'm quite happy with, and am glad that I purchased.

<Title>Not as bad as people are saying.
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>ok, so people are griping a lot and worried apple is flopping and giving their customers the old one finger salute. I bought this, trying to be as open as possible, and this is what i found. The click wheel- Not as bad as some are saying. It is not perfect, but after an apple update or two it should be fine - Cover flow. Its true, it doesn't update fast enough; however, i don't care much for the concept and will probably never use it... I imagine most will be the same. -Battery life- Great!!! what more can you ask for? - Incompatibility with 3rd party accessories... ok, understand this gripe, but lets be honest, not all your computer accessories for the 90s fit this nice new HP you just bought. When you think about it, we should have expected this some time. granted i have less to gripe about than others since i haven't had an ipod since my gen 4 died 2 or 3 years ago, but if you search the net, I'm sure buying a new cable hear, or there wont kill you. Then there is the problem with games not transferring over. Its true, the games you bought for your gen 5 video wont work on the classic.... Its 5$... is it really that big of a deal? if i wanted cheap i would have gotten a zune, and if your really that concerned, maybe you should. I think a lot of the gripes we are seeing are a little overdone, and if you really think about it... look deep deep down inside of yourself, you will see it makes sense. lets look at the pros - 80 gigs at $250... it must be my birthday - that new brushed metal finish, mmm mmm mmm, it just feels nice. not fingerprints either. - regardless of what i have read on a few forums, all my cover art transfered in rather well (minus a few rare cds that i didn't expect to show up) - the amount of time it takes to charge is great! - its not made by Microsoft - itunes is the MOST intuitive way to handle mp3 tags that i have seen inside of a mp3 player client --- cons the click wheel is a bit awkward at first when compared to previous generations BUT it is not as bad as others will make you think no case, but who cares, you can get em cheap off ebay --- So if your like i was and are really worried about getting this because of all the bad reviews, dont worry... remember, no piece of technology is perfect in its first days, it takes a few updates to get it righ, and im sure Apple is working hard to perfect its product and continue to dominate the MP3 market (for good reason too)

<Title>Big Disappointment
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought new iPod classic 80 GB yesterday and a day later I think I am ready to return it. There are several problems with this iPod. If you never owned iPod before you may not notice these issues. However, if you owned iPod video or iPod photo you will be greatly disappointed.  Things that I don't like:   1)You can't enlarge album artwork anymore  2)The artwork doesn't load immediately when you browse your music.  3)When you browse and click on artist it gives you all the albums that you have and tells how many songs are in each album which I find annoying since I have lots of classiclal music and it doesn't make sense when you read that Mozart's Symphony No.40 has 4 songs.  4) Cover Flow doesn't support all album artwork. Some just won't load on iPod. I don't even bother to talk about that feature. it's useless   However things mentioned above are not major problems. They are very subjective,just something I dislike. The big problem with new iPod classic is its click wheel. When I used my new iPod for the first time I even thought maybe something was wrong with my fingers instead of suspecting that something maybe wrong with click wheel. That's because I had iPodphoto 60Gb for 2 years and it worked exceptionally well. But after reading all negative reviews online I realised that everyone has the same problem with click-wheel. How can Apple allow this to happen when they always brag about their patented clickwheel in the ads is beyond me. It's just a shame. I like the design and the bright screen of new iPod but who wants to wait for music to load for five seconds or who wants to try adjusting volumes multiple times because click-wheel simply doesn't feel your touch.   Like some other reviewer mentioned here I really wanted to buy iPod touch but 16 GB capacity is a joke in our age.I think Apple is just teasing consumers and will probably release 60 GB or bigger versions of iPod Touch close to Christmas to make huge sales. It's kinda sad what Apple has become...

The navigation system is so much better than anyone elses not to mention the sound quality, the itunes interface, or the secondary accessory market.  the problem i guess is that they set the bar too high too many times.  me personally, i couldn't care less about the ipod touch (who needs it?), i'm just giddy about 60gigs for $249....

<Title>iPod 5.5 vs iPod Classic
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the iPod Video 5.5Gen while my friend recently bought this new iPod Classic 80gb. I have compared the two side by side and I must say that the new Classic sports only a couple of new features against its predecessor. The price is quite a bargain though. The menu navigation on the old 5.5G is a little bit faster than the Classic. I bet this is because of the slideshow running in the background while navigating through the menu. The menus are admittedly very sluggish on the Classic as compared to the 5.5G. Good points though are the "scratch-proof" surface, which I think is rather a compromise in looks for functionality. The coverflow concept is also nice but I just wished the hardware could keep up with refreshing the album art thumbnails while browsing. And don't forget to start downloading those album arts.   Back to the iPod 5.5G. Well, this device has entertained me during long drives and has made me sleep for the past several months. It definitely never failed to do its purpose. I learned to love iTunes to make playlists and organize my music. But don't hesitate to use third party software like floola when you need to backup your stuff.   The bottomline is: if you are not one of the early jumpers when a new device is introduced, this device is perfectly cool for you. Honestly, I would've still bought the 5.5G now even with the iPod classic around.   Be cautious though, since this is a hard drive device. But I bet you already know that.

<Content>Well, I've never bought an Ipod, having held off for years. With the lower price on the classics, I jumped in. Boy am I sorry. I've had it a week, and can't do a thing with it. The itunes software is buggy and deleted all my songs (after getting them on their easily on an older version, which it made me update). Now,itunes tells me it can't write to my device and continually tells me to reset it (which does nothing). Look on apples support site and you see hundreds of people screeming in the forums about this problem, with no response from Apple anywhere... not even acceptance a problem exists and a 'we are working on it'. These things are supposed to be easy to use... that is the main advantage of Ipod on itunes, right??? Well, I'm about ready to return this one. Buggy software and non responsive support is not the way to 'lead the industry'.

<Content>I've only previously owned a 4th gen 40GB iPod, so I can't comment on the 'downgrade' issues from the last generation iPods, but so far I am very, very happy with my new 80GB classic.  Installation was a breeze.  I already had iTunes set up with all my music, so all I had to do was load up iTunes and plug in the iPod, and automation took care of the rest.  The iPod charged up in a few hours.  That simple!  The 80GB classic is perfect for what I use it for: listening to my entire music collection from one convienent place.  I've been listening to it for many many hours straight, and it's barely even touched the battery.  The screen is nice and vibrant for looking at all the cover art, and the backlight auto shuts off to save on batteries when you aren't using it, especially useful when it's just sitting in your pocket or glovebox.  The brushed aluminum looks very stylish and gives it a more solid feel.  The clickwheel can be a little sluggish at times, but I've never found myself irritated by it.  All in all an excellent purchase.  Extremely impressed by the battery life.  I'm glad I waited a little longer to buy an iPod, as we now get 80GB of storage instead of 30GB for the same price.

<Title>Such a disappointment 
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You can read on for a detailed review.  In summary, if my music collection wasn't larger than the iPod this was replacing, I would put the iPod classic on the shelf (or maybe ebay it) and run the old one.  This iPod is the first apple iPod product I have felt was just an afterthought.  I have owned the 1G shuffle, the 2G 4GB Nano, and a 4G 20GB iPod color (wife also has a 5G 30GB iPod Video).  I absolutely loved all of them.  All felt like polished products.  The iPod Classic feels like an afterthought that they came up with when they decided to make the iPod touch not a real iPod, but halfway between a nano & an iPod.  The iPod Classic is very underpowered, or the firmware is poorly written.  Either way, you will find navigating through the menus very tedious and will start becoming annoyed.  The first thing you will notice is that there is something wrong with the click wheel.  It doesn't pick up your finger movements the way the other generations of iPod did.  Apple has never been very friendly to audiobook listeners, but the current software makes it really bad. You can no longer sort your audio books by genre (or author, or even book title).  All audiobook files are only accessible in a single alphabetized list.  Yes, that's files, not books.   So to get to 'State of Fear' part 6 of 8, you need to scroll down through every file of every book you have that has a title that starts earlier in the alphabet than "S". For me, that's 187 files.  What's worse, is the list isn't a normal list of files (as was in the last generation of iPod), but is double height for each file and displays a tiny picture of the book's cover next to the file.  What's still worse is that most of the time these just show question marks and slow the scrolling process even more.  The podcast menu uses the same double height lists, as do virtually all lists. Currently you can't turn this off, and you get to wade through your songs in this manner.  The cover flow feature is completely unusable as it is so slow and the album art isn't populated quick enough to actually be of use.  The general navigation utilizes a 1/2 screen for the menu and 1/2 screen for artwork, cut vertically.  Its only use is to look good in apple commercials.  After the "wow, that's neat" wears off, you search around for how to turn it off, but sadly, you can't.  All it does is make what you are trying to read cut off, and also slows down the iPod.  You will notice between a 1 & 2 second lag time from selecting an item before the sub-menu shows up.  I would say you should buy a fifth generation if you can find one, or hold out for the next generation of the touch (when it has enough space to hold your music).  The only good thing about this iPod is that all the problems appear to be software related... however my fear is that apple won't be working too hard to fix them as the "touch" is their baby right now.  The click wheel problems might also be software related, as it seems like some of the non-response you get is the software locking up, rather than the click wheel itself not detecting your finger.  I would recommend not purchasing this iPod until a SIGNIFICANT software update is released.  I will update this review for new updates to the software if there is any noticeable difference.  Currently I have version 1.0.1  *Update: I have found that if you disable "view album artwork" on the settings in iTunes, this dramatically speeds up the iPod.  It is a shame you need to do this, but it even makes the click wheel more responsive.  You will have no artwork, at all, on the iPod, but the music and menus will function quickly.    *Apple released software version 1.0.2.  I have not noticed any change in performance running the iPod without artwork.  I enabled artwork to test if the patch did anything there, and I must say that the speed of the menus has improved and the coverflow is a lot more smooth (though still not very useful). However, it is still slower than the old iPods and the flaws mentioned above remain.  *Apple released software version 1.0.3. Hopefully it will address some of  the above mentioned concerns.  ***WARNING - I have installed software update 1.1.  It has some serious issues and I would not advise installing this update.  For some, it is bricking the iPod. Not for me, but there are some really weird/bad things it does and I haven't noticed anything good that it does. The most noticeable negative change is that the iPod does not turn off correctly at the end of a playlist.   I like to listen to my iPod as I fall asleep (The Classic Tales podcast is excellent, look into it), so I do an "on the go" playlist with one episode, so that after I fall asleep the episode will end and the iPod will shut off.  Not so with the new update.  At the end of the episode the iPod just plays what I can only describe as dead air. So, the iPod will just play this (I guess until the iPod runs out of batteries, but I usually just find it playing dead air in the morning and turn it off manually by holding the play button).    My fears about the software updates not being priority for Apple look like they are coming true.  I have a sneaking feeling that they will update the iPod Touch to a full sized iPod (30GB-60GB) before the Classic is fixed.  Again, buy a 5th gen if you can find one and avoid this product.

<Title>Could it be? A hard drive music player with decent audio quality? Nope. Try again. 
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I put off getting an iPod for quite some time. Too expensive, I thought, and the sound quality probably isn't that good. But finally the alluring 80 gigabyte storage capacity and ultrahip stylings of the iPod Classic could keep me iPodless no longer, so I bought one.  I have a fairly extensive collection of music on my computer, and I was already using iTunes, so loading it up was no problem. Quite pleasant actually. The battery was charged and the screen was great. Everything was fantastic. Until... I finally started listening to music on it. I tried the Apple headphones included with the unit. Rubbish, but that's to be expected. Moved up to my nice pair of around-ear studio headphones. Still not great. Messed with the EQ, and found this was the problem. And oh what a problem it was.  First off, there's no custom EQ setting. Ridiculous.  Second, none of the settings have adaquate bass for desirable listening. Stuck listening to tinny, trebley music sucks. And I'm not really an audiophile.  Third, the EQ settings that approach having a listenable amount of bass response clip the signal. Digital distortion does not sound good like analog can. Harsh clipping in the lower registers. I've had a few portable CD players that had plenty of bass response sans clipping, so I know it is possible. This is just atrocious design. Seriously.  Other reviews complain about a nonresponsive clickwheel, and the useless Cover Flow feature, but these aspects didn't bother me. I actually quite like everything about it except for the sound quality (I even imported a few discs using the Apple Lossless format and still the quality is disappointing). Even watching movies on the thing is kind of fun, which I was surprised about.  Alas, I will continue to use it when out and about because having an enormous volume of music available at all times is quite convenient, and we all know convenience is everything in this day and age.   So, my recommendation would be not to buy this product if you care about how your music sounds, although if by some chance you are going to be running it through an external amplifier and EQ, you can disable the internal EQ and it will sound just fine. Try and find somebody with one so you can try it out before you buy to see if you mind the subpar audio. I doubt the Zune sounds better, but try that one out as well.

<Content>I bought the i-pod classic since I needed a stereo for my living room.  I purchased the Cambridge 745, which is a Bose competitor.  It has an ipod dock, and the remote will control the ipod too.  I bought the classic so I could transfer my CD collection to the ipod, make playlists, and have easy access to my music.  It's working great - loads of memory, just requires patience and lots of time to get the music on it.    I would go with the nano if I were using it to carry around, but the classic is great for a home stereo.

<Content>When my Creative Vision Zen M fried, I needed a replacement - quick.  I was away at school and needed something to drown out my noisy downstairs neighbors.  I decided to go with the original this time, and I am very pleased.  The iPod, with all things Apple, is like driving a Cadillac after years of driving a Chevy - beautiful to behold, and a pleasure to "drive."  Sound and video quality are superb.  My only complaint is the amazingly thin body and polish rear surface, which makes the iPod a tad difficult to hang onto in arthritic hands.  But all in all, I am very pleased and would buy another.

<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this new ipod.  If you are like me and have a 5 or 6 year old ipod then this one is revolutionary!   The ipod that I inherited from my father several years ago finally began showing its age.  Although the old ipod still works, I felt that I should get a new one--one with color!!  Imagine that.  I think that the resolution on the screen is fantastic.  I have actually downloaded tv shows for the ipod because of the great screen quality, although that is not initially what I thought that I would use the ipod for. i think the sound is way above the first or second generation ipods as well.  It also feels to be made of better quality materials.  I probably really wanted an Iphone, but I settled on this because I didn't want to pay to get out of my cell ontract and I actually use my ipod as a hard drive (being a teacher).  I think that this is one of the best purchases that I have made.

<Content>The other negative/mediocre reviews have already pretty much said it.  Itunes is buggy, and Apple is trying harder then ever to force people to use it.  The new UI and click wheel are kind of clunky, although they look pretty.  Sound and picture quality are fine, but there are other players out there that are just as good without the annoyances that come with the new Ipods.  I traded mine in for one of the new creative zen players, and haven't regretted it.

<Date>Sat Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first ipod. I always have had a regular 1 giga mp3 player and I was ok with it. But three weeks ago, a friend of mine turned up with the new ipod classic (6generation) and told it was 80 giga for just 240 euros. And I thought "That's interesting". Then he show me the new cover flow interface...which is stunning...at that moment i knew I was also gonna get one.  Now that I have i just can say that "absolutely love it". Its huge capacity allow me to put all my music library in it and browse through the albums easily with the mentioned beautifully crafted cover flow mode.  I think the design is also great. I have the black one and looks great. I don't get any of the complains on the reviews. The wheel works perfectly smooth on mine. And now this ipod is so much thinner, just in case you didn't notice!  If you already have an ipod video, you probably won't need to upgrade to this version. But if you don't have and Ipod, go get it right now!!! It's well worth the money!!!

<Title>Don't Believe All The Reviews
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've never written a review before, but felt I had to this time because some of the negative reviews here almost kept me from buying a terrific product.  Specifically, I was concerned about comments about the scroll wheel not functioning properly, and about comments about accessories for previous iPods not working on the Classic.    Fortunately, I went to Best Buy and was able to play with their display model for quite a while.  I used the scroll wheel extensively and found that I had no problems with it at all.    All my accessories for my iPod minis work with the Classic, including my AC charger and the adapter I use to listen to the iPod through my car radio.  I was surprised at how watchable video is on the Classic; I thought the small screen would be impossible.  But, the picture quality is so good that I actually find that I would watch videos on this iPod while traveling.  I've been converting video files and loading them onto the Classic with zero problems.   I've had no problems syncing the Classic with iTunes either.  I wonder if those having problems are limited by computer resources.  I have a HP Pavilion running XP with 2Gb of RAM.  All in all, I'm thrilled with the Classic and strongly recommend that folks check it out for themselves rather than just believing the reviews (including this one!).

<Title>The SLUGGISH new IPOD CLASSIC
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Ipod Classic 80 GB is sluggish and the click wheel sensitivity has just deteriorated compared to the previous Ipod Models. I own several IPOD's starting with the 2nd generation and frankly the SLUGGISHNESS to user controls and the WEIGHT of the new 80GB classic is quite a disappointment. Apple packs less in the package, first the dock disappeared , then the CD and  now the sleeve has disappeared. All you get that matters  is the IPOD and a USB connector cable. The  output volume is more powerful and the battery appears to to have less work to do , so will last longer. My Ipod touch arrives next week and I hope that will give me more joy than the classic !

My boyfriend takes it on trips, downloads movies for plane rides and is all set. I would recommend an iPod over any other MP3 any day of the week.

<Content>I purchased this as a gift for my husband for his birthday. Overall, it's easy to load music and movies onto and has a ton of space. Considering his original iPod was a Nano Shuffle, this is a considerable upgrade.  I like the brushed silver finish and the size is a little bigger (though a little thinner) than a cell phone. It's not super small, so if you're using it to exercise, you may want to consider an arm band. At first, my husband thought it was too big to use when he worked out (he's used to the Nano, remember), but now that he's discovered he can load movies onto it, there's a new found love!   Overall, I am extremely pleased with the product and my purchase!

The music is easy to upload/change/customize with Itunes (just make sure your computer has a hard drive large enough), the music is easy to browse through with the "cover flow", you can upload playlists, the pictures get converted to a different format before loading onto the Ipod so it saves space, and one of the best features is the ability to upload games!!  Itunes has some great games to download/upload.  Phase is a good version of the Guitar Hero game.  Overall an excellent product.

<Content>Just upgraded from a 4G Ipod, so the difference in features is amazing.  The menus are well organized and very intuitive.  When using coverflow, the Ipod has a tendency to freeze for a couple of seconds while changing menus or even playing the selected soundtrack.  Personally I don't see much use for the coverflow, specially when you have over 50Gigs of music.  When you are NOT using coverflow, the Ipod runs like usual.  Coverflow is nice to look at, but its more practical just to search for music by genre, artist, etc.

<Content>Hello all,  First I would like to say that I have the 80GB Classic iPod and I just LOVE IT! The cover flow is a great feature and I cannot find something I don't like!  Ok, I have read several reviews (specially the first one) and I completely disagree. I have to say, PLEASE STOP WHINING! Do not give bad reviews for extremely tiny things like this! You are misleading other customers to other products when they can get this one! Yeah, I saw the video about the "Cover Flow Annoyance", and yes, the cover flow takes about 0.0000065461 seconds to load the arts, SO WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!? I guess you can live with that! Is not like it affects the iPod's whole performance!  So, if you really like the iPod, and you trust in Apple, BUY THIS! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!  Sincerely,  A very satisfied customer with his 80GB iPod Classic.

I even went to the Apple site and tried to download it that way but the needed Quick Time program wouldn't load. So now I have a brand new 80 gig Ipod that I can't tell if it works because of this issue. I am sure however that if these issues didn't plague me I would rate this product much higher. As it is I can't even see if it came in working order and is functioning. Disappointing.

<Content>I've had a LOT of iPods and other media players. I still have a nano 2g for the gym and skiing, but this iPod holds my whole music library, sounds great and is small enough to be easy to carry around.  The battery life is great, sound is awesome and video isn't bad though I'd never try to watch a full length movie on a screen this small.  I considered an iTouch, but I think the novelty will wear off and I'll have a 16GB music player, larger than my nano, a $399 price tag and no ability to control things like volume or song forwarding without taking it out and looking at it to run the touch screen.

<Content>It took me a long time to decide which MP3 player to buy because of all the varied reviews.  Well, I have had no trouble with the IPOD 80GB Classic.  I'm really impressed with how good it works.  Sure, I wish it knew what I was thinking when I am driving so I didn't have to touch it to tell it what to play next, but that is probably in the plans.  Be sure to think about the space difference between the 80 and 160.  You may really not need the 160.  I wondered about this too.  I think if I ever manage to get the 80 filled up, they will have a new model out and it will be 2 years down the road first.  Maybe I just don't have that much though.  The whole Bible (like 70 hours), 600- 30 minute pod casts and all my music takes less than 20 GB.  The itunes software isn't too bad either.  There is a lot of free stuff there like pod casts on your favorite subjects that can be set up to download regularly and automatically.  I think the Apple MP3 program is nice and refined.  Mine works great on Vista and previously XP.  I hope you have the same good fortune.

<Title>Quite disappointed
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I switched over from Creative's Muvo Slim to iPod 80 GB Black. I had been using the Muvo since last 2 years switching to iPod was a little tough for me in beginning. It lacks lot of features, it lacks compatibility, it's not comfortable. I mean it's like slavery, well that's how I really felt everytime I had to switch on my system to sync it with iTune that to from my profile.   Though I bought it for myself but it feels that it does not belong to me. As if it belongs completely to Apple of to Mr. Jobs for that matter. The reason I say this is because, I am a developer, I work for best of the best web designs, I talk about Open Source, I talk about Web 2.0, Simplicity, User centric applications and design. The simplicity of iPod is limited to the look and feel. The internal functionality is completely of it's own, might be good for people using MAC. But it's complex in operation. I feel it lacks flexibility.  I was reading a book recently and found out that people like to be a part of the iPod cult, flashing the white earphones. There are many excellent products available, I recommend Creative not just because I used it but because I could connect it to any machine, could arrange songs as per folders, can delete the songs from the device itself, you would be satisfied with it because of what it is and what value it gives you NOT just because you belong to a cult. I had no choice but to buy Bose earphones to listen to iPod. The audio and video quality of iPod is great (depends mostly upon the quality of songs). But the iTune thing I hate most, it takes most of my time trying to arrange things.   The learning curve for iTune and iPod sync is the worst part for busy people like me. May be this is the reason it's a kit amongst the teens. The concept does not even resemble something that I can get from my memory and use to learn it. Learn to use something completely new from scratch, if you are a busy person ask your secretary to arrange things for you every time. God bless you!!!

<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son got an ipod for Christmas.  Less than two months later, he goes to use it and the screen is messed up on the inside.  He didn't drop it.  There is no sign of any damage at all on the outside.  So, we went in to the apple store and they said we needed an appointment. We made one for an hour later (the first one available), came back, waited & waited while various people went on break, usually only leaving one guy on duty. We finally get up there. The guy said that, if you carry the ipod around (actually expect it to be portable), it's common for the side to get "pinched" which ruins the screen and they consider it your fault. To fix it out of warranty was $149. So we're out $299 but there's no point in throwing good money after bad.  I guess I should keep an eye out for a class action suit.

The only thing is my motorcycle has an AUX input that will connect to the audio system (Honda Goldwing) an after about 30 min or so it will lock up.

<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I upgraded from a first generation Mini, so the storage space is a real bonus. In short, I am pleased, so far, with the look, functionality, and features.  Some complain that this device should have wireless capability, a voice recorder, and a radio, but I don't have a need for any of those things in my portable music player.  The scroll wheel doesn't work well (hesitates) when working in any screen that contains graphics. Otherwise it works fine -- when I scroll through my Artist list, for example. (BTW, beyond the novelty, I see no use for the Cover Flow.) I am hoping that updated software will address the scroll wheel problems. I am still impressed. The Classic cost me the same as my first-gen mini and has twenty times the storage, is comparable in size and weight, has  a full color screen, and photo and video capabilities. Maybe there is better technology out there, but, for now, I am still a fan of the Ipod.

<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine to use with the Monitor Audio i-deck speaker system and so far I can't fault it. Its very easy to use and the sound quality is excellent with this setup.  Currently I'm ripping my CD collection at 256kbps, which produces near CD quality. My only quibble is that it takes a long time for itunes to rip the CD's - but this may be my incompetence rather than anything to do with the product. However, once the iPod is connected songs are uploaded very quickly.  I haven't tried the provided earphones yet, but from what other users have said these are not worth bothering with. Compared with a previous HDD/mp3 player I bought this is vastly superior in every respect, and I now understand why Apple dominate the market for these players.

<Content>I come from a 5 ipod family.  I was very excited to hear about the new "Classic" being released due to the large capacity of it. Went out and bought a 80 gb for my daughter and a 160 gb for myself. Brought them home,  plugged them in and it was nothing but downhill from there. Syncing problems, freezes, and overall very slow performance. Went straight back to where I bought them and got 2 more. Same results. I keep up on the discussions section of Apple's site just to find that this problem is everywhere. Still no fixes as of 10-12-07. As a matter of fact, I am very disappointed in Apple's "hush, hush" attitude when it comes to acknowledging  that there is a problem. I want nothing more then to have this product work. Unfortunately it is a huge disappointment and so is Apple. Shame on Apple for their handling of what is obviously a poor product. I would recommend buying an earlier generation ipod or look to another manufacturer. If I could rate this product lower then 1 star I would!!!

<Title>Um... Apple?
<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My last iPod was a 3rd generation unit with 40GB capacity. Its performance over the years (and still in my car) is excellent. I replaced the battery last year and it's like new. However, my music collection is getting very close to exceeding the 40GB capacity, so I purchased an iPod Classic 80GB.  First, the good: The screen is excellent for both movies and photos. Audio quality is excellent, as expected. Battery life seems to be better than advertised. The new user interface was rather slow and cumbersome, but Apple has resolved that issue with the latest firmware update.  Now the bad: No Firewire support -- just the slower USB2 standard; older iPod games do NOT work with this model, so if you've purchased games for your 5th generation iPod, they will NOT work and you will have to purchase them again -- once the authors re-write them; your VIDEO accessories (e.g., TV output cables) will not work from your 5th generation iPod (though the dock from my 3rd generation works fine).  I believe Apple has made a BIG internal hardware change with this new iPod. With no backward compatibility for purchased games and no backward compatibility for video accessories (this includes the portable LCD screens that the iPod can connect to), Apple has got a potential for an uphill battle. Most of these things did not affect me because I had such an old iPod that didn't support games or video output, however many people upgrading from the 5th generation iPod will have a nasty surprise.

<Content>It's going to break in a year or two anyway, so buy the cheap one, preferably from another company.  My Sony walkman from 15 years ago still works fine, but the iPod died after two years.  I would never buy an Apple laptop because I'm so disappointed in the iPod.  The iPod is a total ripoff.  Since there are much cheaper products available, Apple must be marking up their products to an insane extent.  Although Apple ethics were great twenty years ago, I no longer respect them.  Brand loyalty is the only thing Apple has going for them, so they better make sure their products are high quality.

<Title>bad reviews are misleading
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I read the bad reviews here and they are all very particular and specific and odd (i.e., the problems these people are having will probably never happen to you).  This version of the iPod is probably going to be the last in its line before they switch over completely to the iPod Touch version.  But when I was trying to figure out which one to go with RIGHT NOW, the Touch is 400 freakin' dollars and it only has 16 GB on it!  That's nothing as far as I'm concerned - maybe I'm spoiled but I like putting all sorts of things on my iPod besides my entire record collection which is around 35 GB right off the bat.  The iPod "Classic" is not perfect or ideal (starting with its stupid name)- the ideal would be an iTouch with 80 GB or higher - but its pretty sweet.  The games on it work really well once you get used to the wheel, as far as I know there are no games on the iTouch.  The video looks really good on the iPod Classic too.  As far as the meat is concerned which is the music, the cover flow works fine - all that stuff about it being too sluggish is b.s. - the sound quality is really good and it comes with about 20 preset EQ settings which are nice.  Sync with iTunes is really easy and almost fun and in short its just really simple to use and does the job.  My advice is to get this one and wait for Apple to release an iTouch with more GB later, which might take awhile but I just have a hard time paying 400 dollars for 16 gb just so I can move an album cover across the screen with my finger.  p.s. yeah, the itouch has the wi-fi internet capability but I have trouble digesting what I read about it, like no java - that's a big setback, most of my favorite websites rely on that -otherwise I'm just looking at an incredibly shrunken version of a website and that doesn't really do much for me.

I contemplated buying the Ipod Touch, but was afraid that I would bang it up taking it to the gym and everyday use and $400.00 is a little too steep to shell out for an Ipod with only 16GB although the features are impressive.  Right out of the box, the Ipod Classic is very user friendly in syncing with Itunes which I love.   Not having a video Ipod before, I am very impressed and glad that I waited for the 6th generation Ipod.

<Content>Okay. I must say whoever gives this product anything less than 4 stars is a complete and utter retard. Really. This is the best product out there in terms of mp3 and video playback devices. There are many out there that make up a list of complaints and they are all so repetitive. As for the odd problems about freezing and the screen just turning black, it'll probably happen once ever couple of thousand Ipods or so. In other words, it'll probably never happen to you. The complaints I hate the most are the ones about the album covers. I have one thing to say to you. SHUT UP! If you want the album cover, go to the store and buy the CD. That's it. And as for you people that have legitimate problems, that's why this product comes with a warranty. Get it replaced and stop complaining about the stupidest things. I've never had one single problem with my Ipod. That's because I take care of my possesions. So for all of you out there looking for a really great mp3/video player get this. There is no equal. Except maybe for the zune but there's only one button on that thing and personally, I like the flawless clickwheel. Basically, if you take care of your Ipod, it'll stay in working condition.

<Title>Sweet piece of technology!
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So this is my 1st IPOD and it is everything I hoped it would be. 80 GB's is very adequate for what I needed it for. If you plan on using an ipod for just MP3's, you may want a smaller size, but since I have all of my music, photos and videos on it, it is perfect. This can easily be used as a portable hard drive if needed.  The shiny, chrome, metallic backside looks awesome with the black front, however is very prone to scratching. I have recently purchased a case for it that will inevitably save my ipod from reckless drunks and spilled beverages.  I had heard that this generation was slow and no good overall, but I am hear to say that this is a great buy. The screen is big enough to watch short videos and even has the ability to utilize an AV out to playback on a tv or desktop monitor. This also works well with slideshows that you can play to music if you so choose. I have heard/read several reviews that state that the coverflow function is overated and slow. Well.... it is. First you need to find all of the artwork, then download it. But the real hassle is trying to find music based on the cover artwork. Even if I had taken the time to setup and find the artwork, I would rarely, if ever, utilize that function for searching for music. Searching by album name or artist name is much easier and efficient, especially if you don't know what art you are looking for because you didn't actually buy/own the physical album.  Overall, I am satisfied with this IPOD and would recommend buying this model, especially if you intend on using it for more than just MP3's. In the end, I would also recommend buying a case for this not just because it will scratch easy, but also because for $250, you can't be too careful.

<Title>iPod Classic ... BOOOOOOO!
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am very unhappy with my new iPod Classic.  The iPod itself isn't the problem either. It is the decisions that Apple has made concerning this product.  I upgraded from a 5th generation Video iPod to gain some more storage space and enjoy some of the new features. I have had my 5th generation iPod for about a year now and have quite a collection of accessories and games.  I was disappointed however to discover that none of these items are now compatible with the iPod classic.  Cubis 2, Lost, Mini Golf, Ms. Pac Man, Sims Bowling, Sims Pool, Texas Hold 'Em and Zuma (some of which I purchased recently) will not work on my new iPod Classic. That's $40 in games, now no good to me.  My disgust with my new iPod grew when I plugged my iPod Classic into my DLO Home Dock Deluxe (The one I purchased to upgrade from my DLO Home Dock because I was not able to navigate videos on the TV screen with the original version, thanks to Apple) only to discover that my iPod Classic is not compatible! Nor is it compatible with any other system other than Apple overpriced $50 A/V Cable.  I also purchased a $300 pair of i-Vue video glasses for iPod, that of course also will not work with my new iPod Classic.  I urge Apple to correct this horrendous shortcoming in the next iPod firmware update.  This seems to be a trend with Apple ever since they decided to suddenly drop firewire from the iPod line up after convincing us that firewire was the connective cable of the future. Apple seems to only be interested in gaining market shares, current customers be damned!  I'll think twice before my next Apple product "upgrade"  ------------------------ Bill Roark Apple User since my Apple IIe

<Title>One of the best purchase choices I've ever made!
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>What started out as a spontaneous purchase choice has turned out to be one of the best buys I've made in a long time! I had not planned on replacing my 5th generation unit until my Apple Care Protection Plan expired. However, when it was accidentally dropped in my parking lot at work and then run over, I was forced to make a sudden upgrade. I was a little hesitant in investing in another Apple product because of all the problems I had been having with my previous two. Yes, that's right I said two! I had only owned my first iPod for about two months before it started to freeze up on me. So when I took it into my local Apple Store then gave me a refurbished player and the problems seemed to get worse. In fact, the very day my previous iPod got destroyed, I was actually planning on getting it checked out to see what they could do for me. But enough about my previous iPod, lets get to the new one.  For starters, I'm extremely pleased that Apple discontinued making iPods that have less then 80 GBs of hard drive space. The reason I say this, is I happened to have a rather large music and video collection. So the benefits of this extra space are endless for me. Another thing I really love is the design. This until holds 50 GBs more space then my last iPod and it's twice as small. This makes it beyond convenient for me to haul it around and just stick it in my pocket. I also love the 2.5 inch screen. Like I had mentioned before, I love watching videos on my iPod and this way I do not have to lug my laptop with me where ever I go. I also own conversion software that can change any video I have in my collection to an MPEG format. This is a nice feature for my video collection and my wallet. The one thing that makes this unit stand out from any of the other previous iPod models is the battery life! I can not tell you how wonderful this is for me because I constantly fall asleep while listening to my iPod. But the most noticeable upgrade for any Apple user is the software changes and the touch wheel. The new GUI that is implemented on my unit is definitely eye catching and easy. And the touch wheel is even better then my last unit.   There is really only one thing I would change about the new iPod and that's the GUI. I'm one of the few that does not like the split screen menu with my artwork changing in the background. I'd rather have that as a screen saver option then integrated in the menu. I also believe that the cover flow is a pointless option to have. I have never used it and probably never will. And my last gripe is the screensaver that pops up after you've been listening to your iPod for a while. I would prefer to see what I'm listening to. Call it a control issue if you'd like, but it's just plain annoying.   Over all I really love my new player and wouldn't change it for the world. Goes to show that spontaneity can be a good thing!

<Content>My first and last Apple product.  The click wheel is SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!  Surprise - the TV out works only with expensive Apple cables - I bought the $50 cables they are terrible.  They are cheap and slippery - very hard to use.  No remote control of video.    Just got a gift of a 80 gig Zune.  Stuck the IPOD 160 Classic in a drawer - the Zune is MUCH better.  Zune has video out - video remote - is faster than the IPOD - has a bigger and better screen - etc..  Wish I could get my money back for the IPOD.  DO NOT BUY the IPOD 160, it is a waste of money.
