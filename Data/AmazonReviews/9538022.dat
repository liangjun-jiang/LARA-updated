<Title>EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS, BEST IN ITS CLASS
<Date>Fri Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Initially, I was the dumb consumer ready to buy the big brand names like the new Sony NW 507 or a mini-IPOD. But then I decided to do some research and found out that there are other companies out there, like creative rio and samsung that put out even better mp3 players. I did alot of comparing and Samsung's MTX-6 was the clear choice.   I bought a refurbished model from Samsung mall for $86. It came with a 90 day warranty,(fortunately I haven't had to use the warranty, this product is made well) and delivered right on time. For 86 bucks I got 512 gb, FM radio, voice recorder, and a machine that has many functions to produce the sharpest sound. You'll be surprised, how the SRS WOW format on this thing blows I-PODs right out of the water. My brother has a 20 gig I-POD and the sound is much duller. SRSWOW provides a concert hall type sound.   On top of this, the MT6X is incredibly small and cool looking. In the looks department, only sony's nw 507 can compare, the creative muvos look cheap, and those white boxy Ipods will get old real-fast(like everything from the 80's, trust me.) I wear mine around my neck and its very comfortable to jog with.  The best part about the MT6-X is the fact it uses a AA battery, I just use rechargables and I can't tell you how convenient it is.  The 42 hr battery life is no joke, I've literally listened to this thing 2 days straight.   I used to think Samsung put out inferior products since it was a Korean company, but after I bought an LCD display from them, I was  surprisingly pleased, so I gave the MT6-X a chance, its not just a super deal, its the best in its class.

<Title>A wonderful buy.
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had been researching different mp3 players in hopes to find the best one for the lowest price.  The Samsung YP-MT6X is just that.  It's easy to control, and easy to put music onto.  You don't have to change the file type, and it is great for holding other files as well, such as pictures and word documents.  I use mine for just about everything.  I put all my files onto it when I had to reformat my computer and it worked wonders.  The only thing is that I could probably use one with more memory, because I only get about an average of 120 songs each time I load news songs onto it.  And the voice recorded does not work very well, but perhaps that's just me.  One time I did I have some trouble with loading songs onto it, but I just looked in the booklet for possible causes, and did as the book instructed and everything was fine.  I love being able to put a single battery in and having it last me a few weeks or for a long car ride.  All you need is a pack of batteries and you are good for quite some time, and there is no obligation to charge it at all.  And the player is very light weight.  I do keep mine in the protective case, but I wish that it came with an arm band or something of the sort because it's hard to run with the player strung around my neck, but you can just as easily hold it.  I suggest buying this if you are looking at it.

<Title>iPod shuffle?  PUH-LEEZE!!!
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sure, you could get a shuffle...and pay for all the marketing, hype , advertising they do.  What better way to get people to buy a music player with no display (and little to no playback control) than to brainwash people into thinking its "hip."  What's "hip" to me is performance, quality and control...all of which this Samsung unit has.  And THEN some.  For less than $20 more than the worthless Shuffle, you get a DISPLAY (wow!), an FM tuner, better sound quality, and a multitude of menu options including sleep timers, playlists and adjustable EQ's.  It also supports a slew of formats including licensed WMA's and OGG.  The included USB adaptor lets you use the unit as a flash drive.  There's two adaptors included, a standard USB cable and a mini-connector that lets the unit plug right into the USB port (supports 1.1 and 2.0).  The nicest thing is that you dont have to use any proprietary software to transfer files...you can do it through Windows by dragging and dropping; by Windows Media Player, or any other software that allows synching between devices so you dont have to use the painfully slow iTunes program all the time.  The unit runs off of one AA battery for what seems an eternal 40 hours.  Also, it has the abiiltiy to record from a built-in mic, a stereo source (has a mini 1/8" stereo jack) or you can record from the FM tuner.  How freakin cool is that?  The display is clear and easy to read, and navigating through the easily labled menus is a breeze using the little joystick.  This thing is so packed with features that you would wonder why anyone would get anything else for the price.  I cant say enough about how cool this thing is and how well it performs.  If you pass this up for the Shuffle hype you need to have your head examined.  Samsung rocks!!!

<Title>Returned two players.
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had to return two players.  I went to Samsung website to check if there were any firmware updates available for the YP-MT6X player and there were two; one version was 1.101 and the other 2.121.  So, I installed the software provided by Samsung to upgrade the firmware to version 2.121 (downloaded from Samsung website).  I plugged the player and started the update process.  Everything seemed to be ok.  When I unplugged the USB cable the player would no longer turn on.  I had the same exact problem with the second player.  I contacted Samsung customer support, they were of no use; I was told to send the player to them for service.  If you buy this player, DO NOT UPGRADE FIRMWARE to version 2.121 or you will have problems.

<Title>Disappointed with this player.
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the YP-MT6X for two months, and I've already had to get one unit replaced because it would no longer power up after a firmware upgrade.  I had great hopes for this player because of its small size and the features that is has.  The problem is that this device seems to be pretty buggy.  The biggest problem is that the player will fail to see many of the songs that I copy to it (either from Windows Media Player's "Sync" function, or simply by dragging and dropping folders of music onto it).  After copying music to the device, and then powering up the mp3 player, the player will simply not see some of the songs.  If I navigate to the folders where the missing files should be, the player simply displays a message that says "No Entry".  I know the files are there because when I plug the device into a computer, windows can see all of the music files without any problems.  Both YP-MT6X's that I had did this.  The first player I had died when I tried to "upgrade" the firmware to 2.121 from samsung's website.  I used the firmware updater from samsung's site, and it said everything went fine, but after unplugging the player from my PC it would not power up.  I see at least one other reviewer has mentioned this problem as well, so I am not about to attempt this on my replacement player.  Samsung should not provide the 2.121 firmware on their website section for the MT6X if it causes your player not to power up after you install it!  So apparently I am stuck with the 1.111 version of the firmare that the unit had installed at the factory.  So in short I am left with a buggy player that can not see half of the files that I copy to it.  Changing the music on the player is extremely frustrating due to the "missing files" bugs.  I have not figured out a way around these problems, but I suspect it has something to do with a limit on the number of folders that can exist on the player because I can usually get the player to see the missing files by randomly moving them to different folders until the player finds all of the missing files.  Needless to say, this is a very frustrating process to go through every time I want to copy new music onto the player!  Perhaps if you can get a player with firmware 2.121 on it these issues do not exist, but I would definately recommend that you stay away from players with firmware 1.111.  You apparently can not upgrade the firmware on these units to 2.121, and they are very buggy!

<Title>A good mix of form, function, and price.
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player suits my purposes of listening mostly to podcasts to and from work.  As mentioned in other reviews, it connects easily to xp without the Samsung software.  I use media player to sync my podcasts and Windows Explorer to drag and drop music folders.  You could cram about 16 hours of podcasts onto this thing since they are usually recorded at the 64 kbps quality.   After 2 weeks, I'm still at a full 3 bars of battery life - with the single AA battery included - after using the player everyday on my 45 minute commute and playing with the features at night.  It feels great not to be tied to a charger.  For those buying refurbished, make sure that all accesories are included.  There are 2 usb adapters: a cord and a small plug.  The case is not pretty, but it does seem to offer protection.  I have not played with the line in encoder yet.  The player is small enough to tuck on top of my phone while it is in the cell phone pouch of my briefcase.  It works great with my old school tape deck car adapter; there are even specific audio settings for use with speakers, car adapters, etc.  The menu is a little funky, but I have yet to mistakenly advance a song while trying to up the volume.  The screen is clear and I love the option that lets you see how much time is left in a track.       Other reviews posted since I bought the product have really slammed the product for its not supporting the 2.1 firmware.  My player has the 1.1 firmware and I have no intention of attempting to upgrade after hearing those horror stories.  I'm not sure of the benefit of 2.1, but as of right now it does not seem worth the gamble.  I want to note that the Samsung website includes instructions on how to install the firmware.  Written in some pretty rough Konglish, they instruct you to remove the battery when upgrading along with some other specific steps.  I'm not sure whether those installing the the firmware would have followed these instructions or not.  I have also read that the 1 GB version has trouble dealing with a great number of folders, plus 40 or so.  I assume this would hold true of this 512MB version as well.  Personally, I have experienced no bugs.   Since it's my first mp3 player, I resisted the 5 star rating.  That said, I would be surprised if a comparable iriver or Creative impressed me as much as this little player has.  The display-less Shuffle loses on paper alone.  With the tiny Ipod nano (2GB-$200 and 4GB-$250) announced, flash players will probably make some nice advances over the coming months in terms of memory and displays.  At the moment, though, I am loving my $110 Samsung MT6X.

<Title>FIRMWARE UPDATE TO VER 2.121
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you wish to update your player to version 2.121 you MUST FOLLOW INSTRUCTION provided as a pdf file from Samsung. Before the update, you MUST REMOVE THE BATTERY and hold the play/pause button while connecting the player and starting the update software! I had version 1.111 and upgraded to 2.121 in this way with no problems. If you do not follow these direction your player will not turn on as I have found out the hard way. I had contacted Samsung about this problem and although the technical support was of no use when I called, I later saw that the instructions were posted on Samsung website the same day that I called.

<Content>I have had the Samsung player for a little while now. I really do like all the features, the screen and the fm player especially. The menu is a little confusing, but I have quickly learned to adjust the volume and songs without looking while jogging, an arm strap may be better than that neck strap. I have not upgraded anything and after reading other reviews I will not try, but I do not know if I'd miss any features.

<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I listen to a lot of music on one battery.  I have spent 4 days listening to music all day at work on one AA battery.  The FM tuner is really useful when I want to listen to news or the radio.  The voice recorder comes in handy now and then, plus I can record from the radio or from the output of another device.  I have dropped this several time with no ill effects.  Pros: Great battery life!  Uses AA battery.  Voice recorder, FM tuner, 512MB is actually a lot of music.  Small size.  Great sound.  Seems durable. Cons: Needed to upgrade firmware to make software reliable.  Interface initially not intuitive, but it is easy now that I am used to it.

<Title>WOW! Amazing
<Date>Wed Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I owned a Creative 6Gig Mp3 before I bought this one.  Dropped the Creative and needed to get a new one.  I was a little worried about buying a 512mb unit thinking I would not have enough space.  However, the storage is fine for a whole days worth of music.  I listen to my Mp3 every day and also use it in the car via an adapter.  I think the Samsung product is a great buy for the following reasons. 1. Battery life 42hrs.  I did not know how nice it was not to worry about the battery until I bought this unit. My Creative needed new batteries every 4-6hrs, a big pain if I wasnt at home.  2. The sound is awsome, earphones worked fine.  The preset EQ settings sound great and I also set my own for car use.  It is very easy to go from one setting to the other. 3. Ease if use.  You just hook up the unit to your computer and drag & drop files, that simple.  You create folders on the unit with your computer i.e pop, rock ect. Transfer the songs to those folders then disconnect and start listening.  I read the manual and had a grasp on it by the 3rd or 4th hour of listening. 4. Has built in radio with 20 presets not 6.   You can record off the radio with the click of a button and it gives you a counter of the remaining storage space.  No guessing if you have enough space. 5. The size is awsome too, not much bigger than the AA battery.  I hang it around my neck to play sports and it is very light.  I really don't have alot of complaints about this unit.   1. It is not as powerful as my Creative, so you can not drive unpowered speakers with it.  Which I expected from something as small as a battery.    I would buy again.

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Thu Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this player a few days ago, and can safely say it was the best $120 I ever spent...when I was making my choices, I looked at this as well as the 512 MB IPod shuffle, and this has the IPod shuffle beat in just about everything, and for a scant $20 more...well worth it!  Now on to the pros and cons...  Pros:  -Small size (not much bigger than the 1 AA battery that powers it) -Screen that holds a lot of information in such a small space (HUGE PLUS over the Ipod Shuffle!)...also has a great backlight for night usage -Battery life - 40+ hours on one AA battery -Very easy to load songs onto it...just plug it into the USB port on your computer and use Windows Explorer...no special software needed (though it does come with a CD that is optional)  Cons:  - Slightly awkward controls...if you want to use the controls one handed, I found it much easier to do it if your holding the unit in your left hand, despite me being a righty, but if you have really big hands it might be hard to move the joystick control...also it is very easy to inadvertently press buttons or move the stick, though there is a "Hold" feature that locks out all the controls which helps...

<Title>WOW
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This stylish little MP3 is great.  It's so feature packed and tiny.  You have to see it in person to see how small it is compared to other players.  I bought it to use when I workout but I'm finding that I'm using this device pretty much all day long.  PROS: 1. Small stylish design 2. Clear screen that displays tag info 3. Plays all popular music formats including WMA! I'm sorry I'm not gonna buy some proprietary *rap from Sony or Apple where they only offer certain formats, stupid. I use mainly WMA and sometimes MP3.  ExetremeTech.com rated WMA as the best encoding format (yes they compared sony and apple's format too) for I think at 128kbs. 4. You can create folders and keep an order to your songs. 5. You can create playlists right from the device itself. 6. SRS WOW surround is amazing, especially when listening to music w/ electronic sounds or even Enigma.  Pink Floyd sounds like they are singing right in your head when listening in Rock mode. 7. Can record from the built-in mic, FM tuner, and line-in into a MP3 file.  Yes I thought I'd never use line-in but I ended up recording a bunch of tapes. 8. Nice clear case included, thought it was a nice touch.  Cons: 1. Wish the line in recording could record in a format other than 128kbs, maybe offer a 64kbs? 2. Maybe offer this device in other colors?  I like blue but others may not. 3. Only 42hrs of battery life?  Come on, gimme 100hrs+ guys!!!!!! (wishful thinking) 4. How come no one offers AM radio support?  I'd actually love to record some programs that are offered only on AM, like sports?  Anyone?!  Basically it's as simple as you want it or as customizable as you will end up using it.

<Content>I bought this Samsung MT6X to compliment my iRiver H320.  I wanted something a little smaller but still with great sound and FM capability.  This unit exceeded my needs by far!  The sound is great, it has very clean FM reception, AND it gave me some unexpected extras at a very bargain price...it records FM & voice and also has line input for encoding MP3's on on its own(no 'puter needed). But the biggest bonus is the fact that it uses one AA battery!  It is so nice not being tethered to a proprietary AC power adapter!!!  This is the deal of the year in my opinion.

<Title>Recoding FM
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great FM Reception!  When I first saw the YP-MT6 I thought there's no way this thumb sized device will get reception as good as my big old Sony AM/FM/tape player.  But it does.  And I can plug the YP-MT6 into my Sony if I want to record AM.  I also considered the YP-T7 so I downloaded its manual from the Samsung site.  It has an FM signal to noise ratio of only 45 db, not as good as my YP-MT6's rating of 62 db.  One reason to stick with the YP-MT6 if you plan to use the FM feature.  I find that playback of FM recordings sound best in Normal mode, without the SRS enhancements.  The YP-MT6 uses batteries quickly while recording FM.  My experience is that the rate is ten times faster than playback.  So an alkaline AA that can playback for 42 hours is only good for about four hours of recording.  I record a lot so I bought a pack of four 2500 mAh (high capacity) NiMH batteries.  Each battery is good for about nine hours of recording.  These are rechargeable and cheap (about $10 for the pack and $10 for a charger).  I like this combination of the YP-MT6 and rechargable AA batteries better than the YP-T7's single built-in rechargable battery,  But the YP-MT6 will stop recording before a battery is completely exhausted.  It seems to be programmed to be conservative.  If it waits until the battery is really low then there might not be enough power left to close off the MP3 file.  I've seen this happen and the result is that the entire recording is lost.  My solution is to break up long recordings in hour long chunks.  That way I don't risk the whole session and the MP3 files stay at about 60 MB each.    I think I know why there is no AM radio support.  The YP-MT6 apparently emits a nice strong AM signal itself.  You can still record AM using the patch cord plugged into the headphone jack of any AM radio.  Just keep the two units separated by a couple of feet.  I've contacted Samsung support a couple of times for help.  They are friendly, professional and easy to access.  They also speak and understand English without extra effort.  Another reason to buy Samsung.

<Title>Does the job
<Date>Fri Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the player a couple weeks and really like it.  I don't have a lot to add in terms of pros/cons, but here is some info which you may find useful.  From the YP-MT6 user manual it is not clear that REPEAT ALL can apply to all the songs in folder (rather than all of the songs in the player), but it is possible. Set PLAY MODE to REPEAT ALL. Using NAVIGATION, navigate until the desired folder is highlighted. Press the PLAY/PAUSE button.  If, however, you navigate to a song within the folder before pressing PLAY/PAUSE, then all songs in the player will be repeated.  I've only tested this with firmware 1.2.  For those considering purchasing a YP-MT6 who are not clear on the PLAYLIST function, the PLAYLIST function only allows defining one group of songs at a time as the PLAYLIST, i.e., you cannot have multiple PLAYLISTs and then select which PLAYLIST you want to repeat. (The PLAYLIST group is defined by marking each desired song using the M button.) This only-one-PLAYLIST restriction is why I searched for a way to repeat a folder.  Personally, I really like the YP-MT6X, but was questioning my purchase decision until I figured out how to repeat a Folder.  Also, if you are trying decide between the 512MB X and the 1GB Z, my X is full at 102 songs in WMA format at the default bit rate, which gives reasonable quality. These songs are, I believe, a normal-sized mix -- if you were playing classical music, obviously you would get a lot less. I had read that OGG-format files were smaller and offered better quality, but my test with a few songs indicated that the file size remained about the same -- so I decided to keep my life simple. Beyond my cursory test, there are extensive tests of formats and bit rates available on the web. For those who want to evaluate alternative formats, the free dBpowerAmp Music Converter works well.  Also, if you using Real Player, I found that even when you download Real Player playlists to the YP-MT6, RP places the songs into the YP-MT6's root directory. So I used Windows Explorer to create a Folder on the YP-MT6 and then dragged the songs to the Folder. Then downloaded the next playlist using RP. (For any anti-RP advocates, I started using RP because it has a Sony NetMD driver.)  Also, I've found the Koss QZ-99 headphones to be a good match to the YP-MT6 in a noisy environment (e.g., 16-HP lawn tractor). The YP-MT6 has just enough power to drive the QZ-99 adequately --but not enough power to threaten your hearing. The QZ-99's are bulky and heavy, so there are better choices for other environments. The QZ-99 has a long coiled cord, which can be kept out of the way by tying it to the top of the head band with nylon ties (definitely kludgy) -- then you can stick the player in a shirt pocket, thereby reducing the risk of the cord becoming entangled.

<Content>This thing ROCKS! It's easy to use, easy to set up (no special software needed to load songs - just use Windows Explorer!), and it's smaller than an iPod - only 2.5 inches long and an inch wide. You can carry it anywhere.  I use it to workout at the gym all the time, and even if I just carry it in the palm of my hand, it doesn't bother me.  42 HOURS on a single AA battery? Who WOULDN'T take that?? It also has the FM receiver BUILT IN, and the reception is excellent.  For right around $100, you get what would cost you between $200-$500 for an iPod. Go figure.

<Date>Thu Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The YP-MT6 is a great mp3 player. Having support for OGG files makes me want to switch over to them. One time I tried some test signals with an OGG encoder and found it to have the same performance as mp3 files with at least a 50 pecent slowerr average bitrate. Also I needed something with a record feature. I record a lot of church services and found this unit to be perfect for the job.  Most churches have a 72Mhz auditory assistance transmitter in the sound system so connecting a recorder to one of the hearing impaired receivers gives great audio. The MP3 recorder bitrate settings are 32 48 64 96 and a max of 128 stereo only. There are no settings for mono. 128K works good and gives great sounding audio that I can easily put on my computer and burn to CD. I like the ease of putting the mp3 files on my computer.  One problem is regular alkaline AA cells only work for about 2 hours before it starts shutting down in the middle of a recording session but playback is much better. As stated in another review rechargeable batteries work better and I'm guessing it's because they can deliver more peak current. The battery life is not quite so good as stated in the advertising so I decided to do some testing of my own. I hooked some small wires around the battery terminals and closed the lid then used an adjustable bench top power supply to make some current measurements. When booting up there is a surge of current up to about 150 milliamps then as it settles down and starts playing music it's about 55 milliamps at 1.5 volts and goes up to 90 milliamps at 1 volt. Yes the current goes up as the voltage drops and right below 1 volt the player shuts off.  During record it draws about 160 milliamps average with spikes over 200 milliamps. If the battery starts getting a little weak, the high current spikes during record will cause a sag in the voltage and it stops and shuts off.

<Title>Fantastic Portable Fun!
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This was a smart purchase, on my part. I had asked some friends about their MP3 players and had gotten a variety of opinions and advice, the best being to check out Amazon.com for advice and prices. I have moved music on & off of my player with ease. I have listened to the radio and surfed my music collection, all while working out. This player is easy to use and incredible fun!

<Title>Awesome MP3 player!
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my 12 year old sons, but my husband keeps stealing it! Downloading songs is super easy. My husband and my son run on the treadmill with it and there is no skipping. My husband had to memorize a long a passage and recorded himself reading the passage and listened to it over and over in the car until he learned. We originally started looking at the ipod shuffle but wasn't happy with the fact that you couldn't choose the song you wanted to listen to. It shuffles your songs randomly. You can choose the songs you want to listen to with this. The sound quality is incredible. One small drawback is the earphones. They sound great but don't stay in your ears very well so we use different ear phones. I still give it 5 stars for overall satisfaction because it is more than worth the money.

<Title>Good features/Average quality
<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered this MP3 player based on features, long battery life, and good reviews. Luckily, I haven't had any of the technical problems others have listed, but I'm underwhelmed with the sound quality of this player.  Voice recording is muffled and can be hard to understand with built-in mike and refused to record at all with a powered external mike. FM reception ok, but I've heard better on other MP3 players. Fairly easy to navigate and seems to be solid build. Ok, but not great, player.

<Title>Another Samsung Yepp Winner!
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Samsung has done it again with the YP-MT6X mp3 player.  this model is even better than the earlier 256 MB Yepp.  The display is brighter and more detailed. There is a great little 5 band equalizer which is a big plus over preset equalizer settings. The FM tuner isn't a bad joke as in the 256 MB model. The tuner in this model is fairly sensitive which is important if you don't live in an urban area (I don't).  Navigation through the controls is fairly easy and straight forward with the only annoying factor that some adjustments force going back out of the adjustments menu to the basic player display.  I have played my Yepp all day today with a mix of talk radio (recorded with the mp3 encoder in the Yepp) and music at highest volume and have yet to see the battery indicator begin to dip to lower charge level.  The change from the AAA battery in the earlier model to the AA battery in this model showed some real intelligence. It is so much more handy to not have to carry a spare battery around!  I have had three other Mp3 players and this is the best of the whole group.  I can comfortably recommend the YP-MT6X mp3 player to anyone.

<Title>Great MP3 player only one problem with it though
<Date>Sun Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The mp3 player has a setting on it called the wow eq, which makes the songs sound incredibly good, however the play/stop button on the top will get accidentally pushed alot if you put it in your pocket (to keep this from happening all you have to do is use the hold button, located on the exact opposite side of the mp3 player, if you put it hold it won't stop playing no matter what you do, until it is taken off hold) but that is one thing I've run into. So its basically its really durable, sounds great, but accidentally stops playing if you put it in pocket without putting it on hold.

<Content>I've researched just about every mp3 player/digital audio player for the last few months and finally decided on the YP-MT6X. You truly can't beat the performance of this tiny player for the price. It's loaded with features that are easy to use, a clear easy-to-read 4-line screen, and the sound quality of all of the different equalizer settings is awesome (Yep, you can choose Classic, Jazz, Rock, etc. or create your own!). There are other great choices besides the iPod, and this is definitely one of those choices.

<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using this one for an year now, and so far it's been an awesome MP3 player to have. It's compact, the battery life really lasts long, especially if using rechargeable batteries and the sound quality really makes one go "wow!". Couple of annoyances though - the play button accidently gets pushed when put in purse and not in use. Also, its not easy to find a particular song track on the player, you have to navigate your way through.

<Content>I have had this MP3 Player for about 1 year now. I love it. I've gotten used to it enough that I can just about navigate through the whole thing without even looking. I would say this is a good Player to start with, but the amount it holds has gotten too small for me. My Samsung has survived many drops. I have dropped it many times and it still works great. The only problem is that about 1 month ago I dropped it and the battery cover fell off. It still works but i have to tape it. Overall, this is a great buy and was well worth the money.

<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player is small, but heavy when you are wearing it. When you run if bounces around because of the weight.  I had trouble downloading music and using the little joystick to select options. I am buying a ipod nano in 2 days because I need an mp3 player that is user friendly. I can say their customer support is great because I had to call them to get them to help me with the down loading of music. I owned a Rio cali before and it was very simple to use - unlike this mp3 player.

<Title>Problems with podcasts
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would give this product more star if it weren't for a flaw that is a dealbreaker for me.  I feel like giving it a one star, but it really does have a lot of nice features, as the other users have pointed out.  I listen mostly to podcasts, and during the playback, when I press the pause button, the unit powers off, without the usual power off graphics, then it turns right back on again.  It always resumes playback on the same place, regardless of where in the playback it was turned off.  This happens with both versions of the firmware on Samsung download site.  I cannot skip to the next podcast file neither.  It resumes the off/on loop, and starts play at the same darned location on the podcast playback.  I tried fast forwarding to the end of the problem podcast, and see if it would finish playing normally and then go to the next podcast.  It did not work.  It powers off then it resumes play at the same location yet again.  The only way I can stop the incessant turning on the player is to connect to the PC and delete the problematic file.  I cannot delete the file any other way, once this problem starts.  This is very frustrating, especially when I am not close to the computer.  I called customer service and they were no help.  I will not spend $125 to try to fix an MP3 player that costs $80.  The fix is not even guaranteed.  Now, I am stuck with this player.  I don't know if I'll just live with this problem, or buy another player.  This problem crops up only about once a week, but when it happens, it is usually at the most inopportune time.

<Title>Defective
<Date>Sat Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this unit since 11-06 and have used it infrequently. The first problem I had 2-3 months ago was trying to delete files (while not plugged into my PC) which I was successful doing  once. After that I would go into delete and the cursor would bounce around. Now when I go to delete a file the unit shuts off. I've had problems with trying to resume to listening to files (podcasts) similar to another review, when previously it worked fine and resumed where I left off. I also can't turn the unit  on or off 4/5 times without having to remove the battery to "reset" it. Customer service was good when trying to help me out.

The little plastic cover it comes with did break and the battery cover cracked, but it STILL WORKS.  You would think she is trying to break it on purpose, but that little Samsung will not give up.

<Content>I was interested in this player due to the fact it plays OGG files (since I just made the jump to a Linux system) and that it had a line in for recording MP3's straight to memory. Problem was, every time I went to change modes to record, or use the FM radio feature, or even to change the track it was playing, the device would power off & reboot. I contacted Samsung and the recommended that I download a firmware upgrade from their website, still no improvement. I'm very disappointed with this product.

<Content>The YP-MT6 is not and will not be compatible with Vista, no matter what the Samsung website suggests.  Samsung Customer Service told me that I have to revert back to XP to get it to sync with my new computer (yeah right).  Caveat Emptor for all Samsung Products.  The unit itself is great, I have had it for a year, but it is useless if it cannot be used in the "flash-drive" fashion in which it was designed.  I wouldn't buy a samsung again.

<Title>Put it on your short list!
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I decided to buy a player as a 40th birthday present for myself.  I thought about buying an iPod shuffle, but decided to check out customer and professional reviews first.  PC World's review of the iPod said the Samsung product was a much better buy (since it includes 1) FM tuner, 2) an LCD display & 3) a voice recorder, and is made out of metal, not plastic), so I started looking at the reviews for the YP-MT6X.  The reviews were stellar, and I decided to "roll the dice" and order this on line (since no store in our shopping area carried the player).  The gamble paid off - I got a great player and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an alternative to iPod.

<Title>Excellent tiny player
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an excellent tiny player, it also works as a regular usb flash drive, so no extra software needed (and works out of the box under linux)  I guess one tiny thing which slightly annoys me is that if the player is paused, it turns off automatically, and then it takes 3 seconds to boot back. But this by no means is not a major issue and this is a really enjoyable product. The package also contains a small adapter which could be used to connect player to the computer (instead of  regular cable, which is also included), which is very convinient to connect it to laptop.

<Title>Firmware upgrade
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound quality of this mp3 far surpasses that of a Creative Labs mp3 player, and if you know creative labs you know they make the best sound cards available. I had the same problem with the firmware upgrade as a few other have had, but it clearly states at the bottom of the .pdf manual that if the mp3 player does not turn on after it has had the firmware upgraded, try again. I repeated the process and now my mp3 player works even better then it did before without any of the prior bugs. Navigating through songs is a breeze, play around with it for about 5 minutes and you'll know the setup like the back of your hand. I would recomend this mp3 player to anyone who is extremely picky about sound quality and people who want somthing that isnt complicated what so ever.

<Content>Player is great. Sound is very good. Battery life is awesome, does last for some time. Headphone is a little bit big that kinda hurt my ear a little after wear it for a while. Play button can be pushed accidentally when put in pocket. Useful clear case to protect from scratches. Just bought a 2nd one for my sister.  I also bought the newer YP-C1X since it has same battery life rating. YP-C1X is a little bit bigger, round on the back and does NOT come with clear plastic case or battery. It has new USB cable which has two connectors @ the other end. One used to connect to regular USB port on PC and the other used to connect to audio source for direct encoding. YP-MT6X comes with 2 separate cables. Both models have the annoying beep when 1st turned on. Both models have similar screen and fairly similar menu settings. Connecting to USB port and transfer file is a breeze, very easy. Just plug it in, pc detects it as a removable drive. Drag and drop to copy WMAs to player in no time. Both models are nice. It would be nice if YP-C1X has a protective clear case as well. Not sure what happens to the starter battery. Samsung surely try to cut cost there. Not a big issue for me.

<Content>I received this little gem as a X-mas gift and it sat around my desk for sometime before I finally used it. Right off the bat I was impressed with it's small size while being sturdily constructed. It's taken quite a bit of punishment; dropped multiple times on hard surfaces and it's still going strong. I'm still looking for a an armband case that will best fit this device however. It's easy enough to use, most of the menus are easy enough to navigate. The display is decent and provides a brief backlight when you toggle through your song selections.   It's been able to play every song I've downloaded and the speed in which it does so has been decent. The headphones that come with the device produces good sound quality but tend to fall out of your ears easily when your sweatin' heavy. I'll be purchasing the Sennheiser MX75 headphones even though they look bloody ugly.   The only serious drawback is the inability to manage your playlists. You have ALL of your songs available and the only way to regulate this is to go into the device and choose each song individually to play.  All and all a solid mp3 player that will serve you well.
