<Title>Not Worth the Price
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple Computers should be ashamed of themselves. I received my 40 GB ipod as a 2004 Christmas present and the problems began after only 6 months. Though I sould say, I really loved my ipod before it crapped out on me. I see a lot of other customers have had similar trouble with this thing and I just want to cast my vote of disapproval. The problems are: The computer/itunes not recognizing the ipod. The hard drive spinning up but never starting. The hard drive crashing and losing all data resulting in having to reset the ipod to factory settings and reinstalling the software and after all that having the same problem happen again.  After hearing all the horror stories about Apple's customer service I figure it's not worth trying to repair. Since this model has been discontinued, there's no point in telling people not to buy it now. I only hope that the new ipods are better. I'll be reading the reviews very carefully if and when I decide to get another ipod. Live and learn.

<Title>Better than expected, 4G 40GB iPod
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You don't find many of these new and still wrapped in plastic. I needed one with firewire, so this is what I bought. It was packaged just fine and I received it via UPS just in time. I'm just not fond of using UPS. As for the actual iPod, I love it. I had a 2nd generation for a long time, but after botching it up, I needed a new one. I would have gone with a video iPod, but both Macs I own do not have USB 2.0. Transfer rates would have been s l o w. I needed one with firewire and enough room to hold my music. I can't believe Apple abandoned firewire on the newer models. Mine even came with the dock. Apple has abandoned that notion as well in the new iPods. Having a dock really is nice. The price on this one might have been a bit much considering its age, but you can't beat finding a 4th gen 40GB iPod in new condition this far down the road. I'm protecting the screen after seeing scratches on my brother's 20GB 4G. I'm more careful with my stuff though, so even without the screen protector, I doubt I'll see much damage. I'm not taking any chances though.

<Title>4G ipods, the most unreliable one you can buy
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Be warned folks, the 4th generation of ipod is the most unreliable in the lineup. If you're looking for a cheaper old version of ipod (who needs video anyway) go for the 3G. My almost 2 year old ipod popped up with the notorious sad face icon out of nowhere and is now unusable. I have taken very good care of it in that time, never even dropping it once. I called the NYC Apple Store to ask about getting it fixed and was told I was better off buying a new one! How about that? Nice customer service.  Needless to say when I do get around to replacing my broken mp3 player it won't be one from Apple.  Obviously I will miss the use of ease I have come to expect but the hardware is simply not hardy enough.

<Title>Lemon of the Bunch
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In the first year, I had to send my iPod in under warranty a total of three times.  Twice, they replaced it.  My iPod recently died for good, and because I'm not covered under warranty anymore, I could buy a new one for the cost of replacing it.  When I looked into it, I found that loads of people with the same model had the exact same problems.  It's the lemon of the bunch.  There's a reason they discontinued it.

<Title>Another One Bites The Dust
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After owning my 4G 40GB IPOD for almost a year, it died out. Luckily, I owned it for ALMOST a year, and sent it in before my warranty expired out. Apple sent me a brand new IPOD with a postage paid envelope to send in my defective one. I was happy at the fact that they did it so quickly too. The only problem was that my problems weren't over. After about 6 months of using the new IPOD, it died out too. I have no warrenty now, so i'm stuck trying to  restore, restart, and all those other crappy "R" fixes that they have that don't work. Now it seems that i'm just another statistic for people who spent a lot of money on a peice of junk. Apple has made a lot of money off this product, I think the least they should do is have some sort of definite recall for anyone who has bought this model. It's really pretty discouraging to see this many people with the same problem. I loved the ease of use of it, but now i'm really hesitant on buying a new IPOD. That new Zune is actually starting to look kind of good...

<Title>Apple 40 GB iPod Lemon Club
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a member of the 40 GIG Ipod Club. Purchased first 40 GIG Ipod 2/05. First Hard Drive Failure 10/01/05. At that time thought it would be wise to purchase Apple Care Protection for Ipod. Second hard drive failure 2/22/06. Third Hard Drive failure 8/06. Brought it in to Apple store and the guy said the connector to the hard drive was loose and he fixed it (taped it in place). It worked so I was happy. He also said they were not supposed to fix them and he would order me a new one if I wanted, I was happy it was working and went on my way. Fourth hard drive failure 11/10/06. Brought it in and they are ordering me a new or refurbished one. I like my Ipod but this is rediculous. I guess the next one will last 4 to 9 months, I will be out of warranty, maybe I can fix it myself or buy a more dependable Ipod, or heaven forbid, buy a Microsoft Zune or whatever they call them.

<Title>Yet another 40g with recurring hard drive problems
<Date>Mon Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was lucky enough to have an HP service contract that extends the warranty for 90 days after repair. My iPod 40g has failed for the 8th time in less than 2 years or like clock-work about every 90 days. Always the same "Sad Face" icon that will not respond to any of the simple procedures that Apple or HP propose to remedy the problem.  I cannot understand why Apple has not instituted at least a trade-in program for this ultimate lemon.  A recent survey showed that it failed at 10x the rate of the newer models.  For me, I am not sure that I will ever buy an Apple product again regardless of a trade-in.  I really have never understood the cult of Apple.  It is no more reliable a product or more intuitive a product than anyone else.  It is all Steve's PR.

<Title>What a Lemon!!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got it new about 2 years ago. I bought it from Apple's Refurb site, and when it arrived, it showed the sad iPod icon. I took it to Apple, they said it needed a new hard drive!!!! Then the clickwheel went on it, which makes it so it won't always respond. Then the hold switch won't lock on it, and then all the problems stopped for a while. Then 5 months later, it wouldn't even turn on, and then only the backlight would show, and there was nothing on the screen. When the warranty was up, it died on that day. Now it sits in it's box on my desk. Don't buy this iPod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>I got mine for a Xmas present 2 years ago.  Within 6 months it acted up, making me do the ridiculous R method of resetting it over and again.  Itunes refuses to recognize it and now it tells me that I have a corrupted iPod--no kidding!  At the moment, it is sitting on my desk like a dead bug on its back, frozen.  Save yourself years of aggravation, listen to those of us who have had this for over a year...caveat emptor.

<Title>To put it more succinctly...
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>...an excellent option in this field. Yes, you must use iTunes, but no, that isn't a problem. Yes it's big, and yes, if you don't have a collection of, say, at least 300 CDs or so, then you should probably opt for a cheaper model with less memory (unless you have to have very high quality in your files). Yes, occasionally locks up, but restarting is an easy process that just takes a few seconds. Great interface, great sound, great capacity, quick to transfer music, looks good (I disagree that the chrome backing is bad design), and even this larger model fits easily in many pockets or other such places.   One note re the battery: it is NOT the case that you should never let the battery go dead. That was good advice back in the days of NiCad batteries (which still appear in cheaper, smaller items) due to the so-called "memory" effect involved with those batteries. However, as Apple advises in the iPod section of their site (and indeed as other makers, such as Nokia, advise you to do with their products, as well), you SHOULD let the NiMH battery run out completely and then recharge it completely perhaps once a month. This scrambles up the electrons are whatever in the battery and extends its life as opposed to shortening it.  In short, you cannot go wrong with this unless you just plain don't need it.

<Title>The iPod is good but.... 
<Date>Sat Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Spent a bomb on the 40GB iPod (apparently the 20GB model is out of stock all over Singapore where I am at) and kinda regretting it, though I wont be giving it away to anyone. HAH!~! Anyway grouses currently are :  1. Songs cannot be transferred to PC which means only 1 way transfer from PC to the iPod is possible now! (installed 3rd party software does help.)  2. There is no cross-fading feature unlike some other players and no gap-less play. This means for those dance compilations or for albums like Pink Floyd's The Wall, expect some pause btw tracks. This is blamed on the MP3 format (but I wonder why other MP3 players can do it!) For gap-less play, Apple recommends all tracks be joined seamlessly into 1 large file. I cant search for a particular track like that!! There are petitions on plenty of sites asking Apple for this feature.   3. No Alphabetical Search feature which means all tracks have to be scrolled. So if you have thousands of artistes and bands, then good luck!  4. No casing or remote is given and they have to be purchased separately. These cost abt 68 bucks for remote PLUS another 40 - 80 bucks for the casing.   5. The iPod looks so scratch-able!! It's scary... what's the point of the iPod looking cool and sexy when it's wrapped up like a mummy. (that rhymes, take note)  6. The earphones are white... err.. unsightly to hook up my other (mostly black) earphones to the remote.  7, Remote does not display song titles.   8. Only ITunes can be used with the iPod. Apple does a good job of disabling other software with every update AND no drag and drop into Windows Explorer. iPod wont detect those files.  9. Battery does seem to drain fast unless you turn decide not to turn on the equalizers, shuffle feature and dont ever forward any track that's currently playing.  10. The remote cable is TOO long. I have to wind it round my iPod when i throw it into my bag.  11. Made in China! (doubts abt quality control... I always had the conception that products in China are mass produced and dont go through quality checks)   12. It's freaking expensive still!  13. Back to earphones, these are the type that cant be slung behind your neck... so when someone stops you for a chat, you have to hold the ear-buds with your hands. Geesh.. I LOVE complaining...   14. The Dock which comes only with the 40GB model makes no sense to me. A box which is used to charge the iPod but the cable connected to the box can be connected directly to the iPod for charging. THAT box only helps to make the iPod stand upright! DUH~! What diff does it make... sigh..   15. Gotta make sure all the files are tagged properly. This doesnt mean just renaming the files but editin the tags individually. Time consuming task! Else you get 2 instances of the same band and the songs wont be in the correct album, not in squence as in the album etc..   Phew... this is the kinda review you guys appreciate I hope. Something you should consider and what most people dont tell you. haha... the good thing is the sound rocks n I have an iPod and you don't!! Wait for Xmas and you might just get the out-of-stock 20GB model your parents bought for you last month...

<Title>Fragile & Disposable
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I dropped my 40 GB iPod in the sink for the briefest of moments.  Believe me, the smooth shiny case is conducive to slipping out of hand or pocket.  Water rushed into the docking port and the unit is toast.  Naturally, water damage is not covered by the warranty.   But now the bad news ... it costs $249 plus $7 in shipping, or $256 to obtain a refurbished iPod (nothing is repaired), compared to $399 for a new 40 GB iPod (or $299 for the 20 GB model with the same repair charge).  It is the same charge whether covered by warranty or not.  There is NO credit for being under warranty whatsoever.  Even a battery replacement is $99 plus $7 in shipping.    Apple product support personnel were matter of fact about the charge and the problem of water.  One told me of an iPod destroyed by being splashed poolside.  Another mentioned that he has raised internally the problem of water rushing into the docking port.  Imagine walking around with an iPod in even a steady rain.     A friend has replaced her teenage son's iPod twice in a year due to breakage.     My conclusions - the 40 GB iPod is a fragile, expensive piece of equipment with arguably a design flaw.  The excessive cost of repair/replacment undermines its attractiveness.  It was my first Apple product and my last.  Bad show Apple!

<Title>Excellent Item!
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It seems that the iPod was hands down the hottest Christmas gift of 2004.  I went to Circuit City recently to look for accessories and they were completely sold out of everything from the units themselves, to all of the different accessories.  I've never actually seen anyone who owns one on campus, so when I return in January, I expect that they'll be everywhere.    I opted for the 40GB version.  A lot of people seem to go for the smaller hard drives because they claim they don't really need 40GB, but I think it has more to do with the price.  Most people are biased towards the model that they own.  Although I think they're all overpriced and the 400 dollars I shelled out for my model isn't that big of a difference compared to the others.  I bought 40GB just to be safe.  Where do I start?  For one, you MUST use iTunes in order to run your iPod, which is one of the biggest questions people seem to have.  No, that doesn't mean you have to download your music from the iTunes store, as I think they're expensive and I have other ways of acquiring mp3s.  I have an enormous collection of CDs and previously burned CD-R compilations, and it's great to be able to store them all on the hard drive and never have to worry about lugging around my CD collection ever again.    I want to note that while one of the major selling points of the 40GB iPod is its ability to hold 10,000 songs, you must remember that the amount of songs you can store isn't based on a number.  It is based on the size of each file.  About 90 percent of my mp3s are ripped at 192kps which is equivalent to CD quality sound, as opposed to the more popular 128kps, which compresses the files to where they lose quality.  Some don't notice a difference, but believe me if you have a tendency to blast your music and prefer crystal clear sound, then you'll want the best quality possible for sure.  I have about 1000 songs currently on my iPod and I've only taken up about 5GB worth of space.  So if this remains consistent, I'll be able to squeeze around 8,000 songs on it when it's all said and done.  Although the chances of me even finding 8,000 songs that I actually LIKE is very rare.  I've heard many horror stories about iPods freezing up, going dead, or bad sound quality.  I haven't experienced any of these yet and from what I've heard, Apple is pretty good about accommodating the customers, so hopefully I'll not run into any real problems either way.    Supposedly the built-in battery only lasts for about a year and I believe it's 100 dollars to replace it.  Although hopefully a year from now, the prices will drop a little bit.  By next Christmas, I can see the iPods getting a bit of a price drop.    The ear buds are okay.  A lot of people hate them but I don't really have any problems.  However, my primary use of the iPod is in my car so it's of no real concern to me.  If you have a cassette deck in your car, then a good adapter will run you about 20 bucks.  I do not have a cassette deck in my car, so I had to invest in an FM transmitter which plugs into your cigarette lighter and uses an unused radio station to play the tunes.  I bought a Monster Cable iCarPlay for 50 dollars through Amazon and it works fine and also charges your iPod while you use it.  There are cheaper versions, but this one is the best.  Circuit City sells the same thing for 75 dollars, so you're best to go with Amazon for that.  Back to the iPod model itself.  It comes with everything you need to get it running.  A charging dock, and USB and FireWire cables, headphones, and the iTunes software.    The chrome back is very annoying and will scratch very easily if you're not careful.  Even if there are no scratches, just handling it will result in ugly fingerprints everywhere.  It's almost as if Apple did this on purpose so we'd have to invest in a case.  You'd think for the price we pay they'd throw that in.  There are so many different ones and this was probably the hardest choice for me.  I finally went with a iSkin eVo2 which has a screen cover, and allows me to access all of the outlets.  They run about 25 to 30 dollars.  Some cases do not protect your screen, and some of them cover up the entire iPod, making access to click wheel or the outlets difficult or impossible.  The biggest complaint people seem to have is about the battery life.  Apple boasts that it'll last for 8 hours.  I have yet to have mine drain out completely yet.  Even before I had my FM transmitter, when I just used the headphones, I was in my car for 4 hours and the battery was only halfway drained.  It seems that when you first use it, the bar will start going down quickly but then has a tendency to stop.  If it's really that big of a problem, I'd suggest buying a battery pack which hooks onto your iPod.  Someone else pointed out that battery life preservation has to do with the way you use your iPod.  The less you use your backlight, and the less you fast forward or skip through songs, the longer your battery will last.  Because of this, I always make playlists before I go out.   All in all, I think it's a great gadget and is well worth the investment, despite the current backlash that seems to be going on right now.  My only complaint is the amount of money I've had to spend on extra accessories.  Expect to spend another 100 dollars or so if you want a case, FM transmitter, and a car dock.  I haven't bought a wireless remote yet, but probably will in a few months, and that'll run another 50 bucks.  I give the product 5 stars easily.

<Content>I just received an iPod for Christmas and let me tell you, I love it!  It's quite compact and cute, has huge amounts of storage space, has great sound, the list could go on all night...or at least for another minute or so.  I take it with me everywhere I go, for example, the grocery store, the mall, the bathroom, work, church, my car, and even exercising.  The shuffle mode is great because it provides a nice surprise with each new random song.  Yes, it's a little on the expensive side, but after you realize how much more you get in return, you realize that you wouldn't have minded paying more!

<Title>iPod Changes my image of Apple
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have always been taught that the Apple is the Anti-Windows, a freezing computer with the whole computer inside the monitor. They were ugly until they came out with the pretty colors in the mid 90's.  The iPod has changed my outlook because my iPod has not frozen up yet, and i continue to be surprised at the things that it can do. Yes, it is a bit overpriced, and it is only compatible with iTunes. That means mp3's, WMA's, or anything else that is PC-based will not work with the little wonder. In that respect, it can take a long time to covert all of the music on your hard drive into the right format for iTunes. After you have all your music loaded onto your computer from your CD collection,(Simply insert into the CD drive, open iTunes, and press import on the CD screen) it is easy sailing. You can create playlists, listen to music, and rate your tunes. You can also sinc-up your iPod using the included dock. All of your music will go straight into it. This usually takes a few seconds it you haven't added any new CD's, or a few minutes if you have. My whole CD collection, which takes up a lot of space, only takes up a little more than half of the 40 GB. If you have a small collection, I reccomend the 20 GB rather than an iPod Mini. The Minies are cute, but they cost only $50 less than the 20 GB, and only have 4 GB, which is a 4,000 song difference! Believe me, you will want to be buying new music for your iPod all the time. New tunes only cost $.99 each, or the whole CD for $10. That is cheaper than you could buy at the store, and you can choose which songs you actually want!! There are some cons, however. It is difficult to figure out from the instructions how to add contacts and calendar dates. Also, the foam earbud covers fall off frequently, and can be difficult to put back on. I suggest investing in the In-Ear headphones from Apple. That will take away this con.  Overall, I would definately suggest the iPod for any Techie!!

<Title>Batteries still an issue
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Let me start out by saying that I love my iPod overall, but the advertised "up to 12 hours of battery life" isn't even close to reality. The best I have been able to get is around 6 hours. At first I was only getting 4-5. After some searching around Apple's site I saw some information that claimed if you use low amounts of compression, the battery life will suffer. At the time I was using files with Apple's lossless compression. I converted the songs to AAC 128, and the life has improved to around 6 hours. But, under no circumstances can I ever get beyond that amount of time. I can't even fathom what scenario might give you 12 hours of life. This is really disapointing for me. I was using Archos units in the past that were giving me 8-12 hours of life all the time. It also seems to take more than 4 hours to charge. Usually 5-6 hours.  Other than the battery I am very happy with the unit. Controls and interface are much better than Archos units. A lot of thought went into the interface, as it is extremely user friendly.  As long as you use iTunes to organize and sync your iPod you should have no issues. You'll probably find that you need to tweak the artists and album names in iTunes to get your music organized on the unit the way you want it. Syncing with the dock and firewire is very quick. 6,500 files synced initially in about an hour and a half. After that daily syncs take no time at all.  Nothing like carrying 450 CD's in your pocket. Just wish the battery would give me a couple more hours.

<Title>Wonderful until it breaks
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Worked just great for about 9 months, never crashed once.  Then one day it just woulnd't turn on anymore.  I sent it in for replacement, but instead of a new one they gave me a refurbished one.  This one crashed once in a while, had to be reformated twice, until 5 months later it permanently crashed.  They sent me another refurbished one which crashes about 50% of the times I use it, had to be restored twice and then crashed permanently just 2 months after receiving it. I am so angry with Apple now.  I deserve my money back for this.

<Title>AWFUL! I will never buy another iPod again! 
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this iPod for $350 last March. Less than two months later, it started freezing. Customer service finally sent me anouther one in July. It worked for a few months. Then it started crashing again. I was finally told a few days ago that my hard drive needs to be replaced...for $319. My limited warranty had expired! An independent repair service quoted me $200 for a replacement hard drive. I am outraged and will never buy an iPod again. $350 for nothing!

<Title>Piece of crap, I feel sorry for you if you have an HP
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hp Ipod what can I say. I got it as a christmas present in 2004 and it broke down in 2005. Hp sent me a new one no problem but then the new one was worse than my old one. The new one was only 6 months old. I emailed Hp and they were not very nice about my situation as they were the first time.  They took me through ever troubleshooting that I have already done.  Then they told me that I would have to get a new one. I thought this was ridculous because they sent me one just 6 months ago. I said they sent me a faulty product and I should not have to get a new one.  They told me it was just like a computer and the hard drive can stop at anytime. Please! I have had many PC and the only time they mess up was when I did something wrong. My hard drive never messes up in the computer.  I never dropped my ipod i always update it and I think it is pretty ridiculous that a product 400 dollars has a shelf life of 6months to a year. BEWARE WHEN YOU BUY.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player! It broke things wide open
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this ipod, my first, for my birthday when I was in college. I have gotten an amazing amount of use from it, and it hasn't the slightest indication of imaging and has shown absolutely no flaws from the beginning. It doesn't have the bells and whistles that the more recent upgraded models have, but this particular ipod broke the barriers of the previous mp3 players on the market and demonstrated what huge amounts of music data could be stored on such a small thing. If you're looking for the bare bones music player, with no need for the video and picture-holding capabilities, and you have a lot of music to boot, this is a great option for you. It's a shame the current high-capacity iPods offer only 30GB and 60GB, respectively, because I imagine a lot of people would prefer thier device to fall somewhere between those two storage amounts. I think Apple should produce a very wide variety of sizes and features for its listeners. Either way, though, this makes a great product, and for the enrichment of my ears (and for the deflation of my pockets), I will probably be buying iPods for the rest of my days.

<Title>Excellent user interface, but died in less than 2 years
<Date>Sat Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the iPod interface, but this little guy just can't seem to last two years.  My hard drive died, and the Apple store couldn't get it going again unless I shelled out $200-$250 for a replacement hard drive.  Might as well buy a new one.  I have to say that these iPods either have batteries or hard drives that die in what seems to be a short time frame.  Apple did offer me a 10% discount on my next iPod if I turned in my old one, but to be honest, I found that a laughable offer give how much I originally paid for it.  They also wanted me to buy the $60 extended warrenty (so that it would cover two instead of one years).  Apple, if you can't make a product that lasts for two years, then either take it off the market or improve your quality.  I did buy another iPod because the store offered me a student's discount, but if this one dies with in two years, I am seriously going to consider another company.

<Content>I bought this 40 GB iPod for $195 refurbished at Small Dog Electronics.  It has a one year warranty.  It's my first iPod and is a dream (especially once I figured out the shuffle).  It's easy to use.  As someone else recommended, make sure to upload your music to iTunes and take the time to properly categorize your genres, etc.  This will maximize your experience in listening to exactly what you want.

<Title>Meets My Bedside Needs But Not the Best Portable
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My research, both online and talking to iPod users, made me realize that if I wanted portable music I wanted LESS GB, not more because 20, 40, and 60 GB models strain the battery. But I wanted a huge GB storage space and only wanted to use my iPod beside my bed so I got the 40 GB model a year and a half ago. The battery should last me forever since I stick on a rechargeable JBL Soundstage system (good, not great, but I don't super high volume next to my bed pillow). So far I've had no battery problems.  For bedside or table use, get lots of GB. For a portable, getter a less expensive, less GB model.

<Content>Really liked my Ipod for almost 2 years, thought the sound quality was fine, like Itunes and the playlists, bought a car radio with an Aux plug and used it in the car every day.  All of a sudden the hard drive just died 2 days ago- wouldn't mount to the computer initially and then wouldn't turn on at all.  I am just barely within my 2 year window for my American Express extended warranty, so hopefully I will come out ok- the replacement cost from the Apple Store near me is $270....  I am not happy that a $400 player would just die within 2 years and no one at Apple cares.  Ridiculous.

All of a sudden I noticed the battery wasn't holding a charge, then my computer and itunes wouldn't recognize it, and after resetting it (ie erasing all my music from it) and reinstalling itunes I can't get it to work.

<Title>The 40 Gigabyte drives are defective
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got myself this 40 gig iPod from Amazon for Christmas 2004. In early 2005 Apple introduced the 60 gig iPod. (Missed it by that much!) Mine worked fine for 7 months then the hard drive kept spinning up, over and over, but would never engage and the screen displayed a sad face icon. Went to Apple's support site and tried their suggestions but when you get that sad face icon it basically needs service. The site gave me a form to fill out to return the iPod to Apple by mail. (I didn't know there was an Apple store about 30 minutes (one way) from me and the site didn't bother to inform me of that.) Apple sends me an empty box overnight. I slip the iPod inside and call DHL back to come pick it up. An hour later it was on its way back to Apple, overnight. They check it in the next day but it takes 3 days before they get around to sending me a replacement. Another overnight shipment and after a week I get my replacement iPod. Cost me over $30 in shipping to do this because Apple will only pay for shipping for the first 6 months of your 1-year warranty. They also don't offer a cheaper non-overnight alternative. I did love the iPod when it worked so I figured I'd better protect the nearly $400 investment with Apple's extended warranty. About $70 more. With that Apple would pay shipping during the warranty period.   So I pull out my replacement iPod, turn it on and -voila!- sad face icon! Right out of the box! Call them up. Ask if they will send me a new one and I'll slip this broken one in the return box. Nope. Not their process. So we do the empty-box-to-me-overnight, full-box-to-them-overnight, three-days-to-send-a-replacement-overnight and a-week-later-I get-my-3rd-replacement-iPod tango. Actually, it's the same one I sent them with a letter saying they were able to fix it without any repairs to the hardware. I turn it on and ta-da! Sad face icon! I'm getting steamed. Do a little poking about the Apple site and find there is an Apple store in a mall 30 minutes from me. WHAT?! I don't have to do the weeklong mail repair? I make an online appointment with the Apple Genius Bar and show up right on time. Genius hears my story, sees the problem, will replace, but they are out of stock of the 40 gig iPods, might take a week to get them in. Argh! Okay, 2 days later I get a call from the store telling me my iPod is ready for pickup. They tell me no appt necessary when just picking up so I go at my convenience. Genius gives me 4th iPod. I turn it on. Bada-bing! Sad face icon, right out of the box, right in front of Genius's face! He gets another one from the back. Holy smokes, the 5th iPod works! I take it home and spend several hours recharging and then uploading my 20 gigs of music, audiobooks, and podcasts.   5th iPod lasts about 2 months and I'm back at the Genius bar again. This genius tells me they had a bad batch of the 40 gig drives when I got my last replacement but he's gonna give me a new one which will be fine. Uh-huh. My 6th 40 gig iPod works a few months then does the same damned thing with the hard drive spinning up over and over in and endless loop but never being able to read the contents. Back to the Genius bar and onto replacement iPod #7.   So $500, 4 hours of driving + gas costs, and 7 iPods later, I have 4 months left on my extended warranty. Cats have nine lives do iPods? It's pretty clear the 40 gig drives are defective and "the bad batch" is the ONLY batch they have and rather than upgrading customers to a product that works they just keep feeding us the same supply of defective junk until the warranty runs out and we're stuck with a costly repair. This really is deserving of a class action lawsuit. Apple should be ashamed of themselves. I laugh when I see their anti-PC commercials. I've never had this much trouble with any other brand of computer equipment. If they don't make good on this defective product I'll be switching to Creative Zen. Really shameful.  UPDATE: iPod #7 hard drive failed AGAIN, just days before warranty was up. On to iPod #8 now with a 90 day warranty. Wonder if it'll make it.

<Title>Amaaaaaaazing...
<Date>Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>With each generation of the ipod getting better and better, this one was no exception.  With enough room to store your entire music collection - every cd you and your entire family owns, and every song you've downloaded in the last 5 years - I'm sure this will be worth getting.  Battery life may be a tad short compared to previous versions.  No one I have talked to has been able to come close to the advertised 12 hour battery life but I have personally been able to get about 5-7.  From some of the other reviews I have noticed something about compression of the mp3 file makes the difference.  I will have to play around with that and see what happens.  Nevertheless, 5-7 hours is still plenty of time for me between charges to get my listening done - still worth it to me.  Having one for myself, I am planning on getting one for my father, and I'm sure this will by far be the best birthday present he has yet to receive.  Sadly I had not the funds to purchase another device, so after my brother receieved one for a very small amount of effort via [...] I decided to give it a shot.  If you are really interested in this device but don't have the money or are not willing the spend such and exorbant amount, [...] and soon enough both yourself and my father will be basking in the joy of a free ipod!

<Title>Be VERY VERY Careful...or pay the price.
<Date>Mon Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Le sigh..  I recieved this beautiful piece of equipment for Xmas (as im sure countless others have), and all seemed to work fine for the first few days. I hadn't had the chance to buy a case for it, but figured it would be okay for the first few days if I was very careful.  Unfortunately, after having it for about 6 days, i reached for it out of its plastic bag (which I was using to "protect" it from scratches) and it fell about 3-4 feet onto the ground. It cracked the LCD screen in half (not the glass), and now the screen is cut into fourths, with only two working in opposite corners. If I would have known, or seen a warning at least, that I absolutely HAD TO HAVE A CASE THE SECOND THAT I TOOK THE IPOD OUT OF THE BOX, I would have done so. Yet, now I am here with a functional, but difficult to navigate and ugly iPod.  Whats worse is that apple offers NO HELP with the LCD repair (you cant buy parts for it, and according to the helpline they dont offer the repair due to the cost). The warranty ONLY covers problems from their craftsmanship, and since it was my hand from which the iPod fell, its null in this situation. Just to have apple do anything to it, even if I made them fix it, it would cost $250+ because it is out of warranty.  The ipod is a great machine, and plays things beautifully and is extremely sexy. Its just a huge dissapointment when your $400 machine cant take a simple fall (which is odd considering how much fun those people seem to be having in those commercials, and how it should be a durable mobile device).  Sure, buy it. It works great. Just spend an extra $50 on a case and save yourself another $400.

<Title>Just a few other points
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just wanted to raise a few other issues that others havent mentioned.  First - I am extremely satisfied so far.  Other than the price which I feel is around 100$ too expensive the drawbacks of the 40GB Ipod are pretty limited, esp if you are comfortable with Itunes.  I upgraded from a 20GB creative Nomad Zen to this product for several reasons. 1) I liked the style, 2) My collection surpassed 20GB, 3) The Mini was sold out everywhere, and 4) I use an airport express to bridge my computer and stereo and wanted to simplify my software interfact (only Itunes instead of Itunes plus creative jukebox).   I had heard several times that the Ipod could not handle MP/ and only took AAC, this is simply not true at all.  It plays MP3s with all the functionality of my old creative, and even adds the ability to insert start stop times on tracks - this is nice since I listen to a fair amount of rap and after a while those god aweful skits are horrible. One drawback is that the device has a tendancy to freeze when someone presses multiple buttons at the same time.  Granted this isn't a huge problem when Im operating it - but when you show the device to a friend they are likely to button mash - and that can result in a freeze.  The problem is compounded by a lack of a self standing soft reset button.  The only way to reset is to press the hold button and attach the AC adapter... This is fine while you are home or in a location where the proprietary AC is accessible, but on the road it means you will lose the ability to play music until you return home.  Apple should include a littel paper clip accessible reset button.    This is a minor quibble though and overall the device is really excellent.  By the way I am getting around 10 hours of play time on a charge... and I use the scree quite a bit with the backlight on.  I would think a normal user could expect closer to 12 hours of continuous playtime. Although there are several other devices that are probably just as cool and good, if you are a devout i-tunes user, I would suggest an ipod over competing brands.

<Title>Now I understand the hype
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Advertising and promotion of the iPod has reached ad nauseam.  Then there was the same seeming swagger and contempt for the unwashed masses by iPod users that was seen by early cell phone users for their lesser beeper counterparts.  Curious, I did the due diligence, kicked the tires and then purchased the G4 40 gig model.  After owning one for a month I am now one of the zombies marching in lockstep and proselytizing.  It starts with the iTunes software which is so elegant and seamless.  Insert a CD in your computer and iTunes asks if you want to import it.  It then rips it into compressed format at the bitrate you set.  Just dock your iPod and if it's set to automatically sync, it imports the songs at lightning speed.  Moments later you're good to go.  The iPod itself is beautifully designed.  The size, shape, heft, color and feel are perfect. It feels solid, substantial and elegant in your hand.  (By contrast, I have an iRiver flash mp3 player which I also like for it's different purpose, but it feels like a piece of cheap plastic.) The chrome back and the white material on the front of the unit scratch very easily.  So be sure to have a case when traveling and don't just toss it in your pocket with your keys and change.  Controls are intuitive and the touch wheel amazing.  I haven't bought any songs from the Apple store since I discovered a perfectly legal download site called allmymp3 that sells songs at one cent per meg or about five cents a song right now and have purchased at least fifty CDs without a hitch.  So I highly recommend that site as well.  Comments about the ear buds supplied are mixed.  Personally I like them a lot, though I did also purchase the Sure E5C ear canal headset for times I want to really appreciate the music more than just casually. All in all, other players are cheaper and have features lacking here like FM reception.  But nothing else compared for me.

<Content>The real name sounds a little weird but its my moms account but now to the point. THE 40gig I pod rocks there is no mp3 player on the market. Personlly I dont see why people make such a big deal over the mini in my view this one is much cooler. Some words of advice though. Using the back light drains the power so fast so use it sparingly. Also the front and back look really cool but 1 week of usage and you start to see little scratches on it and smudges on the back so you should buy a case. Besides that its great it looks cool plays great holds more songs then you can shake a finger at and actually comes with good head phones unlike most mp3s that come with .50 cent ones. So in short This is the best I pod ever use it on a plane subway or at school it doesen't matter it looks cool and works great.

<Content>I was always under the impression that the iPod was neat, but that there were better units out there for the money. At least that's how it looked to me. I was wrong. Very wrong.  The iPod is, hands down, the coolest player out there. It has a decent battery life (this has not even been an issue for me, but then again, I walk around with the thing in my Powerbook case and recharge it when it needs it) great performance, and above all it sounds fantastic. Apple made some great decisions with regards to the audio decoding hardware on board - I get all sorts of nasty artifacts on my Archos and Creative players during some songs, but those exact same files play great on the iPod.  Apple has one real winner here.

<Content>I thought I'd buy the ipod and get the $100 promotional certificate from audible.com.  You have to call a telephone number.  However, when you call audible.com, you are put on hold forever.  Worse, you are tortured while waiting by someone reading an extremely boring and pompous book and after waiting 10 or 15 minutes, I still couldn't figure out what the book was or what it was about.  It was enough to put me off of audible.com and in the process, deterred me from buying the ipod.  I finally hung up without talking to anyone or getting the coupon number. Oh, well, maybe I'll wait for a better deal.

<Title>Great for the Technologically Inept
<Date>Sat Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love music, but hate computers and gadgets.  As long as your computer has the juice to work with the iPod (my previous one didn't and I had to return the iPod), the iPod is extremely easy to use in turns of loading and playing music.  I shied away from this for a long time (probably a good thing, since there seems to have been problems with the earlier models), but I love this thing.  You will definitely need a case or a silicone-based "skin" to cover it; otherwise it will get scratched.  The shiny metal sides and back look great, but you have to take great care when they are uncovered.  The XtremeMac clip case is the best I've found so far.  If you love music and have the $400 to spend on this, I would do it.  Some of the other Amazon reviewers have some great tips, and I won't try to repeat them.  My message is to those who might have worried that they won't be able to get this to work.  You will.

<Title>we need a class action for this lousy 40 gb ipod
<Date>Mon Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Background: I have bought Apple products since 1988. Staunch Mac enthusiast, having bought over 10 macs, successively.  Bought the ipod mini 2 years ago for my kid. She loved it, but needed more space so I bought her a 40 gb for Xmas 2005. Intially worked fine. After six months-the hard drive malfunctioned. Oh, I forgot to tell you that this is an HP IPOD $$**%~! Well, HP replaces that ipod  with a REFURBISHED 40 gb Ipod in June 2005. They tell me the warranty has been extended to June 2006--which would make sense since it offers a year warranty.  Well, in October, 2005, the new Ipod has the same disc drive malfunction. HP says they will replace it with another one, but my warranty is only for 90 days.  Guess what, they know, and I know that the 40 GB will break again in another five months but I will be out of warranty.  So I told HP, don't give me the $400 IP Replacement, DOWNGRADE me to a 20gb Ipod because I know that the 40 gb all will break soon. HP says that they cannot do that. WHY NOT? I am asking for a cheaper product in exchange for a lesser product than I purchased.  Read the reviews people, the 40 GB Ipod has MAJOR DESIGN FLAWS and apple should step up and replace these things.  For all of the people who have given them positive reviews--just wait another couple of months until yours breaks and then write about how wonderful they are.  $400 is a LOT OF MONEY to buy something that will only work for four months.  If I knew how to start a CLASS ACTION Lawsuit against HP and APPLE I would NOT HESITATE.  Does anyone know of any class actions that I could Join.  DO NOT BUY A USED 40GB IPOD. They are junk. Apple has stopped making them because they know they were garbage.  I want my $400 back!!!!!

<Title>It looks good, but...
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It looks good, but... there are some problems with it.   used the device for about a week and it died. A cute little failure icon appeared and that was the end of the story. Went thru all of the troubleshooting with apple and they said "Take it in for repair."  The interface is extremely constrained and clumsy. If you want to do anything not in the few simple commands, it's just not possible. it could safely be called fascist but i'll be polite and stick with "clumsy."  You can manually build playlists, but there is no easy way to put similar types of music together (say all your percussion). Using hack tools online you can get around this but it's awkward.  The software install is messy and changes any number of setting on the local system.  iTunes flashes adverts and tries to get you to buy something. it appears aimed more at marketing music than at organizing and playing music.  if you use this for anything athletic, you can hit the button to block key presses. useful! but the first time you stretch and pull the headphone jack out, it shuts itself off. a "feature" you can't disable. you need to dig it out, unlock it, reset it, and start over....  the phones that come with it are a torture device, and a good indicator of what apple thinks of its users.  in summary, it's a cute device and popular. but (remember high school?) like a cute and popular teen it has little substance and is more abrasive than useful.  consider saving your money.

I shaln't buy another Apple product ... not out or spite/recrimination, it would simply be a waste of money and time. I hope that Apple have counted just how many customers they've lost by selling this tat.

<Title>poorer but wiser
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this iPod as a gift for my son Christmas 2004.  This was his only gift.  Within days it began freezing, even though he treated it with the utmost care.  Within 3 or 4 months, it crashed. I was told an insurance policy I purchased for it was no good as the problem was with the hard drive (and the hard drive isn't covered).  Apple ultimately returned my call...but the associate who dealt with me was condescending and dismissive.  I have since talked to 4 or 5 other people with the same sad story.  Do your research.  This iPod IS a lemon.  In fact, you'll find fewer and fewer sites even offering it.  I would LOVE to join a class action lawsuit...and I'm not someone who is vindictive, just frustrated and disgusted.

<Title>IPOD is a waste of money
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me say that I had purchsed this ipod for use with my Alphine   headunit in my car. If you plan on doing the same be very   careful, especially if you drive daily on bumpy roads. Contrary   to popular belief the ipod is not skip proof. Therefore any   little bump shake or quick movement will cause an ipod to act   crazy. I have had this ipod skip, and sadly lock up on me while   driving. Unfortunately for me my ipod locked up for the last   time today. I lost over 700 hundred songs and now my ipod will   not even work right anymore. This ipod also uses a large amount   of battery power, and would never save my settings. You also   have to recharge this thing frequently to avoid the battery from   going dead. I am very disappointed in this ipod   and will never buy one again. Apple only provides a 1 year   warrenty for ipod and I have heard that getting it fixed would   cost more than a new ipod itself. Now I am stuck with a broken   ipod. My suggestion is save your money and not waste it on ipod.   You would be better off investing your money else where.

<Title>I'm not feeling the love here, Apple
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me start by saying that I am hopelessly in love with my iPod.  So imagine how heartrenching my decision will be to put it where it belongs- as a paperwieght on my desk- and replace it with something that actually spends more time playing music, and less time being shipped back to Apple for repair.  I got my iPod in August of 2004.  By June of 2005, it showed me a pretty little picture of a folder (ie: its memory) and a question mark (ie: it couldn't seem to find it).  The folks at Apple support were hesitant, but polite, and within two weeks I had a new (ok refurbished)40GB iPod to again fall in love with.  Love, however, is a fickle thing, and by December 2005, I woke up one morning to find a very sad looking iPod icon occupying my beloved's screen.  Another day spent on Apple's support site, and on the phone, begging, yes, begging them to send me a replacement, in spite of the fact that it was no longer covered by warrenty.  Strings appear to have been pulled, and a box appeared by mail to retreive my 2nd iPod, which was soon replaced by #3. (I have no idea how I ended up in the Canadian branch of the Apple support phone tree, but I highly reccommend them, they should all get raises)  Now it is January of 2006 (just barely 1 month later) and my iPod has died.  Im am begining to think that maybe this relationship is not working for me, and that maybe I shoud start seeing other mp3 players.  Sorry iPod, its not you, its me...oh wait, nevermind...its not me at all...  I don't know if these are even still on the market, but if you buy one, just know that before long, it will succome to the same fate as all the other 40GB iPods before it...a shiny, glorified $400 paperweight.

<Title>"LOCKED"
<Date>Thu Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A word of warning to potential buyers.  MY sons Nano is "stuck" in the "LOCKED" mode.  I did some internet research and it appears nearly all Nanos have this problem.  Obviously a design flaw.  The unit is still under warranty.  I spent two-hours on Apples "Award winning website" and finally gave up.  A total nightmare...please see for yourself.  Their are multiple class-action lawsuits against Apple over the Ipod.  Final note...BUYER BEWARE!

<Title>worst technical support
<Date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my I pod for less then a year and I  have enjoyed it for the short time I had it. For the past three months it has been shipped out three times for service. Every time it has come back not repaired and I had to ship it back to be serviced again. I feel that apple is just biding time until my warrenty expires. I have visited the apple wesite as suggest by my ipod and the website is just about as helpful as the technicians that repair the ipods. I have never had a electronic device that was so costly work so poorly and for such a short period of time. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this item.

<Title>A Warning
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>MY IPOD worked perfectly for exactly one year and five days.  However, just as the 1 year warranty expired, my IPOD's hard drive crashed not only deleting the four thousand songs that I had worked so hard to build up (and spent plenty of money downloading).  It seems quite convenient that almost the day after the warranty expired, the IPOD crashed.  If you are going to buy an IPOD, go for the cheapest one as it is absolutely crushing to have this happen to a $350 dollar piece of equipment.

<Title>Wait for the next generation
<Date>Mon Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a desktop and 2 laptops and several external hard-drives of various sizes and capacities. My CD collection easily fills a 20 GB drive in compressed 128 MP3 format. That's over 500 albums. This is nothing more than a hard-drive with slimware to drive it (SMT Tech). I can build one myself but it's not worth the trouble. The problem is moving parts in a portable device, not to mention the fact that the moving parts are ALWAYS moving. One bump the wrong way while the unit is running and you might as well light your smokes with 100 dollar bills. EEPROM units in the GB range are just around the corner, so save your money until the industry comes out with a dedicated No Moving Parts (NMP) unit in the GB range. This unit is almost built to die in 3 years or less. It sort of reminds me of the Vega and the Pinto.

<Content>After a bad experience trying to get the Creative Labs 30GB Nomad Jukebox up and running, I tried the 40GB iPod.  The iPod was very quick and easy to get running.  The iPod is alot pricier than the Nomad, but to me it was worth it.  I've only had it a few days now, but no complaints.

<Title>More than music...
<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I finally upgraded to a 40GB iPod after my old 2nd Generation 20GB ran out of space for my music. I think the iPod is the coolest thing ever- and I am proud to say I am one of the early adopters before it became pop culture. Given what I do, now I not only use my iPod for music, calendars, address book etc. I also use it to carry huge Photoshop files, and other files whenever I bring work home from the office. Kudos to Apple.

<Title>The music revolution continues
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my Ipods, plain and simple.  The reason that I like them better than any other player is that I am fortunate enough to have access to Macintosh computers.  With the combination of Ipod and Mac using iTunes, there is nothing better for a massive music collection.  The reason:  iTunes!  It's simply the best interface BY FAR (and I've used 'em all, well most of them).  Because I love music and use my Ipods to organize and preview music for two radio shows I produce, I really want a device that is optimized for music listening and music organization, and this is it.  No iRiver or Creative Zen product comes close for music when you consider how good iTunes is at organization, generation of playlists, burning of cd's, selection  by artist, genre, album, rating, etc, etc, etc.  If you need a device that does lots of things besides music, sure, the Archos or iRiver models are good, but if you want rock solid reliability, the best support out there and the best way to organize a large library, go Ipod only.   And, consider purchasing a Mac now that you can get one for $499. to organize your music if for no other reason. More than likely, you'll soon become a Mac person...I still have my Windows computer, it even has the Windows version of iTunes on it but I much prefer my Mac for music, not to mention, photos, home movie production, and archiving all the above.  It's just plain more reliable and easier.  And compared to iRiver, Archos or Creative (Yes, I've owned ALL these brands), Apple is continuously supporting and upgrading their software to match.  I've got an old iPod, first generation 5 gb unit that works just as well as the day I received it years ago and has the latest software on it!  My 9 year old has used it with great luck for 7 months, and he's not that easy on electonic devices.  Ipod is above the competition for simplicity, reliability and getting the job done day in and day out when it comes to music...

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this iPod (my first) for two months now, and I love it!  It is easy to use, and to sync with my iTunes library on my laptop.  In addition to putting all my CDs on, I have been getting many audible.com books to listen to when I travel for business - it really makes the time go by!  The only shortcoming I have found is the earbuds, which are painful to wear for any length of time and can disturb those around you.  I use Bose sound-cancelling headphones on the plane, and Sennheiser headphones for walking around or in my hotel.  I use cables to hook it up to my stereo at home, and the sound quality is fine.  The only place I have complaints is in my car; the FM transmitters don't seem to work, and I have yet to find a good solution.  In short, this is a great product, and easy to use for someone with only moderate technical know-how.  The only thing I recommend is to think about how much memory you really need, and don't pay for more than you need.  The 20 gig iPod, or even the 4 gig mini may be fine for many users.

<Title>Great Device
<Date>Sat Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the 40GB Ipod a few months ago and quickly downloaded about 300 cd's into it.  I can take my stereo anywhere and just plug it into any car stereo, home stereo, you name it.  It did take a little getting used to using the hold button so the battery wouldn't run down.  Did find the manual lacking in directions.  Have read some reviews about it skipping and I use it every day to go running.  It does skip if you jiggle it around too much.  If you put in in a hip holder or in a pocket it skips.  If you use the armband designed for the ipod, it never skips, less jostling.  Also does lock up every now and then, sometimes too cold, sometimes low battery. Otherwise, love the thing, great investment.

<Title>Way too expensive for its features- Get Archos Gmini 400
<Date>Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having owned the ipod for 8 months now, I decided to try another product. Anyone who buys an ipod only want it for the beauty and not its purpose. "dont judge a book by its cover." Sure the ipod looks very beautiful on the outside but look, you're paying premium price for just the looks and not the features. However, the Archos Gmini 400 is more than 50 dollars less than this ipod and look! its the same size and weight as the 20 gig ipod with video playback, photo, voice recording features. People who buy ipods are just trying to "get with the crowd" and do not realize the pettiness of its features. Get the Archos Gmini 400.

<Title>The best MP3 player available
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had several MP3 players before and recently switched to the iPod.  To my suprise, the quality of the music sounded better on the iPod compared to my older players, even though the files were the same.  I heard subtle sounds in the music whereas before I hadn't.  I'm not an expert with MP3 encoding, but I assume the iPods decoding algorithms are superior to the other players I've owned.  I once dropped my iPod while listening to music (it hit the ground hard) but the music never skipped a beat!  The iPod also act as your PDA.  It has native support MS Outlook "vCard" files, so you can have your contact information on your iPod.  You can also add notes and calendar items.  Third-party software that helps manage this are Pod2Go and iPodSync.  Amazingly, you can get RSS newsfeeds on your iPod as well!  The previous generation of iPod players had short battery problems.  Thankfully, that problem has been eliminated with the 4th generation.  I use the iPod quite a lot each day, and only have to charge ever other day.  There are a lot of gadgets available for the iPod.  I think one of the most useful one is the Belkin Digital Camera Link that turns your iPod into storage space for your digital photos.  This allows you to move your pictures off camera onto iPod's hard drive via USB cable.  Great if you're traveling and taking a lot of photos!  The iPod is a bit pricier than the competition.  But then again, there is a lot of third-party support for it compared to the competition.  Companies like Bose and JBL have portable speakers specifically built for iPods.  The competition can only dream of getting support like that!  I absolutely love my iPod.  I think I'm getting "attached" to it.  That's how great it is.  Highly recommended!

<Title>I thought I would get a little more for four hundred bucks!!
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apparently four hundred dollars just buys you the bare bones.  there isnt a carrying case included with this ipod. In addition, unlike the ipod mini there is no clip that you can attach to your pants, so you had better have pockets.  On the up side they did give small headphones so you can actually listen to it. Furthermore, I found the intunes software annoying.  If you just have one ipod and one computer and like to keep all 40 gigabytes of your music on your computer then it works fine.  However, otherwise its just plain annoying.  the ipod automatically updates and deletes all your songs that are still not on your computer, if you are using two computers make sure you put your ipod on manually.  it works well enough after you figure everything out although I find it annoying to use my ipod mini and this ipod and the same computer.  More annoying is that the ipod tutorial and manual tells you nothing.  You pretty much have to search on google to find anything.  also organising you songs is automatic but if you want it organize it your own way it takes some time.  Overall this is not a bad product but for 400 bucks i thought i would get a lot more.
