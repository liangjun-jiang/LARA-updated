<Title>Buyer Beware
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recommend that no one buys this. I bought it thinking, awesome, although it is not an iPod, it looks good, and will do a lot of the functions that an iPod can do. Boy was I in for a shock. Not only was it the tiniest little cheap thing, but also the screen picture was horrible!! I have a Wal-Mart brand MP3 Player that has better picture than this one. Trust me, do not buy this product!

<Title>Very Good Equipment
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this equipment and I'm satisfied with the quality of video that can display. The sound is good, but if you try to display images while a song is playing noise is produced. The quality of the images is poor, because you need to convert it to BMP images and poor resolution. But in general you can not expect more for than cheap price.

<Title>I like it for the most part
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item about 6 months ago to use while I was exercising at the gym.  It fits nice and flat in an armband, which was a plus from my last MP3 player.  The music quality is actually quite good and this little gadget has a ton of functions.  I don't use most of them as I bought it just for the music capabilities.  The only thing that I don't care for is that although you can see the playlist of songs, you can't catagorize them, like you can on some players.  It's easy to forward to another song, the volume and all functions are easy to get to.  The display screen is very colorful.  The only real drawback on this is you need a USB port to charge it.  I like the idea of being able to go anywhere and not have to depend on USB charging.  If you're going to use this for a couple hours or so, charging via USB is fine, but if you plan on using it for several hours you'd better be close to a computer if you want to listen to it any longer than say 4 - 5 hours. (Might last a little longer than that on a charge, but I have not had to listen to it any longer than 5 hours at one time)  Overall it's a nice product for the price and it would be a great first MP3 player for the person who's never had one before.

<Title>beware Amazon electronics
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought this player for our daughter for Christmas.  It's not easy to set up.  It's not easy to download songs onto.  You can't organize your songs (except by using numbers in your naming schema).  Our new computer would not read the software disk that was included.  The function keys are not at all intuitive -- and took several tries to operate, as desired.  There was no way we thought our pre-teen daughter would be able to manage it on her own.  We ended up getting a similarly priced RCA model which works and sounds great and is easy to use.  When I tried to return the Coby one to Amazon, I was told that because it had been opened they would only offer a partial refund (even though it was cleaned off and in mint condition).  I would not only beware of the Coby mp3 player, but I would beware of buying any electronic from Amazon.

<Title>Awfull
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is still working after six months, but I thought not. Not possible to put the songs in order or inside directories. All songs have to be accomodated as they are entered. The software is not good, is a bad quality building. To see a video you need a special conversion, with a bad software. Not recommendable.  Instead of it, Creative has MP3 and video of high quality.

<Title>Beware of looks!
<Date>Tue Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had no trouble downloading songs onto it, although I understand there's no rhyme or reason as to what order they're in. The problem I had was with the video part of it - it is advertized on the package that you can download videos - forget that - I have one manual for my model, the company has a different manual for the same model, and the company's website troubleshooter recomments something different. The only advantaga this has over som others is that it has a spot on it so you can hang it around your neck.

<Title>Slightly Disappointed
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had purchased a similar coby mp3 player in the store and a friend of mine liked it so much I purchased one for her.I tried and tried to get the exact same one - I thought that this was it - well its not .. no where near it. This one has a very annoying font on it that is almost something I would expect to give a child,it has very limited graphics and is a little hard to maneuver. Ok deal for the price but to me I will spend a little more next time and make sure I get a gift worth giving.
