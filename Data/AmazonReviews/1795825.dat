<Title>User interface is slow!
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After trying several units at different Apple stores, all of the new iPod Classics suffer from a slow interface. Apple added Cover Flow and additional graphics but apparently underpowered the device and menu items have a noticable delay, Cover Flow is slow to refresh and even the clickwheel navigation is sluggish. These problems are not shared by the new Nano, which operates beautifully. I wanted to buy the classic, but now will go with either a Nano or a Touch.

<Title>Still great for Music and awesome storage space
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have 4 iPods including a 2G refurb I keep in my car.  So obviously they work well for me.  There are a number of solid alternatives to the iPod and depending upon your needs one of those could be better value.  For the classic the screen is too small for video but that is true of most "video" players and cell phones.  Overall the Apple iPod + iTunes experience can not be beat.  It is an elegant seamless integration and experience.  An often overlooked feature of getting an iPod is that there are tons of accessories to select from and that alone is compelling reason to go with an iPod.  If video is must look elsewhere perhaps to the iPod touch (great screen and makes video actually an option) or one of the Archos options (better screen size and storage then the touch and some with video in option).  If you need a voice recorder or fm tuner other options such as those from Creative might suit you better.  These can be added to the iPod but only at additional costs.  But the core - the simplicity, power of use, battery life and organizing and storing music, photo and video files the iPod is still the best.  Don't get distracted by bells and whistles that really are not important to your core end user experience.  Don't focus on  marginal battery draining features like Zune's wifi unless you really think that those feature are important to you.  If you are on a budget and are willing to forego Apples legendry and well deserved elegance, you can find a decent player for much less.  If you have more specific needs add them to the vlaue equation and figure if the iPod + accessories is worth the extra cost to you.  And if you want a great music player that simply works go with an iPod.

<Title>Too good to be true!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always thought that an ipod sold solely because of publicity. I assumed that most people who bought it didn't research well or didn't know what they wanted to buy. I was often surprised to see people buying one ipod after another for their family and friends!   Now I know how wrong I was!   I am finally a proud owner of the 80 GB Classic (Black)! Now, I'd like to jump to the list of pros and cons for this great product:  PROS: 1. Unbelievably slim for an 80 GB player. 2. All metal design is really impressive (less scratches). 3. Cover flow definitely adds a lot of pleasure to the user experience. 4. Preview for the selected menu option is impressive. 5. More controllable click wheel. 6. Great Battery life. 7. Great Extras (especially the games)  I guess, I could go on n on n on...  CONS: 1. Menu to Cover flow transition is slow. 2. iTunes consumes all your resources on PC. 3. I'm not sure about the datastructure in an ipod, but it seems that if there is an album in which there are songs by various artists, the album shows up as many times as the number of artists in the cover flow mode. 4. Although certain photos get copied but they don't open (Note: They are visible as thumbnails) 5. Need more menu options for photo viewer. 6. Can't change EQ settings from a song. Need to go to the menu->setings->EQ to change it. 7. Artwork for certain albums don't show up even though iTunes shows them correctly.  Finally, I would definitely like to say that this is a great product and one of it's kind. Once you own it, you would never wanna part with it!

<Title>Nice capacity, but that's it...
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is definitely a great gadget, but not the best out there. It still gets scratched just as the other ones, but that's no surprise. I was excited to see how the cover flow feature would work, since it was on the iPod Touch also, and it was not that great. It is slower that the touch and freezes on some occasions. I did like how they kept it sleek and thin as it used to be. It didn't come with many accessories (this means no protective sleeve either), but I didn't mind since I didn't end up paying for the iPod. It's also very affordable, unlike the other iPods. And for those wondering how I "got" my iPod go here -> http://flingk.com/n21v9v1 I saw it on CNN, FOX, G4TV, so I tried it and it actually worked! Overall this is a great MP3 Player, but not the best.

<Title>Music Great.... Video lets hope for a update
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the Classic now for 4 days.  The interface is much better than Gen 5 but the Classic is slower.  All and all for for Music and watching video on the iPod its self the Classic wins.  The bad.  Most of all the iPods docs and ALL Of the past iPod cables do not work with any of the new iPods. Apple change the computability so that you have to buy new cables and docs. They say it is because the old ones put to much drain on the battery(whatever I have had no issue). So if you are not upgrading from a previous iPod it may not be an issue because you will have to buy the $50.00 cable any way but if you already have all your iPod accessories you may want to keep the iPod you have until they fix this issue.  By the way if your car radio has a adapter for a iPod. Like the Pioneer D3 I just bought.  You guessed it none of the new iPods will work.

<Title>not good if you want to watch video
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple won't tell you this before you buy this product. If you use this with third-party video products it wont let you switch the TV OUT selector to ON. This means it won't work with those products. Apple sells two special cable sets you need in order to watch video. Each of these sells for $49.99. There is currently a four week wait for these cables. I have a laptop-like Vision Video 55 that allows the ipod to drop into a special bay so you can watch videos on a bigger screen and carry it around. Its great for traveling etc. My previous ipod videos worked great with this and a similar unit sold by Phillips. Now if I want to use these portable video devices I need one of these special cables partially defeating the point of having these custom devices. And this isn't a fit issue. Apple has purposely done this to prevent users from using third-party devices. Don't look to future after-market video devices to fix this problem. Apple has decided to be greedy on this point. If you just watch video on the ipod itself or on your home TV this will work fine (if you buy one of Apple's $50 cables). I wish I could return my ipod but they wont take it back :-(. Maybe I'll start calling mine the ipoop :-).

<Title>Good but not Great (yet)
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a 5.5 Generation 80G and I got a 80G classic, so I quite literally did a side by side comparison. True, the new interface is lovely, the screen is a touch brighter and its a thiner design, but even after the update from Apple, the spin up time on the interface is just so slow. Its especially horrible going to a listing of movies, it once took nearly 2 min for all my movies to display. The classic is sluggish and for me that is a bit of a deal breaker. I'm a huuuge Apple fan, I have 3 ipods (iPod mini 1st generation, Shuffle 2nd generation and my 5.5 generation 80G), a Mac Mini and will be shelling out for a Mac book pro next month when Leopard comes out, but this one is going back. I have a feeling the next generation Classic may be the one to watch for but for now its all Style and not enough substance, if your going for a ipod video get the 5th generation while you still can or wait until Apple has a chance to get rid of the glitches in this one.

<Content>The Classic is a very good product BUT!!! I give it 1 star because you have to buy a universal dock to use it Apple does not tell you this When you buy the unit. just what i need is more gear to carry on a plane if you don't want to mess with docks and stuff to plug an i pod into a tv at a hotel stick with the 5 gen. Oh yeah it runs a little slugish besides.

<Title>Posting User C. J. F. Was mistaken. It works. Here's Why...
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just as someone else stated, you do not need a Dock, for this or ANY iPod to work for that matter. That is an optional accessory, but not really needed.  Just use the USB cord that comes with it.  It's fastest if your computer has USB 2.0 ports built-in, but it also connects with older slower machines like mine that only have USB 1.1 ports.  It's great.!  USB 1.1 has a much slower data transfer rate than USB 2.0. Just be patient when doing your very first sync. Other syncing is faster just because you will be syncing less data at one sitting.  I love it. 80 GB, well worth it.

<Title>This product rocks!
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>THE GOOD: Good price, lots of HD for the price, has an equalizer, is basically easy to use; can be recharged via a USB 2.0 port on a PC. Also, it looks good (if you need a snappy-looking MP3 player), the touch-pad control is very convenient to use and it's good for audio books too.  THE BAD: No FM tuner, dinky earbuds, weird (incomprehensible to me at least) filing system if you're using a PC running Windows and you try to find individual files in the iPod using Windows Explorer. So, instead of being able to easily delete a few files here and there, it's easier to just restore (ie reformat) the HD and start from scratch. AND, the battery isn't meant to be changed by the owner - you're supposed to mail it back to Apple when the battery dies (although aftermarket batteries are available for the more technically adept owners).  OTHER POINTS: Uses iTunes software to upload & download from, won't support music purchased from anyplace other than iTunes. iTunes is pretty easy to use, make sure your PC can run iTunes 7.6 before you buy an iPod! RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES: Speck ToughSkin rubberized case for iPods & a decent set of brand-name earbuds. CONCLUSION: The pluses outweigh the minuses as far as I'm concerned - I love my iPod! If you disagree, check out the Microsoft Zune or Creative Labs MP3 players.

<Title>No problems or issues at all, complaints seem overblown
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We have just upgraded from a 30GB gen 5.5. video iPod to this model, and are happy overall.  Any complaints regarding software glitches, cover flow, etc. can be fixed quite simply by downloading the newest software update as soon as you first hook your new iPod up to your computer, and it takes about 10 seconds to disable the cover flow feature.  It's a good price for the amount of memory.  I haven't noticed any drastic reduction in sound quality, but on the other hand, there isn't any improvement either.  The only reasons this doesn't get five stars is because there doesn't seem to be any upgrade in sound quality, and even with the software updates, the click wheel seems a touch slower than the old Video model.  But for the extra storage and price, and the improved exterior casing, it's still a great deal.

<Title>INCOMPATIBLE with Accessories
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought into the iPod despite concerns about being locked into a proprietary format.  This buy-in was based on the ecosystem of accessories available (and mainly options to integrate in my car).   I just "upgraded" to the 80GB iPod classic.  Everything I own that used to work with my previous 5G iPod video no longer works.  Anapod Explorer - BROKEN.  Never liked iTunes, and this was my solution.  It no longer works, which is, in Apple's Defense, Anapod's responsibility.  Fortunately the newest WinAmp integrates well (although it can't seem to get cover art right).  Still important to note that whatever file system changes were implemented here are likely to impact other products as well.  Auto OEM Adapter Kid - BROKEN.  My $600 OEM iPod car adapter no longer recognizes the iPod.  This is what I used my iPod for 90% of the time.  No auto connectivity, and this product is borderline worthless to me.  Logitech mm50 Speakers - PARTIALLY BROKEN.  Plays music but no longer charges the iPod.  How tough is it to make sure the newest iPods can still be charged with older accessories???  All in all, a MAJOR disappointment.  I'll be looking for a used or refurbished iPod video to replace this as soon as I get the chance.

<Title>iPod Video is a great buy
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had been hesitant to buy a new iPod because of the high price tag for any of them, but I finally decided to spend the money and upgrade from my old iPod mini, which the battery was starting to becom bad on. I first looked at the 8gb Nano, but decided to spend $50 more and get 72gb more space, and the larger screen. Let me tell you, this device will change you life. The video and picture quality is unbelievable, and the music quality is also tremendous. For someone like me who travels a lot, this is a great product to own.

<Content>I now have 15 movies on my Classic, from animal house to Eric Clapton's Guitar Festival.  They are easy to load and great to watch when flying. My wrist gets tired holding it during long movies, as I do not have a stand (apple should make one). The music is great too! Time to upgrade that old unit as this one still has the space to hold your songs and now movies at a much more reasonable price than the Itouch.

Now, instead of storing a few albums worth of songs, I can have my entire music library, videos, podcasts and photos all on one machine...I can't believe that I lived in the dark ages for so long.  The train rides in New York City will never be the same again (in the good way)!
