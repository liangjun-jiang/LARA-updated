<Title>Decent MP3 player for the price

<Content>Decent player for the price.  Battery performance is ok.  FM reception is awful but that seems to be the only drawback.  $30 is not bad for a player with 1 gb of memory. The nice thing is it comes with the armband although the armband I got is a funky tan color.

<Title>Great buy for the money!

<Content>Now, I'll start off with the downsides.  This item looks nothing like the picture.  Well, same color scheme, but its not the pretty picture you see.  The MP3 player looks very poorly made.  That being said though... I can't complain about it.  I didn't buy it for looks.  And, for only about $37... it doesn't need to look good.  Heck, most companies charge $37 for the friggin' matching armband, but one comes with this sucker... which is why I bought it to begin with.  The headphones that come with it are nice.  They're terrible for jogging and such, but for other purposes, they work great.  Of course, a smart jogger would've already bought those ear buds with the clips on them anyways.  It comes with a battery, and is very easy to operate... even while jogging.  It doesn't plug directly into a USB port, but it comes with a foot-long chord that does.  That may annoy some people... but I for one don't care as long as I can transfer easily (which I can... no software or licenses required).  Plus, it comes with 50 free song downloads, so I won't get arrested and sued for... 50 songs I own/will own.  So, basically, what you get for $31 + S&H is a small MP3 player, with an armband, that holds up to a gig of music and plays the radio.  Though it may look poorly made, thus far it has held up well... and the arm band, though a hidious color, would seem to protect it if by any chance it fell (you know, unless you fell on it too).  I'd say get it.  It beats everything on the market as far as price for the package is concerned.

<Content>This was a gift to my almost 10 year old and she loves it! It is very easy to download songs onto, has pretty good sound quality and is durable. It does go through batteries fairly quickly, although I would say she gets about 10-12 hours of use out of 1 battery, and she mostly plays it with speakers (purchased seperately).
