<Title>Amazing little device
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've used this device for about 2 weeks now and so far it has been wonderful. Sound quality is excellent, FM tuner works extremely well, and the storage capacity (1GB) was exactly what I needed. And I must also say that it is a beautiful looking piece of electronics.   When deciding to buy this player, I was concerned by some of the reviews that say it is unreliable. I figured that getting all these features for 30 bucks was worth a shot. So far I have been extremely pleased, but if I do have any problems with this player I will be sure to update this review.

<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product just a little over 3 weeks ago and it has already given me problems. One of the selector buttons doesn't always respond and I don't think it worth the time or money to send back to get this reoccuring problem fixed. I don't recommend this product to anyone.

<Title>A good buy for pennies
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With the 1 GB memory capacity of my Coby MP3 player I've had just enough to put all my favorites songs and play them over and over. The size of this MP3 player is such that it is quite easy to hide it away, in case you want to enjoy it while attending important ceremonies. And if you want more variety, you can always put your favorite radio station on it. You can also record your own messages to use it as the best way to help you remember things you may otherwise forget (such as getting milk on your way home).

<Title>Difficult to navigate
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I liked the compact size, easy download capability, the 2G memory and the price however it was difficult to store and then retrieve the files once they were on the device.  Obvious you lose some functionality when you pay less than $30 for a storage device.  All the files need to be set up before you download the them, i.e. playlists, favorites, etc. becuase once the items are stored it is not 'one button' friendly to scroll through the stored files.  I have a Toshiba Gigabeat and love the ease of use, simple buttons located conveniently when walking or running and even driving.  I bought the Coby as a gift for my sweetie who is a runner. I know we will be replacing the Coby for a device that is easy to use in the near future and use this as a data memory stick only and not for music.  If you don't mind spending hours trying to figure this out and don't want to scroll through music files while being active, it would be a great buy.  Also, managing your files requires you to have ready access to a computer since you can't sort once files are stored on the device.

<Title>Slick, small and infinitely capable
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Allow me to explain my experience with this style of MP3 players: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PQQ9U/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5192814-2842307">Mac Vision MA833A 128 MB MP3 Player</a> This was my first MP3 player, the Macvision 256mb. Slick, black and small, this simple little device lasted me three whole years and would still be alive and kicking if I hadn't dropped it off of my rooftop one too many times. A remarkable piece of technology, it simply played MP3's, easily and without fuss. The transfer system was simple and easy to navigate, and the player worked through rain, snow, being stepped upon and drowned in water.  After that finally gave up the ghost, and believe me it took a looong time, I picked up this:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EG5UAK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5192814-2842307">Nextar MA933A-B 128 MB Digital MP3 Player (Blue)</a> The Nextar 512mb 'blue' This was not up to par with its predecessor, despite being of the same design, just manufactured by a different company, this device was inferior in many ways. Nextar re-designed the device's program and tranfer capability, forcing you to use Windows Media to sync your files, and they would appear in no particular order, and you had no control over where they ended up in relation to the other files. This MP3 player was definitely not as sturdy as the original, it broke within two weeks after I pressed the play button a tad bit harder than it was apparently made for. So, frustrated, I bought this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BWZGIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5192814-2842307">COBY MP3 Player with 256 MB Flash Memory & USB Drive</a> Coby had finally gotten the patents to this design, so I hoped things would improve. This little device was certainly a bit hardier than its predecessor, and it survived for some time, but its program was just as frustrating as the last one, once again forcing you to sync with Windows Media and randomizing your files on you. The glass screen was very fragile and broke within the first month I owned it, making it difficult to see the text. So, finally after putting up with it for a while, I succumbed to trying out yet another of these devices. I bought this, the Coby C885 1GB MP3 player.  Hallelujah!  This device not only stronger and more durable than the nextar or earlier coby model, also allowed you to return its program to the original Macvision style, allowing me to finally order my files the way I wanted! I have had this now for about three weeks, and it has served me well. The buttons take a little while to adjust to, but after you do, its smooth sailing. Its as if I have my old Macvision back, with an upgrade in style and funcion! If you're looking for something sleek and simple, without paying out the big bucks go for this!

<Content>Bought as a gift for my daughter.  she loves it!  Easy to use, nice geatures and a good price point too! Prayers of Meditation  Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

<Content>We ordered 2 of these and had to send one back as it didn't work.  Ordered a replacement and had to send it back - same problem. Item comes with a special sheet in the box stating "before returning call customer service" so I think they know there's a problem.  Called customer service before returning the 2nd one - they were clueless and not helpful. The one that works is cute, but we have 1 twin boy not happy about not receiving his. Disappointing.

<Title>Not an 1GB MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>One of my friend got this Coby 1GB MP3 player, the package and the player did say that it is a 1 GB player. But in the system it showed the total capacity as 459 MB. Everyone knows that the capacity displayed is little less but not as much as >500 MB. We tried formatting the drive and making it fresh, but of no use. There are no CDs, softwares, tools provided to diagnose the player.   We tried calling up the number in the package which said "Call this Number before considering returning the product" !! The person on the other side could not understand our problem, he kept telling us (threatening) about where we got our MP3s, DRM stuff. CRAZY !! Seems like he was reading from the papers provided to him. Useless Customer Service. They said it, we returned the product that very moment.  Do not buy anything Coby. There are better MP3 players that are worth the buck you pay for.

<Content>This is a great little product for the price.  It has an FM radio reciever as well s the mp3/WMA player.  Most IPods will not play WMA files so in my opinion this is better than an IPod. It also records voice and stores data files.  Now if you are looking for all kinds of bells & whistles go with the Ipod but if not you can get a good buy for the money with this product.

<Title>good until main power switch broke off of pcb
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I thought I had finally found a reasonably priced, simple reliable 1 GB mp3 player I could also use as a flash drive. I bought it for 29.99 at circuit city 5/26, everything was great until the main power switch stopped working yesterday, 6/11. I checked it out and saw that the switch had been sheared  off of  the printed circuit board by the force of pushing the button. Now it is junk as far as being a music player, 16 days after I bought it. If I feel like hassling with trying to return it, I will update this review to say how that went. Mfr's warranty says I can mail it back with $6 for warranty service . I'm not sure if its worth $6 for a new one because the design looks really weak and it would probably break again. For now I'll go back to using my old indestructible 128mb Coby mp3 player that I paid $15 for; too bad it only holds 2 hours of music.  Edit (6/16/07): Ok so I went back to store and got a hassle-free exchange for a new one, and I'm perfectly satisfied with product for now as long as it doesn't break again. I opened up the first one when it broke, and I saw the switch just snaps on to 2 plastic pins on the circuit board and is soldered in place. They probably should have used a drop of superglue or epoxy or something to make sure the switch can't come loose. If I hadn't had that problem I would have given it 3 or 4 stars. All I want from this thing is to be simple, cheap and reliable. Its simple enough (though I'd rate the ease of navigation as only fair), and it was the first one that was cheap enough that I would buy it (I commend the marketers of mp3 players for selling so many of them for so much for so long- I thought they'd be a lot cheaper by now. The shelf price on the one I exchanged for my broken was 49.99, which I would never have considered paying for this thing when Amazon has it for 30.99). Now the reliability has to be seen.  As long as it doesn't break its about as good a deal as is out there right now as far as I'm concerned. I don't think there's any point in going for a top of the line mp3 player since you don't normally listen to them in an environment where you could tell any  slight differences in sound quality anyway. I listen to it with earphones while I'm working outside and I'll also plug it into a good old stereo receiver at my house with a nice pair of speakers and it sounds just great to me. 512MB would have been plenty of music storage capacity, thats over 8 hours worth and I can swap it out with other music in my music library on the computer any day of the week if I want.  I wanted the 1GB capacity for use as a flash drive.  If you like to fiddle with or admire your mp3 player you might want to pay more for something that you like the way the buttons go better or is more prestigious and will make your friends think you have money to burn but if you just enjoy hearing music this should make you happy if it doesn't break.  I should also add that this thing has directions for synching it up with Windows media Player and it supposedly plays WMA files as well as mp3s and  works with all the DRM stuff that comes with music you buy online. I have no opinion on any of that since I don't waste my time with Windows Media Player except to rip CDs and I don't collect copy-protected files or anything other than 128 kps mp3s. Most all my mp3s are ripped from my CD collection or recorded with the computer from LPs and cassettes. The few things I've bought online I rerecorded as mp3s without all the DRM stuff because the mp3 player before this one didn't play WMAs.

<Title>Well Worth the Money
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nothing wrong with it for the money.  Does just what I expected it to do: play music  No problem dumping files from my pc to the device. Turn it on and it starts playing. A small learning curve to allow access to all the options available - not intuitive.  Simple enough when you learn how.  I'm not qualified to evaluate its audio qualities, but it suits me.  One thing though, it could use a clip to attach to clothing.  Update 4 Jul 07  Well the power-on switch broke after daily usage.  If you get one of these players, then be careful not to push on the switches to hard - what ever that may be.  Update 17 Jul 07  After finally talking to Coby (no response to emails), I find that to have it fixed/replaced I must mail them the broken player including all accessory and literature with a money order for six dollars.  I'm not sure if the payoff would be worth the probable aggravation of further dealings with this company.  Update 1 Aug 07  It cost a total of about eight bucks to send it back.  They, Coby, returned me a new one within a week.  It works fine, and I'm careful not to squash the buttons.  Update 21 Aug 07  Well, I've had the replacement for three weeks and it works just great. I use this one exclusively, and I am really satisfied.  In reality, it was my wife who broke the button on the first one, so who knows.  She tends not to force things, but to get a bigger hammer.

<Title>Lecture recording device
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I needed a very simple way to record my weekly classes digitally. The instructions are very easy to understand and with a small jewelers pincer I was able to attach the device to a neck lariat, making it easy to carry. The earbuds are cheap - I use my own headphones when reviewing audio clips (.wav file format). After setting the RECORD function to the lowest memory option, I successfully recorded my first two hour lecture. I was impressed after I reviewed it in Quicktime on my Mac laptop - the teeny weeny mic picked up all sounds, from audience coughs to the siren out on the street to the lecturer. It was placed about 6 feet from the speaker who was NOT micced but spoke loudly. This is a music class, so audio clips played, even Q& A afterwards all recorded really well. I reccommend getting rechargable AAA batteries for unlimited record time.

<Title>a great player for the price
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>**Please see the bottom of this review for an update.**  I read all the comments about this player AFTER I bought it, and I'm prepared to find I later have problems with it, but so far, I am really enjoying this item.  Pluses:    you can use this player to listen to songs you've purchased from various subscription services (not including iTunes, I think);  you need to install absolutely NO new software to your computer in order to get songs onto the player (I synced practically my whole media library at my work computer during a quick lunch break; I normally can not do anything that requires installation or changing of the computer programs already on there--no problem with this one, though!);  you can add songs to it quite easily [I just plugged the player into my usb port and synced songs from Windows Media Player 10 (which I recommend you use, even if that requires upgrading from version 9); syncing 170 songs--about 2/3 the capacity if you're using WMA files--took approximately 8 minutes];  the buttons are easy to use and the menu simple to navigate; and  the cost is extremely inexpensive.  Minuses:  battery life isn't that great (about eight hours, but it does use one AAA battery, and at least you won't have to toss the whole player once you run out of juice!);  getting to specific songs isn't that easy when you have a lot of music already on the player (opening specific files isn't as simple a task as I'd like);  the headphones SUCK (but most of them that come with players do tend to suck, so this isn't a huge deal), keep sliding out of my ears, have no padding, feel like rocks in my ears. URG.  Overall, one week in, I am very pleased. I like the quality of the sound and am enjoying having all my favorite tunes dashing about with me, strung around my neck very comfortably.   Well, I guess I spoke too soon. :-)  I now am  having fatal problems with this item and am about to return it to the store where I purchased it.   I now rate this item one star instead of four.  For one thing, when I tried to sync some new songs to it, I very clearly clicked on the button (on the computer screen) that said I wanted to add new songs, not override old ones, and then synced the new ones. Well, as soon as I turned the player on, the old songs were gone. Not really gone, as they still show up as taking memory space, but no longer accessible to me in any way. I try connecting the player by USB to my computer, but the computer shows that the space is taken up but will not show the songs that are taking that space. OR I will disconnect and reconnect to find that now I can access the songs BY COMPUTER but still am showing "no music" on the player itself. If I just confused you, I apologize, but that's precisely how I feel. I have almost the whole 1gb of memory used up, but only 3 songs to show for it. What a pain in the buns! To make matters worse, I've been trying to reach Coby's customer support at both the non-toll-free number and the toll-free one and can't get anything other than a busy signal. The little booklet that comes with the unit does nothing to help with this problem, and neither does the website.  Arg!  This baby is going back. Now the question is--what do I buy? I don't want an iPod. Frustration, deluxe.

<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my player for about a month now, I love it.  It takes about 6-8 seconds for it to turn on (not a minute as previously noted)and it plays quality sound.  I feel like you will be amazed at how well this player plays music, I know I was!  If you find it at a decent price (about $30-$35), I would go ahead and purchase one.  After all what have you got to loose.  The only problem I had with mine was initially getting the music on it, I had never owned a mp3 player before so I had to learn how it all worked, but if you follow the instructions carefully you shouldn't have a problem.

<Title>Software is unreliable for 5 star unit = 2 stars

<Content>Having used a simple COBY 512GB for a few days and found that with good Sony earphones it was very satisfactory with good bass (the sound is VERY changeable according to the headphones used according to my testing) I plunged for this COBY 1GB at J and R and it seemed an excellent upgrade at $34, against $20 for the 512GB at some ultra cheap place on Broadway near Wall Street.  Unfortunately the 1GB has screwed me up syncing music albums from my PC (Windows Media 11).  Hasving been loaded with 500 GB of music like the 512GB COBY I then synced a number of Nat King Cole albums onto it until it was full.   Sad to report the item cannot play past Song 96 ie including only a limited number of the 12 Cole CDs added.  Previously it played 106 or more like the 512MB.  Now it has simply forgotten most of the latest ones by Nat King Cole I added.  Not good. There has been no damage to the player to account for this. Its software is simply unreliable. Unless the COBY support guy (very nice young guy I got through to quite easily the first time I asked him about some command puzzle) can tell me any different I shall not send it in for repair at $6 but return it to J and R and not buy another.   This is a great pity.  COBY should get their software to be reliable.  The FM tuner is excellent and the sound is A1.  The record commands are too poorly designed for me to try that out properly yet, but I suspect that is high quality too (tiny mike holes and good pick up of sound are familiar to me from a Toshiba camera which records sound only), so it is sad if they can't get their software straight.  $6?  I suspect that is what it costs simply to replace the item.  They expect a certain number of failures I guess.  If my experience is not very rare or unique this is a shame. This level of quality with simplicity is very attractive, Alas.  UPDATE:  OK I am sorry to say I took it back to j and R and bought a Trekstor 2GB with SD Card slot for $15 more.  Very glad I did. The COBY lost its Menu function as well in the last day.  The Trekstor iBeat Extension is a class above the COBY so far - 2 GB instead of 1GB, SD Card slot, and the mike and voice recording very good. The FM seems good too.  Two problems though.  The Mike hole is tiny and on the side so it does not record the person opposite you very well unless aimed intentionally at them. And, the FM seem not to be able to distinguish between 89.9 and 90.0 MHz, though perhaps I will find out how to correct this.  The TrekStor is German and made in China and the texture of the surface and the appearance in well above the Coby, except for two rather tinny looking metal controls.  The earphones are excellent, where the COBY phones were tinny.
