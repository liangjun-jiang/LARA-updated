<Title>mediocre buy-an ipod nano it's not!
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are going to buy this, don't expect a nano.  The lcd is very weak for any sort of video, but handy as a menu screen.  My chief complaints revolve around how long it takes to charge (hours on my dual core pc) and the fact that it sometimes is on when you think it's not, and the result is a dead battery when you think it's charged.  Sound quality is good, no beef there.  All in all, for $70, I suppose it's a good buy, but I also haven't experienced anything close to the battery life claimed.

<Title>The RCA Opal in MY eyes!
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love it because it's my favorite color, blue! Plus it holds uber lots of songs. The ear buds fit perfectly in my small ears. The tips fell of easily and I lost one, though. I like how it shows the artist, song and even the album cover. My old Mp3 player couldn't do that. I really like how you can change the color settings for the screen. I wasn't to happy that it didn't come with many accesories, or any accesories at that. I would rather have the Nano, but this is a great alternative for anyone on a budget. I still haven't got the picture and video to work though, since downloading the converter messed up our computer and deleted temporary files. I give it 2 thumbs up and 4 stars though!

<Title>peice of junk 
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player didn't last 6 months. The jack where you put the earphones in is messed up and now plays only static. The jack also is where you are suppose to power it up- it is suppose to power up automatically- it stoped doing that. Finally, when it was working it took about 10 minutes to load and another 3 minutes everytime you wanted to search for a particular song. Not a happy customer. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P6J78A/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6202090-3874029">Rca M4002 Opal Series Mp3 Player With 1.5-Inch Oled (2 Gb)</a>

<Title>Meh, I've seen worse
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The best thing I can say about this player is that the ear-buds that come with the unit are among the best I have ever used.  The sound is decent quality and I like the size.  However, the firmware is terrible and don't plan on creating playlists with it.  The most annoying thing about it, however, is the fact that you can't change the song without going all the way back the beginning of the menu.  I can honestly say I hate this thing, but incredibly, I've seen worse.

<Title>this might sound harsh
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>ok, this is all my opinion, and its possible that i just picked the bad one off the shelf, but this player is $70.00 junk.  i owned one of these for about a week, and after the third day, it began to freeze up. It did it really often, and eventually, I couldn't go a song or two without it freezing up. It made me furious.so, i returned it.  having this player really lowered RCA in my eyes, and i wouldn't buy an RCA player again if they come out w/ more like this. it pretty much stinks. :P . another option is the sansa e250, i have one now, and its working great.  :D !!

<Title>RCA opal they should've named it RCA disaster
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>..because that's what this product is. A major disaster. Where to start? Well first off, IT DOESN'T WORK WITH ALL NEWER COMPUTERS! Yes...that's correct. It doesn't. I have an older computer (about 3 to 4 years), but it's not ancient! It has Windows xp with all the updates (even the RCA ones), etc yet I still have problems connecting to this device. So pretty much I'm stuck with the same music all the time because it almost never connects! When it does (if I'm lucky) it takes FOREVER! to put music in it!  Not only that, the apparent "random" isn't even random. It plays the same song (when I turn off or charge the battery)when I turn it on!!! About the only "good" think about this player is the headphones and sound, but when you struggle to put music it on it, there is NO sound! If I could, I would return this piece of junk to the store, unfortunately for me, I lost the receipt..so remember...if you ever purchase or receive this for a gift whatever, KEEP your receipt!...trust me you'll be returning this item.

<Title>Well of course it isn't an iPod
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Opal for about a month and over all it has performed well for me. If you are expecting an iPod for the meager price of the Opal, you will be disappointed. But, if you want a good MP3 player with good sound, then the Opal is a good choice.  There are no playlists on this player, and you cannot delete songs from the player directly, you have to be connected to a computer.  The software comes with Yahoo music player, and it appears that this is the most trouble free way of putting music on it.  It does take a few (3-4) minutes to read the songs on the player before you can remove or add new songs. I'm running it with Windows XP without any problems.  Yahoo Music sometimes hangs for awhile, but that is not the player's problem.  My player froze only once and it worked fine after a reset.

<Title>My OPAL is Great
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>OK, this little MP3 player has a lot of pro's and con's. Bad news first...   In order for this device to work properly for you, the user must be someone who "takes good care of their things". Its firmware is rather delicate and prone to several different types of failures. RCA does however have a website where you can download for free a good firmware update. When you load the new firmware though, it essentially formats the OPAL which will allow you to reload the player with music, pictures, videos or soundbytes. If you did the update correctly, the OPAL will perform like a champion. Loading up songs and videos is SSSLLLOOOWWW with this device, but once their in there, the sound quality goes toe to toe with the best players on the market. The battery system is probably the biggest issue I have with the OPAL. SSSLLLOOOWWW charging through the USB port (8 hours minimum charge time) that gives you about 6 hours of playback time. To add to the battery issue, it's internal to the unit, so when it ultimately craps out on you it will NOT be an easy fix. You can however extend the life of your rechargeable battery if you adhere to the owners manual and charge the unit for 3 hours minimum before using it (something that I failed to do). Personaly I would recommend charging the battery to its fullest capacity before using even if it goes on for over three hours. This is because its a little known fact that rechargeable batteries become "set" in their capacity after the first few charges. If you charge fully in the beginning, the capacity gets "set" high. If you charge short, the future storage capacity of a rechargeable battery becomes severly affected.  Now the good news. I use a Windows XP system with my OPAL and it works great. I pull music down from NAPSTER, ZUNE and my own ripped CD's, and all of them load onto the OPAL just fine. The unit is small, lightweight, thin and very easy to operate. Signal push is nothing short of spectacular when using powered PC speakers or headphones. Earbuds? Yeah it comes with a pair, and they work just fine, but with a real set of studio quality headphones this little player will absolutly surprise you with its delivery. Signal push through a home stereo system however seems to be "labor intensive" for the OPAL. You generally have to have the home system on 75% volume or more and the OPAL on full blast to get a reasonably robust level of sound out of the speakers. Menu navigation is simple, direct and easy to read. The LCD display is remarkably sharp and clear for such a tiny screen, but using the LCD a lot does pull a good bit more power out of the battery.  Overall, I really like my OPAL, but its not a device for someone who can't "baby" it. To sucessfully own and operate an OPAL, you should be the type of person who regularly changes the oil in your car, the filters in your AC unit and vaccuum, and takes the time out to keep virus' and clutter programs off of your computer. In other words; you just care for your things well. Take proper care of your OPAL and it will serve you well. I've had mine for almost a year now, and its still going strong.
