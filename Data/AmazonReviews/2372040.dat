<Title>Another winner fron Cowon
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received a new mp3 player!! It's a Cowon iaudio T2 flash player with 2gb (OK, it's really something under 2gb). It's VERY small, about the size of one of those small wooden matchbooks. The screen is absolutely beautiful (color). It comes with a strange earplug/necklace combination, which sounds great as an idea, but in practice, it really sucks because the necklace part is too short--you can't see the screen while it's around your neck. Unless you have the menu system and 6 buttons on the outside of the unit completely memorized, you need to take it off to change songs or do anything that requires looking at the screen. It's the achilles heel of the player, but fortunately the earplug/necklace is easily removed and a different earplug or set of headphones can be attached in its place.     The menu system at first is awkward at best, but with a little practice it's easily mastered. I bought the 2gb version solely because it was the only one I could find online, though it is also comes in 512mb and 1gb (I actually wanted the latter version). And the firmware update process is the easiest I've seen on any product that can be updated. The only bad thing is that it can only be performed on a PC-- no macs can do this, though you can upload songs to and mount the player on a mac. This is no big deal to me as I have a desktop PC right next to my G5 Power Mac. After I updated its firmware, I moved over to my mac and uploaded nearly 2gb worth of songs onto it from my iTunes folder. This worked flawlessly.     One interesting note is that there is no Hold feature on the T2. Once you see and feel the player it's pretty obvious why Cowon did not include this usually necessary feature. The buttons on the outside of the player are nearly flat with the body and require a bit of a push, for they are on the stiff side. They are not mushy at all; making a Hold feature superfluous. The overall effect is that the T2 feels solid and well built. Perhaps not as tank-like as some other models (the 2nd gen. ipod nano comes to mind) because the entire exterior is plastic. Another minor complaint.     It comes with two proprietary USB connectors, one is a long cable and one is nothing but an adapter. The latter is plenty for most of us except for those who have a difficult time reaching the USB port on their computer, or for lack of space in between the USB port and wall or some other object. Oh, another minor complaint: the AC adapter is optional; therefore, the only way to charge it is through the USB port. This means that occasionally a computer must be booted for the sole purpose of charging one's mp3 player. This is just stupid and cheap on Cowon's part.     A big reason I got this was that it has FM (shame on you, Apple, for not including this on any ipod), and it is surprisingly clear. This is another component that keeps getting better with each generation.     At this very early time with this product, I'd rate this an 8.5 out of 10. It has everything I was looking for (except for true mac compatibility) and more. If you're looking for an extremely small, easy to use (once you figure out the menu system) and cool looking mp3 player, give the iaudio T2 a serious look. I doubt you will be disappointed.

<Title>A solid player from iAudio

<Content>Pros: Very tiny, lightweight. It's got iAudio's signature features, such as excellent sound output, fantastic EQ and DSP features, etc. The interface is a bit tricky at first, but pretty good after a few hours of use. The included earbuds are surprisingly good, too. The necklace setup is quite comfortable and reduces cable mess. Did I mention small? Oh, and the FM tuner is nice, too.  Cons: The Ogg Vorbis and FLAC support kind of suck. Some of my FLACs don't show at all, and some Vorbis files cause lockups, horrible screeching static, etc. Tags also don't seem to be fully supported with them. Nothing new here, though, it seems the Rio Karma is the only player in existence to properly support these formats. Except maybe other players running the Rockbox firmware (which has no T2 support at the moment). The screen could be a little larger, too. It appears to be shoved over on the side to make room for other components on the inside. It would be quite nice if it filled up the whole player. That's just nitpicking though.  Overall, a really fantastic little product. People will complain about the battery life, but neglect to realize how tiny the product is. Large batteries do not fit in small places. With current battery technology, this is about as good as you can get.  If you're looking for a tiny player with some nice features, give the T2 some thought.

<Title>Nice sounding, small MP3 player

<Content>If your looking for a small necklace style MP3 player you cant go wrong with the iAudio T2.  I use it everyday at work and most of the time I dont even know i'm wearing it.  It's size makes it very unabtrusive with no cables to get tangled up in.  Battery life is decent at 10-12 hours per charge.   It does have its minor problems though.  It sounds very good, but the supplied headphones could be better.  Thats also another problem, if you use another pair of headphones you lose its necklace ability.  Navigating takes some getting used to as well.  Dont let the negatives turn you off however.  It is a very good product.

<Title>Fits the task

<Content>As one review said - this unit is TyNee - as in real small.  I haven't run into any issues of battery life - it will run all day - or they way it is really used - for several days.  Then just plug it into any computer and it gets recharged over night.  The options it has are plenty and the only 'issue' would be getting used ot which buttons do what.  Once you get used to that, its easy to get around on the screen.  The screen is sharp and bright, the output is full.  I use Shure and Etymotic Research ear-buds and the sound it fantastic.  Did I mention that it is tiny - very small and not worth mentioning that you even know its there.
