<Title>Great MP3 Player!!!!!

<Content>I was given this MP4/MP3 player as a Christmas present this year and I have to admit this is one nifty little player.  It does way more stuff than my IPod shuffle ever did.  This little player not only plays MP3's but it also plays movies and one can even listen to the FM radio.  This player is also very compact and it can be placed almost anywhere.  In addition, this player has two headphone jacks so I can share the player with someone or I can even listen to the player using the built-in speakers.  I would recommend this as a great player for anyone to purchase or give as a gift.
