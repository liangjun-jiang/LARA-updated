<Title>Descent Player, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have purchased several Coby products the last couple of years and have no issues with any of them.  I bought a Coby MP-C781 in November and it died last week.  I emailed tech support and got a caned response 4 DAYS LATER.  The email said to reload the firmware and gave a link to the site. NO FIRMWARE ON THE SITE. So I called support. Took 3 number to find one that worked.  They told me there was no firmware for the unit and I would have to mail it back to them with a $6 money order. They had no answer when I asked why the email said to reload firmware even though there is no firmware on the website.   I had a similar problem with a Sandisk unit and they only required me to send the unit back and did not give me any hassle and they were very responsive on their customer support emails.  I WILL NEVER BUY another Coby product again because of their BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT.

<Title>Worked well for about 4 months
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My daughter was so happy to get this for her birthday!  It worked well and we downloaded numerous songs for her.  She used it a few times every week and carried it with her to keep her from getting bored in the car when I wanted to listen to my music.  The last time she used it she put it in her jacket pocket & zipped it up.  We really aren't sure why the LCD screen looked like we dropped it in water because it stayed dry.  It just stopped working. That's too bad, because it seemed like a nice product.  Should've lasted longer than 4 months!

<Title>Not impressed
<Date>Wed Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this at a day after Thanksgiving sale for Christmas.  The speakers never worked but I bought a cheap pair from Walmart and didn't worry about returning them.  The MP3 worked ok for about 2 months then just died.  Nothing would work.  I bought it from Home Depot who would not allow a return because it had been 3 months since the purchase date.  Coby would also not honor a warranty.  Although it was only 2 months from the date it was opened as a Christmas present, it was past the 3 month deadline.  My feeling is that when you pay $80 for an item, it should last more than 2 months.  I will NEVER buy a Coby product or from Home Depot again.

<Content>I would never buy this product.  Every time I go to use it I have to put in a new AAA battery.  I have spent as much money on batteries as I did on the player itself.  I have since purchased a different MP3 player!!

<Title>A Disappointment
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player for my daughter for Christmas and I was so delighted to find a player with expandable memory.  It seemed like an answered prayer as she continually outgrows the capacity of previous players.  However, from the beginning we noticed that the player ate up batteries like nothing.  Even digital batteries weren't much better.  Now, 4 months later and the player will not stay powered up and I'm finding more and more bad reviews with the same complaints. That expandable space is of no use to us now!

<Title>What a piece of junk.
<Date>Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would advise anyone looking to buy an MP3 player not to buy this one. I had one for just about a week before it started acting strange; it would randomly turn itself off and eventually I had to pop the battery out and put it back in to get the stupid thing to turn on. This things sucks up batteries at an unbelievable rate too. It uses 1 AAA battery and I would have to replace the (Duracell) battery EVERY OTHER DAY.   DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER!!!

<Title>Great price, no frills: a nice compact player
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Other than not having a color display, this player has absolutely everything in a perfect tiny square player.  I bought it during a one day sale and for 1 GB with an expansion slot I felt like I was getting away with something because the list price was even great without the sale.  I bought this for my boyfriend to use in his car with an FM transmitter, and the battery life is long enough to leave it in the car for a couple weeks at a time between charging.  It is a great deal for anyone who wants space and quality without a big price tag, and who doesn't care if the player doesn't come in every color of the rainbow, etc.  No frills, just a great player. :)

<Title>A worthy little instrument!
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to protect my expensive wave/mp3 recorder - at 10% of the cost, this is better than insurance.  I also wanted the memory feature - to have it boot up to the same location as when I turned it off, so I could use it with recorded books, which this does admirably.  Unfortunately, this function only works with the on-board memory, not the extended memory in my SD card.  Also, this is necessary even for music, because the unit will shut down after a short time on pause - certainly less than the period of a phone call.  I have the 512 MB on-board version, and was jealous when my fiddle student showed up with the 1 GB upgrade.  The recording quality really surprised me, as for me this was only meant to play back what I recorded on my Edirol.  Edirol is still better, but this isn't as bad as the last cassette recorder I owned! Other reviewers complain about reliability, so maybe I'm lucky.  I was convinced to purchase (despite the whiners) by a photo series by one owner who had fixed a few basic problems by himself, and decided that if necessary, I could do the same.  There is one tune out of the nearly 512 MB I have recorded that consistently causes a unit failure, requiring me to remove the battery momentarily to reset.  Otherwise, I have no problems with it, and can't believe it only cost $40.  Removing the battery is a pain, so I place a small bit of ribbon behind the battery before installation, and that works great for pulling it out.  There is very little room for this, however, so if you're going to try this, think minimal! I use it almost daily at work, with Sennheiser PCX250 noise-cancelling headphones.  The headphone's electronics unit does seem to interfere with the radio reception, but then I'm in a large steel-frame building, and radio reception could be compromised anyway.  If I lay them out on the desk at maximal separation, there's little interference, but for walking around I'd need different headphones.  I keep a few rechargeable batteries on hand, and replace as needed - again, I don't expect the battery to last forever, so I'm not as irritated as other reviewers - I do like the fact that it uses commercially available batteries and not proprietary ones like the ipod. The main improvement I'd like to see to this unit is the ability to play wav files - converting these to mp3 or wma is not hard, but the extra step gets to be a chore.  Otherwise, I love this little unit and heartily recommend it.

<Title>Coby 2
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought another Coby MP3 for my older son, however wanted a 1 MG since he was younger. This was a poor quality MP3. The lighting/graphics/words are poor. I tried for hours on Christmas to download 4 songs, all the same format. Two downloaded, the other 2 kept giving me an error message. The quality of the player itself seemed plastic-like. I thought I couldn't go wrong buying a Coby, but I guess I should have read more reviews. You get what you pay for.....

<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>10/16/2006 - I bought this little player for my 17 year old daughter after she whined about everyone else having mp3 players. I compared prices and bought this one for the price, more than anything else. That was 8 months ago and this little player is still going strong!! I bought a 2 year extended warranty with it, just in case, but it looks like I won't be using it.   This player has great sound, though my daughter uses her own tiny headphones that she already had. The batteries seem to be long lasting and when you hook it up via USB to your computer, it functions like an extra drive. It holds mp3's as well as data files. Via the computer, you can change song order and change song titles. My daughter rarely uses the radio, but says it comes in clear when she does.  This little thing has been dropped more than once, and it goes almost everywhere with a very active teen and still holding up well. I'm considering buying one for myself.

<Title>Do NOT waste your money
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very disappointed with this product.  It was a gift to my husband.  And while he enjoys the fact that he was able to use it as a radio and to listen to his favorite songs, buyer beware it eats up batteries in less than two hours time.  I regret the money spent and wish I had just bought an IPOD.  YOu really do get what you pay for...only this time had I known about this products defects I wouldn't have even spent a penny!  Waiting to hear back from customer service regarding whehter or not they will honor their 90 day waranty to fix or replace it with something that doesn't have the same problem.  We'll see.

<Title>The Big Sis
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My little brother, a freshman in high school, wanted an mp3 player for Christmas. The ipods were WAY out of my price range, so i searched amazon and found this. The package and item were presentable and my little brother has been using it without many problems. The only thing is that it seems like it might have a low battery life, but otherwise its great.

<Title>A HUGE Disappointment
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player for Christmas as a gift.  At first I thought this player was great...lots of memory, great sound, ability to record radio, portable speakers.  That is, until I discovered that this little gizmo eats batteries like there's no tomorrow.  It has a ravenous, voracious appetite for AAA batteries and no alternative power options.  Within 20 minutes of inserting a new AAA battery and hitting 'play' the battery indicator goes from 100% to 25% and then starts flashing 0% for the next 3-4 hours.  After that, it's dead.  Same thing happens with every battery I try.  THE PACKAGE SAID 30 HOURS OF PLAYBACK, NOT 4!  I thought surely it was a firmware glitch but couldn't find a download online, so I contacted the company twice after which I finally got a reply to my e-mail days later saying that while the player can play back up to 30 hours, the battery won't last that long and to please use rechargeable batteries if I'm going to listen to it for an "extended period of time."  3-4 hours is extended???  Since when??  I heard there were a lot of returns on this item this year and now I know why.  It's a horrible product.

<Content>This player is a bargain, as non-IPOD's go.  It's physically well-designed with quality earbuds and excellent sound, with very usable controls.  With 1GB at the price it's a GOOD DEAL, as Doc Watson might sing (just wanted you to know what I can date to, in case that affects how you interpret my review.)

<Title>Almost Perfect For My Needs (as a recorder)
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did not buy this to listen to music but I bought it for it's ability to record from the FM radio band. I use it to record public lectures (including conventions) which are broadcasted on the FM band within the lecture hall or convention site.  Previously, I had another MP3 player/recorder (Samsung YP-MT6) that I paid $130 for that stopped working. Unlike that first unit this Coby product gives you a choice of bit rates that you can record in making it possible to record at only 32kbps instead of 128kbps and thus able to record lectures like forever (well at least 12 days worth). If I had known this when I made the purchase I would have bought the 512MB model.  One problem is the battery life. While I never have ran the battery dead during a recording, the battery indicator shows that you can't count on recording more than 1.5 to 2 hours at a time. So I use rechargable NiMH batteries and change the battery between lectures when necessary.  Changing the battery could be a bit easier as it can be difficult to remove.  With 1GB storage plus the ability to add extra storage with an SD flash card, I have way more storage capability than I will ever need. I should add that the recordings with this unit were clearer than with the Samsung YP-MT6 which recorded noise likely from flouresent lights in the lecture hall.  I bought a 1 year extended replacement warranty with this for $9.99 but I think I'm going to cancel it.  At the price of this unit $9.99 is too much for an added year of protection. Besides, judging from the reviews I don't anticipate any real problems

<Title>For me, it was too good to be true..
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player based on it's reviews, price, and the expandable memory via a sd/mmc card. The expandable memory seems to be a rarity in players under $100..Unfortunately, mine turned out to be defective within 12 hrs of receiving it. It would read songs off of my MMC card, but not off of the internal memory. I spent a decent amount of time transferring songs to the player and everything seemed like it went through fine. Then I powered it up to discover "no music" where there should have been hundreds of songs. Ouch. I tried it a second time with the same result..so this one's going back, and I'm getting a Creative Labs 1Gb nano plus for 15.00 more.. and the Nano plus also comes with an armband..a big plus for someone who works out. The Coby only comes with the headphone/neck cord, which i disliked intensly-it kept swinging around and getting in the way during my workout. Here are some pros and cons that I found in the short while I used it:  Pros:  -The display is surprisingly animated for such a cheap MP3 player. -Big storage capabilities for the money (see above for the bad part!) -Decent menu/navigation system -Good sound with the EQ, the headphones that came with it are pretty average, as far as pack-ins go. -May be worth the gamble on quality due to all of the features this thing offers. Just be sure to get a different method of carrying this thing around (arm band, etc.), and quality headphones definitely help make this sound even better.  Cons:  -Very cheap, "plasticky" feel to it. The buttons feel "clicky" when you push them. I know that mp3 players are supposed to be light, but this one just didn't feel like it had too much quality to it. -The manual claims there are firmware updates available, but when I checked the website, I couldn't find anything. -After about 2 1/2 hours, the battery indicator was on the last bar..either this player is extremely inefficient, or the indicator could use some work. -The headphone/neck cord has metal (supports?) on it, which look nice and have obvious functional qualities, but seem like they could scratch/damage the player's casing because they are pretty heavy duty. -As I previously mentioned, mine was defective! I'm not too sure about the Coby brand either, so I'm trying something else.
