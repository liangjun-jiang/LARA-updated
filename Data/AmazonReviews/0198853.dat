<Title>The Way it Should Be
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My wife and I had previously owned two Philips GOGear HDD6330 30GB mp3 players and had many many problems. Mostly with syncing the songs onto the devices and also some with proper playback. The interface was also not as nice nor responsive as the iPod. So we returned the Philips players and got an 80GB and 30GB iPod. Neither has let us down once. They sound great, the battery lasts for days (4-6 hours a day use). itunes is very easy to use and seems to almost know what you need to do before you do. podcasts are neat and free, you can download tons of videos from google video, you can put pictures on it, no problems finding accessories. It is really just night and day vs. the current windows based offerings. On the 80GB iPod we have about 6,500 songs, 50 videos, 200 photos, and all of our outlook contacts and it is only about half full. Not to mention the games that come with it. If you don't mind spending a little more for quality, this is the way to go, it just works.   My wife uses the 30GB white version and loves it. it does have a lot less space and shorter battery life than the 80 GB, but it is much slimmer feeling as far as the thickness and still has all of the other features that make iPods so great. We also both sync using the same itunes without any problems (turn off auto syncing to do this and drag songs etc to device.) This was not the case when we both were using Philips GoGears and Windows Media Player. Everyone else that I know that owns an iPod has never said anything bad about them, Apple really has a winner here, it would take a lot of convincing to ever switch me back over to windows based mp3 systems.

<Title>Great product, buy one today!  But . . .
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>don't buy it here.  Go to the Apple store either online or a retail location.  There you will get the product and support you need and you won't have to wait a month or so to get that wonderful Amazon message that says they can't fill your order at this time, but would you like to wait?  And after 4 months or so of not getting your new ipod, just try getting your money back from Amazon.

<Title>Great, but has a sluggish interface
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I upgraded from the previous generation iPod (4g), and expected this new iPod to be better in every way...well it is better in every way but one.  The interface is comparatively very slow to respond to input.  When you try to navigate through your songs, there is always a slight delay.  And when you scroll through your music, it goes scroll scroll stop (for a quarter second)...scroll scroll stop. Overall this is a great player, and I am surprised they didn't put a faster processor in there.

<Title>ipod or zune...???
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>well let's take a quick look at both of them, which one's sexier? well for me ipod is way sexier than zune (besides zune looks really bulky). Zune's screen is bigger, but i guess the screen is not a big problem is it? ipod's wheel make navigating through menus easier, while zune has a pad instead of a touch-sensetive wheel. The wireless thing would be really cool if you could actually keep the songs you receive!! but no, they only last 3 days, and you can only play them 3 times, now that sucks. If you want an MP3 for christmas, i'd really recommend ipod, cause zune just isn't as good as ipod. Yeah microsoft may rule at computers, but they suck at making MP3 and videogames. So that's all i have to say for now, hopefully this helped you realized that ipod is the best MP3 out there.

<Title>Moving on to Bigger and Better
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own both the iPod (5.5) and the Zune - buy a Zune. Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant "let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel" navigation "aid" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion.

<Title>A Great Buy for Kids and Adults!
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted an Ipod video really bad for my thirteenth birthday, but my parents said that it was too expensive. So, you can imagine my surprise of seeing the Ipod video box nestled under the wrapping paper! The first thing I did with it was connect it to our Mac and download the songs from Itunes onto it. The Ipod downloaded the songs quite fast (I was very impressed! It took my sisters nano forever!). I then went to check out the movie store and bought Harry Potter and Napoleon Dynamite. After, I downloade Pac- Man from the games section. I played around on it until my mom said I had to go to bed. I didn't feel tired, so I brought my Ipod with me and watched Napoleon Dynamite under the covers and a couple Tv shows until midnight!                The next Night, my friend Alexis had a sleepover, and I decided to bring my iPod to it (I have trouble sleeping at other people's houses, it freaks me out). When I was in the bathroom changing into my PJs, my friend Mary was in my bag looking for Chapstick that I said I'd lend her. She saw the Ipod in there and showed it to everyone else. When I came out, they were all looking at it, amazed that it could do so many things! When they saw me, they rushed up to me and started asking me questions. The rest of the night went on as normal. We did each other's hair, a couple girls played Pac man and watched Hannah Montana on my iPod (I don't like Hannah Montana! I swear! It was already on iTunes!). When it was finally time for bed, I couldn't sleep (duh) so I got out my iPod. I guess I wasn't the only one not asleep, because my friend Alexis saw me and asked what I was doing. We watched Harry Potter together, and Napoleon Dynamite! When we knew we had to sleep, it was 5 a.m.! This iPod is addictive!                        Of course, nothing can be perfect. I know you didn't want to waste your time reading me babble on about how great the iPod video is. It scratches a lot! I'd invest in a case to protect it. Whe I'm scrollinng through my music, the scroll sometimes stops for a second, not that important, but extremely annoying. Also, the scroll wheel is smaller, which means that it takes longer to go through your music.                 There are also a lot of new features with the iPod video. There's the combination lock, where you can set a password so that only you can get into it. Also, it's the only iPod able to play games and videos (duhhhhhh). REASONS KIDS LIKE IT... It's great on long trips like feild trips, to pass time. All of your friends like it (this can also be a bad thing! It scrartches easily when your friends handle it roughly! Please be careful.) The games are lots of fun when you have free time in school (be sure that your teachers will let you bring your iPods to school.) When you can't sleep, the movies are a great way to pass time REASONS ADULTS LIKE IT... It's functional and practical Very portable You can use it in work while your boss drones on and on (or so my mom says...) My dad says that the podcasts are fun to watch (I like Strong Bad ones) TIPS: Invest in a case! I cannot say this enough! You'll regret it if you dont! I recomend the Belkin Brushed Metal/Acrylic Case for iPod. It comes in Light Green, Teal, Pink, and Silver! I have the Teal one, it makes my iPod video look like it came blue!

<Title>Excellent value
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You simply can't match the value you get for the price of this gorgeous iPod. The ability to view and show others your photos and watch video is priceless. The quality of the video and images is simply incredible. This is my second iPod (the first being a 10 GB white click wheel I had for over 3 years) and I have convinced so many of my friends and family to get them. I have been able to watch almost two hours of TV shows on an airplane with no problem (haven't tried watching a full-length movie yet). Overall this is a fantastic product for the money and you will not regret your purchase!

<Title>Music was my first love
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>At home I'm always listening to music, but so far I never owned an MP3-Player or something comparable. Last month I was looking for an iPod for my sister, which should cost maximum 50-80$ and then I found this one - and fell in love with it :-)  It was in the "Refurnished"-category, but actually I couldn't find any bigger scratches or other problems and now I've already been listening to it every day and it's just great! The battery works really long and the 30GB of memory are just...awesome :-) Thanks very much for this great item!

<Title>Nice video player - try it with TiVo
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>What can you really say about the iPod that hasn't been written already. I'll try one thing: as a commuter who own Tivo at home, I love being able to Tivo movies (TCM - Turner Classic Movies - has them without commercials!), transfer them wirelessly to my Mac computer, then export them to iPod-viewable format for me to watch on my iPod to and from work. Much easier than watching movies on a laptop. (If you do this, record the movies "Basic" quality on Tivo and the encoding and exporting will go much faster and the file size will be reduced - and the quality of the picture will be indistinguishable from "Medium" or even "High" when viewed on your iPod

<Title>Mounting issues 
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm the veteran of many IPod models, and have worked with all of them on various Macs and PCs.  My advice is to get the biggest one you can afford, load it up, and don't count on it ever interfacing with your computer again.  An absolutely wonderful device once you get it loaded, but horrific in terms of consistently being recognized by either your desktop or itunes itself.  I'm still happy I have my current 30 gig model since it's loaded with just about everything I'd care to listen to anyway - and for that reason alone it was worth the money - but I'm amazed at how popular a product it remains (especially the smaller ones) given how poorly it fares with both firewire and usb connectivity.

<Title>Excellent product!
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Excellent product Apple! I've owned this product 2 years from now, and I'm still using it.  There are 2 ways of using it, 1. As a music player 2. as an external hard drive. I like those ideas! that's what made me give up on my new iPod Touch and return back to using my iPod Video.  I strongly disagree that it is prone to finger prints, mine is perfectly clean, like it was new from the box. On, the front, there are absoloutly no scratches, but there are a few on the back.  Pros  -Long battery life -Can be used as an external hard drive -Games -Contacts -Screenlock  Those are all I can remember from the Pros of my iPod, and now the sad part ...  Cons  -Lacks built-in FM radio tuner -Lacks coverflow  I really like this product, I'll be keeping it with me a few more years, then I'll get a new one.
