<Title>What a great player!
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little player is just what we wanted. It recharges at the computer, so I am not buying batteries everyday. The download software is user friendly and my kids figured it out on their own. We are very satisfied with our Zen player and thinking of getting another.

<Title>Bad News
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Deceptive  I bought this MP3 player because the Creative Web site promised "Easy Transfer -- Simple drag and drop your data files between ZEN V and your computer.  No complicated or messy driver installations necessary."  However this does not seem to be the case.  I love Creative's MP3 Muvo player.  No software needed to load that player up with MP3s.  The Muvo shows up as a USB mass storage drive, so one just has to drag and drop his MP3s and data to the Muvo, using nothing more than Windows Explorer -- just like any other thumbdrive.  I researched the Zen V first on Creative's site, and the language implies that loading the Zen V was as simple as loading the Muvo or any thumbdrive.  However, one apparently does need software to load the Creative Zen V.  Moreover, apparently one also needs an Internet connection to install the software.  Why do I need to go to the Internet when all I want to do is load this MP3 player with my music and images?  I tried to install the software, but it wouldn't install after I told Zone Alarm not to allow the  install software to go to the Internet.    There is no language on the outside of the box that says you need to install software to use the player, or that you need an Internet connection.    I attached the unit to my computer via the USB connection to see if it would show up as a USB mass storage device, and it did not.  The "Play for Sure" icon on the back was sticker out; apparently Creative had second thoughts after they put out the product, and decided not to support that function.  Moreover, the player will not work in Windows 2000 (though it does say you need Windows XP on the box).  I also suspect that the Creative software might be phoning home, and telling the mothership what you are listening to. I see no other urgent need to go to the Internet, unless I make that decision myself.  In short, the packaging and the product is deceptive. Which is really too bad because I love the Muvo, and was eyeing the larger Zen Vision: M model.  Now I'm going to have to reconsider the Archos solutions.

<Title>Very Pleased with Zen V
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Zen V about a month and so far I love it. I have downloaded books from netlibrary without a hitch. Copying books from CD's and then transferring has been more of a challenge due to each track needing to be edited manually. It bookmarks great and does remember where you left off after shutdown as long as it isn't on pause. Not sure why that is but I learned that fairly quickly. I am still learning all the extra features, but I recommend it if you want to do audiobooks.

<Title>Great, cheap, and simple to use!
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would highly recommend this player as an alternative to an Ipod.  It's much cheaper, is easy to use, and is small. I wasn't looking for an mp3 player to do my dishes, laundry, and cook for me like many of you who post reviews on this product seem to want.  This player holds hundreds of songs(who needs more on at a time?), and plays a high quality sound.

<Title>Very disappointing
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I returned this item right after I bought it.  I own two Ipods already and wanted to buy another MP3 player for the kids.  I figured I'd try another product and the price was right, but you get what you pay for.  I followed the instructions, connected the player, the device was recognized by my computer only intermittently.  The device also froze up and had to be reset.  The software would freeze up when running and crash as well.  I went to Creative's website, tried their troubleshooting help to no avail.  After a couple of frustrating hours, I've given up.  Too much effort.  I'm buying the new Nano....

<Title>GOOD little PLAYER
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Many of the negatives written about the Zen are true.  It does lock up (esp if you try to scroll too fast), you DO have to install software on your computer and learn how to use it (duh), and it's not quite as sexy as the brand name iPod, but I think for it's particular market niche it is a good little player and stands up well against the Apple products.  I for one LOVE my little Zen.  (note: resetting the Zen is easy, installing/learning the software was not difficult, and for the $200+ price tag of an iPod, I can live with the loss of prestige).       The keyword here is "little".   It is truly small (about the size of my car alarm remote) and of negligible weight, so I can comfortably and securely wear it around my neck like a necklace without special cases, pouches, armbands, or pockets built into my jacket or backpack (though all of these accessories are available for those that feel a need for them).  Because of this compact, lightweight design, I tend to carry ("wear") my Zen more often than other players and so it has become my favourite.     Secondly, the fact that it is inexpensive (I won't say "cheap") is actually a big plus for me because I am not constantly afraid of damaging it as I would be a more expensive player.   I tend to "wear" my Zen through some rugged use (workouts, hiking, traveling, skiing, etc) and it has held up perfectly so far (!), but I am not over-worried about it.  I don't use mine for audio books, so I can't speak to the "bookmarking" problem.  I mainly enjoy a large collection of my favourite music which can be nicely categorized into handy playlists, like an energetic workout list, a mellow relaxing list, by music genre, by artist, or even play an entire "album" in it's original order.  I love this feature because I can rock out when I want to, or play some quiet background pop when my Mom is in the car... LOL.  The Zen has brought a lot of additional joy to my life, hearing my favourite music, esp when sitting around waiting or traveling long distances.  Battery life is impressive.  I've gone on entire 3-day weekend trips without it quitting on me.  It charges from any USB port (cord included) and has an optional car adapter (an after market NECESSITY).     With a few minor accessories (a USB power cord, a car power adapter cord, a car "cassette" adapter, a protective silicone shell, waterproof earbuds), I have tricked my Zen out to fit very well into my life and my uses.  Perhaps I am just not a demanding customer, but I think that the Zen is a very nice little player for an excellent price.  I am very happy with mine and I would confidentally recommend it.

<Content>dont waste your money on an ipod.  the zen is really easy to use and i use limewire to download music so i didnt spend any extra money on buying music. The battery lasts a long time too which is nice, once you charge it completely the first time you only have to charge it about once every week and a half, depending on how often you use it. Its also really small and light it almost disappears in your hand, but the screen looks awesome for such a small device.  Also, fyi creative actually sued apple in 2006 for infringement of the zen patent, the case was settled for $612 million

<Title>Great player for the money
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This a a great player for a new user.  Once I learned how to navigate, I've had very few problems. The screen shows more than other players of equal size.   This device supports books from Audible, which is my primary use, although I have some albums and pictures.  This little 1GB can hold a large book, six albums, and about 20 pictures.  The screen shows the length of a downloaded book, how much time you've listened to and how much time is left.  You can use the joystick to move forward and back within the book.  This device is also supported by my public library, and I can download some books for free. If you shut down the player while a book is playing the unit will usually return to where you left off, and the bookmarking feature offers additional protection.  The unit has frozen several times when I was attempting to navigate too fast, but I've discovered that the earring post I'm always wearing becomes a great way to reset the player.   It is incredible to have an entire book in my purse!  Great little player for the money.

<Title>Three week lifespan
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had some concerns proir to purchasing this after reading reviews on the Amazon, NewEgg and other websites.  It appears you've got a 50-50 chance of getting a good one.  I took a chance and got the lemon.  I lost all confidence when I finally got though to the RCA techies, and their response was "yeah, these have issues, not really sure why".    Having to carry around a toothpick to reboot this everytime it freezes is not my idea of a quality product.  Not that I use this often, maybe an hour a day, if that but when the backlight gave out, it was time to send back.  Kudos to Amazon's return policy and I'll take the refund to purchase something else.

<Title>Very good if...
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had one of these for about a year before my little brother yanked it down from the desk and righit onto hard wood, it still worked, but the screen died, and i didnt feel like replacing it, so i just got something else. But like I said, if youve ever used an iPod or iTunes, you know that their very easy to use, and Creative isnt quite as good but their catching up. Now they may be harder to use (for the first week until you get used to them) but Creative PACKS this thing with tons of extra stuff, im too lazy to list them, but i would definately buy this over an iPod nano if you know how to work, and figure out how to use things well, but if you just want something siple to use, and iPod might be better, but if you just want to play music (and not use the extra features on the Zen V) then its a pretty simple music player.

<Title>bad design, bad quality
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year, and she took excellent care of it.  In March the joystick controller split in two.  It seems like this is pretty common problem, but Creative would not fix it.  I ended up buying another broken one and replacing the joystick myself.  But in Sept. the screen backlight died.  I am really disapointed in both the customer service and quality of this product and will not buy another Creative product again

<Title>Outstanding portable recorder... with one major flaw.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other MP3 player, and/or burn CD copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one MAJOR flaw*  A line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's VU meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. That's right it actually has a line in jack AND VU meters..how sweet is that? With an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3GPIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0691807-1803628">Audio Adapter - Rca - Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 Mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  Recoding is encoded at 128 or 160Kbps MP3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,LPs, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 Kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  It also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. Nothing new there.  Audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  Battery life is about 9-12 hrs...Uh... battery..battery...WHERE'S THE BATTERY?  * THE BATTERY IS NOT USER REPLACEABLE. IMHO that's inexcusable. When it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. Likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. The only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  As a recorder I'd give it an 8/10.  As a portable media player I'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that I'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but I wish it had more output power.
