<Title>Sorry to make the first review a bad one
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Looking for my first MP3 player, thought something small and inexpensive might be where to start, so got I this one. Big mistake. The screen was just impossible to read (TINY in EVERY WAY) and the included instructions were utterly useless. I'm not sure what purpose the CD serves because I couldn't get anything from it but warnings about possibly screwing up my laptop if I continued and error messeges. I know there are 8 year olds out there who could figure this out easily but I really need something simpler to use and easier to read. I am going to return this and try something that is about twice the price.

<Title>Very basic
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased 4 of these for my kids.  They are very basic with nothing fancy but my kids love them.  No fancy options and must have USB 2.0 to use or it has problems.  Not recommended for the high end user but ok otherwise.  You get what you pay for.  Don't use disk unless you have windows 98 or ME.

<Title>It just.. died.
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player was a gift from Christmas, the display was difficult, and the option menu was difficult and annoying to go through.  I would go through batteries constantly.  After the first few weeks, it started to get lags, and the start up was incredibly slow, the next problem was, it would just suddenly turn off, and drop information.  The lags and stalls started growing longer, and longer, and eventually it stopped accepting any information from the USB, and died.  All in all, it lasted about three or four months.

<Title>Run for your lives!

<Content>Please, profit from my mistake and DO NOT buy this product. We shouldn't all have to suffer. This MP3 player is, frankly, a piece of junk. Lots of skipping when it is moved at all, and know this: you WILL NOT get "10 hours of play" on the battery: the most I ever got from it was _2 hours_ on a brand new, brand name battery. Finally had to give up and buy another player, so this one was a complete waste of $.
