<Content>With good quality MP3s or WMAs, this player sound like a good CD player.  I carry 8 CD quality albums in this player that's the size and weight of a Bic lighter.  Good FM, and live voice recording too.  I thought I would needed to upgrade the earbuds, but they are good too.

<Title>WOW!!! My first mp3 player
<Date>Sat Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No more cd players for me; feel like I was in the dark ages compared to having this player. This is my first mp3 player and, after much searching for features I wanted, I settled for this. And, I'm not disappointed at all!! The only other feature that I wanted was an expandable memory card slot for additional memory, and I sacrificed that for everything else I got in this player. I have about 80 songs on mine with less than half the memory used up. The battery I had that came with it lasted 3 days; which is good for nonrechargable batteries. I'd advise anyone to get the AAA rechargables if you listen to your mp3 a lot. The software that comes with it is cool, and I learned how to transfer my songs from mp3 to wma format to save more space. The volume is good, the earbuds look of quality and hold up well and fit in my ears nicely. The color is cool, the options are nice when playing a song. I tried out the FM recording and it was alright. Voice recording with anything (just a voice recorder, cellphone, cd player, mp3 player) is good as long as proximity is not a problem. My only headache, trivial as it seems, is the songs don't play in order that they were imported...they play in random order; not a big deal. Plus, the price is great and Creative is a very well known and reliable brand. Buy this and you will not be disappointed!!!!

<Title>Buy This MP3 PLayer. Now!!!

<Content>I had to pay Creative back in some way for making such a great mp3 player--so I decided to write this review. I bought the player for running and I'm very happy I did. I liked the fact that it came with an armband and cost a lot less than the Ipod that all those suckers at the gym are sporting. The thing is--you don't even need the armband. The player fits into a clip case that you can attach to your waistband--run the cord under you shirt and you don't even feel the thing even when you're running hard. I save my mp3s at a higher quality (I think 192 compared to 128) so I fit about 5 albums on--but you could probably do twice that in WMA. I like to change the content often and it's a sinch. As others have reviewed, the player will alphabetically arrange tracks in a given folder but if your tracks aren't numbered already (and you care) just number them in the title and they'll all play in order. It's also great for experimenting with mixes. This was my first mp3 player and I want to get another one. Buy it!

<Title>Warranty Sucks
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I liked the price. Good buy for the money. I called to get replacement because it kept turning off for no reason. Was told that I had to send $24.95 in order to get it repaired or replaced even though it was still covered under warranty. Maybe it's just me but, doesn't sound like much of a warranty. Check the replacement/repair warranty before you buy.

<Title>Maddening
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At first I loved this thing, but if something goes wrong, good luck.  Last night I hit the wrong thing and fast forwarded to the end of a program.  I could never get back to that program and ended up totally lost and with my information upside down.  Looking at my laughable instruction booklet was no help.  There is not even anything to tell me what the various icons mean.  I went into the website and couldn't get it to take an email for support, so I called a 1-888 number and was told it was for sales.  They then gave me a number for support that wasn't even toll free.  I called it and was told there would be an unusually long wait.    Thanks for nothing Ceative.    If you are a technologically skilled person, you may love this thing, but if not -- forget it.  You sure won't get any help from the company.

<Title>Well worth the money
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned a Creative Muvo TX FM 512MB for nearly 2 years. Bought it for $140 when it first came on the market and have no regrets since. Despite an increasing number of newer, prettier and gadget loaded players, I'm still happy with my Creative Muvo.  I'm not a technologically advanced person so it's simple layman experience here.   This small Zippo sized MP3 player is very easy to use. Just install the CD software included and you're all set. Open program. Plug player into USB port. Point, click and drag music files. Most of my music are MP3 or WMA format. I have had no problems with the Creative MediaSource software on my XP machine.  Sound quality is excellent. Choose from rock, jazz, classical or pop settings or customize your own EQ. I use it with my AKG K-26P headphones and the bass rocks. For classical music, the sound is clear and clean.  Design is business-like and functional. Extremely durable, thanks to the battery module (or battery case). I dropped it several times and it continued to work. One day, after a particularly bad fall, the battery case door finally broke and I simply ordered a new one for $10 from Creative. Replaced it and the player has worked perfectly since. I seriously doubt that the ultra cool and sleek IPod could have survived my abuse this well.  If I have any complaints, the AAA battery life is pretty average even on light use, lasting 3-4 days. I mainly use the player during work commute. I switched to Sony rechargeable batteries. While it did not lengthen battery life, the switch saved me a lot of money. Voice recorder is terribly muffled but this function is not an essential part of my MP3 player requirements.  If you are looking for a functional, easy to use MP3 player, at its current $60 price tag, the Creative Muvo TX FM 512MB is still one of the better players in the market.

<Content>Use this all the time for downloading and listening to books from the library.  Great for work, listening out in the yard, on walks etc. Downloading is easy. Sometimes have difficulty getting it to start at the same place where I last left off, but in the end can get there.
