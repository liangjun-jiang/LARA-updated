<Title>Mhhh, almost but not quite...
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I got one of these from my wife for Christmas. Here's what I see:  Good:  - Very Pretty - Seems to sound good, though I have nothing to compare it to. - Plays ogg (ok, kind of, see below)  Bad: - IRiver advertises that it plays ogg files. It does, but you don't put them into the player in the same way as you do MP3's, and you can't have all of the things with ogg that you should be able to (ordering by title, genre, author, etc). I had to call Tech support to figure out how to add them to the device - Forces users to use Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Media Player. I have not (and have spent considerable time) been able to make it work under Linux or Mac OSX. The device should simply show up as a USB storage device: it doesn't. This is a serious drawback - The headphones that come with the device are even more of a joke that you expect. For a device this expensive you expect a bit better. It is nearly impossible to keep them in your ear without surgery. - The interface is not the best. When you pause the device for more than a few seconds you have to reboot it in order to get back to where you were, about a minute. - It's capacity is somewhat small for the price. Not a big concern for me (It has enough capacity for audio, which is the primary function for which I'll use it) but video may be a different thing. - There's no way to upgrade its capacity to take advantage of falling prices in memory. This is very unfriendly. - Tech support is spotty  Fortunately for iriver some of these are fixable by firmware, so I hope they read this review.  I'll likely keep it because it sort of does what I want it to, but barely and in a half- assed way.

<Title>Amazon dropped the ball

<Content>I ordered the music and video player as a birthday present for my mother, with the plan of preloading it with video of her grandchildren. They sent me a refurbished iRiver T30 MP3 player (no video) and now I'm dealing with having to process the return and have no gift.  Come on Amazon... get it together

<Title>An imperfect yet gogeous little device
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great user interface, great functionality, awesome sound, crappy earphones, Yes! the crappy earphones ruin somewhat your first impression...too bad  This is one of the neatest little hi tech gizmos I have seen lately. You can't take your hands off of this thing. It is neat, it is sleek, works great, menus are intuitive, great functionality, excellent display...  On the down side, it is very difficult to format videos to play on this thing, actually impossible without the third party conversion software available from iRiver's web site. And even this, is not very good software. It works with some video formats but not with others, it is basic and primitive. The conversion process is very much a hit or miss proposition. Don't count on watching very many videos on this thing unless iRiver makes available some decent conversion software soon.  These are the three reasons why I did not give this gadget five stars:   First, the lousy earphones it comes with. A shame, given the cost of the unit.  Second, the difficulties with converting and loading videos into this thing. A pity because it greatly diminishes the use and value of its superb display.  Third, the cost factor. This unit, considering its memory size, is just too expensive vis a vis the competition.  If iRiver revises its pricing policies, includes quality earphones in the package and makes it easier to load videos into these devices, they just might  sweep the market clean.

<Title>Mickey Mouse functionality
<Date>Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The screen is very nice and the push screen is kind of neat but it sometimes can accidentally go the wrong direction. It takes forever to charge and you have to use the usb cable to charge unless you buy the option a/c cable. I think it is compatible with Windows Media 10 and now Media 11 is already out. Navigating through the screens is tiresome and is very tricky to memorize the features. Oh yeh and the headphones are pitiful. I think it's got the right idea but there are more user friendly MP3's out there. PS- the optional cradle is worthless but cool looking.
