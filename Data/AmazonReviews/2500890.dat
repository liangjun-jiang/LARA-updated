<Title>Good PMP but not the the best out there.
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got both archos av500 and cowon a2, cowon is a better choice for overall expectation, only thing archos over cowon would be the Look(Digital Camera alike) Glossy screen shaper image and video but would be easy to left thumb print, sound whise is average not nearly as good as cowon, no tuner, battery life is half of cowon a2, so i telling u cowon is better than this overall, cowon own this one otherword, get this one if u must insist u wanna tivo alike schedulo otherwise no reason why archos over cowon, *cowon has superior sound, support alot more file just drag and paste, radio tuner, nice case etc..* This thing cost almost the same as cowon so another reason.  I would gave a 4 star when this thing is out at first but now cowon turn the table around.

<Title>The Good, The Bad, And The Down Right Beautiful
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Throughout all of my experiences of shopping for a perfect portable   media player I have decided that no such device exists. The Archos Av 500 is one of the closest to that high standard.      The AV500 has all of the requirements for a great pmp and then some. However, it also has it's flaws. It boosts a monsterous 4 inch LCD which is one of the biggest save for the Archos AV700 (that supports a lousy resolution).     I purchased the 30GB model and I was impressed right off the bat with the power of the videocorder function but was unimpressed with the fact that there is no middle ground between the 30GB model and the 100GB model memory wise. I really wanted a 60GB version that cost somewhere in between the two.      The movies look spectacular when you connect a dvd/vhs/tv input and record at the right settings, I didn't even try to go the computer route because the AV500 has such a simple recording interface that there is no desire to use the computer as a middle man between the dvd and the Archos. Several dozen recordings later, I thought about attempting to go the computer way and I found a very interesting peice of info that I would like to pass on to you. The resolution recording settings on the archos are VGA (640x480) and a lower version of 512x(something I forgot). However, the screen resolution is 480X272. When the archos has to shrink the picture, it causes some distortion in the picture quality. This happens because there aren't enough pixels for the video resolution. The archos then decides whether or not to show some of the pixels and when the camera is moving or there is a particuarly large amout of detail on the screen then the garbage quality is shown on the screen. If you can find a good dvd to avi converter program (I used the "dvd to pocket pc" program from www.pqdvd.com) then I recomend that you set the settings to have the output resolution to be exactally 480x272. I did this and I recieved a picture resolution that I thought was literally DVD quality. It blew me away! Note: If you go this route then you cannot use the cropping feature.   If you dont want to go that way, then use the onboard recording feature. Be warned that it is very possible to make the recording look like crap so pay close attention.  The way to avoid this is to set the resolution at VGA and keep the KBS at 1500 (the files become a size that about 16-18 movies can be stored on the AV500). This sweet spot is my key to making the movies that I record look on par with DVDs on my AV500's screen (not a tv output). I encountered some glitches (the AV500 randomly froze during a recording process)that caused me to worry at first but several recordings later and I forgot all about them.      One secret hidden feature that I had no idea about was the editing feature of video files. Due to the fact that I wanted as many movies on my Archos as possible and that I typically only watch the action sequences, I was able to cut out all of the scenes of Anakin Skywalker and Padme in Star Wars Episode III to make a 45 minute movie that jumped from one action sequence to another. I am now able to get all of the aciton from any movie into one file roughly 300-700MBs which allows me to fit 50-60 movies on my Archos.     The photo feature is OK. I say "ok" as a way of being nice. The photo feature is there so i can't really complain. However, it sucks. The photo feature has very limited zoom function that becomes quite annoying. The load times are delayed just slightly which made the device seem a bit slow compared to the fact that it can record a tv signal at VGA resolution with 2500 kbs and sound at 48khz.     The device went above and beyond on the music standards. The AV500 automatically sorted all of my music files into categories such as Artist, Genre, Album, ect. The music from the headphones sounds nice but the built in speaker comes up just a little bit short, a very little bit. The control of a built in equalizer was also a very nice touch.     One of the flaws that I came across was the USB host and what it could connect to. My deepest desire was to connect the AV500 to a portable USB hard drive and cut a corner to save me money from spending 700 dollars on the 100GB version but that plan failed. The AV500 flat out didn't recognize the hard drive. The Archos will however connect to a digital camera and a desktop hardrive but no portable ones.     The feel of the Archos (which I should have probably talked about at the beginning of this review) is that of a peice of solid metal except for those lousy buttons! The face buttons of the AV500 are the worst part of the whole device. I can't stop giggling them while I am watching my non-stop action movies.     All in all, the AV500 is the best gadget for your buck. It has it's minor flaws but the tought of overlooking them isn't really that bad. The AV500 out performed every single other pmp that I have tried and belive you me, my quest for the perfect pmp has driven me to nearly try every single one.  (...)

<Title>NEVER BUY AN ARCHOS PRODUCT!
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had problems as soon as I opened the box. The player keeps freezing during play, data becomes corrupt, the sound is of poor quality, and advertising up to 20 movies storage space is not possible. The most I could ever get on my player was 5, and that was when the playback quality was set on low. I tried to have it serviced just 2 months into a 1 year "warranty" and they said it was going to cost me $150.00 to repair. If you purchase this product, you will be sorry!

<Title>Great video but difficult to manage audio with non-WMP applications
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this little beauty for about three weeks now and have been very pleased with the functionality of the video recording and playback on the device itself and onto TV monitors. But for Mac or iTunes users I've noticed two major inconveniences--most annoying, with audio file management.  VIDEO: For Mac users, you may have to do a little research to find the best avi codec to be able to read your video files in QuickTime or VLC.  If you have a PC, it's a synch because it actually comes with the software that directs you to the right codec, but that's not a good enough reason to make your main system a PC.  One mediocre codec can be found at divx.com, but it's not as stable as I'd like in QT.  AUDIO: Archos is designed to sync with Windows Media Player.  Why, I don't know, but for those of us who are used to iTunes or even Winamp (like on my unreliable sony vaio), managing and playing music is a bit of a pain.  The biggest ouch is that it won't play aav (mp4) music files, which means you would have to convert these to mp3--potentially time consuming.  Secondly, I have been frustrated with trying to create multiple playlists on the Archos.  It might do this automatically when synced with WMP, but it doesn't sync with iTunes the way an iPod does, primarily in that it doesn't automatically create playlists.  I tried the plugin that Archos provides for iTunes and the dang thing read my external hard drive instead of the Archos.  Another really frustrating thing is that every time I want to make a new playlist from the music folder, I have to turn the bugger off for the previous playlist to go away.  Just not inconvenient or intuitive!  In terms of music management, Archos is no match at all for an iPod--IF you're an iTunes user.  I do still give this device 4 stars, though, because it's been loads of fun to do video work with.

<Title>Research proves itself
<Date>Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, so I spent A LOT of time researching different PVPs online and the Archos AV500 came up as top in its class.  Still, after all of my research, I was a bit skeptical in purchasing this device, as there were some obvious cons.  I took a deep breath and shelled out the $500 at a local retail outlet and have never been happier with a gadget as I am now.  This little device is tops.  A solid (i.e. metal) casing houses this PVP which is capable of not only audio and video playback, but recording of both as well.  The first thing I tested was the mp3 player portion of this toy.  Once plugged in via a USB 2.0 port, my computer recognized the device right away and it was as easy as dragging and dropping the audio files into the Music folder on the AV500.  In mere seconds I have loaded the AV500 with about 10 full CDs worth of music.  Unlike some mp3 players, the AV500 quickly (seconds) sorts through its new files after being unplugged from the PC.  My wife has RAVE mp3 player and it can take up to 5 minutes to sort through new files after you toss them in there.  The AV500 was waaaaaay faster.  Playback on audio files is a breeze with the easy to use nav buttons on the face of the AV500.  You can search by file name, artists name, song name, and even music genre.  If you're as anal about your mp3 files as I am, you've probably associated images of the albums to them.  Well, the AV500 will pop those graphics up on its 4 inch screen while playing the tune.  Playback features include random and repeat.  There is a built in, mini EQ, but I didn't mess too much with that.  I did notice that while playing back thru an outside audio source, such as through a car or home receiver, it is best to turn down the volume on the AV500 to about 75% in order to get the best playback.  I've read some reviewers who noticed some noise in the background during playback, but this seems to be avoided if you reduce the volume on the unit itself.  (It also helps if you properly encode your mp3s for optimum playback...don't whine and complain about hissing and background noise if you encode anything under 128.)    Now onto the video....Amazing.  The 4 inch (wide)screen does make this device larger than an IPod, but at the same time, this is not to be confused with a simple mp3 player.  This is a portable DVD player.  It took all of 2 minutes to hook up the AV500 to my DVR and start the recording process.  The TV docking pod acts as a gateway between your DVR (or DVD, VCR, cable box, etc.) and tv, allowing you set it up and forget about it.  Recording is as easy as plugging your AV500 into the docking pod and pressing one button.  I have yet to fool around with the timer options, as I have a home DVR for that purpose, but if I am watching something on my DVR and decide that it's a keeper, I can easily record it into my AV500 and watch it on the go, or even transfer it into my PC and burn it to a DVD.  One downside that I discovered too late was that the AV500 will not playback ITunes video files.  I realized this a tad too late, as I had already purchased and downloaded about 6 episodes of The Office.  Oh well.  The AV500 is 100% compatible with Microsoft's PlayForSure music sites, but the video offering on these sites is limited.  I also sprung for a car mount for the AV500.  $22 w/ s & h off of EBay...not a bad deal.  Other options that I have yet to play with include: TV playback - watch files from your AV500 on your television Remote control Picture viewing Video editing tools Playlist creation  The only cons I can think of are minor 1)	It would be nice if the buttons on the face were backlit.  Very tricky to maneuver in the dark. 2)	The inability to browse the AV500 files while listening to music.  The minute you try to do so, the music stops, but with the built in resume feature it quickly picks back up right were it left off. 3)	The inability to play ITunes videos.  Maybe one day in a firmware update they will address this issue.  All in all, this is a fantastic little gizmo that does a lot.  I know that PVPs are fairly new to the marketplace and with time they can only get better, but for a first generation device, this one does fantastic.

<Content>Yes, its bigger and heavier than an IPod,  but its worth it.  Add to it that you can use WindowsMedia Player to load and sync  your files instead of that stupid ITunes crap.  So much more control over my files. Music (and more) just the way I want it, not the way that someone else thinks I  want it.  I wouldn't trade it for a hundred IPods.

<Title>Archos knows how to make a great PVP
<Date>Tue Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>...or in this case a true "Mobile DVR."  The Gmini is an awesome device and the Archos AV500 is like it's slightly larger brother with a fantastic 4" widescreen.  It comes complete with a docking station giving it DVR  capabilities and it makes transferring video to this device extremely simple - literally plug and record directly to it.  You can record from DVDs or timeshift and use it like a DVR and record TV shows directly.  Personally I prefer converting the files myself as the video looked better than my first shot at direct recording from DVD.  This also comes with a nice custom case, and all the needed A/V cables.  Did I mention the awesome screen?  Excellent product.

<Title>Now THIS is TiVo to Go
<Date>Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product gets compared to the iPod Video a lot.  Well, I have both (actually my daughter has the iPod).  If you've got TiVo like we do (or any DVR), the Archos is by FAR the better unit.  Why?  Because it can record DIRECTLY from the video feed.  No messing around with transferring first to a PC, transcoding, etc...  The Archos lets you just plug into the TV and go.  And you can still transfer to and from your PC - very easily - if you prefer to watch there.  I can tell you from the nightmares I've had trying to move TiVo to the iPod that there's simply no comparison.  I'm not picking on the iPod - other PVRs (like the Creative) would have the same issue.  The Archos, as far as I know, is the ONLY unit that lets you skip the computer entirely - which avoids a whole lot of hassle.  It's also a very good music player (and picture viewer).  Yes it's a bit big - you wouldn't go running with it - but as my 'airplane solution' for music and video, it's awesome.  Quality is top-notch as well.  Just buy it.

<Title>Good product, poor service.
<Date>Fri May 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item a few month ago, at the time on Archos' webpage for this item it claims you can attach a digital minicam to it and record live video clips, I have other devices that does exactly what Archos AV500 does, and 80% of the reason I bought AV500 is because of the minicam.  After I got the AV500, made sure everything works correctly, I placed an order via their web store for a digital minicam, now a few month later they sent me an email saying they are not selling the minicam anymore. Now, I didn't exactly check their webstore everyday, but I doubt that the digicam for AV500 was ever sold in the U.S., yet they advertise that item as a feature of AV500 on the U.S. website. And they are still selling PAL version of the digicam all over Europe.  The charger mysteriously stopped working after a month, actually it'd work for about 10 seconds right after you plug it in, then it'd stop charging, I am no expert but it looks like there is a bad capacitor in there, I didn't bother to look for the warrenty papers, instead I place an order online for the charger, that item, too... took them literally months to ship.  I don't have any problem with that product, it just that without the digicam they cheated out of me, it's just another personal DVR like the others I have... now it's just sitting there collecting dust.

<Content>I love this thing.  It is just perfect for doing everything I want to do - to watch my shows where and when I want to.  It took a little time to figure it all out, but it wasn't very hard.  It is just like learning how to use your dvr and hooking that up.  If you have limited time and want to control your options, this is a good choice, and the picture quality is excellent.  I also recommend getting the travel cable, to increase your options.

<Title>They have a problem
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have purchased archos DVRs before and was looking forward to using the AV500. It is true that it has a very nice screen, and it plays the file types that I need. However, within a few days of purchase, the battery stopped taking a charge. After some fiddling, I reluctantly returned it to Archos. It came back after a few weeks, and I was very surprised to see that the content that I had on it was still there! What kind of fundamental repair was this, I wondered. In fact, the device exhibited exactly the same behavior as it had when I sent it out--literally nothing was changed. I reluctantly returned it again, and have been waiting six weeks for a fix. Their customer service is abysmal and keeps changing their story (next week, Christmas delay, etc.) I have now attempted to get a refund, and have been told by Amazon that my period for refund has expired. I have had the device for about two days in total and it hasn't worked, period. I am attempting to get a refund from archos and this really is not acceptable for a device this costly. Don't buy this.

<Content>I bought this 2 days ago and it does everything I wanted.  Record TV, playback onto TV, transfer files from my Digital cam, and rename, move, and delete files on the go, etc..  I love the fact that you can connect it to your computer as a hard drive and just drag and drop files.  I hated having to sync everything on iTunes.  But if you like syncing, you can with Windows Media Player.  You can also "browse" your music files and go through the folders as you have them created (if you did create them) or search by Artist, Album, Genre, etc.  I personally like the folders much much better.  Pictures/videos look fantastic with it's 4" screen and sound quality is great as well (I havn't yet bought great headphones to really test it).  The built-in speakers are nice and clear, but fairly week, so you'll need a quiet room if you intend on using it.  I did my research and this one appeared best for it's price (you can find it for $300).

<Title>DON'T BUY AN ARCHOS!!!
<Date>Sat Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product as a Christmas present for my daughter.  Within a month after Christmas the battery failed to charge.  I contacted Archos and had to return the unit and not just the battery.  I was also informed that I would probably not get the same unit back.  I received a different unit that contained the previous owners recordings.  This took approximately 2.5 weeks.  Ten days after receiving the refurbished unit back, the hard drive failed.  I contacted customer support and requested that I receive a new unit and not a refurbished one.  I was informed that that was probably not possible.  I find this pretty poor support for a product with a price tag as high as this.  Because I am beyond the 30 day return period from Amazon I have no choice but to work with Archos.  I would not recommend this product or any Archos product for that matter and would warn future customers to purchase a different brand.

<Content>A very beautiful and inteligently built mp3 and pvp. very sharp picture and colors are really great to enjoy but.........but bad and discouraging thing about it comes with a full sized remote without markings, u keep guessing which button does what function and the other thing is its disk type docking station and with that u can not stand straight your DVR on yr table or on top of yr TV or any other surface and in that case your remote wont take any command either and thirdly connecting cables for docking station to TV,VCR,DVD are so short u may need to put your docking station very close to out signals of TV,VCR,DVD or whatever to make it work and lastly battery life is 8 to 10 hours at the most and not as claimed 17 hours. If u buy it buy additional battery for sure...........I returned the item after 10 days, what will u do i wont comment.......very plus of it is quick and easy vedio or audio recording from any source.... and despite of all shortcomings I give it 4 star rating hoping that manufacturer will remove them which is very posssible to make it loveable of every one.

<Title>Great Device, especially for Dish Users
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my unit for about one year.  It's still going strong with no technical issues or problems charging the battery.  Because it's a hard drive unit, I would NOT drop it though.  This device kicks any ipods butt (making video ipods a joke) and for Dish Newtwork users, it rivals any Video unit including the Iphone as far as video options. Very few PMDs have the screen resolution of this unit either.  Those of you who have a Dish Network DVR will love this unit. All your standard definition TV recordings on your Dish DVR can be transfered to your unit 15X faster than playback time.  Instead of taking an hour to record an hour show into your unit, you can tansfer an hour show to your unit in only 5 minutes or less using your USB port.  I love using my Dish DVR to record new movies from HBO/Showtime, etc.  You can also record Sirius radio stations (I auto record Sirius Bests 36 for 2 hours nightly) to your Dish DVR and transfer it to your unit.  That's new Sirius music mixes everyday plus your own CD collection.  To my knowledge, these units are the only PMD that connects to a DVR unit through it's USB port.  This unit is the mid-sized unit.  It truly is a Pocket Dish in that it will fit in you pocket while still providing a large view screen.  The larger unit offers a bigger picture, but will not fit in a pocket, making it a little less portable.  The smaller size is portable, but with less view screen.

<Content>This is a way cool little player. I love the huge screen and 30gb is comparable to the Zune but will fill up fast. The controls are a little flaky, but all in all, great bang for the minimal buck. HOWEVER, I purchased a refurbed unit, which is probably all that's available, and the display went out within 1 day. Archos was good about warranty (save your proof of purchase), but the Amazon vendor (Big City Direct) was useless and took forever to respond. Either way, it was a week and a half before I got the unit back from Archos (paying shipping one way), during which time I kind of wished I'd picked up a Zune.

<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have owned and used this product for 2 years now and absolutely love it. In my personal opinion, this is the last of the best video players/recorders Archos ever made. After the AV500 series, Archos went the way of the Gen 04/05 series and a dearth of accessories, sad indeed. Back to the AV500. It handles all DivX files 3/4/5/6 (with mp3 audio), XviD and WMV. I use it everyday on the subway and it never leaves my laptop bag. One of my best likes is the fact that it uses a removable battery, regular mini-USB connector, comes with an assortment of extra accessories including USB-host cable, leather case, A/V cables, DVR dock.  Since it is a mass storage device, one can simply drag and drop. No proprietary software required and great for Mac users like me. At first, the user controls need some getting used to but once one is up to speed, it's like second nature. LCD screen is a marvel to behold and is very crisp. I always have people (even the iPod crowd) being wowed at the quality of the gorgeous 4 inch screen. Also, it is one of Cnet's highest Editor's choice gadget in its class.

Much better than keeping up with portable DVD players and discs.  Compact for travel.  I have only had it "freeze up" once and I just held the off button down until it rebooted.  Worked perfectly after that.  Highly recommend.  Hopefully price will come down as with all electronics that are new....still a good purchase.

<Title>Terrible Service
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought one of the (relatively) newest mp3 players on the market several years ago. It was a Jukebox Studio 20 from Archos. I wrote to them as I was experiencing some problems with charging the batteries and told them I used an Apple computer. They gave me a return authorization, I shipped it in, they charged me a fee for the fix, shipped it back (late per their initial promise, by the way). I wrote back saying I couldn't get the unit to work with an Apple and they simply replied that Apple's OS wasn't supported. I wrote back saying that I had specifically told them I used a Mac but never got a reply again... Maybe I should have reported them with the Better Business Bureau. You can save yourself a headache (and being robbed) by simply not buying any Archos products.

<Title>Great product...idiot proof!
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am not one to write reviews but I am so impressed with this product...i had to. I tried a TAVI and an Apple...I got so tired of wasting time downloading movies and trying to convert stuff...the Archos is so easy!..record straight from TV or DVD or download from something like Limewire and let Windows Media 10 do all the conversion for you! Music is great and the feel and picture are quality...I flew 7 hrs on a c-17 and watched two full length movies, a concert and listened to music and the battery was no where near done...I love it! HD tv recordings also look really good on the great screen...I spent two months rerading everything I could about pmas...tried two and am so glad I settled on this....try it out                                  Mark, Tacoma.

<Title>Wrong shop
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The device is, after users' reviews and description, really amazing, but I would like to talk about a seller: Computer Geeks. Recently I placed an order for this device using my wife's credit card (she doesn't have the medium knowledge of English I have, so she let me do transactions when they have to be done in English). Computer Geeks let buyers from many countries fill their purchase form, but then they may cancel the transaction giving no valid arguments. To get back the money they have charged in your credit card, is no easy job. I spoke with several of their operators. First I talked to Sarah and Stephany V, then with Ula Calderon, later with Marcia and finally with Jeff. When and how was my wife's credit card going to be refunded was mysterious. Operator Marcia said in 5 labor days, while operator Jeff said in 3 (the money was finally turned back in a longer period than both announced). Operator Ula Calderon tried to argue, that at Computer Geeks orders from abroad where not accepted, but in the select country box of their purchase form, they do include almost all known countries. Does this qualify as a fraud  or what? I suggest not to deal with this shop.

<Title>Best PVR for the Money
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an outstanding device and priced just appropriately. It is extemely easy to connect to a TV or DVR as I have mine connected to auxillary jacks from the TV set. The TV recordings are as good as my Scientific Atlanta DVR. The schedule component is also quite easy to use for recording future events. The key is to use the controls on the side of the device and verify the times input. I have not used the infrared device so I can not comment on this. For shows shown in regular TV format, by switching to maximize the video (in video format) from auto you can stretch the picture to fit the screen. With AXA DVD ripping software, I can easily rip DVDs to watch at a future date, which I did on our recent trip. Synchronizing with Windows Media Player is as easy as putting the DVD on the sych list and opening Windows Media Player. The screen is superb and the playback clarity as good as anything I have witnessed.   My family has owned four different Archos products and have never had any problem with the quality of the products thus I can't comment on their techicial support and problems folks have had with this. However, I would look past the idiots here who seem to post for every Archos product about the support and focus on what I consider to be the best PVR for the money available.

<Title>Fantastic and Useful Display
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read a review on CNET stating that the Archos AV500 didn't have as good a screen as the Creative Zen Vision 30Gb player. Closer scrutiny shows that there is much more to the story, however. For those of you choosing between these two major competitors in the personal multimedia player category, I'll summarize what I've learned in my research (leading me to buy the Archos AV500).  1. Archos AV500 has higher screen resolution than almost all current laptop computers. The AV500 has a 138 DPI (dots per inch) screen. The current Apple MacBook has a 110 DPI screen (looks gorgeous playing videos). Sony VAIOs tend to have 128 DPI screens, identical to the Sony PSP. If you like video on your PSP, MacBook, or VAIO then you'll definitely like video on the Archos. The Creative Zen Vision has a 216 DPI screen, but see additional points below.  2. The Archos AV500 has a 16:9 screen: perfect for widescreen movies. The Creative Zen Vision has 4:3 screen, so your nice widescreen movies will be little letterbox movies on the Creative. The Creative is best suited for TV shows, but these will display at almost exactly the same size on the Archos (with black on the left and right, as they would display on a widescreen TV). The Archose definitely makes the most of your video files since it displays TV shows at about the same size as the Creative, and does a much better job with movies.  3. The Creative has serious problems with limited viewing angle. You have to hold it just right to get a good picture, and even then many people report that the angle is so narrow that one eye can have a good view and another can see a slightly "silvered" view. The Archos is much more forgiving here, making it a lot easier to enjoy on a long plane flight and a lot easier to watch with a friend.  4. The Creative can't record. The Archos can; it can even record DVDs legally, working with the MacroVision copy protection on the discs you own. I was able to save about $130 on a device to record from my DVD player or DVR. I count that as a $130 discount on the price of the Archos.  5. The Archos is Mac and Linux compatible. The Creative is locked into one operating system (Windows XP) and won't even allow music and video files to be transferred when it's connected as a USB drive. This means that you have to use a bunch of proprietary software and drivers to get the thing to work: not a lot of fun if you want to use it with a friend's computer or if you're having problems with getting the software to install correctly on your system. The Archos can connect as a standard USB drive: universal access and no reliance on a bunch of proprietary software.  6. The incidence of the Creative freezing and requiring lengthy recovery procedures is fairly thoroughly documented in the Amazon reviews. The Archos appears to have a much lower incidence of problems.  So, if you're looking for a portable video player you may want to consider the above in making the choice. Obviously these points led me to the Archos. Your mileage may vary.

<Title>Love it.... so far
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So far so good.... I say that cause I had a bad experience with the Toshiba Gigabeat, which I bought first. I returned two of them and finally bought this unit instead.  So far, it's worked great.  I've loaded about 600 songs on it, over 1,000 pictures and recorded 6 movies straight from DVD.  I'm heading out of town this weekend on a long flight to the west coast so this will be it's first "test"   UPDATE:  Just back from my trip and it worked GREAT!  I watched a movie and listened to music the entire 4 hour flight and the battery was still going strong!  The picture quality is wonderful and I had no problems watching the movies that were copied direct from the DVD's.

<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Anything you have heard that is bad about this device...don't listen to it. I have been in the Computer Industry for over 15yrs and I was just amazed at this little device. Not sure where to begin with the details. I have converted 14 full length movies, 30 music videos, 3000+ photos and 300 MP3 files and I still have 11GB of data left I love the feature of being able to use it as a mass storage device which allows you to drop any file onto the device.  I ordered the device from Amazon, and it took only a day to get it. This was last week. That in itself is truly amazing...AMAZON YOU GUYS ROCK  Anyway, I have not had any problems with this device. The picture and sound is great. The earbuds that it comes with are not bad at all, as some reviewers have stated. The case is also not bad.  I have done quite a lot of research on products like this and would not trade this thing in for anything else. Not sure if any other device could measure up to this product.  To be honest with you all, this is actually my first ever review that I have written for a product. I just had to write and also thank Amazon for the great customer service.  Buy it today...you WILL NOT regret it

<Title>Best Purchase Ever
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the coolest gadget you can buy.  Don't listen to how "complicated" this thing is.  For myself, I concentrate on the TV recording and don't really mess with the other functions as much, which are plentiful by the way.  You can even transform this thing into a tiny camcorder if you buy the lipstick camera accessory.  I have had my Archos for several months and this is what I find to best way to get the most most out of it:  It is all about the TIVO.  I get my season passes lined up as well as any other programs I want to watch on the go and allow the recordings to pile up a bit.  Then on a Saturday or Sunday I will hook up the Archos and play the programs recorded from TIVO and record them directly back to the Archos.  Just hit record and come back to it every hour or two until you have yourself a nice collection of shows.

<Content>This is the best little device I have purchased ever.  In just a few days it has become my favorite electronic device even above my tablet PC.  It is easy to use, fits in my pockets, has great color & sound, and responds as soon as you touch the keys -- there's no waiting while the harddrive loads the movie/song.  If this was also a PDA with internet access & MS Office To Go, it would be everything you need to travel with all your videos, audios, photos & editable files in a tiny machine.  Until then, it is an exceptional little device for carrying your video & audio library with you wherever you go.  One note of advice is to simply copy & paste your video & audio files to the AV500 folder in Windows Explorer instead of syncing them from Windows Media Player as the instruction book suggestions--it takes a lot less time & effort (if the files aren't compatible, it will tell you).  This multimedia player is well worth the price.

<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Best picture on the market. The only criticism I have is that the control buttons are small and not user friendly.  They are not emperically comprehensible.  I have read that there is a newer model that adresses this problem, but hasn't solved it yet.  Still, to be honest, although easier to understand, the i-Pod controls were aggrivating as well with being too sensitive at times and at times not sensitive enough.  This model has buttons which I prefer.

<Title>Be prepared to be addicted!
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My son has a PSP and my wife has a video Ipod. I have been playing with both trying to decide what I wanted for a portable entertainment device. I then saw the AV400's at Wal-Mart. A friend pointed me here for the AV500 on sale for $299.  I've had it for two weeks now and I'm totally addicted. For the price, this is the best value for the money. While the Ipod may be easier to use in some ways, the AV500 offers so much more.  For $50 more than a 30GB video Ipod you get a storage device, DVR, voice recorder, music player and more.  The only draw back I have found so far is it is not small enough to wear on my arm or workout pants easily. I also wish there were more cases for these units.  I manily bought this to encourage me to workout more. I get very bored on the cardio machines, but when I can watch a tv show or movie time flies by.  If you are buying this unit and you have a DVR at home, I highly suggest you do not try and use the included TV pod and instead buy the $12 travel AV accessory. You can get it here on Amazon. I found my HD DVR and the included TV pod did not play nice together. The travel AV kit works perfect for transferring recorded shows from my DVR to my AV500.

<Title>NO RAW format support any longer!
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The following review is only interesting for photographer:  The main reason for me to buy the product was to backup and store photos from my Canon to a harddisk and have a fast viewer for the photos. I shoot the photos in .jpg and .raw format.  I upgraded my Archos from the former AV 420 which did support .jpg and .raw backup from my Canon, but the photo viewer was incredible slow.  You don't find any Information about storing the .raw format on your Archos... I bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really DONT support .raw ... I asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was NO, they decided against raw format.  Nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...  Thanks Archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like Creative.

<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an amazing device. Period. THe battery life, great. Screen, huge. The remote and built in speaker are great for watching a movie though the speaker isn't high quality and the remote is bigger than the actual player. The of course, there's the recording feature. If you have an up to date VCR or DVD player, it will work no problem. You can go to your public library, rent a bunch of movies and record them FOR FREE! The headphones that come with it are good quality. I especially like the volume control on them. The whole "playsforsure" thing is great. It works with limewire, so yopu can get all your songs free too. There's only one minor downside. It's that you can't listen to music and look at your photos at the same time, which is not an enourmous issue. It's big, but still fits comfortably in a pocket. THe pricetag is a bit large unfortunately. I bought mine for 300, and I wouldn't pay much more than that. Still =, if you get the right price this is a great product. If you're still not sure if you want to buy this, use a search engine to find online reviews of the AV-500.

<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was hesitant to spend the $299 for this unit and researched the pro's and con's for my teen daughter.  Just a week later I ordered two more, one for myself and my son at a slightly higher price, the previous seller was out.  These units are well made, well worth the price.  My other daughter has a creative Zen M video player, which is rated better by the techie world than the iPod and she's had several issues with that unit in the few months that she's had it... to the point where we will have to send it back to Creative to trouble shoot a problem that we have not been able to find a fixer for.  The archos AV500 is your best value with almost all the needed accessories included, the other 504/04 models you have to buy the extra's separately.   I would recomend that you purchase back up car charger for long trips... I have rarely used ours, but it's really convient since we have 3 players in the car and inevitably someone's battery is on the low side.  Look for a travel connector also.  We like to keep our docking pads in place to set up our recordings and have a spare travel cord in the car in case we want to show friends and relatives photo's or movies we've stored on our units from our camcorder or camera.  It is very easy to learn to use, so many possible uses... a great portable hard drive! Multimedia player. Excellent DVR. Buy it!

<Content>This product is great. It is so simple to put movies and tv shows onto the archos av 500 but when it comes to puting music on it, it's a different story. Windows Media player alone is a very frustrating but trying to get music from the media player onto the arcohs is more than just frustrating. It will eventually transfer but extremely slow and not all the songs will go onto the archos...

<Title>Good. Better. Best.
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you want a good Mp3 with features such as Music, Video and Such with big memory. Better buy this. What i like about this Mp3 is that the screen is super good. Good graphics can be shown. Really superb. Also the screen is wide enough. So movies you want to watch on the mp3 can be watched with good graphics. Also with it's good showing pictures, watching videos from the archos to the tv is an ease. Really nice video. As long as you got a good transferred video. What i don't like about the product is that you can't record videos ASIDE from the TV. Unless of course you buy the added optional feature that can be bought to record videos. When i bought this, i thought i could record videos while away from the tv with it. Too bad! Also the music is not that loud. When you want to listen without the earphones you can hardly hear the music even with the loudest volume unless you are on a REALLY QUIET room. Also before i bought it, i searched for things that can protect my device from scratch. NOTHING! Aside from the black leather case that comes with it. THat's it. Also to tell the device whether it is finished recharging is not cool. You have to look at the little hole and see if it's blinking to know if it is fully charged. When it is in the leather case, YOU CAN'T SEE IT! You have the flip the thing that covers it first. But with all those, you'll love the product once it reaches your door.

<Title>I LOVE MY ARCHOS AV500!!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I absolutely love my Archos AV500.  How can you go wrong, I only bought here on Amazon for $299.  My husband owns a 80G Ipod and the ARCHOS AV500 beats the Ipod hands down.  No comparison at all.  The coversion software I purchased for the AV500 also converts for Ipod and the resolution and compression is better with the AV500 than for the Ipod.  Of course, this is my opinion.  I purchased the AV500 for its ease of use for downloading pictures from my digital camera(s) so that I wouldn't have to lug around a lap top!  IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!  I also take cable classes from the local community college and recording the classes is a breeze. Its like having a mini-VCR.  The only regret I have is that its only 30G.  Now that I know what it can do, my next purchase is the 120G.  Signed, Happy with my ARCHOS AV500 in Hawaii

<Date>Sat Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As many of you have probably done, I have researched and read the few limited reviews I could find on this item, but finally i purchased it yesterday from the Sharper Image.  So far its amazing,  I did have the Archos AV420 but returned it because the battery failed on me.  The AV500 is truly an amazing machine.  The screen is so much sharper than the AV400 that it is indescribable.  You can record directly from your DVD player, VCR, Satellite or Cable Box, which I am doing as I type this.  I already put about five different cd's on the AV500 from my collection from Windows Media Player, and that took a mere twenty seconds for each cd.  Also, the AV500 displays the album cover for each cd.  The AV400 did not recognize many of the album covers that the AV500 does.  The "TV Pod"  is much easier to hook up on your tv than that of the AV400, and it seems that there are many less wires coming out from the pod.  The built in speaker is good if your sharing with someone else, but the included earbuds have very good audio quality.  In the case comes a user guide, 2 sets of audio and video cables, a USB 2.0 cable and USB host adapter, AC adapter and charger, Stero headphones, the TV cradle and IR emitter cable, Remote control with batteries, and the Protective Case.  All in all the AV500 is a must buy for anyone who likes music, photos, and videos.  I am in luck too because I am going to Washington in a few days which is an eight hour drive.  On average the AV500 probably will have about 4 hours of playback on the battery while on video, and 10 hours of playback for music, but I have yet to test that.  I am very happy i purchased the AV500 from The Sharper Image.  [...]

<Content>I got my Archos 500, I call it my little movie box, a few weeks ago and I love it. The picture quality is excellant, I enjoy watching the little screen more than a larger lower resolution TV screen, although it can easily be plugged into a Big Tv and watched that way also. The music sounds great and easy to organize. I definetely recommend getting the travel kit so you have a spare power cord because if you want to hook up to your computer you have to unplug the round pod thing and then noone can watch Tv while you have the Archos connected to your computer unless you move all the cords on the back of your TV- a real hassle! But as long as you get a extra power cord everything is then a breeze! Recording off the TV is so simple- just plug in your box and push record. I highly recommend this product.

<Title>The Archos AV500 Is A True iPod Video Killer
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It was a tough debate between getting (& keeping) an iPod Video 60gb or an Archos AV500. So, to effectively evaluate them, I bought both with the intention of returning the loser.   Look & Feel -  The Archos is built like a tank; no worries about easily scratched surfaces on this all- metal-sheathed beauty. Sure you need to treat it with respect, but you don't have to wrap it in a diaper like the iPod (actually if you decide to get an iPod, you need to go to (...)to fully protect it). The buttons & menu are attractive, functional & intuitive. It is very easy to use & best of all if you pause a movie you can automatically resume it the next time you power up as well as set up to 8 bookmarks for movies or music.  Performance -  With a 60% larger screen (than the iPod) that easily equals (& in some ways surpasses) the screen on the PSP, movies on this thing are GORGEOUS. It can easily play DIVX & XVID movies. Download "Lathe" to easily convert your movies to play on the AV500, just be sure to encode them at a min. of 1200 kbps for the best picture. I had to squint to see the image on the iPod, but that is most definitely not the case for the AV500.  Audio Quality -  The iPod surprisingly had a continuous "hiss" in the background as soon as it was turned on. Also, sadly, Apple doesn't give you the ability to tweak the audio other than with presets like "rock", "pop", etc. This, depending on the track, can crack & distort the sound in playback. The AV500 sounds BEAUTIFUL & rich with NO background hiss & the ability to tweak the bass, treble & bass boost as you wish without distortion. I do recommend a good set of headphones, I use the Apple In-Ear headphones which block out the world & let me drift away in musical (or movie) bliss.  Battery Life- In short, the iPod battery life for video SUCKS & wouldn't make it through a feature length movie. So if you want to use one for a long flight, you better plan on buying an external battery pack. The battery on the Archos has given me a good solid 5 hours of video playback time & best of all it is removable, so you can easily carry more than 1 battery.  Drag & Drop Convenience- This is a true drag & drop device. Just be sure to go into settings before you connect the USB 2.0 cable & set it to "hard drive" mode & you can easily & quickly transfer your movies & mp3s on to the unit without worrying about Windows Media trying to convert the file.  Overall- The people at Archos have hit a home run with this little baby & it is a true joy to use & beautiful to watch. If you are a movie buff this is the device for you. Pick up a leather Targus Micro Camera Case (item # DLMC00) for a couple bucks to easily carry this little gem with you anywhere & I can guaranteed you will be beaming with an ear to ear smile. Needless to say... it was bye bye iPod.

<Title>Excellent technique, poor quality and horrible service
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> I just bought my Archos 530. This is the second one I have after intensively using Archos 420 for more than a year. Technically, it makes some significant progresses: screen is gorgeous; the design is stylish and very compact.  However, I found some serious problems with the new one.  Each time when I plug the DC IN to the turned-off Archos 530, it turns on automatically (I do not touch any button.).   I can not turn off Archos 530 while the DC IN line is plugged (When I press and hold the "X" button, the screen turns off but the green "On" light is always on and I do not see Archos shut-down screen. Then when I press the "On" button, the screen turns on immediately without showing Archos starting screen.)  Meanwhile, when Archos is unplugged from DC IN, it can be turned on and off normally (like my Archos 420).  The most serious problem is the TV recording function. When Archos is researching for the input signal, it freezes constantly. The same thing often happens when I stop a recording by pressing the "X" button. And then, the only thing I can do is to unplug the DC IN line. Then Archos shuts down immediately. I lost the recorded program!  Of course, I pay attention to set video input parameters correctly.  I think there is maybe a hardware problem with my Archos 530, since I did the firmware update (now it runs with OS 1.2.20) but the over-mentioned problems remain.  Furthermore, the main touch button is not well fixed (it is slightly smaller than the hole reserved for it. This is very annoying since each time I press it, I do not know if the machine receives my order.  The worst thing is Archos company's Technique support. I sent them an email to complain these things four days ago. No answer! I already had the same experience with them when I asked them a technical question while using my Archos 420.

<Title>Review of the Archos 500E 30GB Dish Netowrk "PocketDish"
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This review is for the Archos 500E marketed as the "PocketDish."  The key feature of the 500E available from Dish Network retailers is that it can connect to "select" Dish digital video recorders (DVR) via a USB 2 port and transfer approximately 60 minutes of recorded programs in "about 5 minutes."  Here are my observations compared to the marketing statements made by Dish Network and Archos.  Transferring video from a Dish Network DVR equipped with a USB 2 port:  According to the Archos 500E PocketDish customer service office, only the most expensive High Definition Dish DVR is currently able to make quick digital transfers to the 500E via the USB.  There are plans for other Dish DVRs with USB ports to be able to do this in the future; but right now the feature is limited to only the most expensive DVR.  Record any Video Source:  I tried to record a major release DVD movie using the S-video cable, but the Archos 500E said that the movie could not be recorded because it was copy protected.  It's what I expected, but not what Dish and Archos would lead you to believe.  They lead you to believe you can copy ANY video source to the Archos 500E.  Download photos directly from your digital camera via a USB cable.  I tried this feature with both the 6 megapixel Canon Digital Rebel, and with the Sony W-1, a 5 megapixel digital camera.  The Archos 500E didn't recognize or allow photos to be transferred from either one.  Wide Screen.  Standard squarish 4:3 format video from will not fill the screen.  It will only use the center 1/2 of the screen.  The DVD movie I viewed through the S-video cable connection was confined to an even smaller area of the screen because it was a 4:3 letterbox format, so the small viewing square was further reduce at the top and bottom.  You would think the 500E would detect the widescreen type signal and expand it to fill the whole screen - but it didn't.  In summary, the 500E leads you to believe that it is a wonder player, and in most respects it is at the top of it's class, but what they don't tell you will probably disappoint you more than its positive points.  The user manual is small, and provides very limited detail about how to accomplish the most interesting tasks like the ones I mentioned above.  Call Archos customer service at 877-300-8879 to see if the key feature you want actually work BEFORE you buy it.  Pros: By many measurements, it's at the top of it's class as a portable video player.  Cons: It fails to deliver on it's most interesting features.  It's priced as if it can do all of the things it really can't.

<Title>Hard disk crashed
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Beware of your archos.  My Archos AV500's hard disk crashed after only 20 days of use, fortunately, i had copied all my photos from the unit to the PC just the day before.  I sent the unit for repair (at least 40 days).  Also, it didn't work with a Canon 20D for transfering photos, i have to use a card reader.

<Title>Don't let the bad reviews fool you! 
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my eye on the Archos AV500 for about a month now.  I'm a photographer and was looking for a portable device to download CF cards to while shooting events.  For the record, I am using an 8 MP camera and the files are around the same size.  I thought about the Epson P-2000 because of all the great reviews, but I really wanted something that would play movies since I travel a lot for my regular job.  I bought the Archos AV500 and tested it today.  True, this thing does not have a CF slot, but the USB cord can be connected to a card reader.  A CF slot would have been optimal and I can only hope they'll include it on future models.  However, I had no problems downloading my CF card to the Archos and then downloading the files to my computer later.  It will only display JPG and BMP files and not RAW, but it will show whatever files you've downloaded and you'll see that they are safe within.    Ok, so it passed the business reason why I bought this.  Now for the fun part.  The video on this unit is amazing!!  I almost didn't buy this thing because of the bad reviews noting how the Archos AV500 would not record DVDs, or the actual video size was smaller than the screen, blah, blah, blah....etc.  Not true in my experience.  I hooked up the Archos as the manual instructed and I was able to record two very, very new and popular DVDs no problem.  The image on my unit, anyway, almost fills the screen. There are settings to make the image fill the screen, but I didn't have to mess with them.  I think if you take the time to read the manual, you'll have yours recording and playing ANY DVDs in no time.  And for the record, my DVD player is probably 5 years old.  Buy the Archos AV500 if you can find one.  They're flying off the shelves where I live!

<Title>AV500 is great... when it works
<Date>Tue Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, I would like to say that when the AV500 is in working order, it is amazing.  I encoded all my video with XviD (after turning off stuff the player doesn't like, such as GMC and Qpels) using Gordian Knot and it plays back amazing.  The screen can get a little motion blur, but it is hardly ever noticeable.  For a device of its size, the picture is very sharp and clear.    Music playback is very nice with my Sennheiser headphones (encoded using VBR mp3).  I will say that the ear bud phones that come with the system sound fairly poor.  I don't like buds in general.  But, even compared to the ones that come with the iPod, they are sorely lacking.  So why give the AV500 three stars, you might ask?  Well, the first one I got was great.  That is until I noticed that after about 5-10 minutes of use, a bright horizontal, flickering band would appear on the screen every few seconds.  They told me it was a faulty screen and I got it replaced.  The new one was awesome for about 3 weeks.  Then, all of the sudden, the right arrow on my 4 way directional button stopped working.  I can now only navigate in the OS up, down, and left.  This is a problem, because it renders my Archos into a 450$ paperweight.  So now I suppose I will have to send this one back as well.  You can imagine the frustration.  Overall, the device performs well... when it works.  I think, however, Archos may have a serious quailty control problem.  People may want to be careful of this product.
