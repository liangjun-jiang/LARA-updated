<Title>fantastic iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just purchased my new nano from the apple store today and this new model is absolutely amazing! The size is soooooooo small and light, absolutely amazing! The screen is crystal clear with such high resolution.  The only complaint I have is there is just a tiny bit of "lag" as you scroll around and access the menu's and your music. Especially when browsing your music with "cover flow". Its a very minor issue and it's present in all the models I played with at the store.  This is definitely the best nano revision to date!

<Title>First iPod and I'm in love
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm new to the world of Apple and am so happy this is my first experience with the company.  I was amazed at the high quality of video of the new iPod Nano.  It's so clear and sharp.  The only problem I had with it so far was that it froze once in the two days I had it.  I held down the Menu and Center button down together for about 8 seconds or so and the iPod reset itself.  After that, it continued to play well.  Will see how it operates in a few weeks from now.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i just got my new nano a few days ago and i don't have any complaints except for the cover flow. i'm gonna need to spend a bit of time to get that organized so every single song is under an album cover, but it's not that important, it's more for show. also, the back is the polished stainless steel, so i put clear packaging tape on it (as a cheap cover) to prevent scratches since i just throw it in my backpack. i can't find any cases that i like, but it's only been out since September 5 this will have to do until i can get a hold of a clear plastic case. i love the large screen so i won't have to squint at the screen now (unlike what i had to do with the 1st and 2nd gen of nano)  i had a sansa before for a couple of months, but i got sick of that! i guess being stuck with my ipod mini for a couple of years got me so used to it. i gave the sansa to my boyfriend and just bought the new nano! i fell in love with it right when i saw it at the apple store and just bought it right there on the spot! it really is a great upgrade if you haven't gotten the 1st or 2nd generation nano.  if you're looking for an upgrade from previous (small) ipods, then this is  it! or you can save 100 bucks more for the iTouch or 50 bucks for the regular ipod.  wow people! stop complaining about the ipod nano not having a lot of storage space! it's a NANO! not a REGULAR ipod! it's a modified version of the big ipod! get it? and plus you should know the features on the product before you buy it. i don't have a 10,000 song library and movies and videos to store on a device, but if you do then get the regular ipod. so the nano is perfect for someone who just wants some on the run music.  i was a little surprised that they changed some of the colors from the neon colors to the more "calm" colors. but if all else fails, just get the black one. i got the red one to donate 10 bucks to fight aids in africa.

<Title>Awesome Nano with added Video!
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the blue Nano 8 GB 3rd generation Ipod this past Saturday at the Apple Store.  It did freeze up on me once but if you read the owners manual on [...], it tells you how to reset it.  I did as they instructed and it was working normally again.  It kept everything in memory and did not erase anything.  The video function is awesome!  You quickly forget you're watching on a 2 inch screen as the screen is so sharp, bright and clear.  Cover flow is so cool, although a bit slow but nevertheless it is a nice added feature.  Some album covers do not load in Itunes so will not download to your player properly.  This might be a glitch that Apple may address in a future software download patch (I hope).  If you are looking to purchase a Nano, I highly recommend the new third generation over the second, simply because of the added video feature and twice the memory for your money.  It is definitely worth it for the added memory alone.  Overall, more bang for your buck and a nice new cool look and interface, with an all metal construction.

<Title>I did shy away from Apple, now I came back...
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I previously owned a gen 5 iPod with 60 gig...I love it until the headphone jack went out, so I tried to fix it myself since I had it for good two years and didn't want to send it to Apple for half of what I had to pay for in the first place.  So I gave up iPod cold turkey, even when they came out with the 80 gig and 160 gig iPod, I never looked back...I also looked at other music players, they didn't feel the same...until I saw the new iPod Nano...so I ordered one as soon as possible, and yes I do have one already (ordered it straight from Apple).  It's more compact, I love the click wheel, great for people on the move, 8 gig is enough for people like me, new user interface, and the best thing about the new Nano is the video capabilities...for me it's no big deal, it's not my primary source for video playback, but it's just cool to have that feature...

<Title>Nano's keep getting better
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Nano is a nice improvement from the previous generation. The screen is big and bright, the battery life is excellent, and the music sounds good.  The video feature is nice to have, though 8 gigs and the small screen are not conducive to watching feature length movies or even TV shows. I use this feature to keep a few 1-2 minute videos of family and friends to watch now and then on the train to/from work. Plus, the new size makes it fit easily in the credit card slot of my wallet.  Also, this nano syncs nicely with Microsoft Outlook so I can quickly look up a phone number.  I give it four stars instead of five because of what I consider a design flaw--the headphone jack is on the bottom. This means that using the Nano at the gym on any of the aerobic machines requires either placing it on its side or upside down.

<Title>Too Cool Fool
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just picked mine up from CC bought it online and picked it up in the store. They didnt even have these out on the floor yet. This thing is great. Its syncs nicely and the screen is crisp and clear. I have a few tv epiosdes on here and about 300-400 songs and 100 or so pictures and about 7 movie previews from apple which is too cool. I still have 6.8 gigs of free space. The size is incredible its so small. The coverflow thing is cool even though it couldnt find some of the album covers from albums I ripped but thats a small price to pay as far as I am concerned. For the money its great and I dont need 80 gigs so this will work just fine for me.

<Title>3rd Generation Nano Freezes often (similar to the 2nd generation)
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own a video iPod, and have owned previous generation iPods, all of which I have found to be excellent products. I just recently purchased my first Nano (the new 3rd generation) and love the looks, size, functions etc.- a potential excellent product. However, I noticed that my new Nano often completely freezes up; always after syncing; sometimes while charging; and sometimes while just changing songs, going to the menu, etc. The only way I found to unfreeze the player is to do a hard reset. This is quite an inconvenience and totally unacceptable. I thought maybe I had bought a lemon and would simply return the product for a working replacement. However, after some research, I have learned that this was and is a common problem with the 2nd generation Nano. I haven't found much information regarding this issue from others who purchased the 3rd generation - most likely because it was just released a week ago. I plan to return the product and wait until the problem has been corrected. Once this is done, I will only have wonderful things to say about the 3rd generation Nano.

<Content>It is exactly what I wanted. Priced little bit more, but it is worth the money.   I am already feeling that I bought this at the end of 3Gen era, cuz new iPhones and iPod touch has come up now with huge memory.  Getting a feeling that I should have gone for them with little additional money rather than this nano.   Anyhow, I liked nano 3G. It is compact, light weight, clear sound, bright picture and Videos.  And, I can synchronize my Calendar and Contacts from my Outlook too.  I have subscibed to Podcast, and audio books, I liked to listen to it while I am driving.

My JVC car deck controls the i-Pod via a convertor. 12 hours, 160+ songs at CD quality sound and it's flash drive, easily reloaded from i-Tunes. My shuffle does fine MP3 with headphones while hiking- I can't complain. Nicely done on both products.

<Content>This product is good. It acted weird after the first week I had it. The images were all scratchy and then it wouldn't play my music for some reason. Anyway, I turned it back on after a couple of days and it just went back to normal. I don't know what happened, but it hasn't given me problems since then (about 3 weeks later). Then again, I had bought a used one...maybe spending an extra $20 or so to get a new one would be worth it!?

<Content>This was an upgrade for my daughter from her Zen Nano Plus.  The Zen Nano worked very well and has been very durable so I'm not knocking it (actually, I'm inheriting it).  However, this IPOD appears to have many features that allow greater flexibility and control.  It has been much easier to download music to as well.  I hope it will prove to be durable as well.

<Title>A very good product!!
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own black Ipod Nano, my first impressions are very positive.  My biggest concern before buying were colors and sound quality, this is my first ipod. I bought black ipod because I didn't like how silver looked like and wasn't sure about other colors. This black I didn't like at first but I'm getting used to and beginning to like it. Its is not glossy and shiny black like other apple products. Under normal light, it turns to gray black(lighter shade of black).  My advice is go to Best Buy or other stores that carry these nanos and check them out in person before you buy them online, if you're buying online.  Sound quality is good, more towards average. I have owned other and cheaper mp3 players, the sound quality of nano is not any better, about in the middle I would say. Its very good, but in comparison to some other cheaper players, Nano doesn't stand out at all. But this is just my experience.   I have known this before I bought it, so I bought it for couple other reasons. I was already using itunes software, and you can't beat reliability and build quality of these nanos. Just go to store, other SMALL flash players look like bricks compared to nano. And itunes software is pretty good when it comes to syncing your nano, I have used others.  I experienced one issue though, my nano froze. Just like Microsoft Windows would freeze, so did my nano. No problem, just press Menu + Select buttons to restart the nano. So far I only experienced this once, other then that, I'm very pleased with nano's performance. It's a great buy! Some people don't like new shape of this nano, but personally I think its better than older nano's. It fits into my pocket nicely.

<Content>Ok, I'm in my mid 30's and this is my first ipod I have ever bought.  I figured instead of all hundreds of CD's I have I would get an ipod and download them all and get a plug to plug them into my car.  Well, I don't have the plug yet for my car and I just got the ipod in the mail yesterday.  So I download itunes and put in some CD's and even bought a few songs but everytime I wanted to add new songs it seemed like I had to sync them all over again.  Am I going to have to do that whenever I add any new songs??

<Title>My First iPod!
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first iPod ever.  Before this, I owned the Archos Jukebox 2000 which holds 20GB.  This 8gb Nano blows that other heavy hunk of junk away.  The nano is quiet, small, thin, lightweight, plays everything seamlessly, and is a breeze to use.  If you're buying your first MP3 player ever, I definitely recommend the Nano.  It is really worth every bit of the 199 I paid for it.  The screen is beautiful.  It's very bright and crisp.  Cover flow is awesome, although I don't use the cover flow as much as I use the "artist" listings.    Compared to the 2G nano, the new 3G nano has it beaten hands down.  3.5mm thin!  I mean, if you carry it in your pocket, you can hardly tell it's in there.    I really bought the new Nano to occupy me until the Touch comes out and it's doing just that.  I'm plenty occupied and satisfied!  BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A GREAT IPOD WITH GREAT FEATURES FOR THE MONEY!

<Title>Buyer beware: output to TV is now disabled... otherwise great iPod!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned two models of the 5.5G video iPods (the 30 and the 60GB models) and have been very pleased with them. I'm a teacher, and I use them for playing videos in class--so much better than DVDs! I was tickled pink when I heard that the new solid-state flash-based nano would include video; I bought it the first week because the school year was starting.  Well, I bought too soon. It seems that without disclosing the change to customers, Apple has locked the "TV Out" feature, preventing users from outputting iPod content to their TV sets. When you go to the Videos > Settings menu and bring up the "TV Out" option, toggling it on/off is now unresponsive, showing only the word "off." When locked, video content will display on the iPod's screen, but not on your TV or portable display accessory.  According to the guys on the tech support line, the only way to turn this feature on is if you connect your iPod to a device with an "Apple authentication chip" built in, or buy the soon-to-be-available Apple video cables that will work with the new iPods and will sell for a shocking $49, plus shipping and tax.  Quite a blow to this long-time hardcore Apple fan and defender. It strikes me as underhanded. Perhaps if they had made it clear in the pitch that a $50 cable would be required to play to TV, I would have still made the same choice, but as it is, I feel, you know, tricked.  That issue aside, the nano is as cute as a button, and the little screen looks great. I will refresh this review in a few weeks when I have had a chance to put it through the paces.

<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had all 3 nano versions from the 1st to the 3rd (current) generation. This new nano is incredible. I mean 8 gigabytes for only $199 with high resolution video and new user interface. It's very bright, thin and weighs only 1.76 ounces. The screen is 2" which is small for viewing long periods of video but for short stretches like 30 minutes its great. Battery life is awesome too. Only small downside is that it doesn't fit into the small little blue jean pockets any more since its wider but who cares? Definately worth it.

<Content>My 4th generation 20 GB took a dive the day before this was released.  I love the new Nano.  The size is well, very small.   The display is great, photos look good, haven't tried video yet.   Menu is almost exactly like my old ipod they just added video, and photos.   The cover flow feature?  WHO CARES! Its a music player.   I'd say the only downer is if you have an older Mac you'll have to updrade to OS X 10.4.8, I had to buy the newer OS and 10.4.8 is not much diffrent from what I had (10.3.9).  It's wierd there must be some integration of the newer OS into the new version of iTunes.

<Title>Great small Ipod, well worth the video
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Nano came with a cradle adaptor, not so good earbuds that you should immediately upgrade, and the USB iPod cable, all bundled together.  The dimensions of the new video iPod Nano vary that much from the old one. The unit measures 2.8 by 2.1 by 0.3 inches, with rounded edges and a a very nice brushed metallic finish  I think the look is great and like it far more than I expected.   Cover Flow was not great on the nano. Not much CPUs to push the graphics but good enough for the size and gave a very nice color view of all my music.  Amazon would not ship the nano to my APO address in Afghanistan but I sent it to my APOBox.com address and Amazon was able to ship it fine.  I almost went for the Touch, but did not want to wait and its smaller size is better at the gym.

<Title>Still some bugs....
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this a week after it came out, and any smart buyer will tell you not to buy the first wave of new items, especially on electronics. Apple are still the kings of digital music, yet even they couldn't get ALL the bugs out at first. Here's my reviews...  1) The thing I liked about the 2nd gen. was the casing. Full aluminum, so very little chance for scratches. This reverts back to the 1st gen nano style, yet with an aluminum front. why not go all aluminum? 3 stars  2) Video playback is awesome. The larger screen is an improvement, and it is much sharper. 4 stars  3) The backlight can now be adjusted, and can be brighter or duller. 4 stars  4) The cover flow is awesome, yet if you have a lot of music, the album covers take a little time to load. 3 stars  5) The player tends to freeze a little after extensive use. This can be esily rectifeid by resetting it. 3 stars  6) The price is great. I paid 200 for my 4 gig nano, and 200 for an 8 gig nano video. 5 stars  7) Transferring files seems to go faster. 4 stars.  Over all, 4 star review. This is based on personal experience after only a few days, and even with the few gripes, I am still very satisfied.

<Title>An improvement in every way
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Video Nano has improved in every facet over the second generation Nano. As you know, the interface has Cover Flow, the display has increased pixel resolution, and the video is a welcome addition. Lastly, unknown to the public, the audio quality has improved.  The reason I give the Video Nano four stars and not five is because the improvement in audio quality is not significant enough. There is background hiss, and the second generation Nano's audio clarity was poor to begin with.   As you know, the product is excellent. However, it is NOT outstanding. Apple should focus on the basics of what makes an MP3 player outstanding. Its ability to play MUSIC for an audiophile's ears should be present, considering this Nano is the third generation of this line. Sometimes when Apple crams so much functionality into one device, it's possible to forget what is being bought in the first place. One reviewer mentioned that the iCar will be next. How about the iPhone/Fax/Microwave/Coffeebrewer?

I like the design, it's very small and light easy to carry...wonderful product from Apple....just one more thing....they should give more thing inside the product...because it a little expensive that we have to pay extra money to buy armband and something else.

<Content>Even a 65 year old, with some patient help from the grandchildren, can learn to truly enjoy this amazing technology.  This is a real musical treat.

<Content>I guess my review is kind of tainted because our ipod was defective.  It froze up all the time and we had to send it back.  The return process gets 5 stars from me though, as it was very easy and painless.  Disappointing also, was the fact that we lost all of our downloads which was worth $25 or so.
