<Content>Once you have loaded images into the drive it works very well. The pictures are crisp and easy to see. You can organize pictures in folders which is useful but not initially intuitive to do. It gets easier with more use. A major complaint is that the drive does NOT accomodate all cards. For instance to use a memory stick duo, you must have a CF adapter. Problem...they are very difficult to find, if you can  find one! Sony has discontinued them. Some other brands are available but not in USA markets. In addition the adapters are quite expensive. I found this misleading and problematic given one of the cameras we use. The newer units may take care of this but at a higher initial purchase cost

<Title>Unimaginably slow

<Content>I use a Canon 5D and shoot RAW. The files are 12-15 megs each, so they eat up the 8GB of flash fairly quicky. I got this viewer for a trip so I could in effect have 10 8-gig flash cards of backup. On the very first transfer I realized I can't live with it -- it took this device 2.5 hours (!) to import the photos. Once the data was in, the battery was nearly dead.   When viewing files, it takes maybe 15 seconds to populate one screen (about 12 thumbnails) with data. Until that happens the thumbnail slots are blank, so you can't quickly find what you need. Even once cached, it takes several seconds to draw a screenful of thumbnails. For a dedicated device the size of my camera, I expect it to be at least as fast! Instead, it's lethargic. To import 22 RAW files, it took more than 5 minutes -- 14 seconds per photograph, or less than 1MB/sec. What is it doing with all that time?  When viewing RAW files, it only shows the JPEG ewmbedded in the RAW file, so you get no zoom at all. For that, you have to select Jpeg+Raw in the camera, which is a feature I avoid, because it results in twice as many files on my computer, and nearly half the space on the card. I tried that mode, and of course the Epson now takes twice as long to build the thumbnails, and since you now see two identical thumbnails instead of one, you lose half the screen. One thumbnail is zoomable, the other isn't. What Epson should have done is detect that there are two files with the same name, but different extensions -- .cr2 and .jpg, and by default displayed only the .jpg. What photographer would want it any other way?   All in all, this device is just not usable for the high volume of photographs it was designed for.

<Title>Problem with WA compact flash cards
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Epson has admitted to me that all their storage devices have problems with loading WA cards e.g. Lexar 133x, Told to watch for a fix.
