<Title>Mostly Good - a few flaws
<Date>Sat Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>My 3rd MP3 player (IJam and Rave2200) Good Points: reasonable price with FM mode and memory, good sound quality, remote control allows full control of unit. Minor Flaws: a bit large (compared to the Rave2200), remote a bit bulky and the buttons on remote are somewhat difficult to use (accidental pressing buttons is very easy), mostly plastic parts - not metal as advertised, highest volume level could be louder.  CONs:Equalizer is useless, all EQ modes make sound muddy, 3D mode is terrible, huge distortion.

<Title>Great Value
<Date>Tue Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I am very happy with my new MP3 player.  I love this thing.  It's so light-weight I'm taking it everywhere.  As a student, being able to record 4 hours worth of lecture is a must-have feauture.  I've tested this out and I was pleasantly surprised at how clear the voices were recorded. <p>One complaint I have is its use of AAA batteries.  I think they chose AAA to save some weight and size.  I wish that Sam Sung chose AA batteries instead so that I don't have to keep recharging my little AAA batteries (every 2~3 days).  <p>Get this MP3 player.  I highly recommended.  You should also get the 64mb Smart Card for additional memory.  You'll get so hooked on this thing that 64mb of memory it comes with just won't be enough:)

<Title>Mac Users: Ignore the Editorial...
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this MP3 player whilst in America, as it is unavailable in the UK.  Compared to the paulty, overpriced offerings in the UK, this MP3 player is fantastic.<p>After ordering it, I returned to the Amazon editorial review, and became worried when I read that it didn't work with a Macintosh.  I own an iMac.  However, this turned out to be incorrect.  The player's software CD comes with a Mac explorer that works fine, and I have been copying tracks with typical macintosh ease.  There is currently no OSX version of the Explorer, but Samsung do provide updates on a dedicated web site, so I imagine there will be a version available soon.<p>As for the features, OK so the radio isnt all that great, but MP3s sound perfect, and you can fit an hour onto this player easily (at 192Kb encoding).  My advice, though, is to purchase an additional 64Mb card, for two hours of music.  And anyway, it does look very cool...

<Title>AWARD FOR ERGONOMIC DESIGN AND PERFECT PERFORMANCE
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Maybe most of us music freaks are more interested in the sound quality: With the Techno Yepp [ASIN B000059RAB] you will get it (as well as with the MINI Yepp [ASIN B00005B4BS] which I owned before I purchased another product from Samsung). MP3 is MP3, i.e., the sound quality should be 'original' and it is. There are 4 equalizer modes NORMAL - CLASSIC - JAZZ - ROCK and each of them can be &quot;topped&quot; with the Surround 3D sound effect by just pressing the 3D button.<p>I personally like Voice Recording/Playing very much. The built-in microphone catches more than I expected (I used it even in a courtroom and got a &quot;digital transcript&quot;. Legal? I don't know.) Since I was able to apply for a free 32 MB SmartMedia memory card (limited offer June 1 - July 31, 2001) I will have enough space for Voice Recording, some of the recorded files will be used to send later as E-mail attachment.<p>Downloading files TO and FROM the Techno Yepp is fast and easy using the Yepp Explorer Software or Realjukebox, both to install from the CD-ROM disk. Yepp Explorer is just how a software should be: Load it - use it - period .... but make sure Techno Yepp is connected bcause Explorer will look for!<p>The Remote control with FM radio receiver that has 5 presets is a nice &quot;add on&quot; but should be called &quot;FM radio receiver&quot; and not more. It's true, you can control Techno Yepp with all the buttons on this hexagonal shaped FM radio and you may even show-off with the backlight LCD, but all these, FM radio tuner and backlight are powered from the two AAA batteries located in the Techno Yepp. I would rather like to have a lower price or more built-in memory instead of this FM radio which will eat up the AAA batteries faster. But for a hiker or bicyclist the remote control unit may be very useful (also as an &quot;extension cord&quot; for the quite short earphone cable).<p>Most of all I like the ergonomic design of the Techno Yepp. I can hold it in my left hand and operate all the functions easily. Feels good - looks good - sounds good. I would buy it again.

<Title>GREAT!
<Date>Sat Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I wasn't sure of which mp3 player to get because this is my first time buying one, but then my friend told me about it. She said that she had a Sumsung Yepp, so I got it, and I have no regrets! I don't really like buying cd's so I just download the music online, and I'm on the go. I take my Samsung YEpp with me EVERYWHERE. It's so light, I can hardly tell I have it around^^

<Title>Great little toy with a few drawbacks
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>All in all this is a great player. The worst thing about it is the headphones. I guess I have small ears because they don't even fit inside. My husband said he wore them for one hour and they hurt his ears so bad he threw them out. We had to run out and purchase a better headset. Also...the FM tuner is a separate entity that attaches by a cord to the player. Don't be fooled by the size because now you have to have 2 things clipped to your belt. That was a big disappointment. It never said that anywhere!

<Title>Good with a few flaws
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This mp3 player has it all.....for a low price. But it has a few flaws.<br>1)The max. volume is too low. (This is helped with buying a better pair of headphones.)<br>2)The door for the expansion card opens all the time. If I clip the player to my shorts to workout, the door opens five or six times. 3)There is no auto-turn off after all the mp3 files play. So If I fall asleep while using it.....I wake up to find the batteries dead. 4)The buttons are in strange places.<br>5)The batteries die all the time, so buy a recharger.<br>Nothing else wrong with it yet. But overall I love to use it all the time. It can hold 20 songs and with the 32mb expansion card I get another 10. For the money it is the best buy I have seen.

<Title>Great player.
<Date>Tue Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Buy this one!  After months of procrastination, I ended up with this player for one reason.  It was on sale at a local electronics store.  After months of use, I am appreciating the features, ease of use and reliability of this player.  Sound quality is excellent, the included software is complete; with out hiccups, it can hold over thirty tracks on the 64 Megs of flash memory.  What else do you want or need?  The USB data transfer is fast and clean, and you have sound modes that actually work without the need for complicated (and time consuming) equalizer settings.
