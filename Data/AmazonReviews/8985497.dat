<Title>Handy little player!
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Would love to see this come out in a larger size with a slightly stronger clip spring. But, as it is, it works as expected. I can clip it on the back collar of my shirt, or more often the back of my baseball cap. The backside of the clip is slim enough that it doesn't become unfomfortable. Battery life could be a little longer, but I'm already looking to get another one of these because I haven't seen anything nearly as hands free and adaptable on the market. Way to go Coby!

<Title>great alternative to the shuffle
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>costs less than one third of the price of the shuffle with all the features.This is a pretty good player i bought it for when i go biking and it has done its job well but the reason im giving it four stars is beacause it takes a while for it to go from one song to another and it will freeze up occasionally(to prevent it from freezing up let it load about 5-7 seconds at start-up) other than that everything else is pretty good it gets pretty loud even with the headphones that are included it is very durable and it definitely worth the 25 dollars.

<Title>Not Bad
<Date>Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted a little MP3 player to wear around the house while I was cleaning.  This fits the bill, and I love the clip on feature.  I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that the volume doesn't get terribly loud.  Also, I don't like ear pods because they tend to fall out of my ears.  I thought I'd just swap a pair of regular, "walkman" style headphones, but they won't fit.  Too big.  Come to find out these are 2.5mm headphones.  It does come with some sort of adapter, but I think that's for even larger headphones, so it didn't work with what I had.  All in all, it's a nice little player for $25.  I suppose it's probably better that the volume doesn't get so loud (better for your hearing), but I still like my music kinda loud.  Now I'm on the hunt for a pair of 2.5mm headphones that fit over your head and have a volume control on the cord.  Not a bad deal overall.

<Title>No frills, but does the job.
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As stated elsewhere - not bad.  It is smaller than I expected, literally not much bigger than your thumb, and very lightweight.  Still, it has stood up to the heavy handedness of an 8 and 10 year old for a week of post-Christmas play. It hooks to your computer with an included USB adapter, which means another small part to potentially get lost.  Funny, but we bought this one together with the black one (same model), and the black one had a 3.5mm headphone jack.  Identical in every other way.  Sometimes your headphone plug comes a little loose and suddenly you can't hear anything thru the earphones until you jigger the plug back in.  Has rechargable battery that is charged when the unit is plugged into the USB.  Simple plug and play, no software to install.  Drag and drop files in Windows explorer, or WMP recognizes it as a device.  Make sure the Hold switch (the little switch on the side with a picture of a padlock) is off when you try to sync or you'll get a disk error message. An "okay" player for an okay price.

<Title>Terrible product, did not work, and company unreachable.
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this item for my son, and it did not work right out of the box.  I followed all the terrible instructions, and it still did not work.  I went to the Coby website for answers, and there was nothing there either.  I then attempted over 20 tiems to contact Coby via telephone, and was never able to get through.  I finally returned the product for a different bran.  I STRONGLY suggest buying something else with a longer battery life. and MUCH better support and documentation.

<Title>Very disappointed
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he is so disappointed that I didn't choose something of higher quality.  I read all the reviews and thought it sounded like a good first mp3 player that he could use to work out.  At first, I couldn't download his music onto it at all, which turned out to be a simple thing: there is a button on the side that locks the player, which is not mentioned in the enclosed guide.  The headphones started to cut out within a day, and if you wiggle the wires it goes in and out.  The control buttons are loose and move in different directions, sometimes getting caught under each other.  After 2 uses, it quit, and only works randomly.  I am returning the product and will go for a real ipod next time.  (We also use itunes, and it has been a pain to transfer our music to another program.)

<Title>fine non itunes player
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For $15 the sound is surprisingly clear, the ear buds, the controls, & the # of songs (up to 500) are all fine.  The item has to be clipped down otherwise it slips off.  A worthwhile buy for the gym.  Not for someone who needs to select which song to hear - it has two functions: random or order you loaded the songs from your computer.  The big negative: your computer has to stay on for 4 hours during the initial charge; if the computer goes to sleep the player stops charging.  Same for subsequent charging.

<Title>Good on price short on features
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a nice little mp3 player, it has decent memory and good sound. However it does not allow fast forward or rewind or tell you what track you are on. For the price not to bad though.
