<Title>Complicated
<Date>Fri Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 Player is not user friendly.  The sound is good.  I like the lock feature and the headphones but I find it confusing and complicated to use all the features. Especially the main menue.

<Title>Great little MP3 player
<Date>Mon Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: + Sound quality is awesome. + Great headphones. + Transfer speed is FAST! + Choice of 3 backlights. + FM Reception is good. + Line in recording is excellent. + SD expansion feature. + Excellent battery life (15+ hrs) + The FM transmitter is a nice little bonus, however I have not tested it myself.   Cons: - This thing is supposed to have a resume feature, but its rather complicated (pause song first and then switch off, to resume go to the same song and press play) - Controls aren't that intuitive and might take a little getting used to. - The shape. Its sort of awkwardly shaped. It feels good in your hand, but if you put it in your pocket, it looks like a strange bulge. - It doesn't seem to support more than 2 levels of folders. Hopefully RCA will fix that with a new firmware. - No color screen. But hey, what do you expect for 50 bucks? - 256MB is kinda on the lower side, but you can remedy that with one of those cheap 40 dollar 1GB SD cards. - I have read in other reviews elsewhere that the FM transmitter does a bad job is places with a congested radio bandwidth.   Bottom line: Excellent little player with great sound quality for everyday use. Well worth the price!

<Title>Point of clarification
<Date>Mon Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't own this player yet (am ordering one) but wanted to point out that the manual (available from rcaAudioVideo) states that 512MB is the maximum-sized external card that is supported - so I suppose 768MB is the total maximum memory on the device at any one time.  Still, with the line-in recording feature, this seems like a good deal.

<Title>Expanding MP3 player is amazing
<Date>Mon Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've shopped for several months and found this little unit to be everything I wanted in an MP3 plyaer. Expandable with SD memory, what a great idea. The cards allow my daughter and I to share the unit with each of us have our own library on SD. We can transmit the songs vith this unit to our car radio, and also record from the internal FM radio.   I took mine with me to Greece and recorded music over there that I've never heard before. Now it's part of my collection, thanks to the Lyra.   Con: It eats battery life, so use rechargables, and keep them ready. Alan

<Content>I have really enjoyed this mp3 player.  To my ears it has very good sound quality.  I did replace the original earphones with a set that was more comfortable to wear than the original set.  The FM tuner works great.  I have recorded several songs from my local radio stations with it.  I now have 3 512 MB SD cards with my favorite songs on them.  Oh yeah....that little battery lasts and lasts.

<Title>many pro's, a few cons
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player for about 4 months now, and have tested it thoroughly.  For the price, it can't be beat.  I give it 4 stars because has a few negative aspects but it's so much better than anything else out there, I recommend it wholeheartedly.  It has many more features than almost every other player.  It's almost impossible to get SD expandability, let alone voice recording, FM radio and recording of FM radio, line in and recording of line in in another player. It plays practically every format.  You can use WMA compression, which allows you to get a LOT of songs on the player.  Who needs the headache of being limited to a specific iTunes format by Apple, and who needs or can afford 15,000 songs on an ipod? You can also use it as a general memory card reader also.  I've copied documents and pictures onto the player.  Of course you can't view them on it, but it's a good feature to have. I bought one of these for a couple of family members and they love it too.  Now of course, nothing's perfect, so I should explain the not so good..  The Con's-  FM transmitter is worthless.  Have an audio shop install an audio jack to your car stereo.  you'll be much happier.  No resume function.  If you are listening to an audio book and you turn the player off and turn it back on, it doesn't remember where you left off.  That's pretty annoying.  Extremely slow with larger SD cards.  Even though the player claims to support up to 512MB SD only, I have successfully used a 1GB and a 2GB SD card, and it works fine. Over 1GB doesn't show up in the mem usage field accurately, but you know can tell how much memory you have used and free when you plug it into your computer.  The biggest downside to using a larger card is the painful wait time when booting up.  With a 2GB 133X SD card, it takes 45 seconds to boot, before you can do anything.  With a 1gb card, about 25 seconds, With a 512 card, about 10 seconds.   The packaged earphones are junk.  Do yourself a favor and get a decent set.  I bought the Westone UM-1, and am very pleased.    The menu is a little confusing, but you get used to it.  It's relatively slow to scroll through albums, artists, songs, etc., but I'm in no hurry.  Overall, highly recommended!

<Title>Stopped working after 3 months
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I fell in love with this MP3 player. It was small, so convenient, great sound etc. It just stopped working one day. It just won't turn on. I've changed the battery but to no avail. Now I have a useless little piece of plastic that I cant return or fix. $50 for 3 months of music!
