<Content>I think this is great, I first saw it in a PC magazine review and then had to buy one. This is my second Since my daughter just "had to have" my first one. The little one inch cube packs a lot of features into a small space. You'll forget you are wearing it because it is so small. The cube mp3 player charges via the USB cable (Included) that connects into the headset plug. Initial charging time is 3 hours. After it was charged I copied several WMA files onto the flash memory drive of the player. It was not lighting fast, but acceptable.  The sound quality is very good There is also a sound boost option in the music menu to enhance the output. Additionally 6 equalizer settings are available to choose from, plus a user definable equalizer setting. the overall quality for a device this small is GREAT. The features, the sound quality and the user interface all make a great impression.   Did I mention how cool this unit looks?

<Title>Too bad about the display
<Date>Tue Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband is a techie and after reading the review in PC magazine decided I had to have this for Christmas. The first one didn't even start, so thecompany replaced it (after about a month) with another piece of junk. It's really cute, but the display is faulty at best. Usually, when I turn it on, it seems like an old TV with the V set way off. There's no way of tracking it to hold still, so it bleeps or just spins by quickly. I have to turn it on and off up to twelve times to get a steady screen that will let me move through my playlist. After three months, it's now started the curious little trick of just restarting itself or else the buttons stop working and I just have to wait for it to play its own battery out. Luckily, the battery isn't all that great, so it usually dies after about five hours.     All in all, I am wholly unsatisfied with this product and reminisce about my old 256 mg Creative Rhomba. It's a pity the recharger cable was so weak, otherwise I'd still be using that without the hastle of the cube which is such a cute little pain in the butt.

<Content>It is a very nice MP3 player.. It has voice recording and other stuff, but I have never used that.  I had a small issue with a firmware going out (probably me unsafely pulling it out of the comp when downloading).. took 2 minutes to fix by updating it with their software.   I love this thing.

<Content>pros: very bright and easy to see screen. great sound as well. easy to use for first time MP3 player buyers.  cons: battery life is shorter then I would have hoped. also you have to skip to get to the song you want to hear (no scroll). tips: you should buy the adapter for outlets, its very easy all you have to do is plug it in and it charges.              i hope this was helpfull to you!
