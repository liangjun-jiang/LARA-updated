<Title>it can't be better!
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got one! it's just awesome on video playback, awesome! my friend insist that i should compare it with PSP, but here is my point: it's about two third thickness of old 60G, and it has 2.5 inch screen, it play awesome video. what else you want from an iPod?! To be honest, I gotta say that the video playback even clearer than most computer screen. No block at all!  But there are several thing to remind you, there is no POWER Adapter in case, and they trade off a like-leather case. check the size of the new iPod, i don't think any solid old iPod case fits perfectly.  New iPod has screen lock function, like chubb lock. that's interesting! Since i just got it less than 2 hours, i can't give more information about the battery or other new functions. But, no doubt, it fullfills me really well. Take it, it will never turn you down!

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my fourth iPod and definitely my favorite, it's a great player and I love the ability to be able to watch videos.  I'm not bothered by the fact that they left out the charger block as I already have two, plus you don't really need one.  For everyone who is considering getting on or already has one and doesn't know how to convert video to it here's a short guide (assuming you already have video on your computer, from wherever).  Ok, very easy, the PSP uses the exact same video format so use google to find a PSP video converter and make your video 320x240 and either 512 or 384 kbps.  Use mp3 audio at 96 or 64 kbps.  This will make video about 200mb per hour plus it looks great on the iPod.

<Title>Great player, hard to find Accessories
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my 60GB model through the Apple website along with some accessories.  This was my first iPod purchase and I am very happy with the unit and how easy it was to load it with my mp3 library.  The unit is small elegant and packed with features.  However, I was disappointed to find no AC charger included (I had wanted to use one in my office and the IT folks won't allow me to load the software to use the USB cable).  I was also disappointed to find out I could not easily find a case for this model (hopefully they will be available soon).  The biggest disappointment was that many of the accessories for previous models (including FM transmitters) are incompatible with this model since there is only a headphone jack and no charging jack on the top.  I'm sure the after market guys will soon develop more accessories, but it is frustrating to own the flagship model and not be able to use it in the same manner as people who own less expensive or older models.

<Title>Solid if not spectacular
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had for almost a week now. Solid (first) attempt at place- and time-shifting video programming. Video color screen is vivid and rich. 60GB of storage is more than abundant (I honestly think 30GB will suffice for most users). Using my iBook, I'm able to convert full-length 8GB DVDs of movies into 600MB MPEG4's for "downtime" viewing (e.g., commute, slacking off during lectures or meetings) on my iPod using a free downloadable (Apple-only) program called HandBrake (available at versiontracker dot com) (this process takes 4-6 hours, and is something you start before going to bed....in the morning, just load the finished product onto your iPod as you would music files). Much more elegant and not as bulky or expensive as other portable video players, although not as flexible in terms of content sources either (see Archos' player).  No mechanical or cosmetic problems yet (see iPod Nano). Video capabilities would be better served if screen utilized more real estate (i.e., make it widescreen; but I suspect that's a technical limitation at present). Comes with USB cord, software CD, and earbuds, but no AC or desktop charger. Limited 5G iPod 3rd-party accessories at present.

<Title>Great product but can still improve a little
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just picked this up yesterday because my mini's 4Gb just wasn't enough anymore. The new color screen is extremely sharp, just like looking at my LCD monitor. I love being able to watch my favorite music videos on it although iTunes didn't have my favorite, Stacy's Mom. But I'm sure their video library will expand every Tuesday just like their music. It's also a nice feature to be able to download TV shows from ABC to watch at my convenience. But once again, the selection will need to improve on that one as well. I've only had it for one day and I bought a leather case with it but even the case made for it has already started to scratch the glossy black surface. So I'm disappointed with that. The operation of the clickwheel is slightly different than my iPod mini. When I'm scrolling through artists, songs, etc., it will scroll at normal speed and then jump maybe 4 times faster than normal so you're going from Aerosmith to Pink Floyd and the next thing you know you're looking at ZZ Top. On paper the feature probably sounded like a good idea but in reality it's just annoying and as far as I can tell, it's not an option that can be turned off. Overall I'm still very happy with it and highly recommend it.

<Title>pretty much a cynical rip off for the money
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this video unit very swiftly followed on the heels of the photo ipod which clearly was aimed at maximising sales for folks who wanted to put digital photos/power point presentations etc on an ipod, presenting them with another three-four hundred photo/video unit after they'd just bought a threee-four hundred dollar unit. After barely three months the photo ipod is now effectively discontinued and being discounted. I initially got a 60 GB photo which I discovered is incompatible - its just too thick for the docking station -  with the new Altec Lansing IM 7 - after establishing said incompatibility with Apple (obviously Altec's fault - not Apple's) I discovered that the new 60GB (slightly thinner) video was just about to be launched so I swapped my photo for a video only to discover Apples cynical exploitation continues. I was very unimpressed with the video ipod, the screen would have scratched very quickly and does according to many reviews, unlike the photo which happily is more durable, there was no mains adapter, none of the peripherals I have like iTalk work, you have to buy the new universal dock at fourty dollars a pop to make some features work. The better (20 hours) battery life is only for the 60GB, another deliberate cynical ploy. The video/battery capability is seemingly  pretty limited as regards watching films longer than 100 mins or so. I dont really see the point of watching vacuous mtveee type music videos on such a small unit - but each to their own. As for the limited TV series drivel currently on the itunes PPV web site, enoough said!!   I originally had a 4th gen 40GB which was big enough for my 5000+ songs. Each time they update the ipod they take something away from the package. This time with the video they've taken virtually everything away, no dock, no adapter, no peripherals, and added the crappiest thinnest case you could imagine which wont really protect the unit long term. Unless very small screen video is really tremendously important to you and you're happy spending two dollars on each music video/populist tv shows thus far offered buy the photo ipod and save fifty dollars and get a much better deal with a screen that will not scratch so easily and wont be such a problem even if it does scratch up a bit. I use mine exclusively as a music/audio player and now have a second photo ipod after swapping out my new vidoe player. I found the video player took thirty mins or so longer to download the exact same number of songs that my photo ipods took.  And I can still record speech/memos etc on my ipod, use an fm transmitter on the car stereo. Its funny how generally speaking the media just lap up whatever apple do and never seem to criticise the (to me) cynical plethora of products, many of which if you have a reasonable music collection are worthless, 1GB or less of music recorded at at least 192kbs to ensure reasonable play back sound is to me a waste of money and effort. If you buy decent headphones - at the very least Shure E3's or better, owning a 60 GB ipod is an expensive toy. Doubtless Apple will sooner or later launch yet another expensive video ipod update, presumably enough folks will want the kudos of having the latest model so Apple's profits will continue. Hopefully if this cynical product exploitation continues increasingly folks will begin to see through this creeping corporate cynicism. I make this observation as a free market loving Republican. I suppose as a proud non gamer and older geezer, with nothing but contempt for the vacuous mtveee and its ilk this product is not really aimed at me.  My music ipod is still by far and away the finest and most cherished toy I have ever owned.

<Title>Converting Video to 5G iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Don't let any of the reviews about difficulty of video conversion dissuade you. I found an app off of download.com called SUPER (freeware) that perfectly encodes videos of virtually any format for the new iPod. It's fairly quick, though CPU intensive. For the most recent version of the program, check out  http://fever.link.free.fr/SUPER.html#Dnload. Don't spend money for Quicktime Pro when better (and free) alternatives exist. Oh yeah...get yourself a new iPod in black. Sexy as hell. I'm the first of my friends to get one, and everyone is jealous.

<Title>APPLE IS AMAZING
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has done it again with the new 60GB ipod video. This unit is beyond amazing because not only have they improved upon the size, color, function, and battery life of ipod, but what is great about this thing is that it plays VIDEO. The picture quality is crisp and clear, and so far, my only gripe is that the unit scratches too easily. I'm still waiting for a case that doesnt suck. Also, the fact that there is no AC adaptor that comes packaged with the unit should be a crime. But despite these gripes, its still the best music player out there, and now it plays video.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Can't mess with Apple!  For $400, you get 60GB, a beautiful screen, and a cool black design.  As always, the major gripes are with the cheap earbuds and lack of early accessory support.  You do get a case with it now, a thin slip-on deal that does make it easier to put the iPod in a pocket or briefcase without scratching.  I would disagree with people who don't like the accelerated wheel scrolling.  At just over 30GB on mine, scrolling through the artists or albums would take a long time one-by-one.  The acceleration is fairly intuitive once you get used to it.  The screen is big and clear.  I seriously doubt anyone would watch movies on it, but I can see downloading news and half-hour shows to watch while on a Stairmaster or riding the train.  At this point, you're on your own for video content unless you're a Disney lemming.

<Title>Yes I Have This One, & With VIDEO, Now It's Worth It!
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got mine alittle over a week ago directly from Apple.  (Sorry Amazon, but it's the same price, + free laser engraving & shipping)  I HAD bought the iPod 60GB photo for about a week, but as soon as I saw these new ones coming out, I sold the photo on ebay and bought the 60GB video in black.  I got the new one for 3 main reasons:  1: The iPod is finally in BLACK!  2: It's thinner = more portability.  3: Yes, it plays video.  Now these reasons are listed in order.  I didn't get this new one just for the video.  I got it as a music player first and a video player second (or third).         First off, since it's the new feature, lets talk about the video.  The video quality is excellent!  (considering that the screen is only 320x240 pixel)  I say this from putting my OWN videos on it, meaning videos that weren't downloaded from iTunes.  $1.99 isn't too bad a price for a music video or an episode of a TV series, but at the same time, most of the music videos and TV series episodes they offer aren't everybodies can of beer!  (I don't care for Lost and especially Desperate Housewives...unless the 4 women did the show nude!)  All I did was rip the DVD of a TV series or whatever I want, then transcode it into a format that the ipod can read, and Presto!  Now I know while your reading this your thinking, "If I get this iPod, how can I put my favorite stuff on it the way this guy is talking about?"  No problem, I'll tell you!         First, if you want to get a movie or a TV show off a DVD, chances are it's probably CSS encrypted.  (Pretty much any movie or TV series DVD you buy at any store)  To rip these type of DVD's into a video file, you'll have to get a DVD ripping program that can decrypt CSS.  You can find a number of them online for free or cost alittle $ to download.  My experience, most of the freeware ones can't rip any decent quality video, so you'll probably have to shell out afew bucks to get a decent one.  I had already downloaded one called AoA DVD Ripper afew months ago for about $25 or $30.  (Do a google or yahoo search to find the site)  It does a really good job of ripping the DVD's and the video/audio quality is great.  (Especially using the DivX 6 codec)  Next, you'll need to transcode the video file into a format the ipod can read.  (Go to apple's website for video specifications)  I already had Quicktime 7 Pro, which comes with a setting to save videos it can open to the proper format.  I tried using it; it took an hour just to convert 5% of the video!  It was only a 22 minute video!  WAY TOO LONG A CONVERSION TIME!  (would have taken almost a day!)  So I went searching online for another program that would do this faster.  I found a freeware program called Videora iPod Converter.  (Again, do a Yahoo search to find the download site)  It comes with a number of options and it does a great (and fast) job of converting the video to the right format.  TIP: When using this program, ONLY certain video settings can be used for the converted video to work on the ipod.  Check the forum of the website you download this program from to see what other settings people have tried to get it working.  It may seem like a lot of trouble, but if you want to be able to watch certain videos, it isn't that bad once you get everything set up.  (It only took me a total of 30 minutes to put an episode of Chappelle Show on my iPod using the process I described above!)      Now that the video is out of the way...The sound of the ipod is excellent.  I read somewhere that they also fixed 3 minor sound bugs that were present in the earlier versions of iPod.  (Another bonus)  Overall, there isn't too much more new about the new ipod besides what I talked about.  One drawback that people have mentioned, but hasn't affected me; the 4 prong connection that was on top next to the headphone jack is gone.  So if you already have ipod accessories that use them, tough luck, they won't work on the new one.  They'll be coming out with accessories to replace the older ones sometime though that exclusively use the dock connector on the bottom.  (Already have in some cases)  Also, if you don't like using iTunes to transfer music to your iPod, there's a program out there called Anapod made by Red Chair Software.  It integrates into Windows Explorer and just drag and drop!  Has a lot of cool/handy features, and they just put a new version out that supports the new ipod!  (Namely transferring video)  It costs about $25 -$30 depending on which version you get.  Well worth it though, I think.  Hope this review helped you out!

<Title>Ipod
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My ipod changed my life.lol  Im in the navy, so everything has to be compact.  No more carrying around CD's DVD's TV's etc.  Now it is all in one place.  I can watch movies in my rack now without a bulky laptop.  The picture is so crystal clear.  i fought the hype for a while by buying a creative, a gigabeat, a lyra.  They cannot compare by far.  Having an ipod is like belonging to a club.  Trust what ever you want a mp3 player to do the ipod does.  A little advice though, learn how to use itunes fully.  People at work are always asking me to hook their ipod up like mines.  Itunes is simple.  It will organize all your stuff for you if you take the time to learn how.  Fyi don't buy that 100 dolar cable to hook your ipod up to your tv.  Just go to walmart or somewhere and get a 20 dolar cable that plugs into your headphone jack and converts to audio and video rca's.  Normally these cables are for digital cameras/cams.

<Title>One of the greatest devices ever w/ a couple of pleasant surprises.
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all I've owned this 60 GB 5th gen Ipod for over a year now and it's been a blast to own. I often tell people that if it were any more versatile that I'd consciously use it in my sleep :). During the time that I've owned it it has been a snap to operate. ITunes is very easy to browse through and buying and transferring new songs to your IPod likewise is a snap (you can make $$$ disappear really quick while browsing ITunes :)).     So far it's held up remarkably well I have my IPod in a simple case and I've dropped it a million times and thankfully it hasn't given me any problems. The worst was when I accidentally dropped it into a bucket of water I freaked out (naturally when you pay as much for something like this) the rest of the day it didn't work and I was bummed and thought I'd have to send it in, but remarkably the next day it worked again :). So in closing this is one of greatest devices ever is quite durable, worth the money, saves you the risk of sifting through 10 million CDs while driving, and is among one of my most valued possessions as in if I lost it I know I'd have to have another ASAP. After owning this wonderful device it's no wonder that there is so much competition trying to compete for a slice of the Apple pie.

<Title>The care needed for this amazing device
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After purchasing the Apple iPod Black 60GB last September 2005, I noticed that once the clear seal which protects the screen and iPod wheel was taken out, I found the surface to be very sensitive. The surface is succeptible to scatches easily. If you are planning to own this device, I suggest that you purchase adhesive plastic cover or iPod skin to protect your investment. Other than that, the iPod 60GB is an amazing device that can fit approximately 20,000 songs depending on track lengths and MB size.   Looking for new music? iTunes, the desktop companion to the iPod, offers one or two free songs every Monday online. Want Podcasts on your favorite topics? No problem, just use iTunes search engine to see if it's available in the iTunes website.   Planning on using your iPod during long drives? Purchase the iPod iTrip which easily fits underneath your 60GB player. Look for a clear station on your car stereo and start dancing or singing away!

<Title>Best iPod Ever
<Date>Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my 60GB Video iPod- there's plenty of storage room with all my music, photos, videos and room left over to backup my data.  If you look at the price per Gigabyte, this is without a doubt the most cost-effective iPod model. The Battery lasts for hours upon hours when playing music and still for several hours when watching video. I love the fact that I can hook this up to my TV with a video cable and watch my video on the big screen. It also works great when coupled with the dock and remote, before the Apple TV, this was the best way to watch my iTunes movies and videos on the big-screen from my sofa.   The iTunes software works great for managing all my media and the sync process is easy and fast with the USB 2.0. Just plug it in and go. I was really surprised at how clear the video screen was - yes it is small, but it's fine for occasional viewing such as when on a trip. Made my 8 hour overseas flight much more enjoyable. I also bought an iPod compatible stereo for my car and now I rarely use anything else. Great for podcasts and audio books, especially for long commutes.  Oh yeah, and last but not least- it's absolutely gorgeous.
