<Title>Nice player but not flawless
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The good: Line-in encoding. Voice recording. Equalizer. Long battery life.  Small. Lightweight.  Easy-to-use.  Portable.   The bad:  Skips between songs-there is about a 1-second pause between songs. Cuts off the first second of every song-it will start at 00:01 and not 00:00; this can be circumvented, however.  The "Favorites" playlist will re-order itself by album name if you turn the player off and back on again. Quite annoying, actually. Shuffle and Repeat One modes take up tons of battery.  Does not seem to be compatible with any format of playlist. Also quite annoying.  The clock is always two minutes off. You can only set the hour, not the minute.  The earbuds short out quickly.  Sometimes it freezes; a quick punch of the reset button fixes this, however.  Scratches easily. The back, at least. As in if you put it on too hard a table and whisk it off, it will have a new scratch.   I like my player, but, as my library grows, I'm going to be looking at new models with more space, more compatibility, and a more durable design.

<Title>"Does not" IPOD 
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As with most folks that are new to MP3 players we tend to go with what's well advertized and, well "Hot". So we look towards IPOD. After looking at the price tag of the IPOD and hearing of the difficulties with I-Tunes. I did some research and found this product to be superior in every way. It has many sound options that IPOD does not, it is more compact, it works with many on-line music store programs, it has an FM radio, (IPOD does not) It is cheaper! Why IPOD? Go with this little beauty, you'll be much happier.

<Title>Nice for the first 3 months. From then on, hell. 
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It looks like the best player ever made. Until, of course, the warranty expires.   And then we find out everything wrong with it...  It scratches more easily than you would believe.  Every new album I've put on it has blanked out the entire player and made me have to format it and resync my entire library.  It holds nothing like 1GB of songs. More like 900 MB. It records so quietly you can hardly hear it.  The earbuds hardly work.   I would not buy this again, given 70 bucks. I would go for a completely different brand, different model. And next time I won't be fooled by 4 glowing reviews.

<Title>Good for a while, then, 70 bucks down the drain
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mini MP3 a while ago and loved it. Good radio, nice sound quality, and beautiful graphics. But then, it became possesed and said I needed to "re-sync every freakin' song to listen." ?!! RE-SYNC?!!!! I ALREADY SYNCED IT, I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN!!! So, I format it and attempt to download again, but the software rejects it once again. I get mad and break it accidentaly, and then I lose the stupid thing it's so small. Take my advice, avoid the un-neccasary anger and don't buy it. There's lots of other good quality MP3's out there, this ain't one of em.

<Title>Loses it's mind
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit runs ONLY on Windows XP, there is a patch that supposedly allows it to work on Windows 2000 Pro, but the patch doesn't work for ANYONE I know, so don't bother.  I travel a lot, so I enjoy the FM stereo, and the recorder comes in handy for meetings and such... No complaints there.. mine is also one of the ones that gets excellent battery life (MANY people say the battery life is poor, and about an equal number say it's excellent.. go figure)...   I use it literally every day, and have for over a year now.  My only real complaint is that once in a while, it loses it's mind (or at least it's place).  I listen to a LOT of Audio-books with it, and sometimes it skips to something like "Track 5" and re-starts there at the beginning of track 5 EVERY TIME you turn it off and then back on, even if you are only on track 2 (or the middle of track 2).  It will keep starting at track 5 (or wherever) until you listen past that track, THEN it will either clear up and do right, OR it chooses some NEW random track to start on every time you turn it off and back on... USUALLY it starts back right where you left off, but AT LEAST once per book it starts doing this "random place starting" thing, and once it starts it, it will keep doing it until you listen past where it's decided to start..    I have NO idea why it does this, but I have mentioned it to several friends with the same unit, and they say theirs does it too when listening to Audio-books saved as MP3 files (The Conversion software used doesn't seem to matter.. I use Goldwave, but others use Cool Edit, or Windows Media Player's "Save" feature to convert the audio books from CD [or Audible] to MP3). It's no big deal when listening to songs, but it's not fun trying to find your place every time you re-start an audio-book that may be 30 hours long... especially of you are driving.  It's aggravating enough that it's causing me to look for another MP3 player after a year of this, which is why I am here right now.

<Title>Sound could be better
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A nicely designed little device with lots of power, though not much storage compared with others with similar prices.  I've had mine for about 10 months now, and haven't had any problems with it freezing,as other reviewers have mentioned, but it does refuse to set the date and time properly, but that's just a minor convenience to me.  The best features of this, however, are its recording capacities - line-in with excellent sound quality, beautiful FM recording, and a pretty powerful audio recording feature as well.  It picked up most of a conversation I had with my dad one afternoon, for instance, all while lodged within my backpack.  The only real drawback I find to this player is that its sound quality when playing music files is noticably inferior to my portable CD player, even when I'm running lossless files.  The sound settings improve this a bit, but not enough.

<Title>Life-altering device
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Tiny, easy to use, with a capacious memory and excellent sound, this device has freed me from the tape players/recorders, CD players, and radios I used to carry evreywhere. It allows me to download, without cost, many books from my public library (whose system won't work with an iPod). It plays for a long time before needing recharging and then can be recharged either on the computer with a USB cord or same shaped cell phone charger with wall plug. Ever the cheapskate, I bought this refurbished but ir has worked beautifully. The sleep timer function (along with my pillow speaker)allows me to go to sleep listening and more important go back to sleep after waking. The FM radio works well but I haven't tried the other functions. My only criticism is not for this player but the general family of digital audio players: they are all designed for music listeners, not book listeners. We may be a smaller part of your market but we exist and would appreciate being taken into account in instructions, labeling, etc.

<Title>Great for Tween users
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these for my 9 y.o. daughter last Christmas.  She loves it!  It's small enough to fit into her pocket and has a little hook on top for charms or a lanyard strap.  The MP3 is easy enough for her to use by herself when downloading her favorite music and family photos.  I would recommend this to anyone with younger kids.  The battery last a long, long time between charges via USB on any computer.  Don't buy the super expensive MP3s, this one packs a punch for much less--- holds tons of media files, plays FM radio, and records. The graphics on the screen are cool too.

<Title>Battery recharge problem
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If the battery worked I would rate this unit a near 5. I really like this player and I wish Samsung could fix it. If the battery drains completely the player can't be recharged and will not turn on. I've sent this player back to Samsung 3 times for this problem. Samsung returns the unit, after 3-4 weeks, working and fully recharged but the problem happens all over again. Now it has happened for a 4th time. Samsung is either unable or unwilling to fix it. I'm stuck with a lemon.

<Title>Can I get one in 8gb?
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Almost 3 years ago, I think, I got this little samsung. It has traveled across the world with me and survived a freezing winter in Eastern Europe. It was probably the best mp3 player I have ever had the chance to use. I have dropped it multiple times, it's been tossed and squished and banged up and still (for the most part) works. But sadly, it no longer works and I've had to replace it. None of Samsung's products seemed as good as this one, and I ended up getting a Zune. But I still wish they made this product in an 8gb form. Exactly this one, because I love how sturdy it was. I worry about breaking my Zune...

<Title>Great player with few drawbacks.
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great sound.  Sensible menu structure.  You can use Windows Media Player or drag and drop files and folders.  Has line in.  Has built in microphone or you can use line in.  FM radio actually works fairly well.  You can record from FM too.  Compression rate is selectable from unit as opposed to PC.  Very small but still able to push buttons with old, beat up fingers.  Screen very readable, unlike my Erickson/Sony cell phone.  Battery life is reasonable.  Customer support has been great.  I had one problem that required help from the "next level" and he explained how to fix PC related problem.  Draw backs.   Requires USB port to charge (or separate USB charger that you buy).  Supplied ear buds are terrible.  If you want to listen to music you will have to buy something better.  Does not work with Mac OS X.  You cannot drag and drop from Mac.  Player is not recognized at all by Mac.  Technical support says if you put more than 9 folders on player, it may (or may not) erase something already there.  They are working on upgrade to firmware to address this issue.  Overall I am very pleased with player and use almost all the features.  I highly recommend it.    iPod comes up short on features by comparison.

<Title>Good things DO come in small packages!!
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just picked this up in December and have not put it down since!  What a terrific product Samsung has put out for us music/gadget fanatics! This little guy is impressive to look at with a very robust and colorful screen, the menus are easy to navigate through and it is user-friendly all the way around.  I was torn between this and the iPod Nano but I'm very happy with my selection thus far especially since it offers the option of an FM tuner which you can record from directly into the unit!  I bought a rubberized cover for it which I highly recommend to keep it clean, prevents slipping when you put it on a surface and protects against scratching the outer casing.  Other owners have dinged the earbuds on this but I don't have any complaints except that they fall out from time to time (as with any earbud) so I'll most likely upgrade to BOSE noise-cancelling earphones. The sound on this unit is EXCELLENT as it has surround sound capabilities and different settings to choose from.  In addition to my 1GB unit, I purchased two 512MB units as Christmas gifts so that should tell you something about my level of satisfaction.  I also purchased a two year replacement contract since as with any portable device, the risk of damage is greater.  If I could put something on a wish list it would be that Samsung include a case and neckstrap with the unit as mine did not come with those items.  Definitely one of the better mp3 units I've seen out there!

<Title>Cool
<Date>Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great product, its small & chunky (like a Zippo lighter), wonderful craftsmanship, a very nicely made quality device, the screen is bright and colorful, for such a tiny device the controls are surprisingly easy to operate (I love the background strobe or flash light which comes up everytime the navigator button is depressed), it works with Windows Media Player, its loud, has a hook for a neck strap,its easy to sync, you can even drag & drop files, feature by feature it beats iPod (even the dimensions make it easier to carry it around in the pocket), has an FM Tuner/recorder, Mic, Voice Recorder and best of all - line in encoding (with this feature you can record from virtually any other device if it has a line out (an earphone port i.e. a headphone socket would do just fine as well), I actually have the YP-T7JX which is identical except that it only has 512MB but comes in a cool Aqua color.  I had to reset the device after I had to shut down the computer when I was charging the device for the very first time via the USB port and it left the device lifeless, it wouldn't load or charge, anyway I called Samsung customer service and they adviced me to hit the reset button which I did and then everything went just fine (make sure when you are charging it the first time that you don't disturb...don't have your computer go on standby or hibernate).   All in all, I recommend this 100%, you can't go wrong here, this gadget is cool.  Just an idea for Samsung for the next evolution of this product, build tiny speakers into this like a miniature boom-box, so one can just leave it on the desk and listen without the headphones (its possible to do this even now for a short while in a quiet room, the sound coming out the headphones is quite loud when its set to full volume)

She borrowed it while her battery operated mp3(Samsung YP-T5V 256MB)ranout of battery.  She convinced my wife my YP-T7JZ 1GB is more usable to her than me... long story....  In the end we swap mp3 players.  Samsung YP-T5V 256MB MP3 Player is mine now which is little more than year old and just refusing to end it's life so I have excuse to buy different mp3 player..  Samsung's customer service is A++++ for me, after 2 weeks of used YP-T7JZ 1GB the LOCK screen flash for no reason..  I called customer support and he walk me through upgrading firmware.  Problem Fix and no problem,,, except I don't owned it anymore.....

<Title>Blows iPod to smithereens. 
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was so undecided between getting this Samsung vs. the iPod Nano.  Going with the Apple felt 'comfortable' as they are everywhere and my kids both have one.  Problem I had with Apple products is that there is no FM Tuner (biggie); and I also hate the little 'roadblocks' that Apple places on music file movement between programs (another biggie).  My final reason for choosing the Samsung is that I've NEVER had a bad product with their label on it.    Now onto my general thoughts on the YP-T7z:  1 gig, color screen, multiple adjustment options such as full band EQ, Bass Boost, 3D effect adjust, Surround adjust.  This Samsung is simply amazing when it comes to sound tayloring.  Earbuds are adequate - however a larger driver phone really sets off all the adjustments you can do.   Battery life is fair - I really wish this ran on a AAA vs. the rechargable ION.  Look for 5-6 hours of MP3 and about 10 hours of FM usage.  Product fit and finish is A+++.  Locate and remember where the reset button is, I connected mine to my wife's older (slow) laptop and, while the file swapping worked, the unit had to be reset before it would operate again (just FYI).    Highly recommend this product if you want to avoid the iPod cattle call.

<Title>Very disapointed
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player, and was extrememly disappointed. It does not come with a manual. I see from another review that it can be downloaded on line, but it would be nice to have with the player. I found the user interface very cumbersome. Maybe if I read the manual which they didn't give me I would find it easier.  The software CD insists on reinstalling Windows media player 10 on my computer even though it is already there. I can draw two conclusions from that: Either the programers are not very good at their job, or the software is installing extra spyware on my system. Either way I'm not interested. Had this been the extent of the problems, I could have lived with it as a nice compact MP3 player. Unfortunately, after one day of use the player shut off, and never turned on again. Fed up with the whole thing, I returned it and went for another brand.

<Title>Great player with small annoyance problem
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My boyfriend bought me this player for me for Christmas.  He waited till Christmas eve befor looking and this one was the last hidden below something else. Anyways, it works great and accepts wma as well as mp3.  It is just the perfect size and built to withstand the abuse that I can put things through. The only thing is that everytime I go to charge it I have to turn on the device first or it will freeze.  If music starts playing before I can plug it into the computer then it freezes then too. So I have to have perfect timing with turning the device on and then connecting it to my computer befor it fully loads its software.  Any other way of doing it causes it to freeze up and then I have to go locate a pin to push the reset button. VERRY annoying.  Other than that I love this device.

<Title>My New Gem!
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After losing my Sony NW-E505 =(  I decided to get this Samsung product for a refreshing change.  I'm glad I did!  You might not agree from the picture, but it's very beautifully designed...A+ for craftsmanship!  The screen measures 1.2" diagonally (which I frowned upon at first) but it's actually an adequate size for viewing photos.  However, it's just a little extra feature to sweeten this baby up...Samsung clearly did not try to make it a grand bling-bling thing.  You can view photos while listening to music, but there's no slideshow feature (you have to manually flip through the photo album). Bummer, but I can live with that just fine. The navigation is a little weird at first, but after 30 minutes of messing around with it and referencing the online user manual it was totally user-friendly.  In fact, it's almost like navigation around your typical cell-phone.  When you listen to music and have to stop or turn the device off, it will pick up where it stopped when you turn the player on again!  Neat-o!  Someone said the headphones are horrible, but I thought it was pretty good in terms of sound.  It's just annoying in that it falls out of your ears easily.  There's also a drag-n-drop feature, which is great.  I'm not into playlists, so I haven't bothered with that feature yet.  The radio feature is always a plus!  Though it works just fine, I thought the Sony had slightly better reception...well, I guess that's not really relevant.  In terms of battery life, I measured it out to be a little over 9 hr.  This sucks compared to my old Sony because the Sony lasts waaay longer than 9 hrs, but I guess that is another shortcoming I'm willing to overlook.  Lastly, when connecting or disconnecting the USB cable to the player, you must use extra force (it's OOOKayyyyyy) or else it'll never work...  Update 2/25/07: Wow...I love this samsung even more.  I accidentally left it in the laundry machine and it survived! Now, I'm not saying that it will survive a second time, but at least you're given a little leeway for carelessness.

<Title>Awesome Player for the Price, Kills the iPod Shuffle
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm in the habit of researching electronics extensively before I go ahead and make a purchase. Let me tell you that after putting the YP-T7J against other comparable mp3 players, this one comes out way ahead.   I exercise regularly, from weightlifting to jogging, and this solid little player holds up wonderfully. It's a flash-based player, which means it has no moving parts unlike the bigger iPod models. This is essential for the active music listener because it wont skip no matter how much you abuse it.  As with all Samsung products (I own one of their cell phones as well) the display is astonishingly colorful and brilliant. It's animated equalizers add a nice touch.   The navigation is suprisingly simple (even for my older family members), and (as mentioned above) the bright strobe that flashes every time you press the buttons is also nice detail.  This solid little device is full to the brim with features not present in other players within it's pricerange. It has a quality FM radio with up to 30 presets, an awesome voice recorder with a bit rate quality of up to 192 Kbps, a picture veiwer that lets you display your pictures WHILE playing music, and the ability to organize playlists and favorites.   The YP-T7J uses Plays-for-Sure which works well to organize all your music. I use Winamp on my computer which works great with this player.   Connects to you computer via a USB cable which also doubles as it's power source (I just leave it connected to my XBOX 360, it recharges without the console being on). It's battery life is pretty decent, which all depends on how long you choose to have the backlight on.  All around, the YP-T7J is a solid little device that will not dissapoint. I've had it almost a year now and it remains scratch-free and fully functional despite a massive amount of abuse. It is a huge bargain at the price, and is sure to please.
