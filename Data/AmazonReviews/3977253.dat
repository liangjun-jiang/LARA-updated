<Title>Not bad for the price
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Coby for my husband for his birthday. He was using a CD player on his way to work and now he just uses the Coby. The instructions aren't the best but he has found his way around it and enjoys it quite a bit. He says the sound quality is good too! The only thing is that the batteries don't last too long. Other than that it is great for the price. I am thinking of purchasing one for myself too! It is so compact he just puts it in his coat pocket and forgets about it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a non-complicated mp3 player. It just serves its purpose which is to play your favorite songs on it.

<Title>A Great MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very happy with the decision I made in purchasing this product.  I was a little worried about it because it was a pretty cheap price and a brand I am not familiar with, but after recieving and using the MP3 player I am very happy I made the decision to purchase it.  It is very easy to use and the fact that you can download music onto it as well as it having a radio built it makes me happy.

<Title>terrible product
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>it does not work. I spent 20 maybe 30 hours and no luck. the guy from costumer service had no idea either. If you pay $5 for this mp3 that is $5 too much.  The worst thing I've ever got

<Title>Perfect throw around mp3 player
<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would never want to spend $200+ on an mp3 player I'd just use for working out and get sweat all over. I used to have another version of this mp3 player that held less songs, but I wanted to hold a bit more on it. At most, it can hold around 160 songs and the sound quality is quite good. If you just need a low cost and high quality mp3 player that can handle being jossled around, this would be a good investment.

<Title>Horrible experience with this product and the Coby company
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently bought 4 of these mp3 players. I had bought one and thought it was pretty neat, so I bought three more (one for my wife and two as gifts). Within a couple of weeks, however, each one had started to malfunction in different ways. I was quite upset, so I returned them to Coby and requested a refund. The Coby company refused a refund, never sent any replacements, and the elusive person who was the only one who could authorize a refund was conveniently always "in a meeting" when I called. I am now out more than $120 dollars with no explanation or apology from the Coby company, much less a working mp3 player.  I would highly recommend NOT buying this product!!

<Title>Waste of money for me unfortunately
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just bought a COBY MP3 Player a few days ago. I had music on it, it played well and 3 days later it stopped working. The Battery was on right, I never dropped it and It was very well taken care of. Now all it does is flash. I tried to plug it into the USB to see if it would start to no avail. I am starting to think COBY is selling refurbished products on low priced ones. I don't think I'll waste my time buying another COBY Digital Audio Player MP3
