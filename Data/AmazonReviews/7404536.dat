<Title>Getting Better all the time
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I started out with Sony walkman(Cassette Player), then went to the CD player. Both were noticable(heavy) when I was running. (Radio reception was terrible). I graduated to the MP-3 player, psyc. Small and light, but needed to change the batteries. Then I went to the Jelly bean style. Very Happy with this, but needed more room(1gb). So now I have Sony NW-205F with 2 gb. It gives you playlists or artists albums. It doesn't have the entire list shuffle, which the jelly bean does. The sounds are fantastic. However I am still experimenting with the headphones. The ear buds, pop out every once in a while. The behind the ear hoop, keeps them in place. But the cable gets pulled from the armband to the noggin'. I just ordered the clip on style. So the jury hasn't seen the evidence on this yet. But all the mp-3s are easy to download. Easy to remove songs etc...I haven't had a run where the batts have died, but if with age the batt can't hold a charge for a long period time, then time will tell.

<Title>Fantastic Music to My Ears
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I could start this review by telling you some annoying quirk of this unit or that Sonic Stage software could be better.  Everything is gray-everything!  Even electronic devices!    What I really like is how the Sony proprietary Atrac 3 audio compression makes music sound.  That's why I still use the not so popular mini-disc and now this flash device.    If I wanted to be hip-I could have an I-pod but the sound reproduction does not match Atrac 3-not even close.    So this neat little device can pump music to my ears or through my $2500 stereo system.  1350 songs using 48K sampling rate in 2Giga bites is a lot of music.  This 3-4 times the comparable amount for a I-pod using Mp3 or WMA compression.   No hard disc to crash.   A hard to beat combination  Sony and GREAT SOUNDING music.  Easy to use-what more could one ask for?

<Title>Great sports mp3
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have always been a fan of the "sporty" mp3 players vs the larger multi gig "hard drive" mp3 players or even mid-side ipod-ish style mp3 players.  Pros -Great display. -Decent radio -Great charging options (as it says a very short charge will get you good to go for a good workout period no problem) -Awesome design, looks sleek. -Nice armband, protects, solid, looks good. -Cool features i.e. "shuffle shake" or sports mode, (plays different playlists based on your speed), stopwatch. -Software is kinda nice how all the navigation/downloading features are all in one program. -Unique twist navigation (that little silver band on the player) can be slid up and down on the top of the player as well as twisted left and right to navigate. Pretty simple.  Cons -They let you sort by album/artist/title etc, but even then it can be tedious flipping through them if you want to get to certain songs. -Like an ipod in that there's no way to get the battery out, not an issue for a long time, but something to keep in mind... -There isn't really an explanation for the different features on the player itself, some reading required. -Sony's music format, oma or something like that, pretty lame. Not really recommended to download from the sony site if you can get mp3 format somewhere else. That being said if you research it, you can convert oma to mp3.  Overall, very nice for working out, if you want an mp3 player to house your 40gig collection and leave in your car, not really the mp3 player for you. If you are a little tech savvy and want one for on the go, and especially working out, then HIGHLY recommended.

<Title>Excellent MP3 player
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had mine for 3 weeks now primarily for using in the gym and I really like it. It is tiny, slick and classy. I have WOWed people with this. They were shocked that there are other cool MP3 players besides iPod.  Here is the breakdown of what I like and dont like:  Pros:  Small well-made Good battery life Sounds great The display is just right.  I am amazed how great the user interface is given minimum number of buttons and controls. Radio tuner (it's an extra $50 to add it to iPod) No need to look at it to change songs. The silver ring on top is the control; you skip songs with that. Way cool. The armband is super handy and well made; Perfect for working out; just perfect. Did I mention small and stylish?  Cons:  Battery not replaceable; pretty much like almost all other MP3 players, however by the time the battery goes, you wanna buy a new one anyway. The earphones: This is pretty much why I am giving this player a 4 star instead of 5. Although they are around the ear sets, but these particular ones don't fit well. I have another Sony around the ear sets that fit great and I was disappointed to find out these suck big time. It could be that I have big ears, but still.  Music software: It is pretty bad. Don't forget to update the software which makes it easier to use, but still sub par. I figured, since I am not gonna upload music to it so often, it shouldn't bother me, and I was right.

<Title>Better players are out there
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a heavy gym user who has sweated several MP3 (and headphones) into the trash, I thought this was the answer. But after using it for several weeks, I hate the thing. My biggest gripes: 1) The Sonic Stage program seems not to be able to find and import the vast majority of .wma format files that I have never had a problem using on my other players. The program seems like a shill to force you to use Sony's Connect Store. Cheaper MP3 players allow you to drag and drop files direct to the player, I don't want another program just for this device. 2) The entire industrial design of the player depends on one small keyway on the back of the plastic case, which in my case was deformed after one week and would no longer hold the player in one position. Without the keyway, you have a round player that is free to spin in the round holder which make this impossible to use without tying up both hands. 3) Even when the keyway was working, the controls are not easy to use when you are working out. The armband positions the player so that the rear of the twist knob digs into your arm and makes it hard to navigate the controls with one hand while running. It is almost like no one actually tried to use this while running in the design phase. This is a case of a cool looking industrial design that does not serve the market it was meant for, avoid this player!

<Title>Tried hard to like it
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software is terrible, slow and glitchy. I have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player. The operators manual is just under 100 pages, so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls. Granted, the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive--assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual.

<Title>A disappointment
<Date>Sat Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in Runners' World. There are a lot of problems with it, however. While it is advertised as a sports MP3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are: - Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them. - Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture. - Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out. - Software is a pain to use. - Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player.  That being said, I still use it. There are some good features: - Long battery life, recharges super quick - Very cool-looking player - Very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size.   I would not recommend this player and if given a choice, I would not buy it again.

<Content>Great mp3 player. I guess not everybody will appreciate one-line display, however, I knew what I was getting and it is absolutely awesome. I play with Koss Porta Pro and the sound is great, and the design and controls are excellent. Thumbs up.

<Title>Just an OK MP3 player for the price
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this for christmas and I'm not thrilled with it.  It can only be charged through a USB cord, with a computer, so if you're traveling without a computer, you're out of luck.  The FM feature and stopwatch are great for a long run, but the headphones aren't that comfortable.  I wasn't happy to have to use their clunky music software either.

<Title>Software does not work with Windows Vista!
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player works great, it's the software that has problems. I first tried to install the software on my computer with Windows Vista and it didn't work! I had to install it on my older computer that had a standard version on Windows XP. The booklet says it will not work with some other versions of XP so be careful.

<Title>Excellent Hardware - Horrible Software
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am an avid runner, mountainbiker and climber, and have been using Walkmans and MP3 players since the early '80s. Still have my very first Sony Dolby B/C automatic reverse cassette player (what a blast that was - too bad it broke down about 15 years ago). That said, here are my comments:  - Love the battery live, looks, minimal weight, but most of all, the EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY.   - Hate the software. SONY, SONY, SONY, get rid of these guys (the guys that wrote the Sonicstage software)! Drag and drop compatible with Windows is all we want!   - Forget about the included earbuds or any earbuds - buy Sennheiser. The sports PMX (green) sound awesome but unfortenately are inadequate in outdoor enviroments (cannot handle water), the PMX 60 are noisy for neighbors but are virtually indestructible.  That said, enjoy everyone!!
