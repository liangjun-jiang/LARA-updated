<Content>I had a iRiver T10 1 GB MP3 Player and tossed it in frustration. I purchased this player (TrekStor i.Beat Organix FM 1 GB MP3 Player with FM Tuner) because it behaves like a flash drive - not dependent on Windows Media Player (you can use it, but don't have to.) I use it constantly. It is highly configurable, easy to figure out without the manual, has a long battery life and sounds great. It feels much nicer than the iRiver, the buttons are great. It supports many file formats: MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, ASF. Best of all it can use DRM but is not a slave to DRM. Next I'm buying the TREKSTOR 67136 Datastation Pocket x.u Portable 160GB Hard Drive & TREKSTOR 12GB USB-Stick CS-D Drive.  
<Overall>5
