<Content>this was suppose to be a refurbished IPOD but instead they set me a used one. the battery will not stay up on it and apple said it is not under warranty so be very careful on what you buy not everything is what they say it is.

<Title>Refurbished is not the way to go

<Content>Although the refurbished models may save some money, we were not successful in getting good quality.  After 30 days the screen went completely blank and a small hairline crack was found.
