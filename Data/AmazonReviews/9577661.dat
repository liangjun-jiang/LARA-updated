<Title>Excellent quality, great features
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Model: Creative Zen Nano Plus (1GB) I purchased this primarily for the features it provides and so far I am very satisfied with the quality and the features.  - Line-in recording. records in mp3 format (96, 128, 160 Kbps). It requires a smaller plug for the line-in and the included wire is very small, so recording from TV etc. might be problematic. But I guess you can buy a longer cable.  - FM radio and recording. Records in WAV, not sure why they would do that. No time-based recording. Recording FM will need the headphone cable plugged in, coz thats the antenna.  - softwareless transfer. So I can use it as a USB stick. U can also transfer the recorded track to your pc, without software, just copy-paste.

<Title>great player- no problems
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had one of these for 6 months now and it has held up to steady use and being knocked around in a backpack and in and out of my car. It works great, is light and small, easy to use. I love it. Triple A batteries last a long time in it and they are cheap too- no pesky recharging time.  My wife, who avoids electronic gadgets, wants one for Christmas.  If she's happy I'm happy so soon we'll have two. I don't get to be in the ipod clique, but I save money and have a player that does more, takes music from more sources, plays more types of files, and is just as easy to use, so I'm surviving. The controls: there are 2 volume buttons, a power/pause button, and a scroll wheel. I can hold it in one hand and handle all the controls with my thumb easily. Without reading the instructions it took me one minute to figure out the controls. Highly recommended.

<Title>Excellent!
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought the Zen Nano Plus for my 13 year old son. I am pleased to say it was an excellent choice, as it's very easy to load with music and to use the controls. The sound quality rivals the best of players. And most of all my son loves it. Some of his friends who have ipods even envy his player! Bravo to Creative for bringing us a great product at an affordable price!

<Title>Creative Zen Nano Plus is a bust
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered the Creative Zen Nano Plus, and it was a bust. Amazon.com had fantastic customer support on the returns, but the Creative help team was nonexistent. You are put on hold and then disconnected. The players would not turn on, so you are stuck with no help from the maker, nor able to listen to music. I will stick with better quality products like an IPOD.

<Title>It even grinds Coffee Beans!
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Nano Plus for Christmas and it is too cool.  I have already used all the features (except the line-in) and they all work great.  I can record all my favorite radio shows and make e-mailable podcasts right on the Nano.  Thanks to all the research I did on Amazon I helped my wife get me the perfect gift!!  I am not anti - iPod, but this player offers so much more.  I spent at least 2-3 hours in the Apple store talking with the rep. (who by the way was very helpful) he showed me all the features and went over the software and I went for about 3 weeks saying that I wanted an iPod until I did more research.  I learned that you can get so much more out of other players.  Based on my research I know that you get more for your money with this player.

<Title>Doesn't install easily, help nonexistant, manual uninformative
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This looks good on paper but:  None of my three computers at home recognize it (XP home SP2, XP Pro SP2) so I can't transfer files. I've tried installing CREATIVE's software but their software nor WMP 10 recognize this.   Play for Sure? Not in the least.  Check out the website? Not much help there. A few things to try that don't work. Look at the manual? Not much there. They don't even tell you how to use anything more than the most basics. Call support? Well its a toll call and they are only open when I am at work (9-6 central time M-F). Looks to me that they don't really want to help their customers.  I am a fairly advanced computer user and I am very dissapointed. I've check the USB ports, used multiple computers, and check the web. Four hours and I still can't hear a single song.   Stay away from this one. Even if it works for you, supporting a company with such poor customer support is a bad idea. No more CREATIVE for me.  (OH, and it comes in one fo those packages you have to destroy to open to returning to AMAZON is not an option unless you accespt a partial refund.)

<Title>Creatively lacking support
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Zen player with high hopes that were ultimately crushed by their technical support.  I am a pretty savvy, techno-geek but I met my match with the mp-3 player from Creative.  After experiencing set up problems, I contacted their tech. support.   I spoke to a friendly girl who seemed to be dazed by even the smallest technical problem which she was obviously enslaved to answer.  I asked to talk to a supervisor.  When I was told I would be contacted in 24 hours by a supervisor to clear the problem, I returned the product.  I never heard back from the girl's supervisor, nor was the problem ever resolved.

<Content>i-pod? whats that? this thing is the best MP3 player in its catagory. #1. its TINY TINY TINY ! #2. it plays all MP3 and WMA formats #3. if you get one of those HORRIBLE proteced CDs that SONY makes you can RIP it directly into the unit by using its built in analog audio input. Battery life is very good and the sound is truly excellent. I have not tried the build in voice recorder or FM tuner, I didnt buy it for those features. I should point out also that it does NOT come with a neck strap however it does come with an arm strap. You could use a neck strap if you have one because it has a hole for it. Only bad thing is the battery cover comes off a bit too easily so i just put a peice of tape on it JUST IN CASE !

<Title>sounds grate
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 so i am new to the game.It sounds grate after you mess with the EQ.The headphones they give you suck but after geting my sony ear buds(walfart$10)i realy like the thing.It was a little tricky at first to figer out how to down load my music.The player uses a drag and drop process.It may be me or windows but it would not sinck my playlist from windows sinck list.Every time i tried it would put songs from the same album in thier own folder.it only holds 30 folders.So if you have just a few songs from each album and more than 30 songs you have a problem.But once i figerd out what was going on it was all good.Thier software works good becuase it keeps all the songs as singls and you can make play lists with it.And with a simple click,drage,drop you have your music.I gave it a 4 becuase of the lack of instructions in the manaul.It just tells you how to turn the darn thing on and scroll thru folders.I do wish it was a 2GB player.But for my first MP3 it will do until I get the 30GB M-Vision.

<Title>Great Until It Quit After 13 Months
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned my Zen Nano Plus for 13 months before it stopped working.  The LCD will still light up for a few seconds after I try to power up, then it shuts down.  My computer won't recognize it, so I can't update firmware.  Since I'm 13 months out, I can't get any support from Creative, except for paying $13.  I'm going to buy a different, cheaper brand.  I dont expect things to last forever, but 13 months?  C'mon.

<Content>I owned this device for 5 months and it just stopped working... I went though all the proper channels for repair and was told they want at least $25.00 to "work" on my warranty repair. It turns out only parts are covered for a year and labor only for 3 months. This is NOT what I call standing behind your product.  DON'T BUY CREATIVE PRODUCTS! Not only are they poorly made, but Creative knows this and doesn't stand behind their own products.

<Content>I have had my player for a little over year now, and I like it.   But what I want to tell you about is it's durability.   I have dropped my mp3player, and all the normal things to abuse it.   But two nights ago I dropped it in a cup of iced tea.    I got it out, got the battery out, and blew on both the player and battery it to dry them.   The music stored on it still played, and after one day of drying out, the radio works as well.  That's what I wanted to say.

<Title>A few more comments
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Others have described this unit fully, so I won't do so here.  Highlights are: (1) About the size of a pack of gum and comes with an arm-band carrier which is great for running (2) Has an FM radio and microphone built in (and a line-in jack) (3) Runs on an AAA battery (my sons' Ipods all died prematurely because of the rechargeable batteries which aren't replaceable)- for me it is easier to carry a few AAA batteries than a charger (4) An incredible number of settings and modes that are easy to access once you get used to the toggle-press switch (5) Extremely easy to drag and drop songs into organizing folders on the PC interface (6) Tiny display is amazingly informative, with song time, repeat mode, battery life, equalization setting, and song title all displayed when a song is playing (display changes when accessing other functions).  I have only one minor complaint, that is not documented: You are limited to 60 song folders (including the one or two folders that are built in).  You can set up more than that on the PC interface, but the player ignores them.

<Title>Zen Nano dies yet again
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first nano(black) and replacement(under warranty) nano(black) have both failed. After the duracell provided battery was used up and I replaced it the unit shuts off after about two seconds. I followed the instructions the first time to replace the firm ware via download but it didn't work and just erased all my music. Creative Zen technical support was not very helpful and only repeated the exact same instructions that were on their web. After a series of calls they finally agreed to replace the unit. Well here we go again the exact same problem has now happened with the replacement nano shutting off after two seconds. Stayed tuned...Too bad -- I did enjoy it when it was working. My husband has a blue nano and has not had any problems so I wonder if the black nanos are defective?

<Content>I bought this for my girlfriend; no special reason I just love her so much; It's twice as big as mine, and since she enjoys music so much I just love to make her happy.  I love you Alicia!  Hours and hours of music in the palm of your hand. . . .can't go wrong really.  Got a letter, resume, or other document to take with you, it doubles as a flash drive.  Also plays FM radio AND records it. You got something like this, you got control over your music.  Wish I had this in hand while in other citys that are playing HOT HOT music on a weekend night!  I'm gonna make Alicia my wife.  This is my testament to one of the most beautiful latin girls I've ever seen.

<Content>mainly used for music playback.  works great.  it's small and does all i need it to do.  i tried to do mp3 encoding to record stuff but i haven't gotten it to work yet.  only drawback for me, is it takes a while to scroll for songs that i want to hear.  i dunno if there is an easier way for me to scroll through songs.  i love how u can just drag and drop songs into a folder.  it can be used as a portable hard drive.  it comes with a case that is white.  i wish it was darker so it would match the mp3 player itself but i don't mind so much anymore.  if u can get this sucker for less than $50 i'd say it's an awesome deal.  if u have more than a gig of music, i would recommend something that could hold more songs.  when i get the mp3 encoding to work, i will be very happy, haha.

<Title>Zen Nano is decent for the price, but prefer the iPod Nano
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently upgraded from the Zen 1GB Nano to the 4 GB iPod and am much happier with it's performance. There are pros and cons to both, but the iPod is the better of the two.  One thing about the Zen and any other non-Apple mp3 player is that if you download songs off of iTunes they are only formatted to play on the iPod in the mp4 format. What this means is that you can't add purchased music to the Zen without converting it to the mp3 format and the only way to do it and be able to load songs onto the Zen is to burn a disc of the converted mp3's and then re-add them onto your computer. This becomes a nuisance and Apple hasn't done anything about it - they essentially are limiting their competition by doing this.  The sound of the iPod is superior to the Zen as is its functionality - the iPod allows you to search through playlists much faster. Also if you want to play the Zen through your home or car stereo the sound quality is poor. The iPod also has faster song download time.  Another issue with the Zen is playlists - once you've created them and downloaded the songs you can't change the order, you have to load them in the order you want them to play. Also, the earbuds that come with the Zen are too big and become uncomfortable if you leave them in too long.  The Zen does have positives, it's small, has the FM radio (decent reception), the recorder is great and you can also delete songs directly from it which you can't do on the iPod. It also has a equalizer that lets you set up your sound preferences and the iPod only has preset equalizer settings.    I liked the Zen but it just isn't as nice as the iPod. I know the larger GB models of the Zen are great, I would either get one of those or the iPod.

<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my mom sometime late last year and she loves it!  It's great for a long daily commute or jog.  It's so tiny and she no longer feels the need to lug around her CD player and CDs...I've put all her favories in the mp3 player.  The headphones aren't that bad, but it all depends on the person and individual comfort.  I came close to buying her an ipod but realized that I would have to buy a separate piece to have radio.  The zen nano already has radio which is a huge PLUS if you need a break from listening to your own tunes.  I recently dropped my beloved ipod and now it's BROKEN!!! so today I will BUY a zen nano until i'm able to get it repaired...if i get it repaired b/c the zen nano will do the job just fine. Buying batteries isn't such a big deal for us..our office supplies bulk batteries and we use those..shhh. each player has its own pros and cons for battery life vs rechargable in a portable player..so weigh your options and decided what's best for you!

<Title>Great, Solid product.  Great for Audiobooks
<Date>Fri Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I spent a good deal of time trying to find my perfect MP3 player.  realized it doesn't exist.  but here was my criteria list 1. Plays Mp3 AND WMA's 2. at least 1 gig 3. less than $200 4. FM Radio (which records) 5. AM Radio (which records) 6. Small 7. good battery life 8. Pause track when turned off. 9. Superb sound quality and loud enough. Well, NO mp3 players have AM radio functionality unfortunately.  Other than that, this little puppy is nothing less than a marvel! small as a cigarrette lighter, it slides easily into any pocket.  i read some complaints about the battery compartment, and it's not the best, but it comes with a rubber case, which covers the battery compartment completely, and the best part about the case, is it doesn't interfere with any of the buttons!  I keep mine in it's case all the time, and i tuck the earbud cord under the clip so it won't rip out of the player.  Which brings me to the only downside the earbuds.  HUGE!  however, do yourself a favor, shell out 20 bucks and buy the KOSS Spark Plugs.  They are so comfortable you don't notice them in and the bass is fantastic on them.  I was also pleasantly suprised when i changed the battery out it held my place on my book!  Don't hesitate with this player.

<Date>Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>&#65279;I was very satisfied with this player while it was operating: however, after about 6 months of use the player wigged out on me.  The volume control became non-functioning and music would bellow out of the left speaker while nothing at all sounded from the right.  Nothing I could do could resolve this issue. I tried everything from adjusting the player utilizing the menu screen to updating the firmware.  My efforts were futile.  I thought it was a fluke until I was discussing the problem with one of my students and he said that his player had the same problem.  Coincidence, or manufacturing error: It appears to be all to clear to me.  Be forewarned that if you purchase this MP3 player you could either be very happy (as many are and I was) or very disappointed (as others will be and I am).

<Content>I wanted to purchase an MP3 player to use while I was working out in the gym.  I looked at the IPOD, but did not like the fact that you could only download from ITunes or your own CD collection.  So I did some research and found Creative.  This player is ultra compact and lightweight...perfect for the gym.  This little player not only stores lots of music, but has an FM radio and records voice.  The scroll button takes some getting used to; but once you get the feel it is like second nature.  When it comes time to upgrade, I will be looking towards Creative again.  Great product!

<Title>Great product
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this little player.  It's small, light, runs a long time on a single AAA battery, and is user-friendly.  The software was easy enough to figure out, and I found the sound and headphones to be just fine (but then I've never used expensive headphones, so I may not know what I'm missing). The small size makes it easy to put the device in a pocket or carry it around in a small purse when you're not using it.  Recording off the radio works well also.  I have about 350 tracks on the device (and some are considerably longer than 3-4 minutes).  I definitely would recommend avoiding anything smaller than 1 GB if you can help it, though.  The only things I don't like:  the line-in recording does not work on my device. I haven't contacted the company about it because it isn't that important to me, but one of the reasons I chose this particular model was for that feature.  Another thing is that I'd really like it if while it was displaying the song title it would also display the artist.  But that is a very minor matter, and at least the title will display.  Also, the headphones have a very short cord going to the left ear, a very long cord going to the right ear and an overly long cord going to the device, so that is a little strange, but still totally functional.  Overall, I definitely recommend the Nano Plus.  I've had it for a couple months and would buy another for a gift.  It's a great little invention.

<Title>Bookworm in my Ear
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As most reviewers here, I did quite a bit of research before choosing a player.  Unlike most here, I bought it nearly completely for audiobook listening. There was a $100 discount given on Amazon if one signed up for Audible.com for a year and purchased the MP3 player from Amazon.  I happened to luck into that promotion and immediately bought the player.  Best choice I ever made.    I'm a little past middle-aged and not very technically minded.  I did not have a single problem learning how to download audiobooks or music and was tickled that the sound was so clear.  I've listened to about eight books now, downloaded Mindy Smith's album, and bought some music from Walmart.com, and have not had a single problem.  I did notice that sometime it bookmarked my place in a book and sometimes it didn't.  Paolini's Eragon had no bookmarks, A Changed Man did.  I think that's the recording's choice, not the player's misstep, however.  Anyway, if someone out there is interested in listening to an audiobook while working or taking a walk, I would highly recommend the Zen Nano Plus and audible.com.   One complaint:  The belt clip gets pinched just opposite of the on/off button...I quite often turn off the player while squeezing the clip to attach the player to my belt.  Otherwise, I'm in heaven.  I drove to Charlotte last weekend and honestly slowed down a bit so I could have more time to listen to "The Lincoln Lawyer" by Michael Connelly.
