<Title>I'm loving it!
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got this delivered today, and so far I love it!  I have been using Rhapsody for a while now, and so this is a great way to get all that music and take it with me, without having to go through the computer first.  I've already discovered new music that I like - and that to me is the real reward with this guy.  Just pop on rhapsody - it really feels built in and not like some extra step - and look at your playlists or their recommendations or search for something.  Then while you're playing it, find other music by artists like that one.  Even subscribe and download podcasts right from the device.  Very cool!  I like the quality of the screen and menus, too.  Now for the reality of it and the reason it didn't get that last star from me:  Sometimes it hiccups a little and freezes for a few seconds, and the wifi antenna isn't as powerful as it could be - My computer can see my network, but the ibiza can't right now.  The touchpad and entering text, especially on the web browser, could be improved.  Sometimes I miss the line I'm trying to hit.  I'd like to be able to rate albums and artists like you can in Rhapsody (but I can always do that from my computer).  And the looks aren't top-notch, but I am happy with the general feeing of the construction.  I expect to be listening to my new music on the ibiza instead of my ipod.    I just wish I knew how to pronounce the name!!

<Title>nothing but praise
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm so happy I purchased an Ibiza. Subscription-based Rhapsody has always been a better fit for me than iTunes, and I love having it with me wherever I go. Any time I think of a song or album I want to hear, I connect to Rhapsody and I'm listening to it in no time. When I don't have access to a wireless network (my office for example), I have thousands of downloaded tracks to keep me entertained.  The interface is great too. The designers did a nice job of anticipating what someone might want to do next, and the display is crisp and attractive. The only item on my wish list so far is to have the ability to view albums by genre.  I haven't experimented with the other options such as video, photos or Internet, so I don't know how well those measure up to the music feature. But bottom line, this is the MP3 player I've been waiting for.

<Title>Product Arrived DOA
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Like all things in life there is good and bad news about this product. The good news is that it represents the best bang for the buck in terms of features right now. This is true if you subscribe to the Rhapsody streaming music service. the units strength is its the ability to stream music and take advantage of most of the Rhapsody website without requiring a computer. The graphic user interface for streaming is very nice and the ability to transfer tunes to the unit both through hard wire USB cable and wirelessly is what sets this unit apart from the current competition. Unfortunaely, my unit arrived essentially DOA. It frooze during the intial firmware update, while streaming music from the Rhapsody service, and while playing tunes from the units internal hard disk. You can see from the Haier Support Forum, although this unit has only been available for a limited time, many consumers are having reliability problems (at least with the hard disk version of the player). When I spoke with Hassan at Haier support he spent most of the call telling me how many tech support companies he has worked for and bad mouthed Dell computers rather than addressing the issue with the defective Ibiza. When I pointed this out to him he agreed the unit needed repair. He did not offer to send me a new replacement unit. He also mentioned that it would take about 3 weeks to get the unit back to me. I also needed to send a fax to the Corporate department with my receipt before they could begin the authorization process. Don't get me wrong, I love the promise of what the Ibiza can deliver. For that reason I spoke with Amazon and they immediately agreed to send me a replacement unit. They even said they would send out the replacement before they received my defective unit in the mail. Now that is customer service. I am just keeping my fingers crossed that the repalcement unit is problem free.

<Title>Amazing player with great features!
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received the Ibiza for Christmas, and not having much experience with MP3 players other than the Ipod wasn't sure what to expect, but since I used Rhapsody to download music and burn CD's I was delightfully surprised when I unwrapped this little gem, I had no idea there was a device for Rhapsody users, and having bought Haier products I knew it would be well made, just how well made was an even more pleasant surprise!  The Wi-fi feature makes it so easy to download and listen to music from the Rhapsody site, the bluetooth is awesome, I bought a headset that works simultaneously with my phone so when I get a call it automatically pauses the Ibiza so I can take my call!  It comes with different free airskins so you can change the background on the screens as well.  It comes with a 30 day free trial of Rhapsody, but I already had the service and just upgraded to Rhapsody-to-go, which for only $14.99 a month you get unlimited downloads, nothing more to purchase.  I haven't tried the video feature yet, still enjoying the ease of use of downloading and enjoying all the music I now have at my fingertips, whether it be through the website or ripping from my own cd collection.  The Ibiza makes the Ipod obsolete, in my opinion, I'm with the one reviewer who is wanting accessories:  so am I!  Please come out with a docking station and a holder/case, there is a really nice looking holder/case on the Haier website but I can't find it anywhere online, this is fairly new so I'm being patient, but hurry up!

<Title>Closest thing to perfect
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been using this player for about a week now. For players in the "Rhapsody compatible" category that I've tried - this is hands down the best. I've gone down the list of iRiver alternatives - all the way to the first gen Clix. They all pale in comparison. Dealing with the "plays for sure" cluginess quickly became ridiculous.   Right out of the box I was able to connect to my Rhapsody account and start streaming music in just a couple of minutes. The player is immediately ready to use when plugged in to the wall charger. The user interface is extremely intuitive. While you are listening to a streaming tune - there's a one click option to store it to your device via wireless connection. Simple as that - no jumping through hoops! You can even download entire albums at a time.   For mass downloads i.e. downloading your entire Rhapsody library - you'll be better off connecting to a PC. The USB transfer rate and drag and drop interface make it the only sensible way to do this. I moved over approximately 8GB of my rhapsody library in just over  3 hours - much of the time was spent by Rhapsody downloading the tracks locally before it made the transfer to the device.   The touch pad was surprisingly effective. I was skeptical at first but after using it I can honestly say it rivals the iPod wheel.   If you are looking for a Rhapsody compatible player - there really is no other player that can compete with the level of integration the ibiza has. "Plays for sure" was a nice idea - but to get to where the user experience is on a level with the iPod and iTunes - this is appears to be the way to get there.

<Title>Awesome true WiFi media player
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Awesome media player that isn't an iPod.  Finally, a media player that has true WiFi with no strings attached and no WiFi limitations.  I can download music from any WiFi hotspot, play it whenever and where-ever I want to, and never have to connect it to my PC.  No crippled WiFi, like other wanna-be's.

<Title>Revolution in PMP!
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is the first player I've ever used that doesn't really need a PC !  just enable wifi, hook into them Rhapsody channels and click away when you hear anything you like or just listen for hours browsing through the artists' bios and simular music that it keeps suggesting you.  really great experience, highly recommended!  now got to install an A2DP Bluetooth adapter (or car stereo) in the car to make it magically play without any wires there :-)

<Title>cool wifi and Rhapsody power packed
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>nice, nice nice device with mad wifi capabilities. Seems a little slow and not huge battery life, adequate at best. What sets this apart from other MPs is its Rhapsody integration, and ability to sync locally-owned music to device using WMP 11 so quickly! One thing: where is equalizer!?!  Pretty cool overall. No regrets on the purchase. I love Rhapsody, and this devices knows it inside and out. Audio isn't perfect, but I 99% goodness and 1% popping and occasional burps I can live with.

<Title>outstanding
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is an outstanding player that does it all. With a great screen and features. the wireless connect to Rhapsody is amazing, it updates player and renews licenses with out connecting to your PC. The ease of use and touch pad makes it easy to scroll.  They way the Album art appears in dual background is really cool. Soubd quality is outstanding, earbuds come with 3 different sizes so they are very comfortable.  Puts the iPod to shame.

<Title>Love it
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm almost 70 years old and wanted an I-Pod or something similar to listen mostly to podcasts and secondarily to music and FM radio.  I've never owned an I-Pod before so don't have a great basis to compare with.  But I do love the Ibiza Rhapsody.  I didn't care for the provided earbuds because after a while they hurt my ears.  But I found a nice headset from Wal-Mart for $7 that's just perfect because the "buds" don't stick inside the ear but rest on the outside (they're secured by an ear loop).  The quality of the music is astonishing to me.  Fats Domino never sounded better (told you I was 69!).  I was mostly super pleased at the wide variety of podcasts that were available and that I could load onto the Rhapsody with just a click--and no PC needed.  I like downloading all that are of potential interest to me and then deleting them after I've listened to them.  One last, big point for me.  I got the Ibiza for Christmas and four days later it stopped working.  Amazon shipped me a new one even before they had the "broken" one picked up from me.  I didn't have to do anything and had a replacement within a few days.  The "new" one has worked perfectly.  And with this kind of service available from Amazon, why would you ever order an Ibiza anywhere else?  Hope my experience helps you make a decision.  I'm thrilled!

<Title>truely inspiring
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>OK PC mag and the rest hear this. Finally a truly awesome player with all the bells and whistles and it actually works flawless. The best of the bunch. I have wasted a lot of money and returned the bad. It doesn't freeze up and glitch like many of the so called ipod wanna be models. This one is actually much better than my 60 gig 5th gen ipod. It's a little pricey yeh but if you like Rhapsody this is it.period end of story.

<Title>Spot on features and design
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As were many others, I was reluctant to purchase an MP3 player from a company that normally manufactures microwave ovens, dehumidifiers, and other home appliances.  I watched reviews and comments about the ibiza for a month before jumping in.  I've owned several hard drive MP3 players in the last year, culminating in an Archos 504 WiFi that was working pretty well for me until Urge and Rhapsody merged, and I lost a compatible subscription based music service.  The Haier Ibiza is the first player I've owned that hits every major requirement I have.  Subscription based music with a broad, deep catalog, unprotected music, unrestricted WiFi, bluetooth, a reasonable, quick, well designed UI, etc.  Additionally, the development team at VariaMobile, the folks who are developing the software for this device have taken a very open, community driven approach to making this device better.  Downside?  There are no accessories yet, (specifically a docking station).  The player cannot be used while connected USB to your computer, (my previous Archos models would prompt, asking if it should connect, or simply charge).    Haier and Varia have put together a potent combination of features that more than justify the price, (some have complained it is too expensive).  Anyone looking for a player that does music, subscriptions, and pod-casts will not be disappointed.  I haven't even dug into the video features yet.

<Title>Product Defective & Ordered Replacement (To be continued)
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Product came out of the box defective.  Static on playback due to some problem with the audio output connection.  At first, other than the static that could be adjusted away, it performed fine.  However, just a  week after purchase, the second problem came during downloading Rhasody Channels.  When downloading the channels, the unit froze.  I disconnected from the computer, and rebooted, and it seemed fine.  After that, it never turned on again without a fatal error message, and was inoperable.  I am in the process of returning and replacing, and will see if the replacement works properly.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XRQ2Q6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-4752004-4741501">ibiza Rhapsody H1A030BK 30 GB Wi-Fi/MP3 Player by Haier (Black)</a>

<Content>This is a perfect device for me.  I wanted a way to easily find new music to download play in my car and at work.  This device provides this with the Rhapsody service available via wireless networks.  The rhapsody service has had almost every artist I have searched for.  This device has a few bugs, but they should be fixed in the next firmware release coming out soon.

<Title>Very Easy to Use
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My wife has had several MP3 players but the difficulty in using the player has kept her from enjoying them.  The Ibiza has solved all these problems.  No more need to connect via a computer to sync music.  With the built in Wifi she can just browse the Rhapsody catalog and download almost any song right to the device.  She can also stream a Rhapsody channel and with the push of one button she can download that song to the player to listen to later.  This is the easiest to use PMP I've seen yet.  Rhapsody subscription music licenses are automatically updated when the device finds a previously used Wifi cnnection and it also updates itself via Wifi when new firmware is available.  So simple and effortless.  Speaking of easy, setting up the Wifi connection was simple as was pairing the stereo bluetooth headphones.  The only drawback to this device is i is slightly bulky (about the size of an IPod classic). If you like Rhapsody this is the best PMP available to date.
