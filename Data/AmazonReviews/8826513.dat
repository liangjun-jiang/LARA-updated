<Product Name>COBY MP-C858 - Digital player / radio - flash 512 MB - MP3
<Title>Will not play DRM files

<Content>I bought this MP3 player to play audio books from the library I can downlowd from their site.  The files download just fine but when I go to play them it just skips around randomly making it impossible to listen to the story.  I tried to return it and unfortunately this is not covered under their warranty and my 30 days are up for amazon.         
<Overall>1
