<Content>Do not buy the iPod Classic!! While this iPod offers the basic benefits of the iPod family, Apple has made one, Microsoft-worthy, change.  The only component cables that will work (especially the video/AV/component cables) are the $50 (or more) Apple brand cables.  They have inserted an "authentication chip" requirement into the firmware.    If you notice, the 5th and 5.5 generation iPods (not the newest 6th gen. Classic) are more expensive for a reason: They're LESS RESTRICTIVE.   After-market cables (such as Belkin/Griffin/Etc) will not allow video output from the Classic to TVs.   If Apple introduces a firmware change to allow ALL video cables to be used, then you should consider this one...otherwise, stay with the 5th/5.5 generation units.

<Title>Decisions, decisions..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had my 3rd gen ipod for 4 years, holding out on a video ipod until for a larger screen.  I was torn when Apple released the full-screen flash memory based 'touch' with 16gig max (less than my old 20gig full with music files), and the small-screen hard-drive 'classic' with up to 160gig. Maybe the full-screen and hard-drive together would wear too much on a battery?   I decided I would be annoyed with 16gig, managing which files to load.  I have a Blackberry, and get enough internet, without being limited to wi-fi, plus all my work mail and calendar are tied to that. The bigger touch screen was not worth it for me, and I could not wait for another upgrade.   Because of an Amazon delivery est. 4-7 weeks out, I canceled my order for an 80gig, went to Apple instead(free shipping), and ordered the 160gig.  160gig does not seem extreme.  There is always something new to fill space.  Higher quality music and videos, backups, games etc..  Plus the apple-site shows the 160gig battery has about an extra 30% play-time than the 80gig (apple site Classic tech specs).   Had to pay sales tax, but got free engraving.  Used that to add 'return to' with my name and email on the device.  That gives the honest majority of our population the chance to get it back to me, and the less classy folks will need to scratch up or hide the back side.  **update** I now have it in hand and stick with my 4-star pre-review.   I got it loaded fine, including new videos I had in anticipation, and many photos from my pc -all of which barely made a dent in the space.  The options are very easy to manage in iTunes.  I like you can choose full-photo vs. ipod-veiwing-photo file sizes. Old news to many of you though. Of course I went full-sized, I have 160gig now, and this is a great way to back up those pics. Actually I have 148.79 available space.  Everything looks good and runs smoothly, so I'm not griping about the space the os/software used up.   I like the album art display on the menu and songs.  Things like that don't matter in the big picture to most people, but those types of touches make Apple products seem a little more friendly. I am jumping from a monochrome music-only ipod, so for me this is a major upgrade.   It does have the search option, but typing in a word by scrolling around a click wheel is not much faster than working through the menu. It also has a few games loaded, clock/alarm, a lock code setting, notes and calendar you can load from your pc/mac.  I like the stopwatch, which dispays an old analog version.  Using a stopwatch makes even boring activities seem more like an event. The only real rub with this is the 'TV-out' (video output)option is locked to 'off'.  I had seen a 50buck cable for sale from Apple so I knew I could do it(cnet claimed video-out had been removed), but I read on a rumor-site that you will now be forced to use the Apple licensed component-cable in order to enable the video out.  Fine, it comes with some other adapter stuff, so I'll do it, but their availability is 3-4 weeks.  I do love this device, and appreciate how far we've come since reel-to-reel and projectors, but not getting a hard-drive in the the 'touch', and not having the video cable (and many games) ready for launch takes a star off. *** Update 2 *** Well, I had it stolen already.  Hope the engraving somehow causes the perps some pain.  Smashed my car window at church and grabbed my bag.  I was dumbfounded.  I did an on-line police report and tried to get my serial number from the Apple registration.  Could find no way to veiw previous registrations, and the email confirming the registration didn't have it.  Without the ipod connected to iTunes there appears to be no way to see it there either.  I easily signed on to Garmin and got my gps s/n (they got that too), so I don't know why apple would make it so difficult.  My wife found it printed on the box.  Good old printed ink.  Writing it down may be a good idea.  Maybe this is gods way of telling me to get the touch?

<Title>Prefer Touchscreen
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I prefer the touchscreen, at least over the scrollwheel, simply because the scrollwheel is too imprecise, and it's hard to get to deeply nested items.  I've been happily using a 1 gig (yes, that's one gig) device for almost 2 years now, and have been anticipating moving up to an 8 gig device, so moving to a 16 gig device seems downight exciting.  16 gigs holds 192 CD's at 196 kbps, mp3. Does anyone realize this? I don't have that many CD's, and a lot I don't listen to anymore anyway, and even when you include some converted mixed-tapes and long podcasts, which I need to "recycle" anyway, 16 gigs is, quite frankly, great. I can't imagine having to manage 160 gigs of music, what with al the tagging and converting of files - sounds like a nightmare, and intrudes on the listening experience.  The touch is definitely a breakthrough.

<Title>IPOD 30G + Video Problem
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received an iPod for Christmas 2006, and lately it has been cutting out about 1/2 second, I estimate, randomly. I emailed Apple on their incredibly confusing website, saying let me know how to get this fixed under the one-year warranty. I actually did get a response, but: get this: they'll cover it under warranty, but the shipping and handling would be $31.65!!! I emailed them back complaining, saying it's too much, and that I'll just live with it and buy a Zune next time. I never got a response other than the usual offers to buy more Apple stuff, now that they have my email address!!! BE CAREFUL with this company!!

<Title>Don't buy a special offer from Apple
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Foolish me, I just followed Apple's invitation a few weeks ago to buy their 80 GB iPod classic in flashy, greasy, view-all-fingerprints black finish. What I paid for that meager package (not even including a decent power supply for the wall outlet included, not colormatching white USB cable and white earphones!), was way much than their new classic models. And now this! Apple is fooling us with dumping prices of iPhones and iPods much lower than they offered just a few weeks as "special offer". Yes, their offers are special, but in a manner that I will probably never ever buy an Apple product again. Foul Apple.   BTW: Guess, the new iPod 160GB features a bigger, more power-consuming hard disk drive. So: more memory, less running time (about 8 hours less compared to the 80 GB model), and of course no way to replace the battery yourself?

<Content>I like almost everything about iPods, but I can not STAND having to use iTunes...it is a total pain in the behind...If Apple would allow the iPod to just look like a hard drive to my computer I would be all over this thing. I started with a 30 gig iRiver which I loved but out grew. Now I have an 80 gig Archos 504 which is good but a bit large.  When I first got my iRiver I used iTunes software and it drove me batty...Come on Apple!! Free up...let folks use iPods as little HD and you will lose your competitors but until then....

<Title>a "fascinating" device
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This small, portable music player is quite fascinating. It is composed of a synthetic byproduct of petroleum, known by most as plastic, though the exterior shell seems to be composed of a thin sheet of brushed aluminium (Ai, atomic number 13). The "plastic" from which this device is constructed appears to be of the highest quality, however, when closely observed, I found it to be softer than desired, thus, it scratches easily. It plays music that is downloaded to it via a computer, either Macintosh or PC. This may be a deterrent to those of you who do not own a computer. When playing the music, it uses small phonic devices inserted into the ears. These are called "headphones". Due to the nature of these "headphones," dogs cannot listen to your music. When listening to the music, I found it to be of satisfactory quality. This device has a large storage capacity which is its primary selling point. If you buy this device, you should be sure to have music to download to it, otherwise, there will be nothing to listen to. The music that I recommend is Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and Puccini. I find this music to be of superior quality, and worthy of listening to.

<Title>I've got one!!! Size matters..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok guys, I just picked up my silver iPod classic 160gb from the Apple store on Regent Street in London so I can give an actual review on it.  I've had an 80GB video iPod for a year and it's already full, so I was really hoping Apple would make an iPod big enough for me. Presently I've got 110GB (and counting) of music, so this iPod is for people like me who have a large music collection, and who like to be able to take it anyplace.  The 160GB iPod is the same size as the 80gb, but costs less than the 80GB did when it first came out.  With a brushed aluminium front finish (similar to the 2 and 3G Nanos), it should be less prone to scratching, though the back is the same smudge magnet, and I don't know how resilient the screen is. The front is curvier than that of the last 2 video iPods, with the screen slightly depressed from the rest of the casing.  Additional features are extra long battery life (40 hours for music, 7 hours for video; I've tested this and playing music non stop without much fast forwarding, etc, it's about right), and cover flow (a fun way of scrolling through for music using album cover art, though it is a bit sluggish).   The new split-screen interface lists functions to the left half of the screen, and symbols (or previews of content such as cover art, videos or photos shown as a slide show) to the right as you scroll through the functions. Neat!!  During music playback, after being idle for about 80 seconds, the screen goes gray and displays a clock, and battery power. Viewing tracks in an album also gives you, at a glance, the track times. Same for video. A nice touch. To my hearing, the sound quality (without equalizers, mind you) is improved; more bass and a bit more treble. The iPod turns off in about 2 seconds, much faster than previous models.  It's still got the other regular features; album track lyrics (new, nicer text font, and it also shows the album art), can play video and games, store photos, contacts, calendar, notes, stopwatch, and screen lock (which allows you to lock the screen with a password), and it can be used as an external hard drive. It shows up in windows explorer as an external drive. The search feature allowing one to type in album/song/artist titles (introduced in the last video iPod) is still there, but relocated to the "music" menu. I didn't spot it at first. In fact, the menu has been reshuffled to make it better, and (under settings) one can now view number of songs, videos, photos, etc graphically just like in iTunes.  If you need loads of space for your music collection, you can't go wrong getting this. Judging from the crowds in the store, Apple's got another hit here. Now if only the iPod touch had this much memory...

<Title>Finally, more than 80GB!
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>20 years worth of CD purchases filled my current 60GB iPod long ago, with another 25GB still waiting to go onto the first iPod that would break at least 100GB.  Glad it finally arrived with some room to spare, but hope it does a better job of navigating that quantity of artists/songs/etc than the 60GB did.  Hope it sounds better, too.  After all, that's what it's for.  I'm not ready to give up the click wheel for on-screen nav, but was impressed with the responsiveness of an iPhone I tried (and I'm brutally critical).  Still, you can feel and control the click wheel when you're not looking at the device (in your backpack, in the car) and you can't do that with a glossy screen on the iTouch.

<Title>Absolutely stunning (I own this product)
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>UPDATE after 2 weeks use:  One feature that makes it all worth it for me: switching the shuffle mode between albums/songs/off while in shuffle mode. Let's say I have 10,000 songs on shuffle, and I hear a song by Nirvana that gets me in the mood to listen to more Nirvana...I click the middle button 3X and switch random to "Album". Now I'm going to listen to the rest of the album. Before, I had to go to Menu, scroll to Music -> Albums, scroll 500 album names to letter N, then choose album. Can't believe reviewers overlooked this feature.  I insist the sound quality is very good. The new DAC is different than the previous gen iPods, but by no means worse. Sound quality is subjective and depends on many factors including genre, encoding, headphones, hearing loss etc. In my isolated case, I noticed a slight improvement in treble and a huge improvement in bass. The 5.5 gen 80gb used to wash out the bass. Mids and overall dynamic range is just about the same.  ------------------------------  Pros:  - For MP3's encoded in 192kbps, you can fit roughly 27,000 on here - about .08 inches thinner than 5.5 gen 80gb iPod - sweet finish on the front - center button is a little concave and feels better - coverflow is great eyecandy, let's leave it at that =) - new interface for every menu is very intuitive and stylish - battery life is AMAZING - 10000 songs and 6 movies later it's not even half full - sound quality is great, no need for eq imo(using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGLZUE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-8782139-7500665">Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones</a> ) - when music is playing and the screen in dim, you see the battery charge and clock in large numbers  Cons:  - Coverlow only organized by artist, can't do by album (or at least can't figure this out yet) - Great theft potential - Back still scratches easily - iTunes is not exactly the best software ever written for windows  Notes:  No, this mp3 player is not perfect, but it's way up there when compared to other players overall. Obviously you won't get $100 headphones included. Yes, iTunes is clunky and there are better ways to organize your music, and you have to convert all your movies...at the end of the day: it's small, it's easy, it's cool and it will play you media really really well.

<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Pros: I had the first generation IPOD Nano 4GB before I bought this one. My music collection has grown so large that I need an mp3 player with a bigger storage capacity, which this IPOD delivers. I can now play all my music video on this IPOD too, and the video quality is great (provided that you start with a good quality music video in the first place). I also like the new IPOD surface too since now I don't see my fingerprints all over the place.  The Cons: The downside to this IPOD is it often freezes on me. I don't mean once or twice, but almost every time I connect it to my laptop. So it becomes an annoyance to me. Sure I can unfreeze it but why do I have to do this often? I've never had this problem with my old Nano and it seems like this problem is faced by newer generations IPOD (I have a friend who just bought the new Nano and it freezes on her several times already).

<Title>Good and Bad
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok The Ipod Classic's are a step forward and a step back. First Apple purposely disabled the video out feature unless you use their cables. This is all for more Dollars which for how much these things cost and the money they make off them is just ridiculous. I have had several problems with this new Ipod from syncing errors to general data issue's I bought one of the first released so I believe it had to do with that since I got that unit replaced it has been fine. The Cover Flow is neat I don't know why people complain about it if you don't like it don't use it. So the good with the new Ipod models would have to be the space and then the cover flow feature which I like. The Negative points are as always - apple, their customer service, and the disabling of the video out for third party devices - just underhanded. It is still a great device so if you are not to upset about having to spend 50 dollars on cables than it will be a good bet for you.

<Content>This is iPod #2 for me.  I'm one of those people who likes to have *way* too much music at hand at all times.  I filled up my 60Gig iPod, so I gave it to my wife, who has about 3 CDs she likes, and moved up to this thing.  I use the video function very rarely, but it *is* nice to take a movie along for long layovers in the airport or to have instead of renting a movie in a hotel.  I mainly listen to the iPod when I walk to work, or in the gym.  I hate going to the gym, so an audiobook on iPod makes that experience much better.  I'm very pleased with this iPod.  I use Sony ELP828 earbuds rather than the ones that came with it because a)I don't want advertise to the world that I've got an iPod, and b)They're really good and not terribly expensive (I have a cat that thinks they're food).  Be sure to buy a good case with a belt clip.

<Title>Lots of Problems
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I will go straight to the details as to why this unit sucks:  The software called iTunes will frequently duplicate songs and waste space.  The unit itself is prone to not being recognized by Windows XP, so there is frequently no sync available, so....when sync is not available, you cannot upload new songs into your ipod.  When plugging in your ipod, iTunes will tell you that the ipod needs to either re-enter all the songs, or reformat the whole ipod.  When you "restore" your ipod (according to the will of iTunes), nothing happens afterwards except an ipod with no songs in it....and trying to put the songs back into the ipod...i'm still trying. Help!  Getting help (help!) from iTunes is impossible, but I'm still trying.  Managing more than one ipod's music in your pc is problematic and prone to glitches. I heard it's easy to manage multiple ipods if you have a Mac.  If you are still thinking of getting an mp3 player, the most trouble-free is the Creative Zen Microphoto (8gb), and the Sandisk Sansa Clip (2gb) that holds 1000 songs.    If you do decide on getting an ipod, make sure you save the music on cd's (burn them to cd).

<Title>What went wrong???
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have a 40GB iPod Classic.  It's a breeze to use, an excellent product, and I love it.  It's full, so I wanted to upgrade to the 160GB.  What a disaster!  Apple was in a hurry to get this one out.  It shipped with a bad software version, so the first thing you're stuck with is updating the software, but there's a glitch:  You can't download the new software without jumping through a bunch of hoops to disable firewalls and other stuff on your computer.  That required a lengthy tech call.  After downloading the software, I tried to sync it up.  It would load a few MB and then freeze.  Several more tech calls and hours of wasted time (including reimporting my library and reformatting the iPod)and it still kept freezing.  Bottom line:  This piece of junk doesn't work with its own software and is nothing but a headache.  Apple should be ashamed.  They had a corner on the market and a reputation for excellence, and they blew it.  Keep your money until they remove their heads from their posteriors.

I'm music centric and don't care about the video or game functions. All I was expecting was the same device, albeit with more storage capacity.  The cover flow is superflous to me: nice but unneccesary.  This device is virtually the same size as my 80, but feels smaller and a bit heavier in the hand. So far I like it.  Too early to say I love it in the way that I love my 80.  The five stars are for IPOD itself.

<Title>CONSUMER ALERT
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item last week to upgrade my ipod 80gb (great item!!!). I found the sound on the classic VASTLY INFERIOR to the old ipod.  I thought it might have been my imagination but after cruising some websites, I discovered that APPLE is using another chip that deteriorates the sound in  significant way.  I found the sound of the Classic to be thin and shrill compared to the older one and not nearly as warm and "clean." (I mostly listen to Jazz and classical) Again, I thought this might be my imagination but apparently other purchasers have had a similar experience. I'll be returning mine.

<Title>Excellent sound quality, and the 160GB are a treat
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had the previous 60GB video iPod, and the additional 100GB comes very handy as I only use Apple lossless compression. What I did not expect is the much better sound quality on the new iPod. I did A-B comparison and the classic's sound quality is first rate and much more musical. I guess the DAC must have been improved. For info, I use the excellent Shure ES500 headphone. Most of my music is apple lossless compression. I never use MP3, as it throws away too much information, even at the highest setting (320kbps).  The interface is very intuitive, as usual, and fast. The screen is much brighter. The search option is very handy to locate album or song. A big plus too.

<Title>  Re: Ipod classic TV out problem 
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple has intentionally disabled the Video Out button on the Classic models.  Spend more, get less features.  I am shocked to hear that Apple will treat so poorly those who shell out $349 for a 160 GB Classic. I contacted the Geek Squad none of the salespeople or support team had a clue that Apple had disabled the video out feature. They pushed every available button before contacting Apple to find out that Apple has disabled a basic feature available on all prior video Ipods. I had stopped at Circuit City first and had the same experience there.  I would not have bought this so quickly had I known that Apple disabled the video out capability. The video settings menu is still there, but all the clicking in the world will not change OFF to Ask or On. Apple will soon be selling a $49 accessory to allow some limited output of video. I already own the Icuiti IWear. Memorex and Virtual Reality Ipod video accessories, all now rendered useless by this greedy move on Apple's part. We all expect value-added from Apple, not elimination of a basic feature. Shame on you, Apple and Steve Jobs.

<Title>Great size and hard drive capacity
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is pretty much the best iPod based on it's value. I did notice that they didn't include the soft slip case this time, like they did with the 5th generation iPods. They also took out the video out feature, which I think was a bad move on them. I do like the new interface though, they also added the cover flow feature. They include a nice shiny metal case when you get the iPod. I did end up buying a case for mine. I didn't mind buying one since I didn't pay for my iPod. And BTW for those wondering how I got my iPod classic go here: flingk.com/n21v9v1  I was amazed how thin the iPod Classic is considering how much space it holds. I do think it is better than the other iPods based on how much you end up paying.

<Content>Apple is pulling a clasiic Microsoft tactic here by making the 6th gen ipods NOT backward compatible for no apparent reason other than to force you to pay more to upgrade your OS and docking stations / cables.  Plus, the 5.5 gen is faster, and better assembled.  From what I am reading here, alot of others are saying the same thing.  Don't buy this item.  Buy a 5.5 gen instead.

<Title>Severely disappointed
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I thought long and hard before purchasing this iPod. Before, I had always used a Creative Zen Micro and was quite fond of it until I ran out of space. Then, I was torn between the iPod classic and the Zen W. I decided to give Steve Jobs a chance and shelled out $350 for the iPod.  Within about a week of purchasing it, it had a problem. It froze up for no apparent reason but maybe 12 hours later, it decided it wanted to work again. Then, I was quite pleased with it. The sound quality seemed good, the graphics on the screen were crisp and clear, it scrolled quickly, and overall, it worked very well.  One day when I plugged it into the computer, however, and downloaded and installed the required update, the screen suddenly went black. The iPod would not turn on and didn't respond to being plugged into the computer. I had not dropped it or mishandled it in any way. The support section of the Apple website was very unhelpful, and nothing I tried had any effect. Defeated, I called Apple. Apparently, spending $350 on one of Apple's products does not mean I am important enough to talk to a living, breathing person. After attempting to explain my problem to a computerized recording which basically told me to repeat all the steps I had already tried, I was told to send my iPod back to Apple so they can repair it--a process that will take, in total, about two weeks.  The iPod is wonderful when it works, but as soon as it has a problem there is no help for it. Do yourself a favor--avoid Apple and buy a Zen.

<Title>What's the point of upgrading to an inferior version?
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the 160GB version as an upgrade to my 5th generation Ipod Video with 60Gb of storage.  Sounded reasonable at the time.  I purchased a $340 Harman Kardon Go & Play to use as not only a sound system, but to use in the classroom when showing videos I purchased from Itunes and other educational sources.  It was very nice having my library of videos for class on my Ipod.  I figured the additional storage on the new unit would be extra nice.  So, imagine my surprise when the 6th generation Ipod is no longer compatible with the HK Go&Play because they've disabled the Video Out feature.  Now mind you, Apple is still advertising the Go & Play on their website as being compatible.  Ipod compitable logos are misleading.  Don't assume. . .  I contacted Harman Kardon and had an opportunity to speak to one of their techs who indicated that Apple decided to share the design changes just before releasing the new 6th Generation Ipods, leaving their engineers absolutely no time to process or adjust to the changes.  Intentional?  I guess if it boosts Apples sales of proprietary cables and docks, then probably.  I also noticed the sound on the 6th generation wasn't quite as refined as my 5th generation Ipod playing through the Go&Play.  More research online talks about sound compression modifications.  For anyone who has the Go&Play, you know what an amazing sound system it is.  It picked up the changes in the 6th Generation very clearly.  What a disappointment.  I also need to mention that having the video capability on the very costly Go&Play helped me justify the steep price and sold me on it. . .not much good now though. . .    I've owned every generation of Ipod that has come out and I'm amazed they would do this to their line.  What makes things worst is they've kept things very quiet to the point that their own technical suppport people are unaware of the changes and handle people like you and me who think the unit is broken, as just that. . .a defective unit.  You'll spend a fair amount of time on the phone with their people trying to figure out what's wrong with your unit when it basically amounts to Apple's irresponsible design change.  Until you do the research online, you won't know any better.  They released the 6th Generation sometime around early Fall. It's now almost February and it's amazing how few staffers know how to deal with the issues when customers start to complain.  There stores continue to sell you items that don't work with the 6th Generation Ipod because they haven't a clue. . .One additional note, if you've enjoyed the ability to fix minor things with your Ipod, like battery replacement or hard drive replacement, those days are also gone.  It wasn't so much an issue of getting rid of the white color of the Ipod, but designing a case that would have to be destroyed before it could be openned by someone like you or me.  Rumor has it that when it does need something as minor as a battery replacement, you'll need to take it to an Apple store where they'll exchange it for a "refurbished" unit.  My loyalty to Apple ends as of now.  I've taken back the Ipod and will continue to do what I can to maintain my 5th generation. . .which will be a very sad day when it finally goes to rest.  In the meantime, I hope that people initiate a class action lawsuit or the open source community makes it a mission to put Apple in it's place.  I'll be first in line to contribute to the cause.

<Title>Apple nailed it
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my 7th Ipod purchase.  Kept needing more and more storage space.  I've sold or given some of the others away and never had a real problem with any of them.  The Ipods all scratch way too easily.  You need to put it into a protective case as soon as you take it out of the factory packaging.  Otter Box makes some secure, sturdy, albeit bulky cases that have the added feature of waterproofing yor Ipod.  Now let's recognize that there are militant Apple people out there as well as Apple Haters.  I'm neither and will be as objective as possible.    The 160 GB Ipod does everything it is supposed to, and does it pretty well.  If you listen with ear bud headphones, I don't know that the sonic quality of this generation is any worse (or even different) than the prior ones.  If you connect your Ipod to a serious stereo system, well, I guess "you pays yo' money and yo' take yo' chances."  In my opinion, the Ipod was not designed for that task.  The fact that it is even possible to do that is more a function of aftermarket opportunism than because of anything Apple ever intended or did.  A lot of Apple Hating is probably directed at iTunes and not the Ipod per se (and probably rightfully so).  At any rate, Apple has done some consumer unfriendly things in the name of copyright infringement protection, and so on.  Many of the things iTunes prevents the Ipod user from doing are perfectly legal and sometimes absolutely necessary, like if your computer or HDD crashes, you get a new computer, etc.  A program called MediaWidget, widely available for under $20 obviates most of these Apple imposed undue restrictions and should provide you much happier Ipodding.  Anyway, Ipod 160 GB is the best product of its type available.  You will definitely need a protective case of some type, and the purchase of MediaWidget will greatly decrease the amount of Ipod related profanity. There are also many alternative sites for legally and safely purchasing music other than the Apple Store.  Frostwire is the first to come to mind, but there are many more.  These sites also do not restrict your ability to use the songs you purchase as you wish to, like Apple does.  Add these 3 tips to your Ipod purchase and you can thank me later.

Zune has video out - video remote - is faster than the IPOD - has a bigger and better screen - etc.. Wish I could get my money back for the IPOD. DO NOT BUY the IPOD 160, it is a waste of money.

<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After trying  some cheap MP3 players and discovering that 70% of the accessories are for Apple, I plopped down $350 for n iPod Classic 160GB.  It would hold ll the music I could ever want plus hold movies and play them back at will for the kiddies.  WRONG.  Boy was I wrong.  I had been seriously considering an Archos 605 160GB before this disaster and am now sorry I didn't go that route.   APPLE HAS PURPOSELY CRIPPLED THE VIDEO OUT ON THE 6G CLASSIC IPOD AND ITOUCH UNITS.  THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS WORK IS TO PURCHASE A $50 CABLE FROM APPLE.    They have incorporated a chip in this cable which will enable the video out to function.  This pretty much renders ALL THIRD PARTY ACCESSORIES USELESS (save the $600 B&W Zeppelin) that have a video out port...like my new Athens iVoice speakers, and my highly portable and handy retractable AV cable.  Apple did this quietly and did not even release suitable accessories until months after the iPods were released.  Now I have to spend another $50 on a friggin cable.  Forget about any other accessories.  Who knows what will work and what won't.  If you are considering purchasing an Apple product, I would seriously consider any other brand.

<Title>This is Everything I wanted!
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Apple Ipod Classic is exactly what I wanted in a multimedia player. I wanted to able to listen to music, audiobooks, podcasts, and movies in a compact, portable package. I wanted to be able to carry a large collection of media all at once. I think the 160 gig Ipod Classic is perfect for me. I don't have any plans on using this as a VCR to play movies on the tv. So, I'm not going to buy a $50.00 cable for that. I knew that before I bought this unit. I bought my Ipod the day the Classic was released. I bought a clock radio that works perfectly with it. I read about compatibility in the description of the product. No problems. It docked and it charged up perfectly. When I received my Ipod, I hooked the cord to my laptop and my beautiful silver Classic. It synced just fine, it even added my digital photos to the Ipod. I have added well over 80 gig of music, podcasts, audiobooks, and movies, so I'm glad I decided to purchase the larger Ipod. I still have a lot of space for more. One pleasant surprise for me was the ability to play games. I have bought 5 new ones, so I have a total of 8 now. I really like the game "Phase." I haven't had the problems other people have experienced. I use my Vmoda Red Roxx instead of the earbuds that came with the Ipod. Other than the bad earbuds, my Ipod has been a joy to own. I love my Ipod! I wouldn't trade it for a Zune, or an Archos!

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well, first off, it's my first iPod, so I have no previous experience with iPods hence I can't compare the new to the old. Here's my personal experience.  Pros: I can however say, that my iPod does just what I want it to do. iTunes works fine (a tad sluggish at times, but I guess that's understandable, seeing that there's over 70GB in the library...), I've never had any problems with the player itsself, the battery life is great the capacity leaves nothing to be desired. It's very robust, I dropped it more than 5 times and nothing happened! It's still as good as new. (Well, there's scratches at the back, but that happens to all iPods if you don't buy a cover for them, and even if you do!..)  Furthermore I don't understand people bitching about the slightly laggy coverflow feature... hey... didn't Apple give us a firmware update less than a month after the new iPods first hit stores that completely fixed the problems? There've been several updates since, and I can't say I notice anything being sluggish, or not working as it's supposed to work. Do those people never update their firmware?   The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that I hate the vendor lock... I'd have liked to install Rockbox on it instead of Apple's software, but this is NOT possible on the 6th generation iPods. Thumbs down at that move.  The second reason I've only given it 4 stars is that Apple haven't improved the sound quality yet, customers asking for this for a long, long time. The quality does me, I think it would do most customers, but another thumbs down at Apple for that.  Plus sometimes it takes the iPod a couple of seconds to start playing a track, probably because it has to look for it on the HD, since my music collection is so big.  Otherwise I love the iPod. Plus I like the stickers that come with it.

<Title>Great Battery Life- Poorer Sound Quality Then The 5G iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked one of these up about a week ago.  Battery Life is DOUBLE what my 5G 60 GB unit has.  Unfortunately in a side by side comparison sound quality has degraded significantly compared to my wonderful 2 year old fifth generation unit.  I did some research and found out Apple has completely redesigned the Logic Board and is no longer using the old Wolfson Microelectronics chip.  The new iPod has a dynamically compressed, tinny, metallic sound that can even be heard thru the cheap earphones provided.  There is almost ZERO 3D sense of depth and imaging.  The sound is so horrible compared to 5G that you can tell the difference thru every headphone tested except for Bose which has almost zero high frequency response.  If someone is new to iPod and never owned a fifth generation audiophile quality unit they will probably not have a problem with the sound though.  When I first got the unit it had firmware 1.00 installed and I experienced extremely sluggish menu response.  I updated to 1.01 and response is now much quicker though still not as fast as my 2 year old iPod.  Update:   The latest firmware 1.03 solves the sluggish menu response problem pretty well.   Too bad nothing has been done about the sound quality.

<Title>Avoid if you have an older computer!
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you have an older PC or Mac, avoid the iPod Classic and go for a previous generation of iPod.   The new iPod Classics are serious CPU hogs when they sync with iTunes. On my 1.8ghz iMac G5, for example, syncing my iPod Classic 160gb takes 7 minutes, even when there is nothing new to sync. Throughout that time, my CPU is over 95%, according to Activity Monitor. This is in stark contrast to syncing my other iPods (gen5.5, gen4), where syncing never uses more than 30% of the CPU.  Windows users report similar behavior (Google for "ipod classic sync crash").  So unless you have an Intel-based Mac (or similar post-2006 PC), stick with the earlier iPods.

My total digital content has been increasing exponentially with music, audiobooks, photos, movies, TV shows, podcasts and music videos. This 160 GB model is not really 160GB, in fact it is only 148GB when taken out of the box brand new? It seems sluggish when compared to the 60GB and 80GB 5th gene models.

<Title>Quality but certainly not perfection
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod, but I also understand it's not going to be for everyone. My primary reason for purchasing this product was to store lots of movies and music for travel. If you don't mind the tiny screen, it's great for a personalized flick on the airplane. And my entire music collection fits on the hard drive with a lifetime's growth that could still be added.  I've noticed people complaining about crashes, rebooting and the redesigned thumbwheel. I have no issues with these items. I have no issues with the music quality.  I do not like DRM or the fact that this iPod requires a special $50 cable to activate TV out features. That's a load, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me since I don't really plan on using mine for watching movies on a larger screen. For a man who can remember paying $400 for 4MB of RAM about a decade ago, I feel like I got a decent deal. I'm a fairly satisfied iPod owner.  This iPod will scratch up immediately. It does not come with a protective shell of any kind. I got mine laser etched with "ad vitam paramus" and I like scratches - they add personality like scars do.  Several other notes - at the time of this review many of the old accessories for iPods are NOT COMPATIBLE with the "Classic" - it's particularly important to note that your old docking station isn't going to work with this new iPod. The included headphones for the black model are white. If that's the sort of thing that bothers you, be prepared. I don't use these included headphones because I think they are crappy. I upgraded to black Shure e2c headphones.

<Content>Yes.....iPod created the wave with its beautiful mp3 player line. People loved it and placed complete trust in Apple. What ever comes out of Apple, must be the best and costs reasonably......The business strategy is to take people there before the corporations drop them down and make a helluva lot of money for lesser and lesser. I remember iPods used to come with chargers et. al. which has to be bought seperately now. Now with this jukebox what is called as a 'Classic', No TV out, poorer quality of audio. They brought in a newer and a cheaper chip that is not only a poorer performer but also a feature chopper!! Apple has disabled the TV out in an effort to sell another of their $50 product. AV cables work no more. Tell me something.....why will somebody watch a movie on a 2.5inch screen, unless they are waiting in a stinking airport? I also think their menu-ing system has slowed down a bit. Definitely they have been infected with Microsoft's monopolizing disease.   Here I am one of the first sheep to buy this product.....It is a shame. If you find a 30 or an 80 gb 5.5Gen iPod.....Simply buy it. Run for it since people are drying up this product from the market. I am sure this is an opportunity for other manufacturers to get ahead.

<Title>sluggish UI but larger storage space
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Today I had a chance to play with the new Nano, Classic and the iPhone. Being the techno geek, I have been keeping up to speed on the iPods and after going thru the various functions I have found out the following...  - the iPod classic has a sluggish response UI compared to the previous iPods. Very disappointing. It was more difficult to scroll through the albums and songs compared to the previous iPods. But you have to give Apple credit for the amazing 160GB capacity. - the iPod Nano was as responsive as the previous ones. Very pleasing to the eye and very well designed. But I read about the video out issue where you need to buy a $50 cable to make use of the video-out feature. Is Apple trying to milk the customer up as much as possible before something comes up to take over the iPod market share? - As most of us knows, the iPhone will not work at ALL unless you activate it with the AT&T service (unless you hack it...which turned out to be troublesome after today's Apple software update). The problem with the Touch is that there will be no scheduler feature for the Touch and there are some talks of how the Touch suffers from a "darker" screen compared to the iPhone. I asked about this and the Apple person told me that they heard about the problem but was not sure whether or not Apple would refund/replace the Touch because this was all very "subjective."  How nice of them to screw us.  The iPod is a very very attractive mp3 player to buy, but it seems like it's starting it's descent into ho-hum land.   ** Update: The dark screen issue for the Touch has been fixed with the new update.  It would have been nice for the Apple store person to tell me this when I was asking about this issue on Sept 27th.

<Title>Former Gigabeat owner - converted to iPod, a review
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>majority of negative reviews are based on what the iPod is not, ie - a camera, a tivo replacement, a toaster, a scooter...  Let's focus on what it is - the best digital music SYSTEM on the market.  I was one of the first people to line up and buy a Toshiba Gigabeat MES60.  Great product, great interface, had it for a year.  So whay the switch?  lets focus on the IPod's attributes:  Storage - blows everything out of the water Interface - slight edge to the Windows Mobile, but overall very clean, and easy to use Accesories - when buying a HDD based player - it becomes not just something you take on the road, but an integral part of any home audio system, and lets face it the iPod is miles ahead of anyone here.  it was near impossible to find accessories for my gigabeat. Support - nonexistent for the Gigabeat.  I mean completely nonexistent from day 1.  so even crappy support (which i have not had to use with the iPod yet) is better than none iTunes vs WMP - i think WMP is easier to use and has more features to manage your collection - but this is where Apple really got it right.  While iTunes needs some help - they nailed it when it comes to how you can interface with other content.  it was just simple to subscribe to a podcast, upload a video from my tivo onto the player, and so far i have had no problems interfacing between the systems, not sometihng that i can say was seamless with WMP - definately some panic moments.  overall - 1 week into this - it was the right call.

<Title>Incompatible with Mac OS 10.3, when update is not a sensible choice
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, the iPod itself is a lovely piece of equipment, the functionality I was looking for in a pretty package, at an acceptable price. It could be a nice replacement for the old iPod that I wore out.   But (as of late September 07), buyer beware: it does not work with Mac OS 10.3. Granted, that is not the latest OS, but a reasonable version to run on a home machine. And, updating the OS at the time the iPod Classic is released is not a sensible option, given that 10.5 will be available very soon.   Apple could have done better than that - leaving their loyal, long-time customers hanging like that is a terrible business strategy. A 1-star rating not strictly for the product itself, but for the overall experience. (And one would think they would have learned from the iPhone debacle.)   So, loyal Apple users with OS 10.3 - it is a wise choice to wait until OS 10.5 is out.

<Title>GETS BETTER EVERY YEAR
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple once again scores high, this is my fourth ipod, first I got the U2 20 GB special edition, then 60 GB Photo Ipod, then the 5th gen 60 GB video Ipod and now this beauty, I has great sound, great video cuality, love the new interface and what I love the best is the space. The interface is not as slow as some people claim, it just takes between 10 to 14 seconds to change menus. So if you are thinking of buying a new ipod, get this one.

<Title>The best iPod yet!
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 160gb iPod Classic 3 weeks ago to replace my two 40gb 5th gen iPod. I was continually running out of space and I needed more. What I got was more than just space. The new Classic features video capability, games, contact list and more.   I love the new CoverFlow feature which lets you flip through your albums by the covers. For this you need to have a perfect iTunes database complete with album cover images for each album. Fortunately, Apple iTunes provides automatic downloading of album art work to your MP3's. ITunes automatically located and attached about 80% of my CD collection art work. The rest I either scanned or found on the Internet and dragged right into iTunes. This process is very easy, I could find the image in my browser and click & drag it directly onto the album in iTunes and it would attach the art work to each song in the album. One click & drag, period.   I had to do a lot of work to clean up my iTunes database to get the whole package to work properly. My database was a mish-mash of ripped CD's and downloaded songs with only about 40% of the ID3v2 basic tag information populated. At first try I also got a lot of my albums showing an album cover for each song in the album, this was particularly a problem with compilations where a separate album was listed in CoverFlow for each artist in the compilation, for example, with the Rolling Stones Magazine top 500 Songs of all time I got like 400 albums listed in CoverFlow. Needless to say, this is plain old annoying. After much experimentation   I found that by selecting all the songs of one album together and checking the box marked "Compilations" to "yes" that it then correctly listed the album one time in CoverFlow. I now can breeze through my entire CD collection with one album cover per CD. This is a great feature when you get it working correctly.  When I first attached the iPod Classic to my iTunes I found it to be a bit slow to react to my commands, but when I cleaned up my iTunes database and properly linked all my albums via ID3v2 tags and got the first sync done I found the performance to be quite acceptable while working in iTunes and during future sync's. My previous database was a mess with a lot of songs missing from the database (I manage my folders manually as I have yet to trust this to itunes). I use CDeX to rip my CD collection. It uses the phenomenal LAME CoDec which produces the best MP3's and it does a great job of filling out the ID3v2 tags automatically for you. All the albums I ripped this way imported flawlessly into iTunes.  The battery life is amazing. I ran it for two days all day and the battery meter barely moved. It still had 90% full indicated. I read a review that tested the new classic and claimed 56 hours of audio playback and 14 hours of video playback. I believe it. It is far better than my older iPod 5th gen.  I love playing the iQuiz game on it. It quizzes you in a great variety of ways, even including album art to challenge your knowledge of your own music collection. Fun stuff.  On the negative side, my add-ons that I used on my original 5th gen iPod no longer work on the new Classic. I have an iTrip FM broadcaster and an iTalk voice recording attachment, both made by Griffin Technologies that do not work on the Classic. I did find a new iTalk at Best buy for $10 that creates amazing CD quality stereo recordings on the Classic. I will have to fork out another $60-70 to replace the FM broadcaster.  The sound quality on this ipod is noticeably cleaner than my original 5th gen iPod. I have a good ear and $250 pair of Shure E3c ear buds that clearly like the new Classic over the older model. There is no noise or distortion even at maximum volume. Every nuance of the music is faithfully reproduced. If you have anything less than a good $100+ set of headphones you won't notice the difference, but if you do, you will like what you hear and what you do not hear.  I am through importing my CD collection into iTunes at 320kbps. I have already filled 138GB of it including 50gb of Coast to Coast podcast's and 6 feature length movies at 500mb each. There is not much space left, I can't wait for the one Terrabyte iPod to come out.  My first attempt to sync the new iPod Classic to my old database netted me a lot of errors and failed sync's, and also way too many album covers in CoverFlow. This turned out to be all due to the mess of a database I had thrown together over the years. Once I cleaned it up it has worked flawlessly every time. Even with 30,000 songs and being nearly full it now sync's in about 2-3 minutes with just 4 or 5 songs being added each time I sync. This is very good.  This iPod is a definite winner, but to make the most of it you have to have a squared away iTunes database.

<Title>Don't rush to upgrade
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my iPod classic as a gift.  This is my 5th iPod and I had high hopes.  After a few days my reaction is mixed.  Sound Quality -) My 60 GB iPod with Video had much better sound quality than this version.  I listened to both with my Bose QC-3 headphones, a pair of Bose earbuds and a pair of regular earbuds.  I had someone hold the iPods out of sight so I coudln't tell which I was listening to during my "blind" test.  The sound quality on the new iPod Classic is a bit muddy.  That's the best description I can come up with for the sound.  It wasn't so bad the new iPod should be returned but there was a difference that I couldn't describe as a good thing.    I could hear less of a difference in quality between the two devices on the standard iPod headphones.  Since my other headphones are both mady by Bose, it is possible that there is some problem with the Classic and those headphones.  I listened to both in my car, which also has Bose speakers.  The sound was different but not as different as it seemed via the headphones.  Nevertheless, try it (with your headphones) before you buy it.  Sound quality is very subjective and you may prefer the classic.  Interface +) Cover Flow is really a nice feature.  It makes me stop and listen to albums that I had forgotten about over the years as they get burried among all of the newer music.  I have had no problems with freezing.  +) The ability to search is a wonderful improvement.  I am not one of those people that knows every artist name, album name, or song name.  It's nice to search on one word.  The more ways the iPod can allow you to find what you want to hear the happier I am.  -) The click wheel on this version seems less sensitive.  While it may give you more control, it isn't as smooth and easy-to-use as previous iPods.  +) The finish on this iPod (silver) doesn't show every finger print the way my 60 GB black video did.  You'll still see every print on the back, but at least the front of the device isn't a mess the moment you pick it up.  Display +) The display on this iPod is better than every other iPod I've owned.  It's beautiful to look at and movies and music videos look great!!  All in all, I'm happy with the new iPod.  However, if it wasn't a gift I would return it.  There aren't enough improvements versus drawbacks for me to part with my 5th generation iPod.  If you need something new because of a break or this is your first iPod, it's fine.  If you have a working device that you love, don't rush out to buy this.

<Content> Who would not want to convert hundreds of CDs to a lossless format on an iPod? Playback on the home sound system would be a piece of cake.   Sadly, Apple's notion of lossless recording/playback apparently does not include the mid-range. In other words, no trouble with the treble - it's gone!  Tomorrow my iPod will be also be gone.  Tom

<Content>I've had this 160GB iPod for about 3 months. I love it and would buy it again in a heartbeat if anything bad ever happens to it. Mine works perfectly and the ability to carry around well over a thousand albums with near CD quality is quite incredible. Most of the time, I use it with my home stereo system and the sound quality is outstanding.   I haven't had the problems some other users complain of. I can quickly navigate the menu, the cover-flow works just fine, it plays movies with no problems...  I'm not saying it can't be improved since that would be totally foolish. But I am saying that I think it is by far the best product of it's kind in today's market!

<Title>Huge dissapointment Shame on Apple and Steve Jobs 
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought it so that I could archive all my old CD's and AVI videos I had filed. But I was dissapointed by the fatcs that:  - Ipod won't run AVI videos and previously copied MP3s or MP4s that were not created to its taste. Thers is 3rd party software available on the net, but its not affiliated to apple, costs extra and who knows if its reliable, besides whatever happened to 'plug and play' ?  - When I want to rip my old CD's Ipod will force me to convert them to its special format AAC, which can not be played by any other MP3 player. So that means If were to buy into this, I would be stuck with Ipod forever or lose all my audio/video files.   - Ipod won't let you manually drag audio/video files onto the device, it first has to go over itunes and even that doesn't work all the time, as some albums I was not able to copy after several attempts until I finally gave up because - listen up apple people: I have a life beyond my PMP. - Why on earth do I need to download and install a software (itunes) that plays 'nanny' for me, takes over my computer and manages my media files, I'm a PC user and potty trained and can take care of my needs for myself.  - The things has no 'on and off' button. Talk about the design - utility trade-off !  - That wheel with which it is operated, maybe works for kids accustomed to video game consoles, but as an older find it confusing an user-unfriendly. - No A/C adapter, so I can't charge the batteries on the go in the office (where itunes is -u guessed it- not installed) ? - I'm disgusted how the big consumer electronics conglomerates are imposing their standards to the exclusions of their competitors proving once and for all that they care more about their competition than about the consumer. Microsoft and Apple should fight it out to the death until a third player comes along who will finally make life easier for the consumer by simply offering to play ALL standards available -yes,its technically possible.

<Title>iPod 160 GB gets a perfect score from me!
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got an iPod 160 Gb to replace my 30 GB video iPod, since I needed more room. I was concerned after reading the negative reviews but am glad I listened to the "happy" reviews instead. I absolutely love my new iPod. The lag issues have been addressed in the latest apple software updates and I haven't noticed any problems with lag since I got the iPod. And the capacity on this beast is phenomenal. There is a "search" function that is helpful in locating specific items quickly. The video is crystal clear and runs very smoothly. I have over 90 GB of stuff on there already and have never had to browse for more than a few seconds to find any particular item, which is pretty good I think.   Overall I highly recommend the 160 GB iPod, especially if you  have a lot of video content. It is barely wider than the 30 Gb iPod I had previously so fits most of my previous docking stations (all but my InMotion portable speaker set by Altec Lansing, in which it just barely fits). Recommended Speakers to go with it (the ones I picked) are the Klipsch iGroove SXT (for work) and the Klipsch iFi (for home), which I just purchased.

<Title>So, tell me why this isn't five stars again?
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm just not seeing the flaws reported here or elsewhere.  I have 160Gb -- effectively 154Gb but I'm okay with that -- and I can watch videos, listen to music, see my photo albums, all without much incident.  The iTunes interface isn't perfect but you know what?  It syncs everything I check or uncheck, and it's very easy to get the iPod to just work right out of the box.  My anecdote cancels out yours.  Coverflow.  I love it.  Do I like having to give my credit card over to Apple so I can get cover art?  No, so I didn't.  I can get cover art for free using Tag/Rename.  And since I don't browse by album cover -- with about 60k songs, I'd never find anything, and there are no album covers for some of my Brazilian music -- I really don't suffer from this.  Granted, if you offer 160Gb of space, you have to engineer the software to handle potentially thousands of albums, but I feel they will fix this in time.  It's not the hardest problem in the world.  The same jog dial from my Wife's 3G iPod, only a little more tactile feel, works just as well, probably better for someone like me with caffeine-induced twitchiness.  Volume is very good, but the EQ is largely annoying so I tend to output with no EQ and let the amplifier handle it, e.g. my car stereo or my PC.  And let me say something about the iPod with respect to the Zune.  The Zune, for its WiFiness and video abilities and whatever, cannot function as a hard drive.  I can skip the whole iTunes scenario, plug it into my work laptop, fire up Winamp, set the library scan onto my iPod, and the same 11k songs I'm listening to in the car come with me inside.  Plus, I get Winamp's control over playlists, etc.  The ideal solution for me.  Finally, I checked out video on it, and it looks really, really good.  Since video conversion is almost a necessity for most people, just grab a conversion program and let it worry about getting video files in the right format for your iPod.  Stop letting the tail wag the dog, and make your files compliant with your devices, not the other way around.  In the end, your PC can play anything, so if you've adopted an iPod, then convert to an iPod friendly format and move on.  Sheesh.  It holds 60,000 songs and can play all day, in color.  What else do you really need?  Five stars.  -C

<Title>Hold everything
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Finally, after holding out for years, my dream has come true: an iPod with storage capacity exceeding 100GBs.  At last I can store every note of my music collection into this MP3 player with ample room for videos and photos.  Although this is marketed as 160 GB, the capacity is really 148 once you activate it, so be warned.    I agree with some of the other reviews: the iPod classic is slow when responding to the click wheel.  Plus, it doesn't always load the album artwork quickly.  Even so, I can live with these two minor flaws. I'm just happy to have an iPod that not only can carry 148 GB of music, but also has extended battery life.  Plus, the 160 GB is thinner than the 60 GB iPod I previously had.  In addition, I have Vista on my PC, and I was able to plug it in and set it up with no glitches whatsoever.    I notice that the iPods are no longer packaged with a power adapter.  What's up with that?  Has Apple gone cheap on its consumers?  For the amount of money we consumers are paying, we should have ALL the equipment we need to use our iPod with no hassle or inconvenience.    Still, I'm glad I made this investment.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it's good enough to make this consumer happy for years to come.

<Title>Good, not excellent
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will compare this product with 4G IPod 40GB that I have owned, loved  and heavily used for almost 3 years. I have owned the product being reviewed for 3 weeks now.  1. What is about the same:  - the sound quality. I did side-by-side comparison by playing the same songs through powerful sound system. The difference in sound was marginal; - available equalizer settings; - the look.  2. What's become worse. - the clickwheel used to be better in 4th generation - bigger, more sensitive and smoother; - the screen could be seen without backlight. I could conserve battery by keeping the backlight off and still clearly see the titles of tracks being played. In the new IPod, once the backlight is off (say, 10 seconds after the last touch to the clickwheel), you can't see anything on the screen. When the next song begins, you don't see the title - the response when navigating through menus became slower. - there are bugs in the software that handles the contacts. In my case I was able to import contacts from Windows Vista, but on many occasions the  fields are mixes up (work phone shows as home one e.t.c.). Nice feature of showing contacts with pictures doesn't work well too. Photos are displayed too small to be recognizable, many pictures are shown damaged.  3. What's become better. - the disk space (this is an obvious point) - the new model has gapless playback - huge improvement for my taste. - color screen nicely shows artwork, the fonts are very good. - battery life is much longer.  4. What's new (note: comparing to 4th generation!) - photo playback. The feature is fun, but is not really useful. The reason is that IPod can store photos in a directory tree of 1 level of nesting. If your directory tree is deeper, all pictures from 2nd and consequent levels will be collapsed in one folder under the 1st level directory name. In my case it makes it next to impossible to find the right pictures among 4 or 5 thousand of photos.  - video playback - I don't care for this feature and haven't tested it.  The bottom line is: upgrade if you are running out of disk space (as I did) or if your current model doesn't have gapless playback which is important for you (as it is for me). If I had 5th gen Ipod with sufficient disk size, I would not upgrade right now.

<Title>Not worthy of the Apple or iPod name
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod Classic is a profound disappointment. For some reason, Apple has locked down the iPod to eliminate third-party video output, so don't expect it to work with your old cables, video docks, etc. Secondly, the audio output is reportedly inferior to the previous generation; however, I can't speak to that directly, because the firmware is so buggy, I can't even load my iTunes library on it. The latest firmware (1.0.1 as of this writing) supposedly fixed a bunch of bugs, but you wouldn't know it from where I'm standing. Apple support claims it's my library, but my library worked fine on my 5.5gen iPod. I was able to get the music on it in manual mode, but that's not an acceptable solution.   Apple has remained typically silent on the issue, so there's no telling when (or if) these MAJOR flaws will be fixed. I can't think of a decent reason to cripple the video output that was present on the previous generations, and Apple hasn't deigned to give us a reason. I'd expect such shoddy engineering and treatment from Microsoft, but coming from Apple, it's a tremendous disappointment. It's clear that Steve is more infatuated with the flash-based players, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's quite a while before the iPod Classic becomes a worthy successor to its ancestors. Until then, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

<Title>5 stars...for now(ipod noob)
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the 160g since the second week after they came out,didn't actually open the box till 2 weeks ago.I've been busy.So far I've been pleased with the ipod;all I've had before this for portable music were a few tape walkmans,then a basic discman,then a sony sport discman,and then the sony sport minidisc player.I've been using my minidisc player since at least '02,and wanted to wait till the ipods had enough capacity to let me have all my songs on it at once.Having to sit around re-recording minidiscs every 6 months to keep things fresh was a weekend-long chore,and I wasn't about to get an mp3 player that I'd have to do the same with.So I just went out and got the new big one so that I wouldn't have to worry about wasted time.Good thing I didn't fall for apple's sale involving getting rid of all the old 80g vids for practically the same price as the new,bigger one;apple's weak in that respect.That shouldn't be news to most.  It took me 5 hours to synch 92.87 gigs of music onto it,which was tedious,but I waited and it got done.Then the ipod screen pops up and says that I only have 148 gigs total."Kinda weak" I thought,but whatever--it's still a s___ ton of space.Then I tried throwing a few videos I had sitting around in a folder onto itunes and find out that it has to be in apple's format.The run-around begins.I had some buddies on a message board help me out,found a program,and was able to change the vids after dinking around with it.It takes a long time to convert an hours worth of video to mpeg4 or whatever it is.After a few days I put a handful of vids on it.  So far it's gone about 10 hours off the first charge(1 hour of watching vids included)and the batt icon looks to be 1/4 down,so the 40 hour charge factor seems to be truth so far.  I think the sound's darn good,considering I've upgraded from a player that had songs in sony's atrac3 format.I haven't tinkered with the equalizer because I want the battery to last,but I might check it out at least.  The video surprised me on it.the colors are awesome and the sound from the vid source is great too.too bad it sounds like apple is scalping people on that "special" $50 peice of plastic cable that should be $5,though.one reason I got this thing was so that I wouldn't have to lug around my stupid dvd case to parties;I just wanna plug it in and have 10 or so movies at my disposal.Guess I'll be lugging it around until apple gets the idea and lowers the price.what were they thinking?!allowing any cable to work with the video feature's gonna cause a massive NEW wave of dvd piracy--nah,not a chance.they'd have to ban the internet for that.another capitalist,bold-faced lie that fills their pockets,eh?I wonder if legal action could take place if they didn't advertise the "cable issue"?eh,apple stinks.  it sometimes takes 3-4 tries with the usb to get the ipod to take a synch,but it's no biggie.  in a nutshell:while apple as a capitalist-pig company continues to hunger for ways to screw their loyal,but mostly blind,customers,the ipod has been awesome so far in my experience.the set-backs are few,and except for the cable issue I'm happy with my purchase.

<Title>Could have been SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Could have been SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!  2 be honest i brought this for the memory space. I have tons of DVDs that i copied onto my iPod so i already at this point exceeded the 80GB threshold. So i decided to sell my 80GB and shell out an extra 100.00 for the 160GB. I brought the black model & was soooo disappointed. The quality has really GONE DONE HILL!! Apple cuts corners in the WORST way. The black looks so CHEAP & POORLY made. The silver looks nice & that's what i should have gone with. I didn't encounter iTunes issues like everyone else did, i had a breeze with mine. But selecting a song can take 2 seconds longer then it normally does. Fast forwarding a movie can take a few seconds longer then it normally does compared with the previous iPod video. Just feels like a step down. The funny thing is this isn't Apple's 1st iPod. When you make a device, you learn its flaws & fix it for the newer model. That isn't the case here. Overall it is a good device but it hasn't EVOLVED. If they had created an iPod Touch with 160GB memory that would have been nice & i wouldn't be as disappointed as i am. That's the evolution i was looking for, but it didn't happen here. So I'm cutting back on memory and moving onto the Zune 80GB with a bigger LCD screen. The iPod screen is getting so OLD & small looking. The sound quality is also a bit on the LOW SIDE. Why have a volume setting feature when it doesn't even work. Apple READ & EVOLVE properly. For now goodbye from me (Former iPod Nation Member)

<Title>iPod Classic Review
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod Classic is a mobile music player. The objective of the iPod is to offer reasonable sound and video at a reasonable price. That said, Apple has taken steps to make as many features available as possible while still keeping the price-point low. Many negative reviews are from techs who look at the new iPod Classic and see an inferior audio chip and a few other things compared to previous versions. This is true, but ask how many of the techs actually used the chips to the fullest capacity and I bet the answer will be very few. If you are one of the few people who listen to the iPod with a pair of 150 dollar headphones and rip your compact disks at 320 kbps, you will notice an unnatural bass and treble response with the "new" chip. If you buy iTunes store music at the 128-192 kbps compression rate, or rip your compact disks without changing anything in iTunes, then your music will sound almost identical to the 5.5 gen iPod Video even with expensive headphones. Apple has looked at this reality of so few people ripping to 320 kbps, at least for the time being, and has decided to invest your 349.99 in the iPod on a new graphical experience and bigger hard drive rather than a really nice audio chip (Think BMW vs. Ford on the audio chip). A complaint from techs is that the iPod Classic also has no TV out. The iPod Classic has TV out if you have the right cords: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300233 . The iPod Classic still smudges with fingerprints very easily, and still has no power adapter in the box (you must charge the iPod from your computer). Why Apple still has little support for open source video like an XVID codec onboard the iPod, or an easy converter in iTunes is beyond me. I would love to take some family videos with me sometimes, but I just grab my laptop so I do not have to wait on a two hour video conversion process to put the videos on my iPod. iTunes is still proprietary, and I would love to see the iPod have a hard disk indexing system like spotlight that would allow dragging and dropping so I could use Finder or Windows Explorer to move files around and put them in the folders I thought made since (Think external hard drive with an interface on the go). If you have no idea what these last two comments are, that is okay. The iPod Classic is still an iPod. Better alternatives do exist. You pay more for these alternatives and they are not as pretty or light as the iPod Classic. You should check out such companies like Archos and Creative before you purchase this though. Creative has years and years of audio experience, and Archos is doing some pretty neat stuff. Four stars for a product that does what the majority wants. Minus one star because Apple has yet to give the iPod the computer based support needed to allow consumers to use the iPod to its fullest potential, and because a wall charger is no longer included.

<Title>Ipod Classic Review
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm thoroughly happy with my purchase.  The new cover flow browsing technique is great.  The battery life has been tremendous.  I don't recall seeing the battery appear anything less than full.  My only complaint is that sometimes the processor seems a little - around a second or so - slow at times.  This is hardly noticeable though.

<Content>This version of the Ipod comes in with a whopping 160GB of capacity for your music, videos, tv shows or movies whatever suites your fancy.  I am happy because i will be able to get a good deal more of my cd library on my Ipod.    I also enjoy the new cover flow feature that allows you to go through your music by cover and see what is available on the other side.  Also with the overall interface of the Ipod and how your able to view not only your cd cover, but the song and album title along with the track number and what if any rating that you've given the specific song.  It just feels a lot better this time around with everything this time.  I'm not saying its perfect because nothing is.  But with this version of the Apple 160 GB iPod Classic it comes very close..a great buy.  I didnt have an issue with shipping since i ordered straight from Apple instead with the engraving all that.  I've had no issues with this Ipod being compatible with my Laptop...i just went and sync'd all my songs and videos to be downloaded to my laptop and it did so without issues at all.  Love it so far and i dont expect that attitude to change anytime in the future.  Excellent!!

<Title>A remarkable player with some serious flaws
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Creative Zen Nomad packed up after 4 years of loyal service. I love classical music and I wanted an MP3 player in which I could store a large number of classical CDs. I found Creative's latest offerings inadequate - for starters none matched the 60 GB of my earlier model, so I decided to take the dip and purchased this ipod with its gigantic 160GB memory. First impressions were very good. An excellent screen and infinitely better controls than my old Nomad. Moreover, iTunes converted without hitches my earlier files from MP3 format to iPod format and installed them on the iPod which played them well.   Then I started noticing some irritating features. First, the whole process of plugging the iPod on my Sony Vaio is SLOOOOOW. The computer takes a full minute to 'recognize' the iPod. Thereafter, everything slows down remarkably. Copying a CD onto the iPod takes far longer than it did onto my old MP3 player. What is worse, the computer freezes from time to time while I am doing this, which means that working on something else while downloading from a CD is slowed down considerably.   Secondly, the manufacturers assume that you automatically want to download everything from your computer to the iPod. Given, however, that few computers these days can match the 160GB of the iPod, I quickly found my laptop reaching the limits of its 80GB memory. The solution - not to synchronize the iPod with the laptop; this, however, requires quite elaborate manoeuvres every time you link the iPod on the computer. WHat is even worse, if you ONCE press the wrong button and agree to synchornize the two, the iPod LOSES all its existing content and acquires the computer's lesser content.   Third - playback facility lacks the Nomad's useful capacity to keep adding CDs ('albums') on your current playlist - hence you can only choose to play one album at a time. And while on the subject on playlists, creating them seems to me very very time consuming. Adding an album to an existing playlist seems to take the best part of a minute - this was something the Nomad did instantaneously.   Some simple operations are remarkably tricky. Deleting a single picture or track ('song') from your iPod is virtually impossible without first deleting it from your coputer iTunes library and then synchronizing the iPod to the library - a ridiculously time-consuming routine, which in my old Nomad could be performed by simply pointing at the item and pressing the delete button on the computer. It could even be performed on the MP3 player itself by simply pressing a sequence of two buttons.   The simplest feature that would remove most of these frustrations would be if iTunes (like virtually every other software I know) simply had two lists of items, those on the iPod and those on the computer, and allowed free movement of items from the one to the other. I don't know if this is not done due to some attempt to limit copyright infringements, but the Creative software and all Camera softwares provide it.   Final complaint. You can only charge the iPod while it is connected on the computer (slowing everything else down) and while it is connected on the computer you CANNOT use it as an MP3 player, e.g. looking at the pictures on its own screen or listening to music through the headphones.   I have now had the iPod for 3 weeks and I appreciate some of the frustrations may gradually subside as one gets used to its idiosyncracies and limitations.
