<Title>Every Feature Usefull.
<Date>Sat Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the 30GB Nomad several months ago and it has really been a gem of a purchase.  I was only expecting to by a 4 GB MuVo but for the extra 40 bucks, 26 GB is a bargin.  The people at Creative designed a nice package here.  Over the few months that i have had the Nomad i have had a chance to use all of the features.  It fits my life style perfectly.  You can customize playlists on the fly.  You can set bookmarks in the middle of a track (very handy for long audiobook files).  The sound quality is fantastic, and the EAX Features make it even better.  I also like the fact that it can be utalized as an external hard drive.  I have some files i need to transport from school to home and this is ideal.  I can keep all of my work files on it and still have enough room for an extensive music collection.  The battery life has never let me down and the controls are quite simple to use.  The travel case that came with it is also quite nice looking and functional.  This is a good bye.

<Title>Nice little player
<Date>Sat Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Sometimes I wonder who really writes these reviews...I could swear that 50% of them are written by either Creative or Apple.<p>Regardless, I just received my Nomad today...so everything I write is based solely on first-day use (cannot vouch for long-term performance). I'd like to first address those who complain about software problems/incompatiblity issues, etc. Is it really fair to comment about things like that on a hard product review? When I read through these reviews I was looking for the performance of the player itself, not of Windows problems.<p>I come from a strict loyalty to minidisc players. So this is coming from college student whos boyfriend inducted her to the world of MD and who swore by hers for the past two years: I really am impressed with the Nomad. My 18-year old brother got an iPod for his graduation, so naturally in sibling competition I had to outdo him. He got the 20gig, I bought Nomad in the 30gb for about $200 less. Ha! I won!<p>So let's be fair here. I love the touch controls on the iPod, I just didn't have the patience to wait for the Zen Touch's release, or the money to dish out. The fact that Apple includes a remote is quite nice. I do like the address book feature of the iPod as well, it gives me an excuse to hold off my tech-y temptation to buy a palm pilot.<p>On the other hand, the default carrying case for the iPod has no viewing window. I guess the Nomad didn't have one at first, but mine does. It's sort of faux-leather with a nice feel and a dinky clip (I don't plan on using the clip anyway) and makes the unit feel sturdier than it does alone. The front cover which houses the battery is a lighter material than the rest of the unit and almost seems like its in preparation for interchangeable front panels (I tried to look it up but found nothing of the sort). It has a release button and I have not found a way to make it &quot;accidentally&quot; fall off as of yet. ;-)<p>I do wish there were a manual hold button, I don't like pressing the power button to lock the keys. With the buttons being on the side, and the openings of the case being there as well, it is pretty easy to hit something when you pick up the unit to move it. Yes, its a bit bulky and larger than the iPod, but I would describe it as sturdier, not larger. My brother's iPod is scratched up so horribly because of the plastic, and he's only had it for about 3 weeks. At least the Nomad has metal covers (as thin as they may be). I'm all about aesthetics, so my superficial side is happy.<p>As far as sound quality goes, it certainly matches that of my MD player. I love having everything on a drive as opposed to minidiscs...even though they were durable I still had to carry around 5 of them. I thought 5 hours of music on one disc was great, but now I have more than 30 and have barely dented my CD collection, and have used only 2.3GB if not less. The Nomad definitely converted me and put my faith back into MP3 players, which I resisted for the longest time.<p>Guess we'll see how it holds out. I haven't found any reason to be unsatisfied yet. Although I will mention that I am using a third-party ripper to get my CDs, I haven't tried their software in regards to that.

<Title>Good value for money
<Date>Mon Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Have had mine for about 5 months now...still working fine, battery life lasts 10 hours on mine (but that's only cos I'm diligent about recharging only when it's completely empty) and the sound quality is exceptional.<br>There are a few downsides, the main one being the size and lack of remote control...now I am sooooo tempted to buy the zen touch...<br>I've had no problems with the software, I'ved already used up 20GB of the alloted 30GB...mainly with personal files, it also doubles as my backup hard-drive...transferring of files to and from the Nomad to PC is a breeze, and with USB2.0, absolutely flies!<br>Conclusion is: Not as sexy as the iPod, but for this price, unless you have more dosh than sense, then go for this...

<Title>Nice MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is certainly a nice product. It's well put together, attractive, durable, provides some good options, and has great sound. <p>However, there are a few little drawbacks. First, it doesn't support a very wide array of sound formats; you're basically stuck with MP3s. Second, the &quot;jog dial&quot; scroll button is a little annoying and difficult to use, but not enough so as to ruin the experience. Third, it's practically impossible to read the LCD without perfect light or the backlight on (you can set how long the backlight stays idle, up to 60 seconds). Fourth, and finally, the button style and button/input locations are just a little...off, for lack a better word. The buttons aren't quite sticking out far enough and the button/input locations are a little strange (they work and all, but it could have been designed just a slight bit better).<p>Besides those few quirks, this is a really nice player. The sound is amazing, and the EAX settings are really nice, albeit some scale down the volume whilst using them. Battery life is acceptable. The player is a little larger than say an iPod, but it's still a nice size. The sync from your PC to the Zen Xtra (or vice versa) is a snap and very quick. Also, there's firmware and driver updates available, and the little harddrive is replaceable; if you ever want to replace or upgrade it, it's really simple. The case is really attractive and more durable than the plastic players out there, but the front case cover is easily removed, which is a good thing but can possibly become a bad thing as well, although I've yet to be able to make it 'accidentally' come off.<p>With everything the package includes, there's really no reason you shouldn't pick this up. For the score I had to knock off one star (I wish I could knock off only half of a star, though) for the my four small annoyances with the player.

<Title>Beware - no customer support
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Stay away from creative - far away. They only want your money. The unit itself - a creative zen 20 gb - has a few quirks but operated sufficiently. However, it did not hold up well and each time a repair was made, we were charged $100 minimum. Now, just over a year later, the headphone jack no longer makes contact. We were told &quot;This unit is no longer supported&quot; but we were offered a REFURBISHED unit (now, where did that come from?) for a price more expensive than a brand new 30 gb unit. I thinks its time to get an iPOD.<br>Consider me a disgusted, former customer of Creative. I will never buy their products again. I expect a several hundred dollar item to last longer than a year and to be supported as well.

<Title>Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 30 GB Mp3 Player
<Date>Sun Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was looking for an mp3 player that would hold almost every song and artist from my harddrive.There were 2 reasons I picked this over the Ipod.Price and a replaceable battery.I just got this unit today so I'm writing a review on my experiance with this product today.I will write again in 6-8 months to let people know how this is still working.I bought this at circuit city and also bought the 3 year warrenty in case the problems with the harddrive and ear plug jack pop up that I've read about.So far this is a great unit thou.The install of the creative software and drivers installed on my xp computer with no problem.It was very easy to copy from my computer to this unit and very fast.You can also delete very easily if you want to.There is some pros and also a few cons from this unit.The price of this unit for this much memory was much cheaper than the ipod.Also I don't know about battery life yet since I just bought this.When you get it thou you will have to charge it for 4 hrs.      Pros   1)This hasn't been mentioned but when playing if you scroll to the now playing you get song,artist,title,album info and Gendre all at the same time.Here's what it looks like.Note you must be in now playing to see this.      Michelle   Percy Faith   The Beatles Album/Jesus Christ Superstar   Easy Listening      Also if the title is long it will scroll across.      On my lyra 64 I only get the song title.If I want to see the artist I have to hold the Dsp button down.      2)This comes with the 2.0 firewire and it is very fast.      3)The battery is removable so when it won't charge anymore you can just go buy another one.      4)This thing has sound effects for example concert hall,bathroom etc when listening to music.      5)A backlight for night viewing      6)You can shuffle songs and it will play like a radio station.      7)Times between songs are quick for example when one song ends the other imediently starts.      8)This thing holds a lot of songs.500 hrs with mp3 and 1000 with wma.My lyra usually won't hold over 20 songs.      9)This unit comes with music already installed.It includes quiet a few classical songs if you like classical music.It also comes with demos.      10)This can also hold video from your harddrive.      11)You can organise your songs by artist,song,album or gendre.      12)The sound sounds great thru this unit even better if you have the sound effects on.   Cons   1)The case with the belt clip don't have a see thru window.      2)You must put music tracks in the selected music to hear one after another.If you just choose a song from the playlist you won't hear another one following it.      3)It's not as small as the ipod.      4)No stop button.You must hit pause to cut the song off and if you want to power it off just hit the power button after hitting pause.      5)The packaged earplugs don't fit well      You can also play this in your car 2 ways.Either thru using a cassette adapter if you have a cassette player or by using an FM transmitter.I use the Belkin Tunecast Wireless Fm Transmitter.You can buy these for less than $20.I recommend this product just make sure you buy the warrenty.

<Title>Highly Recommended
<Date>Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've owned several MP3 players over several years, with this one replacing an old hard drive-based Nomad Jukebox (which replaced other RAM-based devices...) I highly recommend this one.    This device is a great value at the $215 I paid for it, especially when compared to the iPod (which I tried and thought was comparable). It's portable and compact, easy to use, high-performance, and the batteries last the whole day on a road trip.    I'd have preferred to see a directory-based listing for selecting genres, artists, and albums like the Nomad had, but once I got used to this format I like it. The desktop application for editing the embedded track information is very good, and highly addicting; I found myself spending hours getting all the data &quot;just right.&quot;    Overall, no complaints, a very satisfied customer. Thumbs up!

<Title>There's a Reason Why This Player is So Cheap . . . 
<Date>Tue Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been following the specs and prices of jukebox MP3 players for a couple years now, just waiting for a bargain to pounce on and digitize my whole music collection. A few weeks ago, I noticed the impressive price drop of the Creative Zen Xtra (30 and 40 GB models) and couldn't resist.     I guess I should say now that I own an iPod instead.     Why? While this brand and model might be suitable for some, I feel that only one word describes this gadget: CLUNKY. First of all, it's a pretty hefty device, it's size and weight comparable to an old cassette tape player. The screen isn't very sharp, and the menu scroll button is cheap and takes careful &quot;balancing&quot; of your fingertip (you'll know immediately what I mean if you try it). Furthermore, the model I received was either defective . . . or there just might be something to the gripes on this site about the battery life on these models - as my Zen Xtra would chug with juice for only a pathetic 80 minutes. While the Creative Zens are unique (to, say, iPods) in that you can remove and replace the battery, the claims of the company are just downright misleading. That's why I bought it over a variety of other brands: the advertised &quot;12 hour battery life!&quot; Nope.     Of course, there are some things that made it hard to send back for a refund. The sheer memory size, 30 or 40 GB, is HUGE. And Creative DID get one thing right - the SUPERB sound quality. Absolutely amazing, it makes the iPod sound bland. With cool effect equalizers that turn the sound into environments such as &quot;Concert Hall,&quot; &quot;Indoor Arena,&quot; and &quot;Auditorium,&quot; a whole new experience is added to old musical favorites.     But altogether, the bad far outweighs the good. If you're terribly strapped for cash, go for it. But unless you plan on keeping it plugged into the wall for home use, this isn't the player for you. Shell out the extra $50-70 for the iRiver or iPod.

If you arent hooked up to CDDB to get the album info I guess you have to manually input the stuff, but that little work will save you looking for songs.

<Title>Good player, but this technology is not yet great.
<Date>Fri Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received this as a gift.  I had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite CD's transferred.  However, the Creative software is not real intuitive.  The software  is somewhat nice to look at, using it is not the easiest.  If you want to rename a CD title that you have already transferred, you will become frustrated quite quickly.  You are better off deleting it, re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player.   <br>Transfers are surprisingly quick through USB 2.0. It is great sounding, even with the supplied earbuds.  I must have differing preferences than others here, as I prefer the supplied earbuds to the Sony's that I thought sounded good on other players.  I love the storage in this thing.  I have 100 of my CD's transferred and haven't made a dent in the 30 GB drive.  I doubt I will use half of the storage capacity, but you never know.  this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining MP3's in which I would have never purchased the CD.<p>Now my dissapointments.  The description of the Warranty is buried on the supplied set up CD.  The warranty is 90 days.  This is ridiculous.  To me this alludes to the manufacturer's confidence that the product will last for a year.  Buy the re-seller's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later, after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time (probably sooner than later).  The scroll wheel, to be blunt, sucks.  Seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection.  The interface used could be better designed.  It is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want.  I am a software engineer and if I wrote an interface to my software that worked like this, there would be hell to pay, not to mention the ridicule from my peers.  AND the case, how did this ever make it out of Quality Control.  It is some protection for the unit, but for useability, forget it.  The screen is covered, so to make any new selections you have to open it.  The cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls, especially the scroll wheel.  There are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet, so you have to live with it.<br>Despite the things that I have listed so far, I could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a CD case to work, to the gym, in the car, etc..  However the main reason I am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times.  I have had it lock up after a transfer of music.  The files are there, but I could not access the player without removing the battery, waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery.   Also have had it lock up when I shut it down to attend to a phone call.  Left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over.  Could not stop it, could not get out of the &quot;Now Playing&quot; screen.  Again had to remove the battery.  There have been other occurrences of locking, but I will not bore you with the details.   Quite simply, the firmware and/or the OS that control this thing is not ready for prime time.   There have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time, upon powering it up it starts on the &quot;Now Playing&quot; screen with a song or CD that I had been playing days before.  I haven't quite figured this one out yet, but it is probably operator error.  <br>Now I have not owned other MP3 players as I was waiting until they matured, but since I received it as a gift I now have this one.  I would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology.  And we all know about the rush to market on new products.   I have had this player for 2 weeks, I will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit.  While I am at the store I will definitely get the extended warranty as I have another day or so (from the purchase date) to obtain one.  I know this unit will have problems in the future and the $40 for the 2 year &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; replacement warranty will be worth it, since Creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous!

<Title>Another electronics fan
<Date>Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Summary<p>Overall I like the unit. I gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when I dropped it from a fairly short distance (less than 2 ft). If it were not for that I would have given it 4.<p>Pros:<br>1) Price / GB of Storage<br>2) Storage Capacity<br>3) User replaceable battery<p>Cons:<br>1) Fragile (I broke the 1st one within 10 days)<br>2) Scroll button / switch<br>3) The case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing.<p>Features that would have been nice:<br>1) FM receiver - some models out there have this.<br>2) FM transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo. They sell an adapter unit to use with your car's cassette deck. But who wants the wires involved. A short range FM transmitter would be much nicer. I believe the Napster MP3 player has this feature.<p>Details:<p>Don't drop this unit:<br>I've had the player for about a month now. Overall I like it. As mentioned above I broke the player within the 1st 10 days. I was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke. I think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell (Murphy strikes again). I was able to return it to the retailer where I bought it and got a replacement. If you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you. I purchased the extended warranty (something I almost never do) when I returned the unit to get the replacement.<p>Updating the unit's firmware:<br>When I first purchased the unit I downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website. The upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions. I would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation.<p>Storage:<br>The storage capacity is great. I don't think I will ever use the full 30GB. I currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and I haven't even used 10GB of storage yet. I'm starting to listen to CD's that I haven't listened to in years now that I have them all handy in one place.<p>For those out there that are not familiar with MP3 encoding, you can encode your CD's at varying quality levels. Typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps. The higher the number the better the quality (less data compression is used) and the larger the file size. If you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps. You should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player. If you're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end (typically 128 is considered close to CD quality).<p>Price:<br>The price compared to the iPod is great. Price, along with the replaceable battery (which I understand Apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it) were the two main factors on why I picked the Nomad. One word of caution with regards to using the Nomad with iTunes. I discovered this weekend that iTunes does not sell MP3's in the MP3 format. It using something called AC3 (at least the trial song I purchased was in this format) which is not a compatible format for the Nomad. I haven't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on iTunes. But for now it appears that this player doesn't play well with iTunes.<p>Scroll Bar:<br>The scroll bar is a bit of a pain. Sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items. It's not the end of the world, but a better design sure would be nice.<p>Software:<br>I've had no problems with the software. I found it intuitive to use (I didn't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes). The software will convert your CD's to MP3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to. My 2.6 MHz Pentium 4 with USB 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly (I would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per CD).<p>Through the software you can classify songs in genres. This is a nice feature (i.e. it's early in the morning and you rather listen to "easy listening" rather than "heavy metal" - no problem. The software comes with plenty of defaults genres. You can also create your own if you don't like their classifications. You can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later. This can be done on a song by song basis or in mass. In addition, you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation CD right on your player. This is pretty cool.<p>Sound:<br>The sound from the player is ok. I was a little disappointed in the low end. I did buy separate headphones as other have recommended. I was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base. The sound level is also not as high as I would have expected. It's probably good for the health of your ears, however I consistently play it near the high end of the volume range (and my hearing is fine).

I haven't checked the resilience of my xtra yet, and don't plan to.  However, if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their Zen, please share your experiences.

Of course you do!<p>a)feel cheap-- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily, and it definately wouldnt survive a drop<br>b) the screen is hard to read-- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display<br>c)the scroll bar is a travesty-- enough said<br>d)software is another great misfortune-- hard to operate, crashes frequently, screwed my music library up, doesnt work with mp4s, the list goes on and on<br>e)the case is too small-- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage<br>f)it doesnt look pretty-- spending this kind of cash, you want something that has the asthetics bit down, of course<p>So... Im taking mine back tomorrow morning, and getting a nice shiny new iPod instead. Don't waste your time, engery, resources on this thing, just spend a little more for a far more functional iPod.

<Title>Don't buy it.
<Date>Sat Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the Zen Xtra 30G as a gift. What a disappointment. The software failed repeatedly. I couldn't load more than one song before the software crashed. Creative Labs Customer support website is useless. Software downloads on the site crashed my pc. Creative tech support Operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if I had time during work hours to spend time on this. Don't buy this thing.

<Title>The best
<Date>Sun May 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>So, this is my first MP3 player, but that does not stop me from thinking it is the best available.  I have had the unit for just over a month, and I have loaded around 100 of my 400 CD collection with the software that was provided - no upgrades necessary.  To rip and fit a CD takes around 3-5 minutes max.  I know the rest of my collection will fit.  Since I travel long distances for work, and have eclectic taste in music, I can sort and play by genre, artist, album, or song.  Admittedly, the scroll joy stick is a little hard to use, and I sometimes select the wrong item in the list, but I can live with that since it is easy to return to the last selection list.<p>It is simple to operate, and the sound from this little thing is great.  Headsets, or powered speakers provide greate stereo separation.  I use it as my main music source when I am away from the stereo system.  Transferring from my PC to my Nomad could not be simpler.  It connects through the USB 2.0, so transfer time is minimal.  <p>The screen is easy to read - even for someone those eyesight fails at 50+, and the adjustment buttons and bars are easy to access.  <p>I am not sure about the battery life.  It seems to run shorter than the manufacurers claims, however that is during writing MP3s to the Nomad, which I assume would consume more power than playing.  Guess I will find out on my next 12 hour flight in June, but having an airplane power adapter should solve that problem. The A/C cord is small enough to fit in my other pocket!  <p>I am considering buying another unit for the spouse.  After looking at reviews of the other units within this price range, I am finding no comparison.  Also looking at the 60 Gb version, which should store all of my future CDs!<p>The only problem I have experienced to date is that it occasionally locks up when being written to for 100-120 MP3s.  The reset button is easy if you have a paper clip or mechanical pencil point, and it boots up fast, so little time is lost in transferring activities.  Just a little frustrating, so I just reset it each 8-10 CDs or so.  This may be my operating system - using XP Professional.<p>When you select by album, it plays back in the original recording sequence.  When you select by artist, you can sort by album or alphabetically by track, so it is easy to find what you are looking for.  Selection by Genre works the same way.  For play mode, you can select any option from shuffle with and without replay, normal, repeat forever, etc.  Only problem with this is that setting the normal after you have selected the album/artist/genre will cancel the selection (or I just have not figured out how to do this yet).  So, I go back and re-select and there it is!  Selecting a new album switches from the I am listening to within 4 seconds.  Not bad.  This may slow down some once I load my entire CD set, but I think I can live with this!<p>Ok - so, no, I was not paid by Creative Labs to write this.  Yes, I am planning to purchase another for the spouse.

<Title>Somewhat better than the ipod
<Date>Mon May 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is actually my first MP3 and I'm just loving every second of this.  The price is so cheap.  30Gb for only $219 or something like that.  The ipod is asking for $200 for 15gb.  That is indeed a big difference.  I know that a lot of people would buy the ipod because it's smaller and it looks cooler.  The problem is that the ipod will only work with itunes(AAC files).  You can't transfers those types of files to the nomad.  It's sort of good for us nomad users because we could buy music from Napster, Walmart, Rhapshody and many more.  People should concentrate more on the capacity of an MP3 player, not just the way it looks.  The only bad thing about the nomad is that the headphone jack won't last that long(only works for a year or longer).  It's better than paying $90 to replace the battery on an ipod.  Go for the creative.  It's definitly worth the money.

<Title>Nothing bad to say about it but....
<Date>Thu Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this trying to save a little money as an alternative to buying an ipod, and while there's nothing exactly wrong with it, I find myself a little regretful.  It's a good product, I've been using it for a couple months and it has never malfunctioned or been irksome, the interface is relatively user-friendly, etc.  My friend bought an ipod at around the same time, however, and seeing that in action vs. using my Nomad Jukebox really shows the difference between the two, and that the ipod is worth the price difference.  The fact that the ipod's interface is just a little easier to use, that the slightly smaller size really makes a difference, that it works just a little faster, everything all the way down to the fact that the come-with headphones are just a little more comfortable make the ipod a better alternative.  Again, there's nothing wrong with the Jukebox, it serves all my needs well enough, but if you're trying to decide which mp3 player to go with, I'd have to recommend the ipod.

<Title>Lousy mp3 player
<Date>Tue Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This thing is a shiny paperweight as far as I'm concerned. There are only 2 advantages to the Zen, and they are price and battery life. This thing is built like a carnival toy. The faceplate that covers the battery pops off basically whenever I touch it. So you get what you pay for. Also, Creative's customer service sucks more than their players do. The overall mssage I got when I requested help from them was, &quot;You already paid us, so why should we help you unless you pay us more. Go screw yourslef.&quot; By contrast, the Apple iPod is the best mp3 player you can buy. It's sturdy, looks great, has a fantastic interface and is easy to use, and Apple has superior customer service. Instead of Creative's useless 90 day warranty, Apple gives you a year, and you can extend that to 2 years. As to the battery issue, the 8 hour battery life was never a problem for me. I never listened to it for 8 hours in a row without being able to charge it. Plus, the battery is replaceable, it's just harder. I returned my Creative Crapbox/Zen and bought a 15GB iPod, which I love.

<Content>I bought this based on what appeared to be solid positive reviews from satisfied customers. To my dismay, I've had nothing but a big headache trying to install the necessary software/ drivers onto my pc. After 3 emails back and forth to Creative's technical support department, and trying every suggestion they had, I'm still left with a player that won't work.

<Title>Could never get CDDB to work on Windows 98
<Date>Fri Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a terrific little music jukebox ... but I have had one very annoying problem.  The CDDB service (which provides the track titles for your CD's) would not work on my Windows 98 machine.  I beilieve that this is a Creative problem, because CDDB was working with Music Match on that machine.  Tech support was responsive, but their advice (which I wasted hours implementing) provided no help.  So, despite the promise of being able to use this machine on more than one computer, I was actually only able to get the software working on my XP machine.  So, I'm happy with what works, but pretty annoyed with the hours wasted, lack of effective tech support, and ultimately the lack of support for my Windows 98 machine.

<Title>headphone jack
<Date>Tue Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this before traveling to holland for 6 months and i loved it.  Its got good sound, its still a lot smaller than a portable cd player, it holds a ton of songs.  And its relatively cheap.  I paid $250.  Here in holland its almost 00 ($500)<p>The only bad thing is the headphone jack.  my friend and i who came to holland had the same problem with the headphone jack going out. It still works, just the connection has to be just right or you lose it.  It gets frustrating after awhile.<p>Other than that this is a great machine and i would recommend it, just get the warranty so you can get it fixed right the first time.  The value of this player is much higher than the I-pod.

<Title>Great product for the Price
<Date>Fri Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like most people i considered the iPod before purchasing the Creative Zen Xtra.  The main factor why I choose the this mp3 player was the price (paid $208 on sale at amazon).  It was 10 gigs more space and $200 cheaper than the ipod.  I've had it for over a week and so far i love it.  It's very easy to use, just drag and drop the music into the player.  I filled up about 11gigs of space, so i have plenty left.  It took me longer to transfer, but that's because i was using USB 1 to transfer.  The menus are pretty intuitive and I figured it out easily.  I didn't have a problem with the battery cover coming off easily like some people have mentioned, but I keep it in the case all the time.<p>My only gripes about this player so far is that it's a little big.  Carrying it around is not a problem, but it's a little diffcult to navigate the buttons with one hand.  The carrying case could defintely use some work since you can't see what is playing or what you are doing unless you open it up.  It should come with a window so you don't have to open it up.  And once you open it, the case isn't very secure on the player itself.  I would also like to see a remote and fm receiver for it so you don't have to open the case.  This would take care of the lack of window on the case.<p>Overall, it's a great product for the price and I would definitely recommend it for those who simply don't want to spend all their money on the ipod.

<Title>Too new to give 5 stars
<Date>Sun Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>OK, I bought this yesterday and it is my first mp3 player, so I'm a little biased.  Of course it is working great at this point.  I love the idea that I can put my entire CD collection in this little player.  I was all ready to buy the iPod (even had the guy start ringing it up) when I went back to the computer department to inquire about a case.  I was already cringing at the fact that every accessory for the iPod was sold separately and my total for a $299 player was already over $400 because of necessary accessories.  A CREATIVE rep was in the dept and showed me his Zen.  Maybe I was duped, but I was attracted to the fact that all I had to get was the player because it came with everything.  I saved about $200 and just used a car adaptor from my existing portable Aiwa CD player to play the Zen in the car.  I didn't like the software and have been using the Windows Media Player to organize and copy all my CDs.  <p>My needs are pretty simple, I'm just looking for ease, price, portability, and capacity.  I think I found all those things with my new Zen.  I am concerned when I see people writing about broken headphone jacks and pop-off covers.  I do recommend covering yourself with an extended warranty.  I got mine at Best Buy, where they have a great service dept.  As far as dropping it--don't.  That is just common sense.  Although this morning I took it flying with me in my uncle's little Cessna and it slid off my lap onto the floor and got wedged next to the door while we were at 6500 feet in the air.  I got it out with no problem and with no damage.  HOWEVER....I am a big enough person to admit mistakes...and will definitely be writing another review if anything negative happens.  What is boils down to is ask yourself what you want and get it.  They all pretty much do the same thing, just with different capacities, they all have certain design flaws, and it is always good to get an extended warranty if you're feeling nervous as a first-time buyer.  Good luck!

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I just bought this player today and I already love it.  It has a few inconveniences: one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd.  Another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long, it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on.  Otherwise, this player is awesome!  It has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily.  The volume range is great, so you can blast it if you want.  Overall, this player is awesome and I definately recommend it.

<Title>Perfect Purchase
<Date>Sat Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received this item for Christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards. Naturally I did quite a bit of review before purchasing (I recomend www.nomadness.net), and price-wise Zens are unbeatable. Compared to other leading HDD mp3 players, the value per GB is the tops.<p>-Price: See above.<p>-Sound quality: Excellent, everything you would expect from this company.<p>-The unit is easy to use and intuitive. It took me about 5 minutes before I had mastered the controls.<p>-Uploading music is quick and easy. Although the supplied software can be annoying at times, on whole it is excellent. I have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty. (It's fast too!) BTW, be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly, as this will ensure a great organization.<p>-The unit itself its well structured, with just the buttons you need and none you don't. As often mentioned, the scroll tab is average, however, not difficult to use or horrible. Structurally, everything is secure and it won't fall apart on you. The screen is large, defined, and easy to read, and the silver unit is naturally cool. There are lots of interesting features included such as EAX, and customization.<p>-The replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out (as all lithium batteries do), you will be able to buy another easily. iPod users have to send theirs back and pay $100 for a replacement. Also, the Nomad's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy.<p>-Equipment included is average, but that isn't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for. The case is strong and stylish, but unfortunately lacks a window (now a big deal). The headphone earbuds are average, so just use your regular pair instead.<p>Conclusion:<br>This player is an ideal purchase. There isn't need to get in details again, but just remember it rocks because: price, sound, ease of use, and features. I would recogmend this player to anyone I know, and you will not be dissapointed.

<Title>Awesome
<Date>Sat Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I'm very pleased with my ZX so here's a quick review.<p>First there's the unit itself.  It is small overall, bigger than the iPod, but keep in mind that this is because different, less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the ZX.  The ZX boasts superior sound quality than the iPod, however it compromises a bit of the unit's size in doing so.  The LCD is larger than the previous model, the NX, and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the NX's green backlight did.  The scrollwheel is easy to use and works great for me, however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate.<p>The sound is excellent as one would suspect from a Creative product.  The included EAX support is useful at times, especially when you listen to a variety of genres, as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle.  The environmental audio, however, is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it (I encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates.)  The signal to noise ratio (the ratio of detectable, useful data to unusable garbage in, say, a radio wave; a larger STN ratio is better) is nice and high at 98 decibles, and it should be noted that Apple refuses to release the STN ratio of any of the iPods.<p>The software hasn't been a hassle for me at all.  I ignored the instruction booklet (as I do with any product) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes.  My sister was able to figure it out on her own as well, and she is of average computer competence.  The less computer-saavy might find Apple's software a bit friendlier, though (I use it at a friend's house and it does do a lot more for you.)<p>Lastly, the price is fantastic: I spent $269 for my 30GB ZX, compared to the $299 for a 10GB iPod and the also expensive iRiver iHP-120.<p>For prospective buyers, I would warn of the following: 1) Purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible, as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable (this applies to earbuds in general,) and 2) make sure that your mp3s have ID3 tags on them, that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves.<p>If you want great sound quality, don't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte, don't mind being something of an iconoclast among many iPod users, and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount, then I would suggest the Zen Xtra for you.

<Title>It's pretty good
<Date>Sat Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Read the instuctions - DO NOT plug the Zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it !! (I had no problems since I did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad Ipod owners since they all recomend it instead). And have you seen the price of the Ipod extras that you need. Eg 60$ for a plastic box to hold 4 AAA batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs (reviewers figures)<p>I uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems. Transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds. <p>It is transferes a song in about 2 seconds. USB 2.0 - VERY FAST<p>Yeah I agree the ear buds are pretty crap, replace them. But the sound is very good (and loud) and works well on my portable speakers.<p>And for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world (and is quite small).<p>It looks very cool, and seems quite small to me and very light. The scroll button seems ok, I have no problems with it.<br>I am very pleased so far.<p>I had all my files already on my PC in WMA format (200 CD's). so far so good, no problems, no conversions. Very simple to use.<p>The reason it does not get 5 stars<br>1) A spare battery would have been great.<br>2) No games - it has a cool screen - why not use it.<br>3) It does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer, like some players <p>All in all suprisingly easy to use.

<Title>A great player for the price.
<Date>Sun Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Summary: Lots of flaws, but exceptional sound quality, HD size, and price make it a good buy. <p>PROS:<p>Excellent Sound - I found the music reproduced faithfully through the Jukebox. There was no distortion and it sounded great, especially with EAX Environmental Audio enabled. <br>Transfer Through Windows Explorer - Windows recognizes the Jukebox as an additional hard disk, so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from Windows Explorer to a folder for the Nomad. I found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the Nomad than using their software. However, it doesn't register instantly as a hard drive like other players. You have to install the software to the computer you're transferring to, instead of just connecting it with a USB connection. This would have been much easier. <p>The Nomad can hold any type of file, not just Mp3, so you can use it as a portable hard disk. I found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer. This almost made it worth the price alone. I was able to easily copy 2Gb worth of video files from my computer, and then transfer them to a friend's. <p>Huge Storage Space - Even at 320Kbs, you can store a ton of songs on this thing. 30Gb is more than enough for most people. <br>Having USB 2.0 makes for very fast transfers. It only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file. It took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs. <p>CONS:<p>Navigation system - The Zen Xtra uses Id3 tags that are embedded in the Mp3 files to organize your songs. This is great as long as all of your music have Id3 tags, and if you've downloaded your songs off the Internet, many probably don't. It would have been much easier to use a Windows Explorer style navigation system. You can't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it. Whe you transfer your songs to the Jukebox, it dumps ALL of them into a single folder, and then sorts them by the ID3 tags.<br>  <br>FM Receiver - It has none. I would be nice to have a simple FM Receiver so I could pick up local stations. That way I could get rid of a walkman alltogether.<p>Cheap Construction - They should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners. The player feels VERY delicate, as if I'm holding an actual hard drive. I'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet. As a portable player, it should feel a bit more durable. The top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable. I could crush this thing in half with two fingers if I wanted to.  This is not a player you can take jogging.  <br>The songs don't play one after another like on a CD. You have to add them to the Playing List. I can't simply bring up my entire list of songs, click play, and then hit next. You have to add all the songs to a play list. There is probably an easier way to do this, I just haven't found it yet.<br> <br>Software - The software is crap. I use it for ripping CDs, which it does a pretty good job of. Otherwise, it is difficult to figure out and awkward. Like most people, I don't want to read the instructions, I just want to use it. Even after reading some of the instructions, it's still hard to figure out. I would recommend replacing the existing software with the "Notmad Explorer," which is simpler to use and can be found on the Internet.<br> <br>No Line Out Jack - As I said, there is none.  The headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack. So you can plug your Nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter, but you don't get the quality from a true Line out jack.  It sounds decent, but I would estimate you get maybe 80% of the quality that you would from a true line out jack. <p>Controls are a bit awkward. The controls definately took some getting used to. It wasn't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman. When I first had it I kept finding myself having to look at the Nomad to figure out where the skip button was. A sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included. I want to have instant access to the volume, not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it. <p>Crappy headphones. The included ear buds were uncomfortable. I would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones. <p>Difficult navigation - I won't necessarily say "difficult," but I don't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate. It is a bit cumbersome, and I can't get to the songs I want as quickly. I think this is it's biggest flaw. I would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on DVD remotes. Up, down, left, and right would have given me better control. If you hold down the scrollwheel too long (which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through), it will get "stuck" rapidly going through the songs and won't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it. <p>Case - The Nomad comes with a leather holding case. It would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen, and if the button didn't cover up the AC jack. That way I could keep it in the case all the time. As it stands now, the case is pretty useless unless you're packing the player up for travel, or if you load up all your songs beforehand.  You can cut up the case a bit with an Xacto knife and make it useable though. <p>Overall, I feel that it's a decent buy, and am happy that I own it. I am willing to overlook it's problems to get superior sound quality and low price, although I feel the player has a lot of room for improvement.

<Title>Good For the money, but software is awful
<Date>Sun Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>After looking over multiple large mp3 players, i decided to get this one. for the price and size and features, you can't beat the price. A 10 gb Ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the Ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins, accesses files or does antyhing. I think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection, whihc is a plus, but then again it is only speculation.<p>The buttons and interface are very easy to use. Simple click buttons, back buttons volume and display are very easy to read, access and use. <p>But the major problem i had was with the software. You are not able to simply import files, but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them. the instructions that come with it don't explain how to make things simple. the quick sync isn't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just isn't very useful. I tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused. i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player. well that was not a simple task. i ended up suing windows player to make mp3's (actually wma files) and then using the probram to transfer. <p>i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer, becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate. <p>Buy this for the storage and price, avoid it if you know nothing about computers.

An iPod with the same amount of memory is $150 cheaper. the reason for this the iPod has &quot;a better user interface&quot;. i have found that the inter face on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer. Also the iPod has games on it. Games are ok for a cell phone, but MP3's are for music.

<Title>It doesn't get any better than this.

<Content>Before asking for the Zen Xtra specifically for Christmas I researched many different MP3 players but finally decided on this one, and now that I have it I couldn't be happier and I'm convinced it's the best one out there.  Many people have written about the software being its one downfall, personally I haven't had a single problem with the software, I'm running Windows ME.  The CD ripping to mp3 is so easy, and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player, so it won't take up space on your pc hard drive.  The software runs smooth, it's nice to look at, it's very organized, easy to follow and makes things very simple.  The controls on the player are very simple, no need for a manual.  The player is fast and sounds great, it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music, or making it sound like you're hearing the music in a huge auditorium.  The battery lasts very long when playing music, but writing files to the player drains the battery fast, so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files.  Playlists can be made on the fly, without aid of a computer, and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your 'now playing' selections or playlists.  The software couldn't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream, I couldn't give this anything but a 5, I wish there was a 6.

<Title>Great Product

<Content>Well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players. So then i came across the ipod (10 GB). So i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to Best Buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one. Well i decided to get this one. Well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket. Well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player (at that size and the price). Well just one con- its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it, it will be a breeze. Enjoy

<Content>i got this for christmas. i was going to get a 10GB ipod, but after looking at the 10 DAY WARRANTY FOR IPOD AND WWW.IPODSDIRTYSECRET.COM (BATTERY LASTS 18 MONTHS ; IT costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 ... what a big improvement ... lol) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with iPODs on windows computers, i realized this is a much better buy. Not only is it more affordable, but its a better player for windows, which is what i have. anyway, on with the review.<br>so far i've only had it since christmas, so i cant tell you much about the battery life. it hasnt gone below the second notch (i charge mine whenever i'm at home and not using it), so the battery life seems fine (so far).<p>SOFTWARE: for the people who complain about software, please, stop complaining. once you hook the thing up to the computer (via the USB cable), the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it's there &amp; installs the drivers. from there, you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player (with the help of the media sniffer...read the manual). my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags &amp; that takes a while to do if your mp3 files don't have them. if you're copying CDs with windows media, its really simple to give your songs id3 tags, so thats what i do. oh...and file transfers are fast &amp; easy.<p>THE PLAYER: it's silver. a little weighty (9 ounces ... no biggie), but otherwise fine. people complain about the scroll wheel, but its not a big deal at all (though it is just a LITTLE annoying at times). it's easy. the buttons are easy to use, and its easy to navigate. the big backlight makes things easy to see, and the writing is big enough for people to see. my favorite thing about the nomad is the EAX feature. you can customize bass, etc. like usual, but also you can customize the sound of the player (like how it would sound in a concert hall, jazz club, etc). its really cool. sound quality is AMAZING. i was expecting worse, but its really good (especially if your files have good sound quality). you can also slow a song down &amp; speed it up, which is cool too. BUT THE EAR BUDS SUCK! BUY NEW ONES ASAP. every time you move your face or something they pop out. for a 250 dollar player, they could have thrown in nice headphones. a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it. oh... one more thing. i forgot, the case doesn't fit. my case doesnt close...maybe mine was just faulty, but the case isnt that great. <p>so far the player froze on me once (i started pushing buttons before it loaded) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that. so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button &amp; you're golden.<p>also, you can store data on it, which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an iPOD just to say you have an iPOD, don't bother, this is a MUCH better buy. HOPE I HELPED !
