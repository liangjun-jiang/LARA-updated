<Title>Barely Works
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Good: -memory appears like a flash drive and will hold songs from WM Player -a single song will play on this player -battery lasts about 6 to 8 hours -Windows Media Player can convert song files to Sansa; if you don't have WMP, there is no software from Sandisk that will load them.  Bad: -Beyond playing a song, player can't do much more -Playlists can only be installed on the fixed 2GB memory, non-removable -Added micro SD card appears as another player, not additional memory -Added memory is limited to 2 GB Micro SD (NOT Micro SDHC) -Total memory cannot be more than 2 GB plus 2 GB, always separated -Playlists cannot play from both memories, only the fixed internal 2GB -If two playlists contain the same song, the song will be added twice -Sound quality is minimal -Sound volume at max is about medium compared to other players -Available operator's manual/website has little or no information -Player is physically very weak, won't play at temperatures below 50 F  Overall, if you are looking to play more than 500 songs or if you want to have multiple playlists without duplicate songs in memory, this ain't it!

<Title>Well, I got it going...
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought it as a less expensive option to the iPod Nano for my 12-year old daughter.  No music software came with it, though an add for Rhapsody was included.  Took me a while before I realized I could use Windows Media Player - d'oh!  Not very intuitive but downloaded version 11 which is a definite improvement over 10.    And it works!  My daughter "Ripped" music from her CDs and it plays and sounds very nice.    Initial concerns with it freezing in the on position.  Couldn't find any reset technique in the instructions or on the Sandisk website, so we just let it run down the battery.  Haven't run any firmware update - afraid to now that it works.    Bottom line: If money's an issue, this is a reasonable option, but parental unit must be somewhat tech-savvy.  If you can spare an extra $75, go with iPod Nano.

<Title>Great alternative to 2GB iPod Nano
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great and cheaper alternative to the 2GB iPod Nano. I like the fact that it is expandable using Micro SD cards and has voice recording capabilities.  The unit is also easy to use, I figured out most of the functions in an hour (hint: get familiar with the menu options and visit Sandisk's site for some videos on using this unit).  The unit's functions are accessable with one hand after you are familiar with them.  Tip: To turn off the Sansa, press MENU once and then press and hold MENU for 2 seconds  You can use the supplied software to put your music on it but I found using Windows Media Player 11 is the easiest way to do so.  I have not used Rhapsody to buy and upload any music to my Sansa yet.  Sound quality is excellant using the supplied earbuds, I had slightly mixed results with the sound quality using my car's cassette deck (the songs ripped at higher bit rates sounded better).  I am hoping that Sandisk (and others) develope a more complete set of accessories for this unit like a docking unit and a case.

<Title>Fantastic form factor and excellent Mp3 performance
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this unit to supplement my 40gb 4th gen iPod.  My iPod is fantastic, but it is not easy to take everywhere due to its larger size.  I wanted a smaller MP3 player I could take and listen to at work, gym, and when shopping at the stores/running errands.  After weeks of research and some earlier purchases which were returned, I think this unit is going to fit the bill perfectly.  This unit has a lot of nifty features: -mp3 player -FM radio -voice recorder -photo viewer  The MP3 player and FM radio sounds excellent, very close to my iPod with decent headsets. I didn't use the standard headsets with the unit - instead I purchased Panasonic necklace fashion headsets with better frequency response.  This unit hangs unnoticed from my neck with the Panasonic headsets, and the sound quality is fantastic.  The FM radio reception is pretty good, although it does not pick up some stations as strongly as a dedicated radio with antennas.  The voice recorder has excellent clarity, but the menu could be better. Once you record a quick note, you have to switch back to the main menu, click to music, then voice recorder, then select the recording to hear the recording.  And there is no way to delete the recording except on the computer.  I wanted the voice recorder to record reminders and to-do's but this voice recorder is not as easy to use as my dedicated digital audio recorder.  The photo viewer seems no better than the photo viewer on most camera cellphones, and I doubt I'll be using it much.  The main purpose is to play music and listen to FM radio.  The unit seems very sturdy and the buttons seem to be very sold.  Overall it has a high quality construction feel, and the compact dimensions of the unit lend it to being taken everywhere to be used.  I love my iPod, but I think I will be using this unit a lot more than my iPod simply because it easier to carry around, has FM radio, and excellent performance for the sub-$100 price.  My friends strongly recommend I buy the Sansa e250 unit over this one.  But after much research, playing with the e250 unit in the store, I decided that I like the form factor of this unit better than the e250 unit with the awkward click wheel.  The click wheel felt quite stiff and not very smooth when I tried the demo unit in the store.  I'm used to the slick wheel of the iPod, and didn't want a unit that poorly duplicated the wheel.  The buttons on the c250 work perfectly fine without a wheel.    The e250 is also wider and longer than this unit, making it a bit less suitable as an alternative to my iPod.  edit: I also discovered that this player does not have a clock.  Due to a recent sale, I switched to the Sansa e260 player, which has 2 very important (to me) features:  date / clock, and the ability to delete voice recordings.   For those on the fence about buying a Sansa cXXX player or a eXXX player, I think the eXXX is the better player, despite its slightly larger size.  There are more accessories available for the eXXX than the cXXX, and the clock / voice recorder are more useful.

<Content>I'm writing a pre-purchase review. I have no idea whether to purchase this item or not because the dimensions CAN'T be accurate! How can the product weigh a whole pound more than it's own shipping weight?? And who'd want to carry a 2 POUND MP3 player? Why does the product dimensions say the thing is 9 inches long? That can't be accurate when everyone else is saying it's so small...well, how small??  Someone help me out here!   Concerned MP3er

<Title>No Audio Books
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this player with one MAJOR exception: it is not supported by Audible.com so you cannot have your audio books on it. All the comparable Sansa players are supported, so I bought this with the expectation of being able to listen to Audible content like any other SanDisk product. However none of the c200 series players are supported and Audible says this is because SanDisk has not provided them with the tech specs necessary. SanDisk was non-responsive to my inquiry as to when they would get this done like their other products - a generic thanks for your inquiry but no info. Bottom line - if you want just music this is a great choice. If you need versatility of also having audio books, buy something else.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this with my 8 year old daughter who wanted to spend her Christmas money on a player. She couldn't afford an i-pod, and this was a great solution. Easy for her to use, includes a decent FM radio, and a voice recorder so she can record herself. I was able to get her going and transferred her small CD collection quickly and easily. The screen is a tad small, so I might not use this for a photo album, but so is the nano's screen. I own an i-pod nano and had I known, I would have bought this just for the radio if nothing else. I haven't downloaded with Rhapsody or Napster yet, so I can't comment on that aspect yet. It will be interesting to see the differences between i-tunes and these. Bottom line: Consider this player for kids or yourself. A very good value.

<Title>Best MP3 player I've used
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my c250 for almost a year and it's never given me any trouble at all.  I took it on a six-week cross-country bicycle ride last summer and the thing is bomb-proof.  I didn't even have the protective case, but I think I may purchase that now.  Great battery life too.    I can't really explain the negative reviews this player has gotten, my experience has been great.  I find the display easy to read and I've had no issues with XP compatibility.  I had an iAudio player by Cowon before and it was always freezing up, requiring a firmware update.  The Sansa has been trouble free.

<Content>I bought this Sansa almost a year ago. I was happy with it at first, but I'm beginning to discover it's more of a headache.  I'm not a technical wizard, but I'm no slouch either.  I found it extremely easy to download the music onto the player, but I have run into trouble.  I can't get the music OFF of the player and download new music.  I've sat down at my computer three times to try to acomplish this with no success.  I end up giving up and walking away.  I think I'm going to suck it up and buy an ipod.

<Title>Tester
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Sound is great, navigation easy, good quality voice recording.  There are two major problems:  1. The title and artist name of some songs is not copied to the player. They are simply "lost" for some songs, without any detectable reason. 2. After copying, recording and deleting files in the player does not correctly release the memory space. The result is that you have less and less space for new songs and recordings. The only way I found to correct the problem is to format and reload the songs, but that re-creates the problem described in #1. I am not sure if a new firmware would resolve it. I opted to return the player.

<Title>Disappointing MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this item to use it for DRM-protected audio books. Felt a little flimsy and cheap when taken out of the box. After the installation, this supposedly plug and play device caused my computer to keep disconnecting and then reconnecting with the player. Two updates later I was able to transfer some files. Everything worked fine, however not with audio book playback. Unlike an Ipod, the player doesn't remember where I previously paused the current track after turning it back on. Also, when fast forwarding for longer than a minute of the track, the player switches to fast-fast forward, however re-starts the song when the fast-forward button is released!!! Really annoying. So between a cheap feel, poorly written and documented software and everyday problems with the interface I returned the item after 12 hours of trial.

<Title>Which to buy?
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am writing a pre-purchase review.  I am trying to decide between the sansa c-250 and the sansa e-250.  I have read a few comments in the reviews here, but am still undecided.  I don't think there is a big difference in size, but the e-250 may be easier to hold in one hand and operate while driving.  But, the C is cheaper, and cost is an issue for me.  Is the E really worth the extra $$?  Update:  I bought the e250 instead of the c250 and I'm very satisfied.  However, if you only want to put music on the player, as I do, the c is probably all you need.  Especially for the money, but I knew my wife would eventually want an ipod and the e resembled the ipod, so I knew when she saw it she would want the e over the ipod.  She already had a player that resembled the c and now, yes, she has already asked me if I'm going to get her an e250.

<Title>one big fault  -- otherwise quite great for the price
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The contrast level on the display is so low no matter how one adjusts the brightness and backlight that you will have a hard time seeing what feature/song you are selecting.  Its genuinely bizarre that they used a very light-blue field against a white backround. Text is black so at least you can see that clearly.  Other than that, the sound is good for such a cheap player and it has a built-in equalizer to adjust the sound to your own liking.  It will operate in MSC mode, which simply means that you can load music files into the player directly from the My Computer icon.  No software of any sort needed at all to load songs into the player. You lose the ability to make playlists in MSC mode but personally I prefer the speed and simplicity of MSC mode.  You cannot use MSC mode to play digitally-protected music.  Again not an issue for me. If you are looking for a cheap mp3 player, this is worth considering.

The jump from song to song is a little slower if your used to a zune or an ipod but if you your new to the mp3 player market this is one fine tiny option.

<Content>This is a reasonably decent device, spoiled by a lousy interface. When you try to navigate in album mode, or in any other mode other than 'songs', it mixes up the album order.  I have my mp3 albums named so that when you sort the songs in alphabetical order, the songs will be in the correct order within the album.  The Sansa device sorts the songs by the write time of the song to the player, making it impossible to play an album in the correct order.  Compared to my iRiver player, this is junk.

<Content>i'm impressed with this model. its my very 1st mp3 player (unless you count my sony mp3 disc walkman witch i got tired of) and its easy to use. plus i love the photos and voice recorder features. putting in a microSD card was no problem, so i made it up to 4GBs. a few cons, however:  -the voice recoder will only use the unit's flash card to store recordings and your computer probably won't be able to play the file (mine won't) -battery life is short, but i bought a portable charger for it and charge it daily regardless if i use it. -the instruction manual is so bad i wouldn't even bother to read it after 5secs. its seriously a joke how non-informative it is on the product.  -there is no information about the warranty, witch is confusing.

<Content>I bought mine (the red one) at BestBuy .. It was one sale & I did pay less than this.. But its so worth having! I didnt need one with a video player or whatever.. .Just to put some cd's in it & & my spanish stuff to learn.. so I got it..    Its wonderful & I highly recommend this to anyone! For yourself, or a gift (unless your a teen & you HAVE to out-do everyone else for your stupid status..lol.)    This is perfect! Only 2GB, doesnt hold a whole library of stuff-- but really, are you gonna listen to every CD you own at once, or in 1 day--NO!..    Get it.. you'll love it too!

<Title>Trouble being read via Windows XP
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I own another Sansa player (older model - 4GB version). It's worked perfectly for over a year.  This one cannot be recognized on my home computer running Windows XP. I've gone through multiple workarounds and nothing has worked. It is recognized fine on my office PC. So, I was able to load music there, but it is a pain as the home computer is where my music is.  I emailed "support" via their website. Two weeks - no reply. Emailed back -- calling attention to zero replies. Four days -- no reply.

<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The display resolution and contrast on this unit is so poor you can't read or navigate the menus. There are no controls for contrast and the choice of colors for the selection and battery level are virtually unreadable in sunlight or in darkness.  Functionally the player works fine but I don't recommend this unit because of the unreadable display.

<Content>I bought this for my wife for christmas. she's not really all that techy but even she can figure out how to put her songs on this one. Works super easy with WMP 11, I like the interface better than that of my iPod.  Build quality is a little cheap but for the money you can't beat it. It also locked up a couple of times and had to be plugged in in order to reset it. I have updated the firmware (highly recommendable) and haven't had a problem since. For those with charging complaints, the iPod style charger works just fine with the USB cord for this guy.

<Content>This is a great little MP3 Player, as long as your main usage consists of listening to music.  The sound is fine, and it even has an expandable microSD card slot with which you can add up to 2GB (for now at least).

<Title>Small product large sound
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was hesitant about buying an MP3 player because I am relatively inept when it comes to electronic devices. After researching different MP3 players I decided to take a chance on the SanDisk because of its reasonable price plus I had read that it was compatible with Windows Media Player (WMP). I had downloaded dozens of CDs onto the WMP and now needed something small and pocket sized that was inconspicuous to use at work. My profession affords me with occasional down time so I wanted a small MP3 player with ear plugs that would help me pass the time by dusting off a few musical neural networks encoded in the 60's.  First of all I was surprised at how simple transferring songs was using the WMP and the Sandisk. You first open up the WMP and once the computer recognizes the "device" you click on the icon, which allows the WMP to connect with the SanDisk. Then you can either right click on selected songs and select "add to synch" or you can right click on the CD title and add the entire contents of the CD to the sync list.  The WMP shows you how much room you have left on the Sandisk after each input. Pretty simple. The real surprise occurred when I placed the ear plugs in and listened to my old archaic music. I'm not crazy about ear plugs (can't use headphones at work), but the ones that come with the player are not uncomfortable. The sound quality of the SanDisk is extremely impressive for such a small device. Although the player comes with an equalizer I did not even find it necessary to adjust the sounds. I give this product 5 stars for the musical portion of the SanDisk. I cannot comment on the other options that this product has, but I am obviously impressed enough to leave a review on this item. I should mention that the device comes with a CD that I downloaded and it appears to assist in using the other features of the SanDisk MP3 player, but as mentioned I bought the player solely for listening to music and am simply commenting on the musical portion of the SanDisk Sansa c250 MP3 player.  I hope that this helps you in deciding which player to buy. I am very satisfied with this product.

<Content>I bought this looking for an inexpensive mp3 player I could use while jogging. It works fine, the sound quality is good and I like the fact it has fm radio and that it supports secure WMA's. The photos on this were completely useless so if you want to use this mp3 player to show off your pics don't buy it because you won't be satisfied with the results. I gave it 4 stars because the battery only charges through your usb connection, unless of course you buy an extra accessory, and because it could have come with better earphones (had to use a different pair to jog).

<Title>I love my little player!
<Date>Tue Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My boyfriend bought me this player at Radio Shack so I can use it when I go on vacation next month and I'm already in love with it. It can only be charged via your computer's USB port, though. To charge with an outlet, you have to buy the Powerduo from Griffin. It comes with a car charger too. I don't use the FM radio very often, but I like that the option is there for whenever I feel like it. The voice recorder is useful as well. This is my first MP3 player and I was relieved at how easy it was to figure out. It also accepts WMA files. I highly recommend this player if you don't feel like spending an arm and a leg on an Ipod. I also recommend it for people who are looking for their first MP3 player. Very great for the price.

<Title>Don't buy this
<Date>Sun Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player because it allowed for an external microSD card.  It's not good for listening to if you're walking.  I put it in my pocket and the slightest bump made it freeze.  The only way to get it to work again was to take the battery out.  It also skips occasionally for no apparent reason.  It's supposed to be capable of viewing photographs, but the screen is so small it's not worth it.  The description didn't say that it can only be charged by plugging it into a computer.  Perhaps there's an adapter, but I didn't see anything for one.  This MP3 player is so small that it actually fell out of my pocket and I lost it after having it for only a few days.  I didn't have any kind of warranty or anything, so it was $100 to listen to music for a week.  I decided never to have such a small MP3 player again and now have an 80g Ipod, which works great and is small enough to be portable but big enough not to lose it.

About a week ago, i squated down with it in my pocket, at work, and the left side speaker stopped working. I tried just about everything to get it to work, but to no avail. So, now i only have one side to listen to my songs. As long as i can hear something, I really dont want to go through the hassle of trying to return it for another. Just a word to the wise, dont squat with it in your pocket.

<Title>Lots of potential, but is is wasted
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A great little player and recorder when it works.  I am on my third unit as the first two had major issues and would freeze on start up.  The problem seems to be in the way that the unit handles either malformed mp3s or mp3s that are encoded with abr/vbr options.  The player just doesn't recognize them and will get stuck because it doesn't know to skip things that it cannot see.  Lately my player has been not displaying the main internal memory when I connect it to the computer.  It will only show the small 16MB partition that you can use in an emergency to restore firmware to the unit.  Perhaps that is a bit of an omen that I should pay attention to.  It only likes certain kinds of mini-SD cards.  Take a look around on the net before purchasing a 2GB mini card to expand the memory of the unit.  Can be very slow to start up if you use it in MSC mode instead of MTP.  The unit is a great size.  Comfortable to hold and use.  Audio recording is excellent and perfect for taping classes.  Battery life is good considering the size as well.  If it were not for the firmware issues, then this would be a first rate product instead of a brick waiting to happen.

<Content>This is the first MP3 player I've gotten for myself.  I mainly use it to listen to podcasts and love how easy it is to get my tunes and podcasts onto the player.  I also have an FM transmitter/charger for it, so it gets used almost every day when I'm commuting and also when I walk.  Made the mistake of getting my daughter an iPod Nano last year for Christmas and it was nothing but a pain.  It ended up being stolen out of her locker recently, but this time she'll be getting a Sansa 6 GB player for Christmas to replace the iPod--I'm sure it will be lots fewer headaches for both of us.  Now that her brother just let me  know he wants an MP3 player for Christmas too, I'm back to Amazon to order a Sansa for him also.

<Content>One of my pet peeves with the ipod is that it doesn't have built in radio. I always thought if you gonna pay so much money to play your own music you can atleast enjoy FM radio. But as an alternative device, I see that the sandisk player is great with MP3's and radio which should be good enough for a music lover that desires a portable device. (the memory card option is also a nice touch) Though the screen resolution isn't that great and making an organized playlist is yet to be discovered...this device is great. I recommend for those of us that don't have "ipod money".

<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I upgraded from an ipod shuffle. Load in the Sansa disc for a new music library. You can't drag over from Itunes, but shows you how to drag over the same music out of Windows Media Music. I ordered this item for me from my wife from Amazon for $40 on the Black Friday sale. 2GB was worth it. I had my music ready to go Christmas Day. While it charged I learned not only of the Window media, but also that it held photos. I quckly dragged some of those in also. I'm not a fan of earbuds. The music sounds great thru them, but I plan to replace them with headphones. The screen is visually appealing. The menu toook a little time to figure out. I can now do anything so small, that the makers designed as an option that often goes un-used or over-looked. This only enhances the experience. It does have FM stereo which I forgot. I tune it to my Sirius Satellite Radio for commercial free music. I can then push the Record button on the MP3 and add a song that I don't have in my library. I use the lanyard because there is no clip. It often tangles with the earbuds when storing. A clip would have been best. It does come with about 4 songs and pictures in memory.

<Title>Nice Entry-Level MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great little MP3 player for someone just starting out with one.  It's easy to figure out and use.  I didn't notice the trouble with viewing the screen that others have mentioned, in fact the color screen is nice for something so small.  It got this for my 10-year-old son, and he loves being able to show his favorite pictures as well as listen to his music.  I did have some trouble figuring out how to load the songs on it.  Bear in mind I am not a techie-type.  It's not really that hard, I just got a little confused by the software required for photo conversion, and the fact that there are several ways to load music to it.  I got it quickly enough and loaded songs easily after that.    What I did have trouble with though was using a music service.  There were coupons for both Napster and Rhapsody included, and this is supposed to be an authorized player to work with both services, but I couldn't transfer songs from either one to the player. I tried going through all the troubleshooting steps, and still couldn't get it to work, even with SanDisk tech support help.  I was finally advised to return the player for a new one, but still have the same problems, so I don't think they will be resolved.  I don't understand why they included music service coupons that aren't useable with this player.  This is probably not the player for someone looking for a lot of features, or someone used to a nicer player, but it's great for someone starting out or someone upgrading from a simpler, b&w display player.  It's also probably not the player for someone who likes using a music service. I do think it's a great little player for the price.

<Content>Sound quality is excellent, easy to download music on to it and it has all the standard features for playing songs such as, shuffle, repeat, making a playlist, ffwd and such. You can listen to FM radio, which is great. What this can do that an iPod can't is record voice and radio. The only drawbacks are, you have to hook it up to the computer in order to charge it or delete songs. You can only have one playlist at a time. In order to hook it up to anything other than a computer, you'll need to buy a different cable. But overall I love my SanDisk Sansa MP3 player.

<Content>This player is slightly different than the e250: a bit smaller, and seems to spec out the same.  The sound is excellent, I've auditioned it with my favorite Sony headphones as well as with a few in-ear 'buds'. Navigation is good, I think the only function I'd like to see is a 'stop' buton... but pause certainly does the same thing for my purposes.  I haven't yet figured out how to set-up my own album names, so I've just been loading raw tracks, but the player comes with sample titles and they're organized properly, so obviously it can be done.  The c250 is a great value, I shopped several players before deciding it had the best features for the price. I highly recommend it!

<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I'm very happy with it. I've read several complaints that the sound quality isn't very good with the earbuds that come with the player, but everything sounds great to me. Again, this is my first player so I have nothing to compare it to.  I have Windows 2000 and Media Player 9 so I can't sync my music, but I can still transfer everything over very easily from Windows Explorer and with the player in MSC mode. And I can't have playlists (other than the default GoList), but I found something else that works for me. For example, I have 3 or 4 CDs by different artists that I like to fall asleep to, so I just changed the Genre data (before copying them to my computer) in WMP9 for those CDs to "Sleep".  When I turn on the player, my new genre shows up and I can play all the songs, just like in a playlist. It works perfectly for my purposes.  I do have a couple of complaints about the c250--the lowest volume setting is too loud for my liking. Also, when you power the player up again it remembers the song you were listening to, but not the volume level--it starts out right in the middle, which is pretty loud. Hopefully some future firmware updates will fix that problem.  All in all though, I love my Sansa c250 (especially for the price) and am very glad I bought it.

NOW my problems with it: -The headphones are crap. As many el-cheapo headphones are. They started freying in like less than a month, stopped working shortly thereafter. -My volume button died. I can turn the volume up, but something broke inside so i can't turn it down. There's no resistance when i push it. It broke 2 or 3 months after I got it. -You know what an mp3 player needs that none of the manufacturers think of? A clock. -I have a problem. It has the same safety feature of an ipod, in that you can't access your songs on more than one computer. I was using it on my family's computer over the summer, and then I moved into an apartment where I'm renting a computer, so I can't put music on it. One thing my dad suggested to solve this was to get a micro SD and route that directly onto the computer. I thought that might be good. But as of yet I haven't bought one.  Mostly my problems with it have been small. Overall, I really love this product. It's my Sansa Baby :)

<Title>Great design, but unstable operation
<Date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the Sansa c250 as a birthday gift about 1.5 years ago. It was meant to be a replacement for my older 256 MB Sandisk. Initially I was very happy with it. I liked the large disk capacity, the sleek design, the color screen, and the user-friendly interface which was a great improvement over the old model. However, after several months of use, there was trouble in paradise. It started freezing after every 1-2 hours of use. The only way to start it again was to hold down the power button for a forced reboot. Sometimes doing this once didn't help and I had to reboot it several times before it would start working again. According to Sandisk tech support, this is a firmware problem that some of the Sansa models have. Since the warranty is expired, there is nothing they can do. Re-formatting alleviates the problem, but it comes back a few days later. This is a very annoying problem and it outweights all the things that I like about the c250. If you buy it, you may be lucky and get one without this instability, but as the saying goes, Caveat Emptor.

<Title>Nice little mp3 player with decent FM reception
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Originally, I bought this unit for my kids who wanted an iPod Nano. They're pretty young, 7 and 10, so I didn't feel like spending the money on an iPod only to have it lost or broken shortly after they received it.  They both love the c250 and I really like it as well.  It's got decent sound, handles wma as well as mp3 files, has a great little FM radio, and has very respectable battery life.  Overall, a nice little unit!

<Content>I have an i-pod nano also, and I like the Sansa better.  It has a better price.  It is easier for me to download my music from my PC (I don't really like to use iTunes that much).  And, it has an FM radio, which the ipod doesn't.  I can use the radio in order to listen to the TV's at the gym when I exercise.

<Content>this has everything one could want form an mp3 player, if you want design than don't even bother yourself reading this, go to apple. I recommend buying a better set of headphones, and the only thing that bothers me is that while starting up it refreshes it's database which takes too long, if they could fix that, it would be perfect

<Title>Too Many Flaws
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't buy this if you are a first time user. Neat little machine but if you expect to use the functions get a more evolved model. Hard to set, easy to mess up, no battery life, buttons are a design flaw/not user friendly. The older battery version (m100)is easier. Save your money and get a good ipod or zune when you decide what music format you will keep (forever) but leave this alone. Looks great, nice idea, just needs work.

<Title>great little mp3 player
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was my husband and my first mp3 player and it has turned out to be a great deal.  We were excited to plug it in and use it right away, but had some trouble getting my computer to recognize the device.  A colleagues did, so we knew it was not a problem with the mp3 player.  Finally, after contacting technical service at Sandisc, we fixed the problem (needed to download new drivers) and it has been just great.  Technical service was very helpful and prompt, which I appreciated.  All in all, a great buy for the low pricetag.

<Title>Can't be beat when you consider price and features
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My significant other and I bought two of these at a Black Friday sale for $40 each. Can't beat that.  Had some trouble getting Vista to recognize the unit on both computers, but discovered a trick for that. In the player's settings menu, change the USB setting from Automatic to MSC. When you plug it in, Vista will install the proper drivers. After that, you can leave it on MSC or set it back to Automatic (which you'll want to do if you want Windows Media Player to manage the device).  The included headphones are garbage. Bought a cheap pair of Griffin earbuds and the sound quality is MUCH improved.  Very happy with the player itself. If the USB mode it set to MSC, you can drag albums and songs onto the player from My Computer. You're limited to the single GoList playlist though. I prefer to use it with the mode set to Automatic, which lets Windows Media Player transfer music to the player. Just drag an album to the sync list or create a playlist and drag that--click the Sync button and you're done. Transferring music that way also has the benefit that the player doesn't have to "resychronize database" every time you unplug it from the PC.  The nice thing about using Windows Media Player to manage the device is that it checks to see what you've already transferred. When you sync a playlist, it doesn't transfer duplicate songs. It only transfers the songs that aren't in the player yet.  The user's manual doesn't explain how to use the player very well, but the interface is intuitive and you quickly figure out how everything works. A previous Amazon review commented you can't jump between radio presets. You can, just press the silver select button. For a while, I was disappointed because I thought you couldn't fast forward or rewind a song. As it turns out, you can do so by holding the next/back buttons instead of tapping them. On the whole, the interface is excellent. You can select songs by artist, album, or song; you can select "play all"; or, you can select one of the playlists you transferred. I use it at the gym, so the shuffle option is also much appreciated.  Love the FM Radio function. The reception isn't as good as our car radio, but the majority of local stations come in clear. The gym we go to uses FM transmitters to let people listen to the audio from the TVs there, and I get reception from those in the parking lot. Once you set up pre-sets, just tap the select button to cycle through them.  I thought 2GB of storage wouldn't be enough, but for my needs, it's plenty. I keep a huge music library on my computer, and listen to that at home. For the Sansa, I just dragged some albums onto it and made a playlist containing my favorite songs. Right now, I have 12 albums on there and a bunch of individual songs--nearly 400 songs in total. I have about 150MB left, which will hold 2 or 3 more albums at least. If I get cramped for space, I'll just buy a 2GB microSD card, which should tide me over.  I love the size of the unit. It's small and light, but the screen is sharp and the build quality is solid. My SO dropped hers onto a tile floor in the process of opening the package. A loud WHACK was heard. No cracks, no damage, the player works fine. Advertised battery life is 15 hours. I'm finding I get about 6-10 hours on average. That's fine for me, and it is totally dependent on how long the screen is on. The less time you spend fiddling with the buttons, the longer the battery will last. I don't mind the proprietary USB cord / charger that it came with, since I have three computers, an Xbox 360, and a PlayStation 3 in the house. They all have USB ports to charge with.  Also, the Xbox 360 and PS3 recognize the music on the device, so you can listen to it while you play. The PS3 will actually let you copy music from the device to the machine, or copy music to it. Yes, you could use the player with a PS3 instead of a computer if you wanted.  All in all, extremely satisfied with the purchase. I get most of the features of an iPod Nano at well under half the cost, I don't have to use iTunes or stick to a single library manager, and I can continue to use MP3 files that don't have DRM built into them (the player does support DRM with WMA though, so you're fine if you use Rhapsody, Napster, or Wal-mart's music stores).

<Title>Good for the money, but OS inferior to earlier units.
<Date>Sat Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 3 year old 512k Sandisk developed a lose earplug mount so it was to upgrade.  The store I went to was offering the C250 model for the same price as the C240 model so I bought it.  The new unit is nice.  The sound is better than my older model and the 64k color display is decent.  You can view photos on it if you wish.  It has a rechargeable lithium polymer battery which is a minus as they wear out over time, Sandisk makes up for this a bit by making the battery replaceable (although the kid at the Be-st buy store was wrong when he said it wasn't--maybe he was just trying to sell an extended warranty plan--bah).  Still, I miss the flexibility my older player had with its AAA battery and the older one had a very similar battery life as my new one.  It has a passable FM tuner with decent reception.  It won't work as well as a home receiver but it works okay.  Sadly, Sandisk still does not sell a player with AM capability, another minus.  The unit has shuffle play but not random play.  (By definition, shuffle play will potentially repeat a song already played, while random play will not).  This is an OS weakness that would be easy to implement in the OS code, but most manufacturers don't bother.  Sandisk no longer uses a true FAT32 file system so their newer players have lost an enormous amount of flexibility compared to the older units.  Now, I can only play music by "Artist", "Genre", "Song", and "Album".  You no longer can pick a folder of music to play so you are limited by the predefined categories.    My old unit allowed the ability to play dance with pop by putting them in the same folder and simply playing from it.  With the new unit that would be impossible without messing with the ID tags because now I can only select dance or pop but not both at the same time.  It is "all" music or "one" genre, but not "some" genres.  Clearly a big weakness.  From what I can tell, the unit uses the contents of the ID1 tags, so you need to have them properly populated.  It does use playlists but I tend to not use them.  I read that this unit only supports 1 playlist but I have yet to confirm that.  If it allows multiple playlists then I could mix dance and pop but it would be pain to create a playlist for that.  In addition, the OS has been greatly dumbed down.  You no longer can select the playback, display, or search speeds.  You can no longer change the display orientation from right-handed to left-handed.  You can no longer set left or right balance.  You can no longer delete files from the device unless you are connected to a PC.  The display no longer shows how much time is left on a song as it now only displays elapsed time, and you can no longer display what file name.  It is unfortunate that the newer units have been dumbed down as they have lost a number of very useful capabilities.  Still, I like the new unit overall and I will adjust to the differences.  It's a good unit for the money and the Sandisk quality is still there--my last one lasted 3 years under heavy use (3-6 hours a day) so I can't complain.  If this will be your first MP3 player you probably won't be disappointed.

<Title>Good Player for the money
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this mp3 player a lot.  I originally had a creative labs 30gb, It died and I did not want to spend $200 again.  This player is pretty small and very light wieght, about the length of my middle finger.  Adding music is a breeze.   Controls are very easy to navigate, no need to read instructions, I had them figured out in about a minute.  The provided earbuds do not sound that great.  Not bad, but I liked my creative labs earbuds better.  I may replace these in the near future.  The sandisk earbuds do stay in my ears better than most though.  I usually hate earbuds, they hurt and always fall out, the sandisk ones tend to stay in place.  Accessories for this player are also difficult to find.  Sandisk website lists several accessories but when you click on them nothing pops up.  Basically I am looking for a clip, but have had no luck so far. The package includes an ad for accessories, but most are for the e200 series and do you no good since you have the c200 series.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.  Good MP3 player from a quality name brand.  Extremely easy to use.  Only downsides are a lack of readily availible accessories and the earbuds could be better.  I would still recommend this player over an ipod any day.  But would probably say creative labs is better than the sansa though.  The creative zen v plus is about the same size and only ten or so dollars more expensive, and it plays video, and accessories are everywhere.  I wish I would have bought the creative zen v plus instead.  But, I wanted an expansion slot and I thought the zen v was too expensive.  It has come down in price since I bought the sansa, soo... it is more affordable now.

<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this unit for my 10 year old so she would have something simple to use.  Unfortunatley it is too simple.  The music management is terrible.  It seems to put songs and albums where it wants to, and some things will show up on the player when it is connected to the computer, but will not be there when you look for it on the player.    The other issue I have it even the lowest volume setting is too loud, especially for a child.  I guess in hind site I should have loved her more and purchased the Nano.

<Title>Terrific Value - perfect for travel or the gym
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this player very much.  It is a great alternative to the ipod nano (compare price and features). It is handy that you can expand the memory with small SD cards too. I bought this unit because of the low price and because it includes an FM tuner (NPR junkie).  I have one minor complaint.  Once you scan for your FM presets, there appears to be no way to flip from one pre-set to the next with a single button push.  You have to go through a bit of a menu procedure, and this is a hassle.  i have had other mp3 players that allowed you to hit (forward) to go to the next pre-set.  I am not 100% sure about this flaw because I have not thoroughly investigated the issue.  However, this flaw is not a deal breaker.

<Title>Don't Waste Your Money
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a device with a lot of glitches in it. Combine with the poorest of customer service, and you get a piece of junk.  1. The interface is overly sensitive. Any little movement can cause a change or a skip.  2. The backlit screen is blue based, and a little blue dot rather than a highlight bar indicates which song you're on. The problem is that the blue dot blends in with the screen. Sometimes you're not sure where you're at.  3. The manual that comes with it is a sheet that really tells you nothing. If you want a fuller manual, you have to go online and download it.  4. There's a lot of skipping for no apparent reason. Call customer service and they'll tell you nothing's wrong. Most of the reps sound young, in a hurry, and rude. They'll resychronize your gadget, tell you that should do it, and then it goes right back to skipping. You can make a million calls, doesn't matter.  Sandisk's HQ is very polite and professional, but there is a big disconnect between their corporate offices and their workforce.  5. Their connectivity cable is proprietary to Sandisk, can't be bought elsewhere except online at their store. Except now they're out of it, and will be for more than a month. So if you lose your cable or damage it, then what?   I wish I had bought an iPod.

<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own an iPod but I was looking for a small, lightweight, inexpensive device that supports to-go services for use on bike rides and at the gym.  The c250 meets this criteria and the transfer rates were great.  I thought I made a great choice...but then I listened to the output.  I tried a fleet of headphones but none could make the sound quality even close to adequate.  It's a little worse than AM radio quality.  I tried to justify it because the design meets my needs, but in the end I need a device that plays music.  Perhaps the iPod has spoiled me.  I wouldn't mind giving this device to a nephew under twelve or a grandmother.  In the end, I owned it for six hours.  I ended up going with a Creative Zen V Plus.  I think I like the weight and design of this device better, but the Zen offers much better sound quality.  Not great, but adequate sound for activities.

<Content>I was looking for an mp3 player for my comute to work on the train. I didnt want to spend 200+ for an iPod so I started looking and found this little gem.   I was surprised how small it was, but it still has a color screen and menu for creating playlists and you can choose to search by album,song, or artist. I had a Micro SD card for my phone which I barely use, so that's an extra 2GB of storage I have for backup if I need. Currently I have just under 2GB full of songs.   The sound is great, with deep base and long battery life. It even has an FM tuner which I've used and it comes in crystal clear.   Its amazing how much this thing has to offer for this low price. I was skeptical at first because it was so low, but I couldnt be happier now.

<Title>Not reliable enough
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this MP3 player for about a year, and I am disappointed with it. The earbuds that were included died after only a few months, losing sound entirely on the left side. After replacing them, I have recently noticed the sound disappearing from the left side again; for whatever reason, turning it off and back on restores it. Several times it has locked up - most recently giving me a message about a firmware upgrade that SanDisk does not have on their website - forcing me to eject the battery and replace it.  The price and capacity were right, it has served for my casual listening needs, and I don't regret buying it, but I feel like I have to replace it now. A one year lifespan is inadequate, and I will NOT be buying another Sansa.

<Content>I bought the sansa 2GB to replace another player that I had damaged.  I wanted a replacement fast without spending too much money, but I knew I would need more storage than 2 GB eventually.  The sansa was the perfect answer--because it is expandable via mini SD, you don't overspend for onboard memory, and it has all the features of the trendy players and then some.  While the auto load of CD images to accompany each song is kind of cool, I wish it had been easier to opt not to transfer CD images in order to preserve as much space for songs as possible.  It does have a very long lasting battery, as I use it for over a week at a time without charging.  The size is great, I just wish it came with the armband rather than lanyard and that it came with the AC adapter rather than charge by USB.  Totally worth the price, and definitely better than the competitors that charge over $100 for a lousy 2GB. :)

<Title>Excellent Product for the Price
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  The battery life is good and it can hold more songs than she would ever need.  The menu system can be tricky at times especially when there are a lot of songs on the device.  After getting used to it, it is pretty straight forward.

<Content>If your goal is simply to listen to hours and hours of music then this is the perfect mp3 player. I especially like having multiple playlists and shuffle play. The headphones are contructed well but the sound is just barely average. Overall though, still a great value for the price.

<Content>I bought this for my dad who after seeing my Sansa liked all it's capabilities. this little guy has more bang for the buck. It buy far suppasses the I-POD equal. the does music, pictures, videos, FM radio, FM radio recording, and voice recording. I haven't really played with the thing since it's my dad's but I love mine.

<Title>Sandisk is the Ipod Killah!!
<Date>Wed May 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I actually purchased this for a friend... but I do own the Sansa E260 4 gig and a 30 gig ipod video... and let me say that sandisk is on the right track... besides all the other little gimmicks (fm radio & voice recorder)... I think their superior to the ipod... for the simple reason if you don't have an apple they're way easier to use... just plug it in and drag and drop... or you can just drop tracks into windows media player and click sync and off you go... ipod's are really nice don't get me wrong... I use mine all the time... my girl uses my sansa... but they're so difficult in comparison... and I'm pretty tech savy... the biggest problem I have with the ipod is that you can't just add songs.. you have to take them into a program then sync all the songs... I had the misfortune of clickin the just add recent songs and it delete all 14 gigs of the other music I had on there... never had that problem with the sandisk products... also if you have the E200 they play ALL video formats... you just drop them into the converter and it's on there... don't even let me start on getting video on an ipod... the only complaint I have is they don't make larger ones... I want to see a 80 gig sandisk... if one comes out... I'm pawning my ipod for sure!!

<Title>Basic Mp3 Player, limited function
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Strengths: THE MOST SHINING point of this product is that it could insert extra MicroSD card. Expend its capacity to external large memory.  Weaknesses: BAD SOFTWARE come with the machine, must be upgraded. VERY Limited functions than non-brand product. Details: I bought two different kinds of players at the same time. One is Sansa C250 another is a non-brand product, no experience on other brand. I would give Sansa C250 4 star originally. However after compare the other non-brand product. I could only give it 2 stars.  Here is the fact of comparison.   Another one is a MP4 PLayer from China (KEO)( possibly distrubited by iceTechUSA?).    (1) Value/Function : Santa C250 is much more expensive than KEO,but function is much less;   (2) Function: KEO has MUCH MUCH more functions than Sansa, it is MP4 player which will play most of the media format wy plays several formats; Sansa C250 FM radio is weak and hard to tune, as an expensive player, it loses it value at this; KEO has triple size of Sansa C250 screen and higher resolution, while Sansa's photo function is only a symbol, could not be used at all in practical meaning;  (3)Sound quality:I compared sound quality with another expensive monitor headphone; they should be at the same level in my view; KEO comes with an inferior earbud,Sansa has a average earbud. However, most of the people will upgrade earbud after purchase to persue extreme sound, this should be not a big issue;   (4) Appearance: KEO is half thickness of Sansa C250, but a little bit wider and longer;itis metal body, beautiful shape, looks solid and VERY well built, could compare to any SONY MP3 machine in my view; Sansa C250 definitely loses at this;   (5)Expandable: Sansa will beat any other brand at this A MOST SHINING POINTING FOR MP3 player; KEO does not have expendable slot;  (6) Accessories: Sansa C250 comes with very little accessories , no charger, no protection cover, USB cable is bulky and clumsy ; However KEO has USB charger, and a becautiful soft silicon protection cover, delicate ans presise cable; Simply do not understand why such a famous brand comes with so meager accessories?Sansa C250 definitely loses at this point;  (7)Software: KEO will immediately work on all me three XP box( I do not know MAC) no need to install driver even. Copy music and photo all fully easy and automatically runs well.FULLY support worldwide language (include Asian area) It also shipped with CD ripper and other applications; While for Sansa, the software comes with original machine is garbage, it ALMOST not works at all (Connect problem, duplicated copy, not support world language), in a word , it can not work if no firmware upgrade. I WAS VERY suprised why a FAMOUS BRAND manufacturer will pass quality ensurance to issue to market with such an inferior software, after struggle whole night , I finally upgraded with version 1.1, afterwards it could accomplish basic work. A pain.    Conclusion: I leant a lesson, brand product is not necessories best product, possible just an above average product.

<Title>Poor firmware
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The c200 has some very good features (its replaceable battery is probably the feature I found most attractive). I enjoy listening to recorded books on long journeys, and this activity highlights its major failings:  It cannot keep track of its position in a long WMA file. It resets if it is charged, or if you play another audio file.   Its fast-forward function hardly qualifies. I have resorted to using a spring clip to hold the FF key depressed for about 20 minutes at a time to resume a story somewhere in the middle(most books are about 10 hours) and the chances of resetting are very high.  It really needs a firmware upgrade to address these problems. If all you want to do is listen to music then it is fine as is.

<Title>Beware of Reviews --- Here's a Review
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After looking at Zunes and iPods, I got a major league headache. Neither of these units seem to do everything that they should for the high price tag and all of the hype. Clearly, Micro$oft and Apple are getting way too big for their britches. Still, they'll probably make the definitive moble media player in 10 to 12 generations and it will probably be fairly priced. In the meantime, SanDisk makes this little gem. It doesn't do everything, it just does what it needs to do --- which is to play mp3s. No hype, no crazy price tag, easy as pie to use (drag and drop), good sound quality (use decent headphones), good screen/picture for what it should be used for (identifying song titles), compact size (like a pack of Double Mint gum), light as a feather, and just a hint of coolness (you can even configure the EQ to your specifications and not just to a preset like Zune and iPod). As others have said, it's the best mp3 player for the money --- and you can still look up Zune's and iPod's later generations for hopefully a more complete solution --- after all you won't be broke (or committed to the Zune Marketplace or iTunes).

<Title>OK,  but has many problems
<Date>Sat Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this product for about 6 months - I have used this extensively and here is my conclusion  Pros: - Small portable player - LCD screen for navigating files, although it is really made for menus and not picture viewing. - Navigating through songs is fairly easy, "go list" is helpful. - Microphone recording - FM radio w/ recording  Cons: - Files that are transfered on to the device are often (always) corrupted. Happens constantly for me, even when i re-transfer them. My guess is that either the proprietary USB cable is broken or the flash memory is crappy - EXTREMELY flimsy, is not sturdy at all, and the plastic on the sides can be pushed in. - Am now having problems with the headphone jack - Must use Windows Media Player to create playlists. - Proprietary USB cable, so if it breaks you have to order a new one from them for much more than a standard USB cable. There is no need for a proprietary USB cable on this player except to screw customers over.  This player is great in terms of functionality but when it comes to quality this player falls short.  It is poorly constructed and defiantly not as solid as many phones and other players.  Bottom line if you're going to spend this much you may as well spend a little more GET SOMETHING BETTER.

<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player is a brezze to use. Ripping Songs from CDs is a snap with Windows Media Player 11. Syncing the device is just as easy. Mine is newer one didn't have to worry mode settings there isn't any. As note don't format the player it will wipe out library of songs. This player sounds fantastic, Plus Fm tuner, a great product.

<Title>Great Unit, easy to use--but very prone to hardware problems
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had (and thrown away) several of these...I really like how compact it is...how easy it is to load with music, ease of use, its sound quality (get rid of stock headphones immediately!), its affordablility, that it's NOT an IPOD....However have had problems over time with Jacks going bad, connectors going bad, unit locking up...  I really don't know what to say...except that the features and value may make it worth it for you to try one. You might get lucky and not have problems with your player...but if you do, you may, like me, figured you got your money's worth anyway (considering the relatively low price?).  I would gladly pay double or triple for a more robust version. Would also be willing to go with another brand...but not seeing many that appear to be more hardy...other than the IPODs. Love the sound and build of IPODs but do not like the 'use' policys, restrictions, and 'oversight' aspects.   Hopefully, someone will build an quality MP3 player with the best of all of these qualities, someday!

<Content>Well I liked this product alot when I first bought it.  It is simple to download music onto it.  I am thankful that I bought the extended service plan on it because now it is not working.  It keeps erasing all the memory cards out and it's own memory.  I will download and a half an hour later it is gone.  Now I have to send it in and wait for the company to send me a voucher to go get another one.  I may not buy this same one now.

<Title>I Love My lil Monsta
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Sansa for about a month now and I loved it from the start.  I've been looking for cons and the only one I've got so far is that there aren't more color choices or stylish "jackets".  All I wanted was a simple MP3 player, but I immediately started dropping pics on it and doing little recordings (soon to be podcasts).  I don't use the radio, but all the other features are great. And it is the easiest thing to use, even if you use Windows Media Player. Before I bought it, I had doubts about the screen contrast (which I can understand people's complaints, but hasn't been a problem for me at all), and the reliability.  I compared it to the MP3 player benchmark(the ipod)and other players, and I found similar problems with all of them, which I'm guessing are pretty standard possibilities across the board.  And since mine had no problems playing anything (and I download some seriously poor quality MP3s-from indie bands around the world) I believe there are more user errors than anything.  I could go on an anti-ipod rant here or go off on the proprietary nature of Apple Computers, but simply said PCs work best with PC products and how can you beat the price!!!  This is the best player out there for under $100 (hell for under $300) and for 20 bucks you can expand it to four GBs!!

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Usually when you purchase an item like this one, you receive a manual or owner's guide that gives detailed instructions on how to use it. This is not the case with the Sansa c250 mp3 player. I have had to hunt for information on the Internet just to get things done. Information that's missing:  1. Albums folder: what is its function, how can I populate it?  2. MTP mode: the only reason I know about this "mode" is because I found out about it on a few sites that have help forums. I don't know what MTP stands for, and the message "USB connected MTP" does not show up when I go into Auto-detect mode and then connect the c250 to the PC.  3. How about telling the user what MTP nd MSC mean? It would be nice to be told this stuff, especially if you're new to devices like these.  4. Where are the instructions for creating playlists?  The owner's manual for my toaster oven is the size of a small book in comparison, surely SanDisk could have come up with a more detailed instruction manual.

<Content>i bought the c250 back in june. now in the 5th month of owning the c250 and the mp3 player freezes all the time and it skips(weird right?)when i go jogging or bike riding with it. but it does have some cool features like FM tuner and Voice Recorder...just wish the software on the c250 was better made. One more thing, the screen, though color, is also very poor.  BOTTOM LINE: if u want a cheaply priced mp3 player that just plays music then this might be for u...but remember the old saying "u get what u pay for"

Although it cant hold a lot of songs, u can buy an addition microSD for it and it could increase the memory.The screen is easily scratched but u can always buy a screen protector or put it in a case. Lastly for all you loud volumers, half way into the volume option its already loud.

<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Prospective buyers should be aware that if they receive a defective product as I did, they will have a very difficult time getting SanDisk to resolve the problem.  The SanDisk Online Customer Service is a tricky maze to navigate, and the questions and challenges from the SanDisk Rep are more intense than Homeland Security.  I received my SanDisk Sansa c250 MP3 Player at the beginning of April, and I am still waiting for a replacement installation disk at mid-May. I am unable to get a refund, so my only recourse is Small Claims Court.
