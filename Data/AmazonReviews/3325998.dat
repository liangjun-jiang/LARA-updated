<Title>Nice simple player...but
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is a nice sounding MP3 player.  Even my 4 year old grand daughter can operate it, which is why I bought it for my wife.  She gets lost in all the menu choices of other players.  However, problems.... 1. Random function may work on the 1G models, but on the 2G model here    the random OFTEN plays songs over again. (Maybe a larger seed value    Coby) 2. The main ON-OFF-PLAY button sticks and requires many attempts to get    the unit on or off. 3. I find it hard to believe the 2.5mm headphones were required.  The     standard 3.5mm looks like it would fit the tiny case.  The 2.5-3.5    adapter is in the package, just something else to get lost.  Over all, nice product.  I would buy another, which I did for my grand- daughter.  1G model- Hot (Princess) Pink.

<Title>Nice & Simple

<Content>For what it is..it's great. It's about the simplest player you can find. I love the fact that all you have to do is drag & drop your files in the Coby...nothing to install. Plays fine & sounds fine. It's not an iPod, but you already know that. It would have been nice if it had some kind of carrying case..for the player & accessories. I went hunting & found my old beeper strap & attached it to my Coby pretty much right away..I mean it's only plastic & doesn't grip all that tight. So, if I were you I'd put some kind of strap on it or maybe attach some rubber to the inside of the clip to help it grip better. Over all..it's nice & worth the money.
