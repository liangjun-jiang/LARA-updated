<Content>Is iPod, iTunes, iTunes Music Store A Monopoly?    In the basic sense of the word 'monopoly', Apple has one in the iPod ecosystem.   There are multiple definitions as to what constitutes a 'monopoly.' There's Microsoft's Windows. Apple's iPod ecosystem. Merriam-Webster's definition. And the legal definition. Has Apple created a monopoly?   Yes. What goes around, comes around. Apple's iPod ecosystem, which includes the ubiquitous iPod, iTunes on Mac and Windows, and the iTunes Music Store, is truly a monopoly.   Or, nearly a monopoly. Or, could be proven to be a monopoly. Or not. That's how law seems to work these days.   Thomas Slattery sued Apple Computer, claiming the iPod is configured so that it will only play music from iTunes Music Store and not music from other online stores.   In short, Apple is facing a number of federal and state antitrust claims, and a California judge has ruled that the plaintiff (Slattery) in this case has met the qualifications which assert a "tying" claim.   The case may now proceed as a monopolization claim under the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and other claims for violation of California's antitrust and unfair-competition laws.   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates must be smiling. RealNetworks CEO (former Microsoft employee) Rob Glaser probably helped himself to another jelly doughnut.   The judge noted the basic facts: Apple has an 80-percent market share for online music sales, and more than 90-percent of the market for portable hard-drive music players.   According to Merrium-Webster (the only authority who would comment), there's a non-legal definition for 'monopoly`:    Main Entry: mo�nop�o�ly  Function: noun  Inflected Form(s): plural -lies  Etymology: Latin monopolium, from Greek monopOlion, from mon- + pOlein to sell  1 : exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action  2 : exclusive possession or control  3 : a commodity controlled by one party  4 : one that has a monopoly   If Windows is a monopoly at 90-percent of operating systems on PCs, then Apple can have a near-monopoly on portable music players and online music sales with the iPod's ecosystem.   But a monopoly does not illegallity make.   The issue is how Apple wields that monopoly and both the plaintiff and the judge in the California case think Apple may need to loosen the iPod's ecostrings.   It's the whole 'closed system` perspective that seems to continue to haunt Steve Jobs and Apple. Granted, the iPod ecosystem works very well. No one else has bettered the mousetrap.   That's the point. It's a trap. Mostly. Once you buy an iPod, you're pretty much obligated to use iTunes if you want to listen to music on said iPod.   Once you start with iTunes, you're just a click away from the iTunes Music Store, and, if you're an iPod owner, that's pretty much the only store from which you can buy tunes that will play on the iPod.   Except Wal-Mart, or Tower Records, or Sam Goody, or Target, or... you get the idea. There are alternatives, but online it's mostly iTMS or nothing if you're an iPod owner.   For example, you can't buy music on Microsoft's Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that's not Apple's fault.   Then again, Microsoft is not the monopolist when it comes to music on PCs. It's an also ran. A runner up to the crumbs left by Apple's stampede.   The lawsuit, and others of similar ilk, have a case, though with many holes. While Microsoft abused their monopolistic position by forcing manufacturers to pay for Windows on every PC shipped, and to bundle software (illegally, it was determined), Apple doesn't really 'force` iPod buyers to use iTMS.   That's the difference, and it's a big difference. The problem is that you can't use other music from other online stores employing DRM (digital rights management) not compatible with iTunes.   Whose fault is that? Apple's? Yes and no.   Posted by Tera Patricks at 9:35 am on Monday, February 6 2006  Category: News * Reader Comments (26) * Email It  Page 1 of 1 pages  Reader comments...  Jeff says:  The remark about Microsoft deliberately modifying Windows to make Quicktime shaky is not completely true. The Quicktime plugin developers did not fully understand what they were doing, and were relying (unknowingly) on an undocumented side-effect. When that changed, they had problems. That was definitely Apples fault, not Microsofts.   The whole "why won't Apple license Fairplay" issue needs to be considered from a real business perspective. Does anyone know for a fact that Apple haven't said to anyone "Sure, you can use it, the one-time cost is $1,000,000,000"? (Long term, thats probably not an unrealistic figure)   The courts cannot mandate a price for a company to sell its IP. That would set a precedent that would bring down the US economy.   You might as well sue Microsoft for not "making Steve Jobs an offer he can't refuse". That'd probably be the responsible thing for Microsoft to do, where responsible == return the greatest profit to MSFT shareholders.   Hell, Apple are already being hauled over the coals for charging 3rd party manufacturers a fee per unit for using iPod-compatible connectors. No-ones suing over that price-gouging, because they can't. Its not illegal to price your product exorbitantly - if you can't afford to make iPod-compatible hardware, thats *your* problem, go make parts for some other mp3 player.   Market forces are supposed to sort this one out. Your new widget appears on the Dell player instead, its an instant hit, people drop the iPod in droves, you get to sleep "on piles of money with many beautiful girls"   The one counter to all of this, that I'm aware of, is the "inter-operability" argument. That Apple should be forced to open its IP up, so that its competitors can inter-operate with it, in the same way that the EU forced Microsoft to show the Samba guys its internals.   But this is not the same situation - the iPod can already play MP3. The only thing it won't do is support "someone elses file format" and thats a function of the business deal between two third parties, the other vendor and the music industry.   If the courts rule that Apple has to change its ways so that Microsoft and Sony can broaden their markets whilst maintaining their current contracts, then they (the courts) have sunk to an amazingly corrupt new low.   Posted by Jeff on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 11:58 am    ian Johnson says:  Not a fanboy, however apple built a working system and a good interface to deliver. No one is required to use either one. You can still buy CD's and play them on your a CD player. Should cassette- er 8-track manufacturers sue them for making CD's inoperable in an 8-track slot? You probably can't get the new Britny Spears on 8-track, and there's probably a recording of "Pac Man Fever" on cassette that will never make it to CD. It's called out with the old and in with the new. It happens. Don't cry because it just makes it that much harder. Primus came out with a Brown Album on vinyl long after LP's were much in vogue.  This is like the "Coffee is Hot" model with McDonalds. Based on these relatively simple premises:  1. Coffee is hot.  2. If at all possible avoid spilling it on yourself.  Nobody forces coffee to be hot. It's just better that way. Do not commandeer a cup of brew unless you feel you are sufficiently able to navigate the liquid as it cools down, into your mouth.  If you don't know how to load your iPod with songs that you got like your "Pac Man Fever" cassette. Get out your old Walkman. And return the iPod for someone more capable. If you want to buy a PossiblyWillPlay (TM) player and load it with songs you can only find on the iTunes store burn them on CD in audio format, after all you own a copy of the music, then use your Windows Media this or that to import the CD. As long as you bought the music you probably won't be reported to the RIAA for putting your Pat Boone iTunes original collection on your iWinKyoob player.  And to Adam, anyone can put their music on iTunes, even Purple Grandma Deathkill Emo, and apparently keep every penny of the sale from their "Knitting with Satan" EP. See this on Digg   Ok Ok, I'm sort of a fanboy and this is mostly a rant, but more importantly I believe that when you dumb stuff down for the least common denominator, everything starts to suck. -Hey world, someone come up with a cooler idea for music distribution and delivery format and I'll buy it. And in the meantime please keep the whining to a minimum.   Posted by ian Johnson on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 2:50 pm    iDJ says:  Didn't `WE' choose for iPod and iTunes? Aren't `WE' the millions of people that made the same choice? Didn't `WE' kill the the `others'.  Apple made something that WE love, because of the looks, the feel and it's easy to use too.  That's what WE want and WE made this monopoly!   `WE control iPod'   Posted by iDJ on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 4:07 pm    Jason says:  "For example, you can?buy music on Microsoft?Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that?not Apple?fault."   Actually, that IS Apple's fault. They won't allow iPods to play any DRM'd music but their own through the iTMS. And when anyone has tried to make their alternate legal service work with an iPod (like Real), they got sued by Apple.   The iPod is technically capable of supporting WMA and the associated DRM. The portalplayer platform they're all built on is used in other players that do. Similarly, other players could be made to work with Apple's FairPlay DRM - there's no technical hurdle, it is only that Apple refuses to license it.   Long story short: Apple holds the keys here and it is only their decisions that prevent interoperability (with either players or music stores).   Posted by Jason on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 10:25 am    Fred Winston says:  Nope, Jason. That's not it. It's still not Apple's fault that Windows media audio, even with DRM, won't play on iTunes. It's the DRM from Microsoft that's at fault. Not Apple. It's not an Apple licensing issue that other DRM'ed music won't play in iTunes. It's the fault of those that have proprietary DRM. The defacto standard for DRM is, of course, FairPlay. From Apple.   Posted by Fred Winston on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 11:25 am    adam says:  Fred -  it's equally the fault of apple that music bought from iTunes won't play on other non-apple devices.   defacto doesn't mean anything in this context.   Posted by adam on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 12:10 pm    Kai Cherry says:  Wow. That's all I can say here...after being `hung up on' by a fellow Mac user for picking `the wrong side' in this non-debate. The fact is, it feels good to be on top, some of us have a deep `love' for Apple.   But love is often blind. Apple has an effective monopoly on the Online Digital Music (and soon, probably video) market. This is a fact.   Apple has an *overwhelming* market share of the Hard Disk digital player market...and likely the flash market too. All of this in about 4 years time...from nowhere. Sound familiar?   Alone, these two things are perfectly alright. But the vertical integration in these two markets, and a lack of interoperability, and fairly aggressive tactics to break interoperability are a problem.   And let's not kid ourselves here: *Apple* benefits from this far more that the music rights holders. In the beginning, many, many large artists were not playing along, but the fact is, if you wanna move music online, there really isn't anywhere else to go.   What's really...weird...is that these same points people are using to defend Apple's position are the same one's Microsoft proponents were using. The difference is, by the time anyone stepped in to do anything about it, it was far too late. Everyone lost.   This is an emerging market. You can argue up one side and down the other about inferior competitive products or whatever, but if someone made a music store that sold songs for a nickel less per, worked with iPod/iTunes, and still had DRM...there would be more places to shop.   Or what of the higher quality audio and video people clamor for? Not gonna happen.   As well, if other folks stores could sell players that could play Fairplay DRM music (and lets be honest...this `they can sell in mp3' is a strawman; no Major Content Provider is licensing non-DRM music/video...stay with reality) then there might be room for some new emerging and compelling players out there.   The likely remedy here tho would be that Apple would have to adopt or support another technology; the burden would be on them to interoperate with the rest of the market. And that market uses Helix or WMA DRM.   As it stands, there is a wall there, and there is no way to penetrate it. Think about 5, 10 years from now. What if somehow, Apple was bought, or was no longer "the Apple that we love".   If it were *any other company* would this be "ok"? Seems to me that when it was, it wasn't. All I'm sayin'   Posted by Kai Cherry on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 12:49 am    John says:  Just a thought, but one can turn around and, looking the other way note that tunes bought from Steve only play on (portably) an iPod. That's more of a tie that binds....   Posted by John on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 1:56 am

<Content>to anyone thinking of buying this ipod i would suggest otherwise this is the only ipod i have ever owned so i can not generalize and say that all ipods lack good qualitybut, this does. I had by ipod for no even a year (and took good care of it, not dropping it, carrying it in a protective case) and it died. Just randomly died one day the ipod with the sad face and the exclamation point came up. So thank God i had a warrenty, i got it replaced for free. Everything was great i got it replaced in July 2006, it is now October 2006, and the new one died yesterday. Same thing as the last a "hardware problem". However, now my warrenty is up so in order to get it repaired, i will be charged, and im sure by december it wil have broken again. That is not a chance i am willing to take. As of now i have promised myself to never again purchase a ipod. I am now lookin to purchase either a Philips 30gb mp3 player or a Zen mp3 player, hopefully i will have better luck with either one.  if you purchase this item, good luck =]

<Title>An Outstanding and Very Reliable Music Player
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my third iPod, and just like the one's before it, it has delivered consistent performance and high quality sound. The iPod is a great looking player and the color screen adds a wonderful dimension for viewing photos and album art. I never have to worry about developing or printing photos anymore; instead I load them onto my iPod to share with friends and family (it's a lot easier than carrying around a photo album).  I've owned this particular player for a over a year now, and have never had any technical problems with it. I used to use it on a Windows computer before making the switch to a Mac, and I experienced seamless integration with both operating systems. It is very, very easy to put music on it with iTunes. The iPod has the most simple, easy to use user interface of any music player on the market, and the click-wheel makes navigating menus, photos, and music effortless.  Another important point is sound quality. I have listened to my iPod through ear-bud headphones (included Apple ear buds), in-ear headphones (Ultimate Ears), over-the-ear studio headphones (Sony DJ Headphones), and desktop speakers (Klipsch 2.1 Multimedia Speakers). No matter what the medium the iPod delivers consistent, quality sound, even at high volumes, with minimal distortion. The entire frequency range is heard through the iPod, which is particularly important to me.  There is a reason the iPod has taken off in the past few years, it consistently delivers great sound and features through an elegant and intuitive interface.

It is hard to find hardware and accessories for it because they don't make it anymore. I would definetely advise to NOT buy this product. Used ones can be good if they come at a good price.

<Title>AWESOME MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 20GB Photo Ipod uses a superb audio computer chip that surpasses the current IPOD classic model and previous IPOD video models.  The bottom line is that I previously owned  The 5th generation 30GB video for 18 months. I replaced it with the 4th generation 20GB photo IPOD it sounds better in my car and on my bose digital sound dock. I purchase an MP3 player for sound quality not looks. Hopefully apple will improve the audio computer chip for the current IPOD models. Until then if you want CD quality sound you cannot go wrong with the 4th generation 20GB photo IPOD.

<Title>piece of you know what...
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'd give this latest ipod less than one star if I could.  I've had two in the last week and they've both been pieces of crap.  The first one worked fine for a few days before it just wouldn't turn on one day.  This was about three days into it.  Thankfully Target took it back with no hassles and gave me a replacement.  I figured I'd just gotten a dud.  I mean hey...it happens with even the best brands.  I got it home, loaded it with music and again it played fine for a day or two.  The first time I went to charge it after the initial charge before I ever played it, it froze.  I unplugged it from the charger and it was frozen on the select language screen with the LCD lit up, which won't go off until the battery dies I guess.  Here's hoping Target is as cool about taking this one back.  I defintely won't be getting one of the same kind.  Maybe I'll pay a little more and get one up, or even better my money back.    I think it's because this is the first generation of the affordable color display.  Apple defintely has some bugs to work out of this sucker.  My first ipod still plays great so I think it's just this particular model.  Still, what a disapointment and a hassle.

<Title>Apple iPod 20GB Review
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the new iPod but now it comes standard with a color screen. The normal iPod's now come in a standard 20 gigabyte form and the high-capacity 60 gigabyte form. The 20GB holds 5,000 songs or 20,000 photos or 15,000 songs or 25,000 photos for the 60GB. This new iPod is a little bit larger than the original though, 4.1 x 2.4 x 0.63 inch weighing 5.9 ounces. But, they have upgraded the battery life from 12 hours to 15 hours, which is nice but I would like to see an iPod with a little more life. These are the supported audio formats: AAC (16 to 320 Kbps), Protected AAC (from iTunes Music Store), MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps), MP3 VBR, Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4), Apple Lossless, WAV, AIFF / Frequency response: 20Hz to 20,000Hz. Here are the supported photo display formats: Syncs iPod-viewable photos in JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, PSD (Mac only) and PNG formats. The accessories that comes with this device include: USB 2.0 and Firewire 400 (with Firewire cable, sold separately), Composite Video (with AV cable, sold separately), and headphones. So all together this looks like a very good iPod. I'm probably not going to buy it though because I already have a 20GB monochrome screen iPod and I don't think I need another one with a color screen. But if you are a first time iPod buyer I would recommend this or if you need more room to store yours songs get the 60GB. It's a great deal and especially now you can't resist it (20GB iPod Photo now same price as old monochrome iPod, $299.99)

<Content>Well!! Well!! Well guys. What we need is a sleek, perfectly designed, aesthetically pleasing, great sounding player for music. Thats what the latest iPod Photo is. Photos? thats a goodie. Well what I am trying to say is, you cant compare it to any other MP3 players in the market. iPod is in a league of its own.  A device that does one thing perfectly and for long, is what we need. Offcourse we could have a camera on it, a voice recorder may be, AM/FM ow thats a must!!, Cell phone? Make it an organizer....How about a microwave? Yea Rrright... I have played with most of them.....iRiver, Zen, Sony...The all in one paradigm of thought, eventually leaves us with none in one. Being a hardware designer myself, I wouldnt buy an all in one device. Take the iPod in your hand look at it, play it, use it...you will realize that this was created by a buncha cool dudes with passion for design, looks & music. They certainly had problems in their earlier versions. This device shows that they really have made an effort to overcome them to please you. Not merely make it a 'throw in more' competition. I think I see a remarkable betterment in the quality and fedility of the music output. A 20G can hold a lot of songs in its stomach. I wouldnt use it for file storage because you can assemble a 100GB pocket disk that requires no battery, power or recharging for $150. So, I wouldnt go for more than 20GB iPod. No wonder it is so popular.   So, Go for it!! You'll enjoy it.

<Title>This is a great product! 
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great product. It's the new and improved iPod 20 GB, same price ($300). Runs up to fifteen hours, which means I can listen to it a few hours a day and charge it every three or four days. Things you'll probably need for this product:  1. A case. Definitely. It could fall or get dirty quite easily.  2. If you like to go for rides on bike, or drive a lot, you'll need a remote control. You can easily and quickly push the buttons to skip or go back to a song.  3. A recorder. If you attend a lecture, or if you're still in school, you can easily record stuff and go back to it. I bought iTalk. Crystal clear, and good. But make sure your earphones are out when you record stuff.  I like playing games in color (the four games: bricks, solitaire, parachute, and music quiz. In music quiz, you try to identify songs that you already have stored on your iPod), and being able to put the album pictures on my iPod. Plus, I can put photos on my iPod and look at them wherever (as long as I have my iPod with me.) If I go on a trip with my camera, and run out of space, I can quickly put the photos on my iPod and then take more pictures. I can take up to 20,000 pictures, so space is not a problem at all (up to 5,000 songs). Plus, I can also put a slideshow on. The scroll wheel is easy to use, although not at first. If I put my iPod in my backpack, there is a "lock" button at the top, so that even when the buttons are pressed, nothing will happen. Volume control is easy.  This product is great; I reccomend it to anyone who wants an iPod.

<Content>The color iPod is the best electronic item I have owned so far... and I've owned a lot. To summarize:  - The Click-wheel is awesome, simple and superb to use - The color screen is great, clear and bright - The sound quality is quite good, though the headphones could handle bass better - iTunes is equally simple to start with, has good enough capabilities. Handling audiobooks is slightly counter-intuitive - The battery life is close to what's reported, though using the backlight and skipping through songs drains it significantly - One capability I seriosly miss in the iPod is song search capability. That would be the icing on the cake.  So far, soooo good. Can't have enough!

<Title>Buy the protection plan!
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Make sure you figure the cost of the protection plan when determining whether the iPod is a good deal or not.  Mine failed two weeks after the warranty expired.  My options?  Send them the failed iPod and $255 + tax and they send me a used or refurbished model with a 90 day warranty.  Basically they just want you to buy a new one.  Had I known that up front, I would have passed or at least made sure I bought the protection plan.  I got exactly 1 year out of mine and now it would cost me more to have it serviced than to buy a new one, so it is completely worthless.

<Content>What can I say, I have a soft spot for small milky white high-tech objects.  20 GB seems like a lot, especially after I put 680+ songs on it and it only took up about 3GB. The photo part isn't that useful because the fact that the screen is very small. It seems the battery last as long as 16 hours because I've played it all day and it's half gone.  It's a great buy.

<Title>Pretty Good, could be better
<Date>Sun Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did a lot of research before I finally decided to get an ipod. I was considering a zen touch, but the color screen, touch wheel, and photo capabilities sold me on the ipod.  I ended up getting an ipod HP version which is now discontinued but it is the same as the regular apple ipod.  Overall I'm pretty happy with the unit, and have had no problems as of yet after a month of constant use.  The photo capabilities of the unit come in really handy on trips, and then showing everyone the photos after.  I have no complaints about battery life yet, but that may change.  So far I use it several hours a day and have to charge it every 7 or 8 days. Having USB 2.0, all my 14gigs of music loaded under 15 minutes, but I may try firewire, unfortunately there is nothing supplied for firewire connectivity when you get the ipod, it all costs extra.  Music sounds pretty good, but not the best, it doesn't sound as lively or as full as other mp3 players I've used, even with some of my mp3s that are coded at 320kbps.  There are equalizer controls which helps the audio out but I'm also using a pair of $30 headphones, so I doubt I'm getting the best sound out of it.  One thing that was an annoyance is that you have to have all your mp3 tags in order if you want it to show up correctly in the player, the most important being genre, artist, and song title, sorting this out takes some time depending on your collection.  Personally I would like it better if it gave you the option of sorting music out by filename.  One of the gripes I have about the ipod is that it does not support drag and drop for music, this must be done using itunes.  It's not really a problem, but it just adds that much more of a hassle.  I do like how the unit can function as a mass storage device in both USB 1.1 and 2.0, this has come in handy for transferring large files.  Another issue with the ipod is that it scratches easily and is not very hardy just by itself so you definitely want to get a case of some sort, especially one that protects the screen. I personally like silicone skin cases, which is what I have. I think the ipod should have come with a case or protection of some sort.  This leads me to my last gripe, it seems most of the ipod accessories are unnecessarily expensive and over priced and every little thing is extra so this may have to be factored into your budget depending on what you want as far as better headphones, protection, and connectivity (firewire). All in all though, it's a good machine, I just hope it lasts and continues to live up to its hype.

<Content>I just purchased the iPOD Color and the Bose Sound dock...what a great combo! I love the clarity of the music.  Only problem is that my iPOD Color just froze on me, in the middle of a song screen. I tried all the tricks on the Apple support site to reboot it, nothing worked. I worked on it for an hour or more. I am going to return it to the store for an exchange. I will also follow a person's advice here and purchase the extended warranty. Are the iPODs known to be problematic?

<Title>iPod 5 Stars but iTunes 2 Stars
<Date>Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am using the new iPod Photo 20 GB (as you know Now iPod and iPod photo are same)  for past 15 days and this the best thing ever happened to me in music. It will change the way you listen music either on the go, in car or at home.  iPod: Good: 1. Greaaaaaaaat Sound 2. Look smartest among all portable players 3. Simple and excellent navigation (Best part is click wheel) 4. Good (Not Excellent) battery life 5. Lot of accessories available 6. No need to buy USB flash drives Can be Improved: 1. Changing the Genre form iPod itself (Without iTunes) 2. Deleting photos/songs/playlists from iPod itself (Without iTunes)  I think above 2 things can be incorporated without any increase in the cost.But pros certainly overpowers the cons.  iTunes: Good: 1. Ripping the audio CD can be done virtually without any loss in quality. Many other rippers don't preserve id tags (Containg Title, Artist, Genre etc.) of songs when you rip to MP3 format but iTunes does. 2. Very fast in transferring your songs/photos to/from iPod. Bad: 1. If you delete a playlist then their is no option to delete the songs permanently from the iTunes/iPod Library. Lets say you have 100 songs in a playlist. Then you make a new playlist (Using "On The Go Playlist" feature of iPod) of 70 songs. Now you want to free your iPod of the remaining 30 songs, you can't do it directly. You have to select them one by one from Library to delete using iTunes. 2. iTunes have no feature to remove songs from iPod which are not there is any playlist. 3. DO NOT TRY TO BECOME SMART BY USING KEYBOARD WITH iTunes. It sucks.  With such a nicly crafted product (iPod), I didn't expected such a bad interface software from Apple.  Also apple accessories (From Apple Store) are too highly priced when you can buy many of them from eBay at one third of the price at Apple store.  But overall a good exprience.

<Title>I owned a Dell DJ-30, but sold it and got this
<Date>Sat Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great MP3 player.  My only drawback is that I didn't purchase it sooner. I originally bought the Dell DJ-30 because it was cheaper and had 10GB more storage.  However, I change my mind too much, and have yet to really use more than 13GB.  Plus, this has a color display and it is soooo much easier to use than the Dell.  I thought I didn't want to get into the monopoly of iTunes, because I usually buy Musicmatch, Walmart, and Buy.com music files, but iTunes has all you need and more.  They have pre-release singles, and Podcasts are truely a cool thing.  I recommend it.

<Title>wow!

<Content>This a great product (yet again) from Apple. If you own a Mac (like I do) this works real smooth. I was able to sync my contacts and calendar too apart from all my music and podcasts without ANY hassles.  The colored screen has a more than decent resolutions and it syncs with iPhoto to make literally ALL your snaps available for viewing anytime. With 15 hours of battery life for music this is perfect.  It uses the same cable to charge and sync. It can also charge using your computers USB port. Not many people talk about this but I really liked the sound quality that my iPod delivered using the headphones that came with it. One downside I feel is when the noise level increases in my surroundings I have to take my iPod out, unlock it and then change the volume. No easy control on the headphone for it!!!

<Content>The Apple 20 GB iPod Photo is everything I could have hoped for...easy to move through, terrific sound, incredible storage capacity. The earphones provide fine quality although some discomfort in the ears occurs after an hour or so. I haven't tried storing digital images on the iPod directly from my camera but will report on that later. Overall, I can't find anything wrong with this unit. I also feel that ordering through Amazon.com was a good move as it saved me approximately $40 and delivery was prompt.

<Title>I waited a year researching and jumped at the $50 off the color iPOD.
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple 20 GB iPod Photo MA079LL/A was originally $300 and since its now on sale at $250, I finally bought this model after looking at various mp3 players for a year.  Now I'm a PC person and was originally afraid of compatability. I use the new  iTunes 6. Apple seems to constantly update the program with new features (like improved Podcasts support) Old version is in the box on a disc, download the latest when you install your player.  At first I thought hey I want to use Real Player or Window's Media player with my ipod.  But I find it helpful to keep what's on your ipod and what's on your PC in separate programs because once the tunes are on your ipod you can erase them from your PC to save space.  And iTunes 6 has many functions that customize your ipod player that just arent' available in other PC based mp3 players.  Then you can set it up to automatically rip CDs as soon as you put it in the drive. The ACC encoding available in iTunes and Real player sounds better with smaller files than WMAs. I consider myself a golden ear and while no player will match a Home Theater/ Audiophile experience, I found it difficult to distinguish WAV files from the Apple codecs ACC and apple lossless using the included Ear Buds.  Using my $100 earphones did sound better than the earbuds but I can't be isolated at work.  The iPOD is capable of sounding better with pricier earbods. Just remember with isolation earbuds you can't hear the phone or people yelling at you!  Why buy an Ipod Photo for $250instead of Apple 30 GB iPod with Video Playback Black for $300? The Ipod Photo is a 4th generation player, the video model is the 5th.  I would go with the new Video if you focus on photos since the screen is slightly bigger. Also if you have more than 30 GB of songs on your hard drive and need to carry about 30 GB than pay the extra $50.  But using mixed waves, MP3, and ACC, I have 1000 songs and its still not half filled. I would not buy the nano because if you like music, 4GB will not be enough storage for you.  Now why buy an Ipod instead of a Zen, Iriver or Sandisk? In my opinion the hardware feel and software quality of the iPOD is superior to these makes, but try them out yourself at a store.  They are not significantly cheaper for identical features either. If you use Napster, and Rhapsody to GO  (fill up your player for a monthly fee) you can't use the iPOD at present.    Rhapsody claims you can still buy $0.99 songs for iPOD but Apple's itunes store includes the CD art to display on the color screen. Yes the iPOD can drag and drop album art in itunes using ACC (best new codec), that are displayed in full color on the screen from right here on Amazon. But I don't think old MP3s can display the album art which is why some people say it doesn't work.  So I am very happy with the iPOD...

<Title>What other reviews may be hiding.
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When fully functional, Ipod's (any of them) can be your best friend, but unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world, so expect some drama. The 20 gig photo Ipod comes with many flaws, and I say this having returned the first one I bought because the screen froze. I was worried the next one I got would have the same ill fate, thankfully it didn't crash on me but it does still have alot of problems. For one, you can't always successfully upload photos, sometimes it updates without even putting the pictures on the Ipod you assigned it to. Deleting photos is also a major issue, some times I have to plug in/out and update the ipod at least 10 times before it even puts the pictures on it. You may also encounter an error while trying to do so. Most Ipod users will encounter the "do not disconnect" error that doesn't seem to leave your screen even after updating it. It may go away as it did with mine after a month or so, but chances are it will stay, as most people I know have the same issue. Another big problem with the Ipod is it's inconsistency to turn off. Resetting the Ipod may help solve the issue but it's an annoyance. Pushing and holding the play/pause button won't always do the trick, making me click in and out of menus and repeating the hold process to make it work. Uploading the music was never a problem, this is a great little machine, that is if you can deal with all the problems it brings along. Battery life is also a big lie, as the Ipod will NOT last 12 hours, not even close, you would be extremely lucky if you could get 6 hours on an Ipod. It takes pretty long to fully charge this but I can live with it, after all it holds thousands of songs that I can flip through whenever I want, and I never have to delete anything. You can hook the Ipod to big speakers if you are at a party and don't like the music they're playing, it's that simple. Overall this is a great thing to have if you listen to alot of music, not to mention it's small and can fit in your pocket. If you'r frustrated at first, it's perfectly normal, just get use to it and work your way around the little bugs that may and probably will come with your Ipod. Good listening.

<Title>Apple's Greatest Creation
<Date>Fri Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I got my ipod 20 gig for Christmas, I was overjoyed. I could finally listen to any of my music library, at the flick of my finger, and I wouldn't have to lug my CDs around with me. Last, and best, was that I didn't need to have that bulky portable CD player that had absolutely NO skip protection. Not only is the ipod convenient and useful, it is also a cool thing to show off at school or just when you're out. Everybody turns their heads when they see somebody with an ipod. But, as with everything, there are a few minor glitches. Here they are:  The "chrome" back finish scratches EXTREMELY easily. I read that in other reviews and quickly found that out. So, I would suggest buying a case for it. The screen scratches too, but not as easily. You can buy screen protectors for it.  Sometimes, when I leave my 'pod off for like a day or something, I try to turn it on, but it doesn't. I check for the hold button, but it isn't on. I then try to hold the pause button down for like five seconds. A non-backlit screen comes up with the apple logo on it. Further holding it down and the ipod comes on.  That's about it for the glitches. Not much, eh??? I truly love this product. It goes with me everywhere. I know you will like yours, too!!! Signed -- A girl

<Title>BUYER BEWARE: 5 iPods dead within a year!
<Date>Wed Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My iPod 40GB died within TWO MONTHS of its initial use as Christmas present.  The hard drive quit working and just makes little clicking sounds.    My husband's 20GB iPod died within SIX months of purchase.  His locks up his computer and won't hold files or play music.  He has been sent to "email support" but reformatting the hard drive and reinstalling the operating system hasn't helped, so we don't expect much good from that.   Our father in law went through 3 iPods within a year.  Similar issues.    These are lovely and useful devices, but TERRIBLE PRODUCT RELIABILITY.  None of us used the product while jogging or doing anything else strenuous to the devices.    Two of these iPods were refurbished by HP.  It took us TWO MONTHS to get support, getting bounced back and forth between the wrong phone lines (an IVR disconnected me before I ever got to a human being on one of the "support" lines), the Apple store (who said they don't support their own product at all - you have to go to HP for that, even though it bears an Apple logo!), and then their HP "support" phone line who, by the time I found them, said, "Sorry, you're out of warranty."    An industry insider suggested that we replace our iPods with the disposable Shuffle - not much functionality, but at least it's just $100 down the drain every year or so -- rather than $200 to $500!    Buyer beware.  These are disposable devices.  Handle them like glass and don't expect them to last.
