<Title>So many functions!

<Content>I'm very pleased with my new VL-531A. It's got all the functions I was looking for, and what a price! The sound quality is terrific, and the voice recording quality is better than I expected. That it does file sharing too is outstanding.   The downsides I'm experiencing are really only two, and they seem to be common to other non-ipod mp3 players. It won't play my itunes-purchased music, nor will it play music from a very recent CD I purchased; I'm thinking this is because of copy-protection encoding that this software isn't up to yet. Hopefully software upgrades will come out for the player to keep up?   The only other downside is that there is only one button to use to navigate through the menus and different options. So you have to toggle it side to side, press it straight down, or down and to one side - for different lengths of time, depending on what you want. My thumb isn't used to it quite yet, but I'm learning.   Overall, I'd recommend the VL-531A to folks who want lots more functionality than just a music player!  
<Overall>4
