<Content>Wish these were [more] available in the U.S.; they are easily had in Europe where they sell well. Not sure what the deal is.  Smallest 20GB music player available.   Does only one thing: play music, and does it extremely well.  Best feature to me is NO SOFTWARE REQUIRED. Device shows up as a removeable Hard Drive in Windows Explorer ('My Computer') (similar for Mac). Just drag and drop. You can put any files you want on there, just like a flash drive. The player will only be able to play the music files (WAV, MP3, WMV). In fact, it doesn't even come with software. If you want, you can use Windows Media Player or (for Apple users) iTunes (with the provided plugin--okay, the only software it comes with) to transfer files. If... you like that sort of thing.  One of several unique features is the ability to delete files FROM THE DEVICE. You can even copy files to different folders, or move (cut/paste) them! So you can screen a bunch of new music on a trip, delete the unwatned songs, and move the keepers to wherever you want!   Does NOT modify your music files to put copy protection or other evil changes upon them!  Very big screen size to device size ratio. Almost as big as ipod screen but about 2/3 the volume of ipod and a more pocketable shape. Screen not as clear or bright as ipod, but this, with the monochrome aspect, helps preserve battery life--it'll usually be in your pocket). Screen displays more actual song info than ipod: count up, count down, total song time, FILE NAME, id3 information (artist, song title, album), time, progress bar... screen is packed with info. Non-color screen may seem like a negative but to me it's a plus. With tiny devices, battery life is precious. XS-202s ("s" is for "slim") sports a li-ion battery, by the way.  Long battery life.   Great navigation (follows the directory structure).  Great sound (no difference from my soundblaster live sound card, except that XS202s unbelievably has virtually no self-noise, unlike the soundblaster). Unlike ipod, features a user-modifiable EQ setting (and it's live-modifiable).  'Real' random play.  Great 'Resume' feature.  Easy to fast-scan/fast-foward/reverse songs (cue and review).  Pretty bug-free firmware. Like most players, there is the rare lockup (especially when turning it off while a song is playing). Just hold down the "X" (off/back/left) button for 15 seconds and it will force a shutdown.  DOESN'T do a whole bunch of stupid features (like photo viewing, calendar, crappy/quirky video play). That is a plus to me. In my experience, getting a dedicated device which does ONE thing extremely well is better. Adding features usually harms the intended funtion. I do actually wish you could see non-music files as text files in this device, and edit them (you CAN rename files on the device, though, with a cool on-screen keyboard!!!).     CONS:   I wish there were joypad buttons instead of a 'joystick' which needs to be nudged. Pushing "in" the joystick pauses a song, and also functions as "OK" or "Enter". When it's in your pocket, it's easy to pause and resume your song... too easy. It is sometimes accidentally paused by bags I'm carrying swinging against my leg, or by leaning against a bathroom sink counter. A flush button would be superior here, but remember THERE IS NO PERFECT MUSIC PLAYER. To me, this is the closest thing.  Firmware updates are so far upgrade-only (no going back), but have poor changelog history (i.e. "music interface reworked").  With my current firmware, random play has option for "folder" or "all". If you choose "folder", it will only play songs in the root of that folder--not subfolders (!). This is my biggest complaint. You can choose to randomize 'all' songs, which is what I do, but then you get songs from all over. If you want to randomize songs from a 4-album anthology, for instance, and each album is in its own subfolder, with no individual songs in the root of that anthology folder, you won't be able to randomize folder play for that anthology. Don't know if that is addressed in the latest firmware--haven't updated yet... I want to make sure I'll prefer the new interface because I really like the old interface.  For Americans, tech support IS Amerian-based, BUT the one guy I spoke to (3rd shift) was unhelpful. He didn't have good phone manners, didn't know the product, couldn't answer my question, didn't offer to find the answer for me, when asked he didn't email me the info he said he would, and I'm sure he didn't submit the suggestion I requested to his manager. With dinks like that manning the phone, what's the advantage of American tech support? I don't know what they're paying him for. There wasn't anything he knew which you couldn't find out reading available documentation. Firmware development is done in the USA, so it's sad there's no clear way for actual customers to feedback to the company. I did email a suggestion but again got no acknowledgement or feedback.    WHY NOT IPOD: Only reason to go with an ipod is because you put looks over substance, love having a big corporation be able to control, modify, disable and even erase your music files, and love being forced to use a single bloaty proprietary money-making marketing software as the sole way to make your device function, the iPod's for you. (That's right--if you sync your ipod with another computer, it will erase whatever's currently on your ipod and mirror whatever's registered in iTunes on the new computer).     UNFORTUNATELY: Archos isn't making a 40GB version of this, even though their hard drive supplier reportedly makes a 40GB version of the 20GB hard drive used in this one. I've seen people speculating online about a self-upgrade, but I'm not risking it... not at this point, anyway. The vast majority of people won't have over 10GB of their own legit CD's anyway. The space left over you can use as a HUGE 'flash drive' to transport files. The only way most ppl would need more than 20GB is by having a huge catalog of either downloaded talk radio programs, or illegal songs.  Also unfortunately, there currently aren't many 60GB+ competitors to ipod. The ones which are, like Apple, force you to use their evil proprietary/controlling software to transport songs onto the device and 'make them playable'. You usually can't then copy music from the device back ONTO your computer if your hard drive dies. Archos is the main exception, but their Video/Multimedia players are too big for me.   The XS202s isn't much bigger than many of the larger flash-memory (2GB, 5GB) players and has a much better display. Again, it's about 3/5 to 2/3 the size of the ipod, has a solid feel, and a much better reputation for reliability/longevity.  
<Overall>5
