<Title>Hmmmm...I wish I would have held out 
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am like one of the other reviewers. I wanted to like this mp3 player but it is so terrible. I wish I would have held out for the Sony or Ipod. I bought this because it was on the cheaper side and I thought Philips would have been a good brand to have.It works sometimes and this is the longest it has been that it hasn't worked at all. The radio worked but I can't play any of the files I have on it. It is by no means user friendly. The instruction manual is not helpful at all. Anyway, I know I have gotten long winded but I would definitely recommend that you not buy this device.

<Title>It has its problems, but its great for the gym

<Content>Pros: Great design for the gym Good radio reception Built-in stopwatch Very inexpensive  Cons: Bad battery life Only compatible for sync with WMP 10 (not the newest) Very difficult to add a play list  Overall, I like it just because of the great design and ease of use while exercising.  This MP3 player is the reason why I started using rechargeable batteries.

<Title>went on the fritz

<Content>Stoped working after 2 months. I only used the radio and liked the presets. However it now has a demon and when you plug in the head phones it turns off or does weird scanning. But it doesn't work. It also used a Battery every four hours or so I bought rechargables but it was to much of a hassle.
