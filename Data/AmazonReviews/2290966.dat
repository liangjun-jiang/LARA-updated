<Title>Small mp3 big sound and clarity
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have avoided buying ipod's because of the price associated.  But now that I have broken down and purchased one I am pleased to say I was impressed.  This shuffle has powerful sound, without becoming distorted.  The battery lasts for mine about 4 1/2 hours and charges like a snap.  The mp3 player keeps where you left off if you suddenly have to turn it off, the player goes into pause if the headphones are unplugged, and the clip is extremely strong.  I ran on a track with this clipped to the end of my sleeve and it did not even move.  The only down side is that the headphone are not ear buds or wrap arounds, but that is just personal preference.  Even at this price I would recommend buying it, there is just not another mp3 that is better than a shuffle in this small of a package that does not have any design or software problems.

<Title>It's stupid but I LOVE it
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok, when Apple offered an ipod with no screen, where the songs are offered to you randomly, I thought - this is so DUMB.  Then I tried it.  Now my Nano and Classic 80 just sit gathering dust.  This device is so small and light and sounds great, and hey I just use iTunes to keep my current play-list on it.  If I don't feel like listening to a particular song, I just hit "skip".  IMPORTANT:  The sound can be a little lightweight unless you use earphones that have substantial bass.  I upgraded to earphones by Westone.  Awesome match with the Shuffle.

<Title>functional once u get past the setup
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So I buy the shuffle because it is wicked small, figure it will have the same simple drag and drop setup that the ipod has. Well, i come to find that loading music is pretty annoying, and slow. Music has to link up to the music loaded on you iTunes library which is annoying if i move some of the music around. when I want to delete music from the device agian, its easier to write down what songs you want to delete because doing it one by one will take far too long.  The device works fine, as would be expected from an apple product, but in comparison to what I'm already used to (iPod) the loading and unloading process is slower and as a result annoying. Other than that, once its good to go, its great for working out, small, practically weight less, unobtrusive. If there was another procut out there that was just as small , i would probably not get the ipod, but given that there isnt one as small, ill have to stick to this one for now.

<Content>I love this little guy - I listen to music only sparingly, mostly I listen to audio books - I had no problem downloading from Audible - one thing to be aware of, though - it is cheaper to purchase books through Audible than ITunes. Audible has directions on their site that tell you how to purchase from them and still download through ITunes.

<Title>Satisfied though wish for better earbuds
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for use at the gym. I clip it on my collar, and it's fine, stays there, does what it should. This is my big leap into the 21st century, so I'm still adjusting. I haven't timed it, but I don't know if the battery stays charged for as long as it claims. It's still good. My only beef is with the earbuds. They're of good sound quality, maybe too much bass, but that's a small quibble. I just wish they stayed in place while I'm running. I find myself adjusting them a lot, and when I sweat, they just pop right out. I wound up  buying some other clip-ons this week. Still, worth it to me.

<Title>More bang for your buck
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I was hesitant to buy the shuffle, am I selling myself short, Will I miss the video feature of a full-size iPod? The only thing I have been disappointed about this product is the fact that I bought the silver one just two months before the purple one came out. This ipod is great for working-out and traveling, the other ipods are too bulky for these activities. I take it everywhere with me.  I LOVE IT! Now if they can just stick more memory into that tiny little body.

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - A steep price for a starter MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The third generation of the iPod Shuffle is similar to the second.  It's a great MP3 player for working out or running, especially if you are a die-hard Apple fan.  However, the steep price means you had better review all your options before you choose this.  Pros - Small size - Nice case design - Many color options - Highly durable player - Apple reputation  Cons - High price point - Less durable shell - Proprietary dock for syncing - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability - iTunes software with limited formats (MP3, AAC) - Competing products offer more capacity for less $$  The Form Factor  This little guy is small!  The body has a spring loaded clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt without any extra case.  Apple added a few extra color options, including the popular purple.  It comes in a composite case. The 2nd generation's case seemed a little bit more durable.  The basic controls remain the same (fast forward, rewind, pause, and play) to access your music collection.  There is a headphone jack which you also use to mount this on the sync dock.  A standard USB B port would have been preferable to this as well.  Storage Capacity  Apple made it available only in 1GB sizes, same as the 2nd generation.  It would have made more sense to bump it up to at least 2GB.  The competing Zen Stone Plus by Creative offers 2GB (twice the songs), an FM tuner and the ability to see song titles for less money.  Sandisk also has some lower capacity Sansa models at similar price points. Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB MP3 Player Zen Stone Plus 2GB Black <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP50AY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa c150 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD40N8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">Sandisk Sansa Express 1 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IM9542/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Durability  Apple definitely deserves point for the more durable player in this group.  Even with the new player composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse.  Software  When you only have 1GB to fill, having to use iTunes software to do it seems excessive.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $65.  Sandisk Sansa has similarly priced models.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.  Overall this is a good player at a price that could be less.  Weigh your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Want to Make a Good Ipod Purchase? Stop here!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 3rd generation of the Ipod Shuffle has to be one of the best purchases that I have ever made, period.  Although I will admit that there is just one down side that I see in comparison to say the 80 gig classic Ipod, which I also own.  But lets focus on the positive first.    Running at least 8.5 miles a day, 5 times a week the Shuffle is great to have!  The controls are easy to use, it gets loud enough to drown out all of the people at the gym and the battery life is out of this world.  I love that it can handle hours of music, also that is so small that I forget that I am wearing it on my arm.  I also wrote a review one of the Shuffle arm bands that I highly suggest.  I know that a lot of people love their new Ipod Touches, but I think that the Shuffle could be the most valuable Ipod because of all of the people I see at the gym using one.  It makes time fly and I go a couple of weeks without having to charge it.    The one down side is the sound quality when you compare it to full size Ipod.  You can really tell the difference between them.  But that is just one of those trade offs for size and convinence that you are going to have to live with with the Shuffle.  The rest of the unit is great to use.  I know that other reviewers state that it is a little pricey compared to other small MP-3 players, and that is true, it is.  But when a product works like the Ipod Shuffle 3rd generation it is worth the little extra money for the long term benefits that the product is going to deliver.

<Title>Perfect size, functional on the go
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had one of the older 1st generation iPod shuffles and upgraded to this latest model 2 mos ago.  I primarily use it for running and working out.  The small size is perfect -- I love how it just clips to your clothes rather than requiring an armband or lanyard.  Also, I have not had the same issue with this iPod shuffle as I did with my old one in that it frequently had issues with its shuffle algorithm (to the point where I could tell it was merely going in the order of the artist's first name alphabetically or it would play the same block of songs over and over).  I have really been pleased with mine so far after 2 months and the price is reasonable given all the use I get out of my iPod shuffle.

<Title>Easy to operate, small in size
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first Ipod. I wanted to listen to music while I work out, by walking and cross country sking.  This is it.  It's so small I can bring it anywhere.  Good sound too.   I didn't like the fact that the software was not compatible to my windows 2000.  I had to use my wife's computer.  Apple's site of course wants you to buy their music, but they are pretty good about making it easy to download your own CD's.  The rechargable battery is nice.  I can easily go 10 hours on a charge.  I like things simple and the controls are very simple.  Thanks apple.

This version is great for running and workouts as it is sooo small and non-intrusive, and with its own clip.  I know Apple has just announced the 2GB version but for my running - 1GB and the battery life are more than enough features for me.  What a great price.

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - New Lower Price, Same Popular Player, Check it Out!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> Apple's iPod Shuffle is a compact MP3 player that's great for working out, running or just plain music listening on the go.  The new lower price as of January 2008 makes the relatively high cost of the device a little more bearable. Great as a gift, extra player, or exercise companion.   Pros  - Newly lowered price!!!! - Compact and functional design - Nicely integrated clip - No case needed! - Great family of Apple accessories - Great for those already used to iTunes - Included in-ear headphones are great for a starter pair - Lots of great color options (silver, green, purple, blue)  - Highly durable player  - Apple brand and reputation   Cons  - Still a premium price compared to competing players (total $ and $ per gigabyte) - Competing products offer more features, including fm radio and voice recording - No screen to view track names - Difficult to control / select tracks via playlists - Proprietary dock / jack for syncing  - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability  - Limited native file format support in iTunes (MP3, AAC), though you can easily convert  - No drag and drop music control - Non iTunes fans are still forced to deal with software limitations  The Form Factor   Size has always been the iPod shuffle's greatest asset.  The integrated clip is no doubt its second greatest asset.   This unit works fine with no extra case, though there are still options. The composite case comes in one of several popular color options, including the silver, blue, green and purple. And of course, the unit's durability is great, probably because of the simple design.   Apple chose to use a proprietary headphone jack for syncing, which most competing players accomplish with a standard USB B port.  Overall, still a great design.  Durability   Apple deserves points for the more durable player in this group. Even with the composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse. Creative's failure rates are too high, but Sandisk's Clip is gaining ground in this area.  Capacity  The 1GB size for the shuffle was the only option from Apple for a long time.  The market has been flooded with 2GB players from the competition.  In addition to lowering the price in February 2008, Apple finally added a 2GB option available now at Apple stores. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012LWG9O/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">Apple iPod shuffle 2 GB Silver (2nd Generation)</a>  Still, as Apple finally ups their size, Sansa now has their Clip in a 4GB size.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00126V8WU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa Clip 4 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a>  Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB MP3 Player <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa c150 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IM9542/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W09ZTK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Features and Software  Competing players over simple screens for track viewing as well as FM radio and voice recording.  The Zen Stone Plus by Creative and the Sandisk Clip each offer all three features at better price points. Apple's reliability and brand loyalty has allowed the shuffle to survive with limited features.  Competing players also offer drag and drop syncing using standard USB cables or, in the case of the Sansa Express, via direct USB.  Apple still requires the proprietary dock.  For a 1GB MP3 player it seems excessive to have to use iTunes software to sync your software.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  iTunes is both a curse and a blessing, depending on your point of view.  For those who are used to iTunes or totally new to MP3s, the interface can be a great plus.  For anybody who want more direct control over their music collection, some of the features within iTunes can become burdensome.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, or if you are totally new to MP3s the software will still be a net plus for you.   For those that care about file options, Apple's software allows only MP3 and AAC. You can easily convert other formats to these, but be aware of the limits.  This is only a negative for those really loyal to a certain file format, such as the growing group of WMA users.  Having to have 2 format copies of all your music can really hurt as your collection grows.  Sound   The sound this unit produces is pretty good though not great. While I still feel the first generation shuffle sounded much better, the tradeoff was worth the smaller size.   Cost   The shuffle's price has finally come down to about $50 for 1GB or $65 for 2GB. While not a bargain, this price makes the sting much less painful for Apple loyalists.  On a dollar per gigabyte and absolute dollar cost, Apple continues to charge a premium for their brand.    1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail, one fifth the lowered cost of the shuffle.  In addition, competing players like the Sansa Clip continue to offer more features at a better prices. If you want a small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, your options continue to expand.  In addition to the Creative Stone and the Sansa Clip, new models from Samsung and Sony have added even more options.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved. This model requires you to pay a premium for it, though a slightly shrinking premium.  :-D  Conclusion  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, choose this or one of the new 2GB shuffles. If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 but gives you 4 times the capacity and video.  Still, if you're not an Apple die-hard, the Sansa Clip and other options deserve consideration.  Research your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Overall this is a good player at an improved price.    Enjoy!!!

<Title>Nice but not compatible with Windows Media Player
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod shuffle is small, plays fairly well and is at a relatively fair price, but if you are comfortable using Windows Media player then this item is a nightmare.  Mac users seem obsessed with attacking anyone if they prefer Windows software but, hey, I like Windows Media player. For me it's just easier to use, faster with way more options than iTunes.  There are many other very good mp3 players out there that work great with Media Player and in the future I will avoid all iPod products. Not to mention once your battery dies then the item is as good as junk.    Just to be clear, I do like the shuffle but I hate iTunes.

<Content>I was given a shuffle from work as an award, I had never wanted one before, but I set it up today and started listening, the sound is absolutely amazing. It may even be better than my 5G 30Gig video. The big con is that you are at the mercy of the ipod as to what songs you listen to, I like having a screen.

I like to listen to music or talk radio while I'm working, but because I'm always on the go, I don't like to carry a radio with me.  I often lose reception; the radio is heavy or in the way;  the batteries die too soon; and the sound quality of small portable radios is lousy.  With the Shuffle being about the size of a postage stamp, having a clip, and weighing next to nothing, I can attach it to my shirt or belt and keep working while I listen to my favorite show or music and the sound quality is awesome.  I can listen to hours worth of podcasts and/or music because not only will that tiny little thing hold so much entertainment, but the rechargeable battery will last up to 12 hours!  A lot longer than I'll be working in the garden.

<Title>3rd Gen Apple iPod Shuffle Fits The Bill For Beginners!
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this iPod shuffle for a young lady of 10.  This player really works well for her.  She doesn't care about selecting specific songs and has no need to sort by artist or genre.  She likes how easy it is to dump songs onto this player, even without the use of iTunes.  The Shuffle is really small and has an integrated clip, so it is easy to transport.  The sound quality is awesome, for such a small device, and it plays for hours and hours on a battery charge.  I think the iPod Shuffle is an item that will only please a certain range of people.  After all, there is no display so you cannot select the songs or artists that you wish to listen to in any given order.  The player does just what the name implies.  It "Shuffles" your music in random order.  You still have the basic controls at your fingertips, including track skip forward and backward, play, pause, and volume up and down.  It also has a handy hold switch so that you don't accidentally turn the player on or change tracks when you don't want to.  I purchased this 3rd gen iPod Shuffle from Amazon for the amazing price of $69.99!  It is now back up around $75, so I feel lucky to have purchased it when I did.  If you are looking for a very small and easy to use MP3 player, which simply shuffles your music and has a high quality look and feel, then look no further than the Apple iPod Shuffle.  It really is an amazing player.  =o)  UPDATE - 1/23/2008: This iPod Shuffle ended up taking a trip through the washing machine and was then subjected to the brutal pouding and scorching heat of a clothes dryer!  Obviously we were just sick about what we had done, and we were sure that this Christmas gift had met an early death.  We allowed the Shuffle to sit out for 4 days, without trying to power it on, in order to make sure that it was completely dry on the inside.  Much to our amazement this 3rd Gen iPod Shuffle powered up and works flawlessly!  It charges, plays all of the onboard music files, and connects to the computer without any problems.  All of the buttons and switches work just fine as well.  We are SO relieved, and can't say enough about the build quality and durability of this product.  We will now be more careful about checking every pocket before laundering our clothes in the future.  Whew...thanks Apple!

<Content>Who knew anything this small could pack such a punch? I looked into ipod when they first came out and thought Ill never use it. Was I wrong! On this tiny iPod Shuffle I can fit 240 of my all time favorite tunes. Its the biggest "mix tape" ever! Now I know why the iPod ads show everyone dancing so uninhibitedly. Its like having music in your head! You cant help but move. I am dancing around my house on a regular basis, something I havent done in years. The sound is amazing. Its easy to use. I clip it on my shirt and my workouts at the gym are better than ever. My fellow exercisers shouldnt be surprised if, one day, I cant contain myself and dance ecstatically around the gym!

<Title>Works Better Than The 1st Generation Shuffles.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was dragging my feet purchasing this product because I was so used to the 1st Generation shuffle that has built in usb.  However, the reason I switched was the 1st generation shuffle continually got corrupted, despite ejecting it.  This was not the case for the 3rd Generation shuffle.  Furthermore, Apple has improved the on/off, shuffle and repeat buttons so they work much better.   As a cyclist and a runner, this iPod is ideal because of its size and weight.  A common complaint is the lack of display, but this is not much of an issue if you are focused on exercising music and not exact songs.    A vast improvement over the former model.

<Title>My favorite tax return purchase of '07!
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this little player for just about a year and it has been good to me. Initially, it was mainly for running and working out in the gym but it has replaced my main iPod with just about everything I do. The size can't be beat and I can bring it anywhere and listen to music discreetly. Originally, this was a 3 star review, because of the crappy included earbuds. However, with some equalizer settings and a good pair of headphones (Sennheiser CX 300 B), this nifty gadget cannot be beat. Functionality wise, the clip was a great idea but they left our some sort of wire organizer. To alleviate that miscue I bought this clear mophie case and now it's perfect! Of course, this product is not for everyone. I think if enjoy just music and like not carrying bulky stuff around, this makes perfect sense for you.

<Content>The name of this products makes certain inferrences- mainly, that thing thing can shuffle songs.  Oops.  It doesn't actually play anything in a RANDOM order.  It just sort of shuffles everything ONCE, then continually loops through that playlist it generated.  This playlist is also extremely poorly shuffled, with songs from the same artist frequently playing one after the other.  How random.  Save your money and buy a real mp3 player, not this thing that can't even do what it is named for.

<Title>An okay iPod
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was my very first iPod that I had gotten last year for a gift. I was very pleased with it for a while, until I ran out of space to put all of my music on. There is no expandable memory for this iPod, and that is not a good thing if you are going to shell out 80 dollars for this product. The size of this iPod could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. I carry a small purse without a lot of stuff in it and I had a hard time finding the thing. The perk to having a smaller iPod is that it doesn't take up a lot of space. One of my other gripes is that there is no screen there to tell you what is playing and how much of the battery you have left. All I have on this is the colors of the flashing little light to give me a rough idea. iTunes is easy enough to use but it can take a long time to load one song onto your iPod. That is why I switched to an iPod classic to give me what I wanted and more.

<Title>There is NO 3rd generation iPod Shuffle, yet
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As of now, Jan-27-2008, there is NO iPod SHUFFLE 3rd generation.  iPod Shuffles are still in the 2nd generation!!!!  The title is totally misleading.  What happens is that on or around September 2007, Apple changed the COLORS of the iPod Shuffle line of products, only that, the COLORS.  Changing colors doesn't do for a new generation.  The iPod itself is exactly the same, outside and inside, still metal, JUST THE SAME.  So, so far, only two generations of iPod Shuffle.  Don't let the title mislead you.  You can obviously tell, based on the color (except the silver one, that remained the same), if the Shuffle is newer or not, but, I repeat, they are the same.  I bought mine in an Apple store, since there is one very near here.  It was a gift for my daughter.  It is a good product but I had a very bad experience to make it work.  To make the long story short, what I needed to do to make it work was to remove ALL my peripherals connected via USB, except the mouse and keyboard, and then finally it worked.  Apple phone customer support was very polite but, actually, it was useless and gave me some wrong information (like a shuffle not being able to carry files besides songs).  The guy from the store, where I also visited to get some help, simply connected it to a computer and since it worked there, he gave me no explanations, or possibilities for why it was not working in my computer, he just handed it back to me saying it was ok.  After googling the subject, I found an article that suggested removing all USB connected equipments from the computer, and finally it did the trick.  This article was NOT from the apple site.  So, summing it up, Apple was no good to help me fix the problem.  That's why I removed one star from the rating.

<Content>I bought the latest Nano based on a Shuffle I'd received as a gift.  But after the Shuffle was lost (easy due to it's size) I had to have another one.  The primary reason is it's small size and the handy clip.  I don't need a pocket or case to hold it- just clip it onto a sleeve.  I have an iMac, so it's especially easy to load music from my CD collection.  I probably use the Shuffle 10-1 over my new Nano.

<Title>Perfect workout companion
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After the arm band for my video ipod chafed a large spot on my arm I finally decided it was time for something a little more manageable to work out with. The Shuffle is the perfect solution. It holds plenty of music to give my walk or run variety and is so small I can clip it just about anywhere on my clothes and forget about it. I even load it with yoga podcasts and bring it with me to my mat. The only downside is that it's so small I get paranoid about losing it.

<Title>Impressive!
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say this little MP3 player is great. I got this as a Christmas gift instead of the pricier iPod Touch. I was definitely skeptical at first, it seemed small and cheap the last time I looked at it in the iPod Store. Truth be told, I was somewhat depressed that I didn't get the Touch. Well, after opening the box (kudos to Apple for making such neat packaging) I was impressed. It's really sturdy- it's got a good solid feel and some weight to it, and it's very portable. The included charging / syncing base it came with is really neat (what with the grippy bottom and nice long cord). Apple really thought this through and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed.    Oh, by the way- if you care about sound or comfort at all I would recommend that you buy some better headphones. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FUESSU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black</a> are great if you listen to a lot of rock.

<Content>Just right for my wife who loves music.  I put 6 to 8 hours of her favorites in, and it was only half full!  The only point against are the earphones that do not fit her ears, or my ears, or my sons ears unless they are twisted sideways Either our ears, or the earphones).  Even then, any sudden head movement will whip them off in another direction.  The white ones are cool...but in this case do not assist or contribute to the quality of the music.  We're going to use an over the ear set.  On the plus side...I can't believe that something so small can carry so much quality sounding music.

<Content>I've had a 2nd generation iPod shuffle for almost a year and love mine. When Apple came out with the new purple color as part of its 3rd generation, I knew it was time to get one for my wife. She had been using one of the older 1st generation iPod shuffles as her workout mp3 player. I gave this to her for Christmas and she loves it! Not only does she listen to it when we're working out, she takes it with her on trips as well.  The 3rd generation iPod shuffle is a very cool, go-anywhere gadget that is extremely easy to operate. I highly recommend one!!!

<Content>When Christmas arrived and I had wanted to buy something for my wife, I heard her saying that her old MP3 was too bulky and what did I think of iPods? When I first took a look at the iPod line I saw the cute little Shuffle model. It was smaller than a book of matches, plus was cute as could be in various colors! The Shuffle holds 240 songs or 1GB and you can easily make up different playlists if you over fill it or want to change genres.  Light as a feather, cute and inexpensive....what's not to like?

I find myself continually fascinated by the mixture of sounds. If you don't like that mix, just plug it in and the computer will find a new one for you.  Who needs the video when you have a little wonder like this?

<Title>Very pleased!
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased an iPod shuffle for both my girlfriend (22) and son (7) this Christmas and both are loving it!  It's simple enough that a 7 year old can use it without any problems (he still comes to me to move songs onto it, but he already knows how to plug in the USB and charge his iPod when it dies).  My girlfriend is fairly computer illiterate and has been able to easily figure out how to copy her CDs into iTunes and put them on her iPod as well.  Also REALLY like that it has a volume limit that's able to be set through iTunes and password-protected (for when my son's a little older).  That way, he doesn't blow out his eardrums at 7 years old and when he's a little older and able to work his way around iTunes, it's password-protected so that only I can update the maximum volume allowed.  I was very pleased that this version of the shuffle has a metal casing which makes it seem much more substantial than previous models of the Shuffle that I've owned (all plastic).  This way, I'm not worried about my son breaking it at all, just losing it because it's so tiny! :D

<Title>THE UNTENDED UNDERLING IN THE iPOD FAMILY
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to buy a no-nonsense mp3 player to keep me company while running. No video, no funky display menus, no labyrinthine software to work with. If I wanted to spend half a day getting my music in order I'd shell for the 80 gig iPod.   So I got myself a Shuffle, by far the sleekest small pod in the market.   But boy did I regret it.   After the one-time registration and initialization (which is not optional) the lemon wouldn't get the songs on it, thanks to the infamous "Disk not found error". Googled for it and discovered websites that are brimming with untended complaints; I'm on Windows XP, but the glitch seems to pervade operating systems.   Spent a day battling with the idiosyncrasies. Downloaded and installed an extra utility that Apple's Help site recommends. Enabled the Shuffle "for disk use". Reset it to factory settings and tried all over again, five times. And I'm a fairly persistent tech-savvy one. I did everything that's needed and more, but the stupid thing will still not remember the settings, will not let me change songs, and so on.    Tired with all of this rigmarole, I got a Creative Zen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S5TYQI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">Stone Plus</a>. It's a little larger than the Shuffle, but you can see why--Shuffle doesn't have a display and it uses the same jack for charging and earphones so you can only do one of those at a time. Stone Plus on the other hand connects through a small non-spaghetti USB cable, comes up instantly as a new drive on your PC, you copy the mp3 files from your music folder to this drive, and you're done.   I was up and running in 5 minutes flat. Can't help kicking myself for having fallen for the iPod luster.   Without becoming any clunkier in any meaningful way (both the doohickeys are pretty small), Stone Plus shows me the song that's playing, which I don't see on Shuffle. Stone Plus has an FM radio, a voice recorder, a timer, and a digital clock--none of which the Shuffle has. It charges in 5 minutes, which the Shuffle doesn't. I can use iTunes or any other tool or even nothing at all, but with Shuffle I am in an unhappy marriage with iTunes. The Stone Plus will hold about 1000 songs in comparison to Shuffle's 200 at the same bit-rate.   Because this is Creative, the company known among geeks for its speakers, the ear phones that come with the Stone Plus have a fabulous combination of bass and treble that will please the most fastidious connoisseur. After hearing them Shuffle's white thingies sound tinny and childish. I got my Stone Plus with a clip that makes it much more practical for running.   And all of it at 60% of the cost of a basic bare-bones Shuffle.   Sorry, Apple folks, in the small-mp3-player market Apple is simply the beautiful blond bimbo who trips on high heels at ten paces. If you're in the market for a nifty little mp3 player, skip the Shuffle. Even in the 3rd generation it's a 3rd rate contender.

<Title>Excellent addition for flash drive MP3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this shuffle as an alternate to my 80G Video iPod, which I also love.  As a runner, I loathe using my 80G because its a hard disk (so it can skip) and I'm terrified I'm going to drop and break it.  Enter the shuffle.  I've previously been using a 1G iRiver (a player suggested by Runners World), but find it bulky and slightly uncomfortable.  While its triangular shape made it great to hold in my hand, using the sports arm band or neck cord make it bounce and the weight was uncomfortable.   NOT a problem with the shuffle.  Its lightweight, clips almost anywhere (I prefer my waistband or pocket), and I forget I even have it on.  I don't think that the docking station (which comes with the shuffle), nor the use of iTunes, diminishes the desirability of the shuffle.   On the contrary, I rather quite like the dock.  I leave it attached to my computer, and its a convenient place to leave  my shuffle when I'm not using it.  I don't lose it, and keep it charged.  Beyond having a convenient place to leave my shuffle, I like the fact that its rechargeable rather than requiring a battery.  Part of the bulky weight of the iRiver was the added weight due to the AA battery, and I've had a Samsung Yepp (c.1998) that used AAA.  [I'm otherwise not comparing the shuffle to the yepp, merely due to the fact the yepp was purchased almost 10 years ago.]  Overall, I find charging more desirable than needing AA or AAA batteries.    As for iTunes, once you take the initial time to install it and load your music, its just as convenient for drag and drop as a thumb drive is.  That is, of course, assuming that you're not using multiple computers to add music.  I don't, so that's not a problem.  As far as proprietary software goes, iTunes is user friendly and has caused me little problems.  I always had frustrating moments with the iRiver software, which I've never had with iTunes.    If the price point is your main concern, I would recommend purchasing a refurbished shuffle over another player. (Currently, you can find refurbs anywhere between $50 and $65.)  If your primary use for the player is excerise, you don't really need more than 1G.  It holds roughly 240 songs.  I only have 80 songs loaded, which is more than enough for variety in my work outs.  As a 10 year MP3 player user, I resisted the iPod until last year.  I'm glad I made the switch- they're reliable, intuitive, and easy to use.

<Title>Expensive for what it is.
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I won my iPod shuffle, so I didn't have to pay $75 for it. After playing with it for a few hours, I could not imagine paying $75 for it. It has virtually no features, and only holds 1GB of music. For the same price, you can get a full featured MP3 player that holds 2 to 4 times as much music. With that being said, what the Shuffle can do, it does fairly well. It's also very tiny, so that might be a plus to some. I give it 4 stars for not costing me anything, and working well. If price factored into a rating, I'd give it no more than 2.5 stars.

<Content>I love my shuffle.  I use it for playing podcasts and audiobooks, rather than music, and for this it is perfect.  My Dad also enjoys podcasts and audiobooks, so I bought one for him for his birthday...since he lives a thousand miles away, I bought it through Amazon.  Big mistake there.  Oh, the box got to him on time...but the box was empty except for bubble wrap and an invoice.  I guess someone in shipping wanted an iPod.  When I called about this, they did replace the iPod, but would not expedite the shipping so my Dad could get it in time for his Birthday...they did literally the least they could do without legal liability.  So much for customer service.  So, my lesson is learned.  I've been buying gifts for far flung friends and family through Amazon for years.  Never again.

<Content>I picked the Shuffle for my wife because she wanted an simple music player, had no interest in pictures or videos, and needed a device that was easy to sync with straightforward software. I have experience with several MP3 players used on Windows platforms, and I knew she would be frustrated with the downloading issues. The Shuffle works perfectly. It is easy to sync with iTunes, it is very compact and can be clipped to a T-shirt, it holds plenty of music for her purposes, and the sound quality is great. If you want just music, a compact device, and simple operations, the Shuffle is for you.

<Title>Amazing device for the money!
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This IPOD 3rd Generation player is all I could ask for.  I decided to purchase this simply for excercising and I could not be any happier.  In fact, I purchased an extra for my wife.  Folks, of course there will be critics out there who wish this could be cheaper in price and capable of expanding more to like a 2 GB and offer more features, but take it for what its worth.  This IPOD is not for anyone, especially those who seek all the tech features such as videos and pictures, but that is why Apple created other players.  With shuffle you simply load it up with over 200 songs and you listen.  You play and don't worry about anything but the volume.  By no means I don't exclude any other ipods like the Nano because those other players are awesome, but I suggest to find the best one to suit you.   I just purchased the auxilary cable and plugged the shuffle to my car stereo and it works GREAT !!

<Content>What can I say, this small but mighty music player is incredible for its size and ease of use ie. on and off button, the simple charging dock station and it doubles as a hard drive to transfer files or... Apple Rock's!!!!

<Title>iPod shuffle ROCKS!!!
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got my iPod about a year ago for Christmas. I opened the box, and saw a little silver thing with a round white circle, and white earbuds. It took a while, but my dad finally found out how to put songs on it. Then, the journey began. This holds 200 songs. (I only have 15 at the time) This iPod has really been quite awesome. It is fun to listen to, and occasionally, I stay up till 11 'o clock listening to it. I didn't buy my iPod here, but it was $200, and I got my name on it for FREE. Please try this. It is really cool, and I think it's smallness is cute. The clip on the back is really nice too. LONG LIVE MY IPOD SHUFFLE!

<Content>We are still testing out the shuffle. Amazon was quick to ship and as usual, had an excellent price. If it's anything like our G1 shuffle, I'm sure it'll be great. Very compact and has a strong clip. The clip is strong enough that we returned the armband we purchased.

<Content>The Shuffle is my fourth MP3 player, but my first experience with Apple. It's awesome. It plays for hours, it's light, and the library is easy to manage. I recommend it.

<Title>First time I pod user at 60
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased an Apple 1 GB iPod shuffle (Purple) (3rd Generation)  recently for myself. It is the first time I have used any Ipod. I am 60 years old, and sum-what technically challenged I thought. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use and how perfect it is for taking anywhere with me. It is so small, that there is no weight issue with clipping it to any clothing and the sound is amazing.  I'm truly happy with this purchase for myself.

<Content>I have had mine for almost a year now and cannot tell you how happy I am with it!  I use it at the gym everyday and have to plug it in to charge maybe every other week.  Now that I have one and know how good it works I would pay more then the $79 for it.

<Content>I adore my shuffle, 3d generation. It is always with me at the gym, or when I do housework. But the most amazing thing about it is that after I accidentally put it in the washer and dryer, it still worked!

<Content>I just LOVE my new shuffle.  Easy to use, convenient to carry (especially on the morning walk) - the only problem is remembering to place it back on its docking station so I don't misplace it.  If you're thinking about buying a starter iPod, this would be perfect.

<Title>I Adore It As Well...
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software is a little cumbersome, though; not streamlined enough. All in all, perfect mp3 player. Clips easily to your person, doesn't skip and boasts great fidelity. Inconspicuous jams! It's also ergonomic enough to where you don't have to look at it to use it. This should be the only flash-based mp3 player you need.
