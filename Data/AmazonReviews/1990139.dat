<Title>iAudio 7 16GB

<Content>Very happy with the interface. Some may find it hard to get used to because the controls are very sensitive but I like the quick response. Audio quality is excellent. The one problem with the iAudio is the total lack of playlists. Very, very hard to work around. Cowon's 'folder' solution is no serious competition for the iPod and other players that incorporate playlists. I'm no fan of iTunes but I do love the way a desktop app like winamp - so simple to use - can manage my iPod playlists and virtually all of my music.

<Title>If sound quality is your prime concern, then this one's 4 U!
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used several iAudio products in the past and I believe they are superior to most other MP3 players on the market. The I7 feels especially solidly built. I have to agree with the previous reviewer that the interface may not be as intuitive as e.g. the iPod's, but once you've gotten used to it you'll be happy you did get used to it since everything else about this player will leave the competition in the dust! Sound quality is exquisite! Especially if you pair this player with an aftermarket earphone like the 'Ultimate Ears Triple.fi 10 Pro'. Yeah, right! you say.. This unit is even costlier than the player itself, but if you manage to make some sacrifices to come up with the dough to pair these units together you'll be so greatly rewarded that you will thank yourself a long time for making them! The unit supports several compression standards like FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) which should be used to compress your CD collection if you wish to experience the player's full potential. The radio reception is, like for most units like this, nothing to write home about - you need to be in close range of your preferred FM station's antenna to receive an acceptable signal for the unit's FM receiver. To sum my review up - if it's sound quality you're shopping for and not an excessively promoted to-brag-about brand - look nowhere else!

<Title>The best sound around!!!!
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You can not do any better in terms of sound (Thats why we buy these things, right!) The ease of use can not be touched by anything else and of course it is drag-and-drop so you do not depend on i-tunes, Windows Media Player etc.. I also want to mention the 5 band EQ and the sound inhance features because with them the sound gets even better. The only room for improvement I will mention is the over-sensitivity of the controls on the front of the player. This is true on my A6 and the two A7's I own. However, if you want the best sound around take a listen! I do not think you will be disappointed.

<Title>Sounds pretty good for a portable!
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product based on all the rave reviews about the sound quality all over the web (since you can't just go down to your local Best Buy and listen to one - they're only available over the internet, and I think in brick-and-mortar stores in LA and NYC). Everyone talks about how the iAudio7 sounds great, wonderful, "audiophile quality sound", etc., etc.   Let me preface this by saying that I am an audiophile - I love listening to music and I am extremely particular about the way my music sounds. I love listening to CDs through my Grado headphones at home.  I didn't think the iAudio7 lived up to all the hype the first few days I used it - thus the two stars in my rating. In fact, I thought it sounded terrible and couldn't understand how anyone could think it sounded good.  Turns out, the headphone jack is a little weird - sort of. I've plugged into this thing numerous times over the past few days and the headphone plug never went all the way into the headphone jack. I always pushed it in until I felt significant resistance, then stopped pushing for fear of breaking it (I can be the proverbial bull in china shop sometimes - "careful" is not one of strong traits). I thought it odd that that headphone plug never went fully into the jack on the player, but thought it was just a bad design. Well, today, I vowed to listen to it one more time before sending it back for a refund, and accidently pushed the headphone plug all the way into the jack. What a difference that made in sound!  Now I would say the Cowon sounds very good. I won't make any claims that it has "audiophile-quality" sound - that's a stretch, but I actually think it sounds pretty good using the "Normal" EQ setting (i.e., set flat). I'm listening to files in FLAC format (lossless compression) and they sound very nice. This will be plenty good for work and travel. I still like my home system better, but it cost a lot more than the iAudio7.  One thing they don't tell you before buying it is that it only holds 4,000 files or 2,000 folders. This is true of both the 8GB and 16GB models. If you're using FLAC format for your music files, you won't have to worry about this. At about 4MB/minute of playing time, a 3 minute FLAC-format recording will use up 12MB of memory in the player. But if for some reason you had, say, 4000 files that were 2MB each, that would use up only 8GB of the 16GB of available memory and even though you would still have 8GB of free memory on your player, you won't be able to use it because you hit the 4000 file limit. I don't know likely it is that anyone will run into these limits, but it is possible.  The other thing that still bugs me is the user-interface. The first couple of days it drove me batty and I wanted to throw the thing across the room - I could not get it to do anything that I wanted it to do and it made me so angry. I consulted the documentation provided on the CD, but it wasn't very helpful. The user-interface is touch sensitive, and when I say "sensitive", I'm not kidding! It is extremely touch sensitive; it's easy to accidently brush against some control on the screen and have it do something unwanted. Until you get used to it, it may drive you nuts.  I would now give the iAudio7 a four star rating, but I can't edit the number of stars in my review for some reason so it will still show two stars when I would really give it four stars.

<Title>In response to the review on Jan. 4, 2008
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This definitely isn't true audiophile quality, it probably is thought to be for various reasons.  I think most people refer to the sound as being audiophile-like, because everything out there for a portable flash/hd based player sounds like a$$ "for the most part" (this being much better than competing Creative, Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Sandisk products available).  But mostly, people do not understand (how high the ceiling goes) or live in that audiophile realm ($1500-$100,000+ receivers, speakers and such).  I have owned 2 prior iRiver models and 2 other iAudio's (I have also used other peoples Ipods, Nanos, Creative, Samsung and Sandisk products for trial over the last 5 years). This model is definitely an improvement in sound quality over the previous Cowon U3 4gb I owned.  And closer to, if not surpassing the quality of my 895 iRiver and the 512mb model before that.  I own some HD580 and HD600 Sennheiser's and they sound listenable, but there is definitely a lack of punch, depth to the soundstage, but thats ok, because thats about as good as it gets for now with portables and I personally need something for the gym.  It's a great player once you get used to the sensitivity controls and menus, which is expected.  I definitely wish Cowon would add true playlist support, so people can create multiple playlists at home on their pc and store them in a player folder for playback later on the portable. The iAudio 7 8gb is probably the best model currently as it doesn't seem to suffer from the transfer speed problems of the 16gb model, and surpassing 4,000 files would be quite hard with 8gb.  As long you are willing to swap files around occasionally (if opting away from the 16gb model), it's a better value until Cowon irons out some kinks and players get even bigger.  (Amazon wouldn't let me post my response comment due to some guideline I couldn't figure out, so I am just posting my comment as a review, enjoy)

<Title>Should be a Bestseller!
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just about everything in the specs are pros.  It plays a large array of file types, has linux compatibility, sounds great, awesome battery life, is small but not too small and the package was easy to open (not in that hard, sealed plastic).  I couldn't be more pleased with this music player.   It can show video and pictures (as well as other features I will not personally use) but I wouldn't watch video from the screen nor would I save pictures to it to show to friends.   Overall, I don't know why anyone looking for a flash based music player would go with anything else

<Title>The best portable digital audio player on the market!
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm in love with this little device. I wish it had more than 16GB of memory, but for a flash player it's about the best you can get right now, and your really can't beat its price for it either. A 16GB flash based iPod or any of the other mainstream players will cost you at least $100 more and won't be nearly as nice either... This little guy does everything I wanted it to. When I was shopping for a PMP/DAP I was primarily concerned with finding an "mp3 player" that could play Ogg Vorbis as well... not only does it do that, but it plays FLAC too! It does allow you to watch (minuscule) videos, look at pictures and read plain text files...but those are all bonus, and not really the main focus of the product. The little OLED screen on it is pretty nice, and I don't mind it being tiny since I just want to listen to music 99.9% of the time anyway. As an Ubuntu user, it was very important that it be fully Linux compatible, and it works just fine. There is some sort of software that comes with it, but it's Windows only. Once again, I'm fine with that as it mounts up just like any other flash drive.  It seems to have a really nice battery life so far (built-in lithium ion), but I am concerned about what will happen 2 or 3 years from now if it gets warn out and I need to replace it or something. I also find the scroll bar to be a little too sensitive, even set to the lowest sensitivity setting. Also do beware that the manual that comes with this thing is practically worthless. There's a .txt file preloaded on it that tells you a little more about some of it's features...but it's been pretty much trial and error for me figuring out all of its intricacies.   Besides those few minor gripes, this thing is awesome! I'm so glad I bought it :)

<Title>LOW speed of usb data transfer
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am disappointed. This device has awfully slow usb data transfer. When I upload files into it I have only 600Kb/sec - 1.1Mb/sec, 800Kb/sec in avg. When I download files from the device it gives ~1.5-1.7Mb/sec. So what is said in tech specs - "File Transfer Speed Max. 40Mbps (Upload Max. 40Mbps)" - is a LIE. Do not buy this device if you get used to players with fast usb transfer (such as cowon d2) - you defenetly will be disappointed.  On the same usb port of my computer cowon d2 gives me 3-4Mb/sec of upload.

<Title>Fantastic player - one quirk
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ALMOST found the perfect mp3 player for me.  I listen to audiobooks and sometimes music, I have pictures, a few movies, and some txt files, too.  I have my books and music organized into folders and this is just like a jump drive.  I can plug it into ANY computer without any software preloaded and just drop and drag.  My audiobooks play in perfect order and they sound great.  It has a delete right on the unit, so I can delete as I go.  Its 16 gbs so I can carry a lot of music and books and listen to what I want when I want.  I have approximately 700 songs and 200 books, along with a handful of pictures loaded at the present moment.  I love running and since this is a flash player, I don't have to worry about messing up a hard drive based player.  The unit is tiny - smaller than my cell phone.  It will record, play movies, FM radio, view text files and all that if that is what interest you.  My only problem is the slide selector.  Even at the least sensitive setting, it is HORRIBLE.  I am hoping I will get used to it with time, because I would even read some txt ebooks on here if I could get used to the control.  Instead, I keep going back and forth trying to pinpoint the exact spot I want to be. I have almost 6000 files on my player, but they are all in folders and the player recognizes them all.  I was concerned when I read an earlier review, but it must mean if they are all lumped onto the player.  If it wasn't for the selector, this unit would be the perfect player.

<Title>Avoid this player and avoid headaches
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Recently I was in the market for a new mp3 player as my second generation 10gb iPod was showing its age.  After an exhaustive search I narrowed it down to another iPod, particularly the 8gb nano and the I Audio I7 16gb player.  After reading several reviews on both players I noticed that there was a type of zealot praise regarding the I Audio players which I have only seen with Apple based products.  My decision came down to looks, I just thought that the I Audio player looked sleeker than the newer nano.  I regret my purchase. First the pros.  The battery life is nothing less than incredible.  The company states 60 hours of use per charge and I would have to agree with them.  I haven't timed it, but I also haven't charged it in days.  The visual design of the player is both sleek and durable.  It is slightly bulky compared to other players but just as light.  It has a crisp 1.8 inch screen that can be used to watch movies, and it allows a ton of formats.  Everything else it does it does poorly, at best.   The navigation, both the physical location of the buttons, and their ability to navigate through the player are troublesome.  The location of the buttons and their sensitivity cause a major problem even when the sensitivity is turned down.  You have to use a combo of the buttons on top of the player as well as the buttons on the face in order to navigate your files.  This makes it nearly impossible to use one handed, especially while in motion (walking, working out, etc).  There are also different browse modes,  which seem to change the way you use the buttons as well. But I have noticed that if you have a large amount of music on your player, choose the file browse.  If you don't, the more files on your player, the longer it will take to boot.  In file browse mode it wasn't affected as noticeably.   There are NO PLAYLISTS.  What it uses is a DPL or dynamic playlist that can only be created with the player itself and can only be used in the File Browse mode.  You select your songs in the order in which you want them on the DPL and then add them.  You cannot move them around once they are in the list, only remove them. Linux support is a gross mis-representation of the truth.  Yes it will play .ogg contained files and it mounts like an external drive.  THAT IS THE EXTENT of its compatibility.  The player isn't even recognized in Rhythmbox or Amarok.  The only way to transfer files is through copy and paste from your music folder to the player. Further the jet audio software WILL NOT WORK IN LINUX.  This includes trying to run it under wine.  This doesn't sound like a big problem, until you try and use the players video features. THERE IS NO SUPPORTED VIDEO PLAYBACK FOR LINUX.  In order to play videos on the player they must be encoded using the jet audio software.  The I Audio releases the formats, bit rates etc, on what will playback in terms of video, but it also states that you must encode using the jet audio software, as nothing else will work.  So far that claim is true, as I have tried to use ffmpeg and handbrake to encode video.  So far I have tried many different variations of what they say it should support and nothing.  It seems they are tagged or something that only works when files are encoded with their software, which again does not work with linux. Finally, their support is horrible.  It is via chat room.  Do I need to say more, because I can.  On page 25 of the included manual it states that a 16gb player cannot hold more than 200 folders and/or 2000 songs.  I addressed this issue with customer support and they didn't have a clue about what I was talking about.  Further they said that that was a lot of songs to have. I said well its a 16gb player what is the point of having a player that big only to hold 2000 songs.  They responded that it could also play movies.  But as it turns out not if Linux is your OS.  Avoid this player to avoid headaches.
