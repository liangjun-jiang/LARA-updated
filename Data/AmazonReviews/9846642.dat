<Title>DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME  (with a MAC)
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item less than a week ago from a local retail chain.  It did not occur to me until after I got it home that my MAC would not work with it.  My husband told me that there was no way that it would work properly if at all with our computer.  So, luckily he felt sorry for me and took it back to the store:)  To my suprise and delight, he returned home with an iPod.  I am so much happier with this one.  Besides, next to the iPod, the Zen looks too much like a toy for my five year old daughter.  So, if you have a Mac or a really mean husband, don't get the Zen.

<Content>I bought this for my wife. Wanted something that looked cute!!! It is compact. The headphones provided with it are not that good. But otherwise the  sound quality is pretty good.   It is easy to sync and use. No need to install any creative software if you only want to sync music and pictures. You need the software for videos.

<Title>Better than IPod
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this thing.  Not only does it have the capablity to hold up to 1,000 songs (depending of file size), but the video quality is oustanding!  You don't have to subscribe to anything like Itunes and it is easy to download your own songs.  The screen is beautiful and the size is great for travel. I love my Zen and I have converted some IPod users.   I'm getting one for each of my parents as well!  This is a great all in one little device.

<Title>Pretty in Pink
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the third Creative Zen V Plus I've purchased. All have been great. My wife lost her black Zen V plus, so we bought the pink one thinking it might be easier to spot if it falls under the sofa. The pink only holds 2-GB, but we use them mostly for podcasts and books on tape, so that's plenty. No problems with any of them (except the 4-GB is black and hard to find if you lose it:-)

<Title>convinient
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item is very convinient for someone who just wants basic music.  It says that it can hold up to 1000 songs which is not true because mine is barely at 300 and it's almost full.  They also tell you it comes with 2GB of space, but that again is not true because it only comes with 1.8GB...you may say that it's only a difference of .2GB but that little bit of space really matters when you are running low on memory.  All in all the Zen V 5 plus is a good thing to have...It's small so it fits almost everywhere and it's very easy to use.    If you are looking for something to just put a few songs on then this may be the music player for u.

<Content>I have really enjoyed my Creative Zen since I've had it.  The only complaint I would have is that sometimes it will just stop playing for no reason.  Hitting the play button will fix it so I dont know why it cuts out sometimes.  Other than that I've had no other problems!  The software is also super simple to use.

<Content>Very user friendly.  Only thing is I had to figure out things like how to delete something from the device without hooking it up to the computer to clear it.  Instruction manual is not very detailed, just gives the basic stuff and omits technical info.  But for us 30-somthings, I have found it's great for just listening to what I want to hear and nothing too fancy.

<Title>Display has quit working after three months.
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice player, but this one and a black Zen V Plus 2GB Black/Green BOTH have a dead screen after three months. I would send them for replacement but when I contact Creative about the warranty I got this......   RMA Fees & Details      * According to the data you provided, your Creative product is beyond the standard labor warranty but within the 12 month hardware (parts) warranty.     * The diagnostic and handling fee for products returned outside the labor warranty is US$25.00. To continue the on-line RMA process, you will need to pay the $25.00 fee using your credit or debit card through our secure shopping cart during this on-line process.    So I have to pay one third of the product price to get it replaced through factory warranty, I don't think so.

<Title>Not Ready for Prime Time!
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Update:   The player freezes with no sound and with the screen on (displaying album artwork), at random times and for no apparent reason. One of my two units had to be reset so many times that it can no longer be reset: it feels like that internal pad you press on with a sharp pin has now disappeared (it must have broken off). Our only recourse now is to wait 3 days for the battery to run dead, and hope that it will be reset simply by recharging it from scratch. We've only had this unit since August (it's now December), so I no longer feel the reliability level of this product is sufficient to justify its purchase. Buy something else that doesn't have to be reset all the time!    I bought the 2 GB model because the 4 GB version wasn't available yet and it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs.   Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.   I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.   At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.   The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.   This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.   Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.   The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.   The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.   I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.   The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.   Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called "firmware") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.   Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.   It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the "safe disconnect" icon is often times not even in the system tray.   If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk ("ripping the songs"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.   You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or "podcasts" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.   Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.

<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Same experience as the previous reviewer. I read the review and hoped it wouldn't be a big deal. Unfortunately, it is a big deal. Having to reset the unit multiple times during useage is a nightmare. We are returning and going in a different direction. Aesthetically, nice unit, but the "reset" issue using a pushpin because nothing larger will fit in the hole is too much for me to overcome.

<Title>Wow!  How did they do it?!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was shocked at how small this MP3 player was when I openened the box.  I feared that it was TOO small to do everything it is touted to do, but I was wrong.  In addition, I feared that 2GB was not enough memory for my wife (as compared to my 30GB Zen).  I was wrong again.  The memory is sufficient for my wife to have all the songs she wants on it together with family photos to look at.  Downloading songs was a snap using either the Zen software or using MediaMonkey (I used the latter since I was converting FLAC files to MP3).  Even my wife was able to download her own songs without my help.  The controls are easy to use and the ZEN feels very sturdy and robust.  The battery life has been very good as well.  I highly recommend buying a wall plug recharger rather than relying on the USB recharger which can take hours.

<Title>A great gift item
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this for my girlfriend who did not previously have any portable music device.  It was a Christmas present and we both live in the city, so she does lots and lots of walking.  Anyway, she loves that the player is pink, small, and has a decent capacity (she actually says that it's more than enough).  The player is a very good player, and comes with a lanyard, sack, and headphones, but I recommend buying different headphones (they're not very comfortable).  One feature that my girlfriend loves, is the ability to switch the player to landscape.  It seems insignificant, but she loves playing around with the orientation.  The software was a bit of a pain because my computer froze while installing it, then after restarting, the software took an extreme amount of time to install fully.  The software is relatively easy to use and is not hard to navigate.  Overall, this product is excellent.  The software seems to be mildly buggy, and I have had problems with my Creative Zen Touch (40Gb) in the past (although I was able to fix it with help from Creative e-mail support).  As of now, with the product being about month old, I'd give it an A overall.

<Content>Bought this as a gift for my ten year old daughter.  She loves it.  It has a lot of nice features that the IPODs in the same price range do not have.  2GB of memory seems to be plenty for my daughter.  She loves being able to load pictures, and use the radio.  Software is very easy to use. My ten year old is organizing playlists, downloading music, and ripping CDs.  No problems mechanically.  I highly recommend it.

It holds about 300 songs with a couple video clips and photos on it. And the color is cute too. If you travel alot, I recommend getting a wall ac adapter, if you are away from your computer. All in all, it's a very nice product and for the price, I recommend getting it! It's a great investment.
