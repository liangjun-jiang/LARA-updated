<Title>Great product and ... misleading Amazon advertising : there is NO FM on this product
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a good MP3 device, great sound, easy to use. The only thing that was disappointing about it was the fact that although the product is advertised above as having an FM receiver in fact it does not (apparently the Creative Zen Nano Plus has a FM receiver.)

<Title>Incredibly small and light
<Date>Wed Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The only downside is having to use a USB cord to copy files from my PC.  I own a muvo and you can just plug it in direct without a cord.  Apart from that minor issue, it's a great little player.

<Title>Great Value for Money
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Creative Zen Nano 1 GB MP3 player is an excellent player compared to others available in the market today. I have used Sony, Samsung but I find the performance and quality amazing. It is just above par compared to the branded products. It is very easy to use and no hassles of recharrging batteries. Just one AAA and that's it, you are on the go...I recommend to everyone. With the memory chip prices coming down it will be soon available for [...] To me it was great buy for [...] I give 5 star rating...

<Title>Good unit - but not what I ordered
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zen Nano is a nice unit - good sound, very small size. The navigation with small buttons and a multi-function thumb wheel is tricky, but works with practice. The 1 gig size carries plenty of music for a workout player so that you do not get back to the same songs very often on random mode. Good headphones included.    Unfortunately when I ordered this, it was advertised to be a Nano-Plus unit, which has an FM radio included.  The one I received does not have a radio.....and is not a Plus.

<Content>The mp3 player is great, but I was dissapointed when I received it. The description of the player read, that it was, a FM and voice recorder and what I received was only a voice recorder. I gave it to my wife to use it to download music. As for the FM recorder that I need , I will get it in person at the local electronic store.

<Title>Great Deal on Zen
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great buy for the price! Zen 1Gig has a great user interface for music and if you have a Windows Media player 10.0 or newer it syncs up very easy. Sound is better than my iPod clarity and bass response.

<Title>Amazon review
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now that I have the mp3 player, I am satisfied with it, but I am not satisfied with Amazon; the reason being that the unit I bought from Amazon, according to the info on their site, also included an FM tuner, and what was sent to me, did not. Rather than go thru a hassle, I opted to keep the unit, but I doubt that I will deal with Amazon again.

<Title>Great player for the money
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great mp3 player for the money.  I have purchased creative mp3 players before and continue to be impressed. I suggest transferring songs to the mp3 player through windows explorer and not the software that is given through creative.  You can just copy and past songs like using a dongle(travel drive).

<Title>No subscription service support
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great little player. It sounds really great with the included earbuds, yes they are a little uncomfortable and hard to keep in.  The biggest disapointment to me was that the zen nano does not support subscription services which means you must buy every track you put on it. Maybe it is just me but this whole play for sure thing is confusing that there are two different play for sures. One that allows you to download tracks that you pay for to your player and one that allows to use subscription services like urge to go to download tracks.  Make sure you are getting what you want. Also be aware no FM tuner.  This is the only time that I feel that Amazon could have been clearer on their discription.

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great mp3 player for its cost. It has good sound quality and almost nothing serious thats bad about it. The mp3 player I would actualy say is to small, if it where bigger it would be more durable and herder to lose. I wouldn't have droped it as many times if it was bigger,so far I've droped it five times on hard tile floor and it hasn't broken so it realy durable. I made a list of pros and cons. Pros -Great price -Long battery (13+ hours) -Great sound quality sound quaility -Nice microphone/recording feature -It comes with a great converter that can convert your songs to 64 kbps .WMA files making the average song half the size. -Fast transfer rate -Extreamly small *not sure if thats a pro or a con* (even smalller then the size description made it sound) Cons -The screen is small and not real high quality but that dosen't effect the music -I've looked hard to find a case for my mp3 and they don't seem to sell them and I drop this mp3 a lot. -The free head phones are average for free head phones (not very good) -It took me awhile to find how to transfer songs the correct and not extreamly slow way but, they transfered very fast once I found how to do it with there software. And by the way as all the other reviews say there is no FM tuner So yes this mp3 player is great and I would recomend it. 4/5 stars.

<Title>Good but...
<Date>Sat Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The screen is very small. But overall it was good for its price. Although I ordered a Zen Nano Plus, but Amazon sent me a NANO instead!!! which does not have a radio. Today I saw the iriver video player which was cool! it was really small and easy to use. I recommend that one instead.
