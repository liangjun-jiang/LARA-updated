<Title>Dont See What The Problem Is
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think people are just too hard on the reviews.    If you ask me, I think this is a GREAT deal. It's small, light weight, has a lcd screen, scrolling capabilities, and the sound is GREAT.   People are just stupid when it comes to writing crap. I got mine from wal-mart.  I think it's a GREAT deal.  Now, i'm sure there is much better ones out there.. but for the price this will do me just fine.    I haven't had a problem with it, and the transferring speeds DO NOT take a minute.  I loaded 300 songs in less than 10 minutes.  how fast do you want it? honestly?  The storage capacity is great too, i think they are stretching the 1000 songs u can put on, but even still you can put over 700 on it easily. and you dont need more. If you are looking for that, then u may as well get a ipod as they are made for storage.  It tells you ON THE BOX to use windows media player to sync your songs.. that is what i used and i didn't have a single problem minus one or two songs couldn't convert. but i EASILY fixed that by downloading it again.    The battery life lasts for about 5-6 hours, depending on what your features you have turned on.  for example... if you have the LCD screen on all the time then obviously it is going to drain the battery faster. they say it could last 10 hours, i dont see that, but maybe, if you have the sound turned low, no lcd.. then.... maaaaybe...  Features on this are good, has a bass boost, 5 equalizer presets, the LCD screen is a great feature. And it has a mic built in which works great, if you need to record something than this would work great for it. the mic will pick up even the quiet sounds.  sometimes a bit too much. There is a couple other features that you can look into by reading.  All in all, the product i think is great, i almost wnat to give it a 5 out of 5, but again, im sure there is better ones out there.. but just not at this price.

<Title>i think it's a great deal
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought it as a factory-refurbished one for only 85 dollars. Overall this mp3 player is great, especially its sound quality.  The sound quality is amazing comparing to my friend's mp3 player.  Also exterior design is nice.  The speed of uploading songs from your computer to the player is average, and it depends how fast and healthy your computer is.  If your computer has too many spywares, surely the tranfer will take a long time.  The earphone comes with the mp3 player is very unique, and the sound quality of the player is only good with the standard earphone.

<Title>Don't Let People Fool You
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this model of MP3 player for just over 6 months.  I found it easy to use and the manual is very clear on what to do if it ever freezes up.  Mine did freeze up, but only once and when I followed the simple instructions, it 'unfroze' and I was able to turn the unit off instead of having to wait for the battery to die.     Personally, I think the sound quality issue has more to do with what headphones or earbuds you used.  I am a music major and I need to have excellent sound reproduction when I am listening to my classical music.  To use a splitter so my friend could hear, I bought some different earbuds, but the sound was extremely muffled and quiet.  Once I put the Philips earbuds in, I was amazed at the sound, even when another set of earbuds was plugged in.  I don't have to use more than 1/3 of the volume capabilities to listen to music on a bus full of noisy music students.   MusicMatch is a program that you get when you buy this product to transfer your music from CD's to the GoGear.  It too is easy to use and transfering does not take that long.    Overall it has many great features, such as the equalizer settings, FM tuner, and sleep modes, a fair amount of storage, and a decent battery life if used properly. I would recommend this product to anyone asking for a decent and easy to use MP3 player that is not overpriced or overhyped.

<Title>A really poor effort
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Although this mp3 is o.k, it has several major flaws, such as it's constant freezing and not playing certain tracks.I bought this with my Chrimstmas money i got from relatives ect, but, within the first month, it broke and had to be repaired for 6 months!I no they do this from time to time, but that is just ridiculus!The download software is O.k to put on your computer, but recently when i ahev used to software, it has frozen up and will not put any tracks on for me!Also, it never deletes my music library when i ask it too. It just stays there.Overall, not a very good effort from the people i would of expected to do quite well in this feild.The reason why i have given this a four star beacuase  it did eventualy unfreeze, but still a poor effort.

<Title>Piece of junk
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this mp3 player about a year ago and I've been somewhat satisfied with its performance, even though it as a very bad designed interface to load songs to the player, it is incredibly slow (USB 1.1) and I had to reinstall the firmware at least two times becuse of data corruption. I can live with that. The problem came last week when I got a flickering of death. The screen just flickers all the time. The player doesn't respond to any command, it is not recognized by the computer, no way to reinstall firmware... nothing. It just died, and of course is out of warranty. I called Philips support (horrible by the way) and they said that they would repair the player only if it was under warranty. I explained to the guy that it was out of warranty but I was willing to pay for the repair. He said... "no, we only repair electronics that are under warranty. Take the player to an electronic repair shop, they might be able to help". Well, there are no electronic repair shops in this area with the knowledge to repair this thing, so basically I am stuck with a $150 (what I paid originally) paperweight. Thank you Philips!. I won't buy from you again!!.

<Content>This is the second mp3 player that I've had from philips.  The first one never worked and this one died after 5 months of use.  When you get the "flickering of death" nothing in the manual works.  My last philips product EVER!!!!

<Content>I saved my money up for this Philips mp3 player.  When I got it I loved it.  I got it in June 2005, it just recently stopped working in January 2007.  It only worked for a year and a half.  I was very disappointed with this mp3.  I will never get this very mp3 again.

<Title>Save yourself $50 and try this before you buy an iPod!
<Date>Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've tried many MP3 players, and I've returned many MP3 players. The first one that I kept was the Virgin Pulse 64MB player. I've had it for nearly two years and finally after dropping it a few times, it's starting to go out on me. It was time to upgrade and get more space anyway. So I thought I'd do what everyone else did, get an iPod! So I bought a pink iPod mini, just to try it out, but I will definitely be getting a refund! Sure it's pretty and the sound is good, but is it worth $200? No!  So that brings me to the Philips HDD077. I will compare the two(iPod mini and Philips).  The Philips has a nice, sleek design. It is slightly shorter than the iPod mini and a tad bit thicker, but both are lightweight. The Philips only comes in one color (white with silver trim), but they offer red, black, and blue stickers to change up the trim. Obviously, the iPod comes in multiple colors.  The Philips has buttons that are user friendly, just push them. There's a volume button, a hold button, on/off button, all of that. The iPod mini has a few main buttons, not including a volume button. To turn the volume up or down or to scroll through a menu on the iPod mini, the user must move their finger around the button area (like a laptop mouse). This is really annoying because every time you go to touch a button, you may accidently change the volume! The Philips has an FM tuner. The iPod...none. The Philips has 2 GB of space and can hold about 1,000 songs and it also supports compressed files. The iPod minis come in 4 GB (1,000 songs) and 6 GB (price increase!).  Philips comes with a charger that plugs into the wall(17 hours of play, 4 hours to charge). iPod mini charges through the usb cable.  Philips came with a case that has a belt clip and a neck strap. iPod mini came with a belt clip. Now, let's get to what counts most..... Philips uses Musicmatch software to transfer files. This software is easy to use and I didn't even have to read a guide to figure out how to get music on to my player. The iPod uses iTunes software, which was supposed to be easy to use, but I had trouble figuring out how to get music onto the player and I still don't know how to delete music(I'll have to find the instructions for that one). I think that the software should be easy enough to use so that the user doesn't have to read instructions for simple things like transferring files.  The sound quality of the Philips is great! It has a fewer equalizer settings than the iPod. The iPod also has great sound. Both have a backlight.   Overall, I think the Philips is a better choice than the iPod mini because it costs less and it offers more(like radio tuning!).   I only have two concerns about the Philips and they are minor. The earbuds are designed funny. The left wire is about 3 times shorter than the right wire and they are not adjustable. I called to ask about this and it's not a defect. The right earbud is supposed to go around your neck and then into your ear. But you can buy your own earbuds. My other concern is the case with belt clip. I think it could have been designed so that the user use the controls on the player, but the case covers up everything but the charger port, usb port, and earphone port.  So at least give this one a try before you blow $200 on an iPod! You might like it. This one is a keeper for me!

<Title>AWESOME MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 Player is off the chain. With 10 hours of straight music its great. The tuner works like a charm. I suggest buying this than the Apple Ipod. You dont have to pay for music. The only downside is that you need a music provider (BearShare,LimeWire,Kazza,Ares). I suggest Bearshare. HAVE FUN

<Title>Why would you buy this?
<Date>Tue Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Main reason to buy an MP3 player is for music! This player sounds OK with included earbuds, but if you try to use a full size set of headphones the volume and sound quality is severly lacking. I personally can't stand earbuds, they don't stay in my ears, plus the sound quality from headphones is usually much better.  Pros- -Looks like a little iPod -Included earbuds sound pretty good (but not great) -Has FM tuner  Cons- -Very S L O W USB 1.1 transfer speeds, takes forever to load songs to device -When using headphones, volume at full up is lacking, sound not very good through headphones -Sound quality not on a par with other MP3 players I have tried -Limited information about song displayed -Must use MusicMatch from Philips site to transfer songs, not the best application for this purpose -Overall, pales in comparison to offerings from Rio and Creative  I suggest you do some homework before buying this item!  Why did I buy this item? I got it on a deal directly from Philips for a much lower price than listed here, still I wasted my money, gave it to my sister!

<Title>I really regret buying this MP3 Player!
<Date>Sat Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Avoid buying this MP3 player. This is surely without a doubt the dumbest 160$ I have ever spent. I tried to actually enjoy this, I really did but to no avail. The volume and sound quality isn't all that great to begin with. Also, the Phillips Go Gear constantly froze up on me, sometimes for days and the only solution was to let the battery die and then recharge it. But still, I tried to remain positive and just bear with it. But then one day, after a few months, my MP3 player just died for no apparent reason. It hasn't worked ever since.  It's been a few months since it stopped working. Sad to say that I basically threw 160 hard-earned dollars away.

<Title>I have to agree with Mario
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Its funny Mario, because the exact same thing happened to me. I got this less than a year ago (I got it for Christmas, it wasn't my choice of getting it), and about a month ago it stopped working, the screen just froze and the sound blew. Lets see, it hasn't been the next Christmas has it? That would make this almost useful for about 3/4 of a year, thats about 9 months....What a pathetic excuse of an iPod rip-off. The Dell DJ is even better than this, at least that doesn't freeze up every two weeks! The volume limit of this is way below that of an average CD player, so when I was trying to blare it to drown out the wigger music in homeroom, nobody heard it besides me! The iPod goes a lot louder than this crap! The sound quality is choppy, and takes the whole point out of the music. It also holds only a 1.8 gig of memory. I dont know about you, but the lengths of my songs can go from 4 minutes to as high as 20, so...thats only about just less than 500 songs...Guess how many CD's I have. C'mon, do it! I have over 100! Thats about at least 5000 minutes worth of songs, this cant even hold 3K! The iPod, and even the mini, are all 1000x better than this poser! Avoid!  I'd give this negative stars if I could.

<Title>Do not buy this product
<Date>Sun Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This has got to be the worst mp3 that I have ever used.  I purchased it refurbished thinking it was a great deal at $82, but was I ever wrong.  It takes forever to transfer songs.  I am guess 1 minute per song.  The battery life lasts only about 4 hours.  When charging, the unit can not be turned off and that gets very annoying.  The software is the worst I've ever seen.  It uses Music Match Juke box.  The software makes me rename all my mp3 files unless I pay for the upgrade.  What the hell is that?  I purchased a product, I expect it to work without having to pay for more.  Playlist created on Music Match can not be transfered to the unit unless you want to transfer the songs again.  It takes forever to create a playlist with the songs on the unit.    I WILL NEVER BUY AN MP3 PLAYER FROM PHILIPS AGAIN.  I WILL NEVER BUY A PLAYER THAT USES MUSIC MATCH JUKE BOX.  I SUGGEST YOU GUYS DON'T TOO.  IT IS LIKE BURNING MONEY.

<Title>Waste of time and money
<Date>Wed Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the crappiest mp3 player ever. Some problems encountered:  -It froze within a week of purchase -Constantly freezes while playing music. -Goes dead often (refuses to switch on) -Constantly jams while downloading music, or, -a screen pops up on my computer stating that the USB port could not be detected, when it is actually connected securely. -Battery life only lasted 4-5 hours, not the 10 hours philips claims. -Constabtly jams while charging the player.   I'm surprised a reputable brand like philips has gotten away with such a shoddy product. I truly regret buying this product. If you're thinking of buying this product, i would suggest you second that thought and get yourself a Creative Zen Micro instead.

<Title>PIECE OF CRAP!
<Date>Sat Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i saw it, read about it, thought it was everything i needed. Boy, was I wrong! This thing is...crap! When a song is playing, sometimes I want to switch to a new one. It's frozen up on me 3 times!! Then, I have to wait for the battery to run out, and then recharge. It takes forever! And every single time i recharge it, it runs out of power even faster than before.  The settings are so messed up! For some reason, all the songs kept switching around. I am the only one who messes with it. Turns out for some reason, it was put on shuffle mode! And the radio is so hard to figure out, you have to use the manual to get it! And the radio quality is horrible. The sound quality overall is bad too.   I bought this as a congratulations for finishing middle school with money my parents gave me. Now I am paying the consequences. I am earning to buy a new iPod nano.  DO NOT BUY THIS. I AM WARNING YOU!!! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER, IF YOU EVEN CALL IT THAT!  I call it...a waste of my good money and crap.
