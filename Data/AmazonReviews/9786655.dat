<Title>Fussy Player 
<Date>Sat Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this little Rio over 2 years now, but have decided to move on.  The FM has never been good. Even in flat Chicago with powerful signals, the stations never came in well. The software interface is clunky - however the update I found on RIO's website is much better.  After it froze up recently, I called tech support and was recommended to purchase a "reconfiguered" replacement for half the price of a new one. No way. While the tech guy was reading through his manual, I ended up solving the problem myself. Don't look for help there. It's been spotty ever since.  It often stops and tries to "connect" to the computer - even when I'm miles away on a run. The headphones now only play out of one channel.  You've been OK for a little while, but never perfect. Time to move on, little RIO.

<Title>A must before you use the player
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received this player as a christmas gift. I found the sound is amazingly well for this small size gadget. It also has an equalizer to change the music settings. I strongly recommend you to visit www.digitalnetworksna.com/support/rio/ to upgrade the player firmware and the RIO Music Manager.   After the firmware upgrade, it will let you upgrade up to 1G of memory (SD or MMC memory card). I believe 512M is a basic necessity. It also let me play by my own playlist rather than all the songs I have in my player. I find this very useful, because I can organize the songs by album.  I love the sound quality and the small size. It is a good quality product.

<Title>There are better choices
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As my third MP3 player, I chose carefully, looking for excellent features on my runs. Unfortunately, I chose poorly. The clip broke quickly, making the poor-fitting case a moot point. Rio will not replace the case or the clip and you cannot buy a replacement. The capacity is excellent with the option of adding more memory a real plus. Battery life was reasonable. Sadly, the played completely stopped working after a few months. In a world where many companies have difficult customer relations, Rio stands out from the crowd in being particularly unhelpful. Though this player had promise, there are better choices. (I will be looking at a different company's players this time.)

<Title>Works Great Til It Doesn't...
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...then you are doinked BIG TIME. My S35S worked great for about the first six months; I had some of the same clip holder issues that others mention but I could live with those problems. What I could not live with was the unit's death and Rio's Customer DisService. I called and talked to someone who was pleasant enough and gave me a case number to fax along with the unit's serial number and copy of proof of purchase. This I did  according to their instructions. Waiting a couple of weeks I then called to get an update and was informed how busy they were and told to give them a couple of more weeks. A couple of months later I e-mailed them and received a reply explaining they were in the process of moving their warehouse and this resulted in the delay(???). Six months after sending them the information requested to implement repair or replacement I have nothing to show for my original purchase but a dead Rio and a worthless warranty. Ri(o)p-off. No more Rio in this household, period.

<Title>Does the job around the gym and outside
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Durable, light weight MP3 Player. (I must have dropped it around a dozen times in the gym, keeps working)  Good sound, after you replace the headphones that come with the unit.  To  enjoy the good sound you will need to get another headphone, (Sony and Panasonic have decent units for around $20.)    Poor FM receiption, limited playlist managment.  Volume not as lound if you plan to use them in the plane.  Could use a couple more dBs to be near perfection. Overall a basic, no nonsense,  durable unit to bring your tunes to the gym or outside.

<Title>Great little mp3 player
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I used mine over 8 hours a week for over two years in a gym.  It took many hard hits and continued to work.  It worked for 6 months even after the plastic case was cracked.  But the internal memory is starting to fail.  Perhaps using it in a steam room was just too much for it.  Very well made!

<Title>Great, But It Has a Few Flaws
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Sport is an excellent little mp3 player.  The sound quality is great as is the display. While, the original model came with only 128MB of internal memory, it has an SD slot making expansion fairly inexpensive, especially in 2005 when 512MB is available for $50.   In general, the construction is rugged with a rubberized enclosure apparently meant to reduce the affects of impact from dropping. It is also has a rather compact, odd shape that is probably less than ideal for someone wanting to store it in his pocket.    While there are a handful of small design flaws, two features that are particularly annoying.  First, it has a four position concave rocker switch that is extremely sensitive.  While this is great to use blindly with your thumb, it creates a real problem when placing the unit in a pocket as switch easily depresses, causing the RIO to change songs, stop, or pause.   In short, the Rio Sport is a decent mp3 player that could use a couple of minor interface modifications and feature enhancements  Pros Excellent sound quality Good battery life Rugged Compact  Cons Main concave control button very sensitive, too easily depressed  Plastic bracket interferes with buttons and jack Uses AAA batteries instead of AA    ****  Note that the technical description in Amazon is incorrect regarding the memory type and expandability.  It uses and SD card and can go over 128 MB in total.  My 512 MB card is working fine.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Rio for a couple of days now. It's been working great. The bundled software is not all that great, but if you have Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10 then you can use that. The player has good sound and is really durable. The armband took me a minute to figure out but everything works great. The internal memory is a nice starting size. I was able to fit 54 tracks on my internal memory (64Kbps - WMA format). I bought a 128MB card for $18 and that works perfect and now I have over 100 tracks on my player. I've been hearing that the player can handle cards up to 512MB despite what the specs say. I haven't tested it so it's still a rumor to me.   In conclusion, for the price this player is a very good buy. I use it when i work out and the armband is a nifty way to keep the player close but out of the way. I'm not sure is the USB interface is version 1 or 2 but the interface is really quick. When I update my track listing it takes about 1 minute and a half to transfer 54 tracks to my player. Check the Rio site frequently for firmware upgrades. When I got mine i had to upgrade the firmware which is a sinch and take about 30 seconds to do.   Just to add, many have complained about how the player tends to slip out of the armband when you move excessively (ex. Running or jogging). I have to say that I use my Rio everyday while running and have yet to have it slip out of the armband. I run just like everyone else, and wear it while playing basketball also and it has not fallen once.

<Content>Rio no longer supports this model and the Sports case is cheap and breaks easily. Once it breaks, you are out of luck because Rio only carries replacement parts for their newest models. Do yourself a favor and buy something dependable with good product support such as Ipod, Iriver, or CreativeLabs..Leave Rio alone.

<Title>Amazing lil device
<Date>Fri Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was getting fed up of the talkshows in the morning and the advertising tirades in the evening on my sony tuner while working-out. I depend on music quite a lot for my running, so finally had to break down and buy an mp3 player. I am so glad I chose S35S, because it fits everything I had in mind. Light, tough, efficient and trendy. I upgraded to 256MB about a day after the purchase. The 128MB MMC (card) is about 80 bucks, but a good investment as it doubles the song numbers. I have about 100 songs in .WMA(the only way to go, since mp3 is usually about double the file size as wma) saved with some space left over, and with the shuffle mode on, working out to music is a breeze. Battery life is very good, about 10-12 hours on 1 AAA. I also upgraded to a Sony streetstyle (MDR57 ??) headphones which are much better than the supplied ones. The back-lit display and menu options are very easy to learn and operate.<p>The set up software couldn't be easier to use, with downloading and managing the songs the fastest I have seen.<p>There is a mail-in rebate offered by SonicBlue till January 03, so go for it right now, if you're in the market for a mp3 player for the fitness minded folks, or anyone for that matter. <p>The only negative is an abysmal tuner that fails to do anything, and will probably recieve a signal if you operate this inside a radio station. So that is a waste. And hence the 4 stars.<p>Counting that out, this is a great product, and since I am not missing the tuner at all, I would highly recommend this product.<p>An Update: After about a couple of months, I managed to crush my precious lil mp3 player under my truck tires in a freak accident. May be this would be an attestment to it's toughness, the display was broken, but the lil thing has refused to quit playing..Lets see your cd player beat that.

<Title>Finally a good sport MP3 player
<Date>Sun Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've been watching the roles of MP3 players for about 4 years now, waiting for a good one in the application for which MP3 was conceived:  sport.  Requirements:  decent resistance to the elements/sweat, high memory capacity, immunity to shock, light-weight, decent sound, decent comfort.  The RIO S35S meets or exceeds all of these.<p>128MB built-in has me covered for 1.5+ hours of activity; plenty for most people.  I'll get an expansion card anyways, just to have the option of more.  It's light enough that I don't even notice it on my arm when running.  The headphones are extremely comfortable and, surpisingly, I don't even notice them when running either.  It's case provides ample protection from my prolific sweat.  The sound, while not audiophile quality, is perfectly good for exercise.  I've been using a NiMH battery with no problem (it worked even better once I found the battery setting in the menues and switched it from alkaline to NiMH  ;-P).  <p>The radio reception is poor.  I didn't get it to listen to the radio.  If I wanted to listen to the radio, the are many sport models available at far less expense.  For me, the radio is just a last resort if the battery gets too low to play MP3s.<p>In all a very good player.  Maybe a little expensive, but less than competing models like the Nike, which doesn't even have the option of a tuner.  Enjoy!

<Title>Review for XP users
<Date>Wed Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the Rio S35S with some reservations after reading a few reviews mentioning problems with the diver installation on PCs running XP.  I just installed the driver and music transfer software on my PC (running XP) and had no problem at all.  If you just pug in the device and let XP detect and install the driver automatically it will NOT work, because Sonicblue is in the process of certifying the Rio S35S driver for Windows XP.  Since this certification is currently only in process the diver will not be automatically detected.  What did work is to first install the music transfer software from the supplied installation CD (the music transfer software is a different piece of software than the driver), restart the PC after the installation of the music transfer software, leave the installation CD in the PC, connect the player to the PC, turn the player on, XP will tell you that an new device was found, select the detect automatically option and click next (or continue), XP will search the and find the driver on the installation CD (which you left in the PC as mentioned above).  After the installation of the driver is complete, XP will tell you that the driver was installed and that the device is ready to be used.  Launch the installed music transfer software and you are ready to roll...have fun!!

The memory is nice, the FM radio is bad bad bad unusable-it is a non feature and shouldn't be advertsided (really it's false advertising to say it has such a feature and it doesn't work), the headphones are average, the music quality playback ok, I miss the ability to replay over and over a song, the rio manager software is ok. The size is 2.5 times bigger than i thought. I should of checked out the specs better. But for [the money] I paid  a more accurate rating would be 2.5 stars. Very average at best for the price.

<Title>Rio S35S
<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>SONICblue Rio S35S Sport physical construction is ergonomic, nice looking and appears to be rugged. Exterior, made of a &quot;rubbery&quot; material, has a good feel and allows for a good grip when holding the unit. Lighted display is excellent and fairly easy to navigate through the menus. Joggers will have to stop and navigate through the menus to switch from player to radio (or vice vera) since there is no radio/player hardware button. Sound of audio player is decent.<p>Unfortunately, radio reception is poor. Earphone wires which serves as the antenna is sensitive to movement and the position of the device. S35S has a bass/treble equalizer but loses its settings in radio mode once the unit is turned off. Unit does not have much bass. When S35S is turned on, you may experience distortion for a few seconds, depending on settings. When unit is turned off in radio mode at a low volume setting, there is an annoying power/volume surge.<p>People considering purchasing the S35S will want this product because of its small size, nice exterior features and expandable player capabilities but will pass if an FM radio is important.

<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>If you're looking for a little MP3 player for the gym, or running, etc., the Rio is perfect.  The only problem I've really had with it is that the radio isn't very strong.  That is, the stations don't come in very well.  Also, there's no &quot;hold&quot; button, so if you acidentally hit a button, you may skip a track or change the radio station, etc.  In terms of functionality and usefulness though, it's been great!

<Title>Rugged little unit
<Date>Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the Rio S35S for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. After much research (and knowing what she really wanted to do with it -- listen to music while working out) it appeared that this Rio model, although new, was the best fit.<p>My only beefs are with the included software. We should have been filmed by Apple as we were trying to install the software and connect the Rio to my wife's ThinkPad with Windows 2000. After about 20 minutes, I got so frustrated that I just plugged the thing into my PowerBook G4, downloaded the iTunes driver and let her load it up with songs from my MP3 library while I installed the various bits of Windows software.<p>The sound quality is great, the integrated radio tuner works well and its rugged design seems to be pretty, well, rugged. A good purchase!

The sound from the 35S was really annoying based based on the Real Jukebox files.  When I recreated the files using the Real 1 software supplied with the 35S, the sound quality out of the 35S improved dramatically!  All in all, the software package is is easy to install and use.  I use the player now have to admit it's a great unit for workouts.  If I were to suggest an improvement it would be to replace the headphones.

<Title>Extremely User Friendly
<Date>Thu Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I transferred music to the player last night and it was extremely user friendly.  Anyone who has owned an MP3 player in the past knows that compatibility with your computer can make or break the performance of the player.  The box lists a minimum 64MB of RAM as a system requirement for this item, but I have an older laptop with only 32MB of RAM, and I still got the player to transfer music.  The only limitation was that I couldn't download the entire capacity of the player at once.  This is an issue that I believe would be resolved had my computer possessed the minimum system requirements. Overall, the software is intuitive and very easy to use.<p>The only negative feedback I have so far is that there appeared to be one flaw when I was setting the time and date of the player.  The player clock would not let me set a PM time in the 12 hour clock mode.  I had to change the clock mode to 24 hour (Army Time), and set the time that way.  Once the time was set, I changed the clock mode back to 12 hour and the clock reflected the correct time.  Overall, a very minor inconvenience.   <p>I have yet to use this player in the gym; however, I have found that this compact, light, and sturdy player remains secure when fastened by belt clip or arm band.  I will follow up in a few weaks to review the durability and playback performance of the player.

<Date>Sun Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've owned this little MP3 player for about 3 weeks now and have spent about 15 hours in the gym with it.  It is extremely small and light weight.  It clips securly to my gym clothes (haven't needed the arm band) and doesn't get in the way no matter what excercise I'm doing.  The controls are user friendly enough that I operate it by feel.  The sound is very good and I haven't experienced any problems whatsoever.<p>If it can handle the gym, I should work equally well riding bikes or jogging.  The player itself actually snaps into a soft, shock absorbent housing that protects the player and provides the belt clip.<p>Downloads have gone off without a hitch and the process is typical of a Windows application making it pretty intuitive.<p>If I lost this player, I would replace it in kind without hesitation.

<Title>A great mp3 Player!
<Date>Sun Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this mp3 player and I am extremely satisfied with it. The player has a lot of functions including a stopwatch, FM radio, equalizer, etc... There are definitly no bugs in the program and very easy to use. <p>PROS:<br>1. Small (very small!!!), durable and handy<br>2. The software was excellent, no crashing, no stalling, and a fast transfer too! The program split the window into two parts, one is my library and the other is the files on the player. All the ID3 tags (tags that display the name, author, etc of a song)should be automatically added if you label them in Musicmatch, Real jukebox, or any other player. <br>3. Water and compact resistant (extremely durable, i even dropped it a few times on concrete and it still worked!)I ran in the rain once, it was working perfectly<br>4. Big LCD screen to display time, battery level, song title, song artist, album, a location thingy to display how far u are into the song, volume indicator, how much time left, how much time already past, and date. The resolution is very fine so the date and the time is not all distorted. <br>5. There are amazing functions including a treble/bass equalizer that doesn't distort the quality of the sound<br>6. The stopwatch includes laps, an average time, and the difference between each lap<br>7. The radio has a search option with 3 savable channels<br>8. A power saving capability to save power (cutting off backlight time and a saving power mode that acts like a screen saver)<br>9. A menu option to browse all the songs<br>10. Light and handy, i ran with it and almost forgot it was still clipped on my shorts<br>11. The cd also comes with iTunes and RealOne, both really nice music managing programs<p>CONS:<br>1. The big round set that has the Play, FF, RW, and Stop is easy to hit so you can't walk around with it in your pockets, on the other hand it is a good thing for running because no one would like to struggle pressing the FF button while keeping a even pace =)<br>2. The earphones aren't as comfortable<br>3. There is no remote control...<br>4. It uses an MMC card for expansion and MMC cards are usually 10 more bucks than Smart Media<br>5. It's a little thicker than most mp3's players (u can check up the dimensions) and its round shape looks a little babyish & toyish...<br>6. SONICblue boasts up to 10 hrs on one AAA battery, I only get around 5 hours....<br>7. no microphone...<br>8. there are no detailed instructions, just a quick start. The detailed instructions are found in the CD program<p>Overall this player is outstanding and I think that SONICblue has hit the target. As a runner, no other mp3 player would match this player's size, weight, and ease of use!!! The package comes with an armband, a belt clip, a pair of earphones, a cd software, and of course, the mp3 player! Again I would definitly recommend this for runners, or people who do sports. I would not recommend this for people looking for an mp3 player that is cute and small with advance features.

<Content>This was my first MP3 player.  I bought it for its versatility with fitness activities.  So far, I love it!!  I like the FM radio option- although only stations with strong signals come in.  Most MP3's don't even offer the option.  I also like the stopwatch function.  Sound clarity is excellent, ease of use is great and fast transfer times for songs.  Backlit display is nice.  It is small, compact, securely stays clipped to your clothing (haven't needed the strap, but its nice to have it).  I also like the appearance.  I like the option of adding more memory later.  I'd definitely recommend it.

Outside is better but if you are skating or running expect the signal to fade in and out as you change directions.  As far as MP3 capability it is a terrific little device.  You could not ask for anything easier to download from the pc.  Point and click everything.  Let's you know how close you are to capacity.  If you can live without the radio portion buy this unit.

<Title>Any problems with the integrated DRM so far?
<Date>Mon Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Hi there!<p>A great player ... but what I'd like to know is, whether anyone out there is having problems with the integrated DRM. <p>In the description of the player is a feature called DRM (Digital Rights Management). Does that mean, that in the future I can only put &quot;legal&quot; MP3's into the player, which I ripped by myself?<p>Thx for answers!

<Title>Great for the gym: sweat-proof with a good battery life
<Date>Mon Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've used this Rio player at the gym for 3 times (1 hour session each) a week for over a year.  It has endured sweat, water and a few drops on the floor with no problem.  The battery life is good enough that I only have to change the battery every few weeks.  The player can fit a good amount of songs on it so I don't have to change them out that often either.  Yes, the holder is a bit cheesy but overall that shouldn't stop you from buying it.  It's so small that you can put it in your pocket if the holder really bugs you.  Great gadget!

<Title>Great little player!
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've owned other MP3 players before, but this one is the easiest to use.  The software is great -- just load it up and you're off and running, no instruction required, it's that simple.  The display is outstanding (whatever you do, don't buy one without a backlit display; you'll be sorry!).  The player itself is also intuitive; you don't have to be a mechanical genius to figure it out (yes,some of the other lower-cost players are that complex).  <p>As others have pointed out, the case doens't fit exactly, but it's not THAT bad, and the circular control is a bit sensitive so you'll want to use the lock feature, but everything else about it is so very user friendly.  I like the clip -- mine has held up through a lot of abuse, and it's just as strong as ever.  <p>As for battery life, I'm getting at least 6- 7 hours.  Maybe not as long as the manufacturers tell you it will get, but a lot longer than I got with my MTV player.<p>And, best of all, the sound quality is awesome.  I've had mine for about a year now, and use it for running, the gym, roller blading and yardwork, and have had no real problems whatsoever.

<Title>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE on this terrible product!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>DON'T BUY A RIO:  1st things first, if you plan on using the fm tuner, forget it!  It doesn't work at all, even after you upgrade the firmware at Rio.  That was the first problem, after using the player for several months it started going crazy and not working.  I called (not toll free) Rio, spoke to a person who barely spoke any English, spent 25 minutes (on my dime) uprgrading the firmware.  Tried it out, it didn't work.  Called back, on my dime, spent another 20 minutes diagnosing with another non-English speaking person.  I was finally told it was broken.  NO SH*T!  Now I have to fax (on my dime once again) proof of purchase (even thought the serial number proves that the player is in warranty! - now i have to locate the F'ing proof).  After they receive my fax, then they will send me a Return Auth number.  Then I get to send the player across the country (you guessed it, on my dime) back to them before they will replace the unit.  Give me a break.  Time to get into the 21st century of customer service.  DON'T BUY A RIO, YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!!!

<Title>great music, pathetic clip
<Date>Thu Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I should have listened!  I had the MP3 player for 3 days before the clip broke.  I was at the gym, riding the bike and it broke!  I just called for the replacement (which they only sell the whole case).  It's $10.95, plus $6 shipping plus tax AND THEY'RE BACKORDERED!  It sounds like there are a few others in my situation!  That's why I only have it 4 stars.  Other than the clip (you can put the player in your pocket, but many of the gym shorts I have don't have pockets) I LOVE the player!  I haven't had any problems with it--great music!  Do invest in a good pair of earphones, the ones that come with it keep popping out of your ears.

<Title>WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, RIO NO LONGER WORKS
<Date>Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>At first I was excited with my new rio mp3 player. I downloaded my favorite songs, upgrade the card, etc. but then I dropped my rio player. And that was the end of it. I called customer service and was sent from one person to the next to the next to the next, none spoke English. I finally found out their customer service phones are answered in a foreign country. Ok, I understand we all need jobs, especially the third world, BUT they don't understand me and can't help me. Then I finally get someone who says I must prove I purchased the rio player to get a customer authorization number to replay my rio because "it can't be repaired and must be replaced." I only dropped it once on my living room rug -- how weak is this device anyway! This happened 5 months ago, I've yet to receive my replacement. I've lost my money. Hold off and save for a better quality player and better customer service. I do not recommend any RIO products because of poor customer service (which you will eventually need).

<Content>Have used this device for about a year now.  One of my highly valued possesions.  Clear sound, very portable.  I am in awe of the technical geniuses that came up with this device.  One of the first things I did with the player is drop it on a brick path while running and having it on my arm.  The player cracked right open on the ground.  I punched it back to gether and it has worked ever since (just lost my songs.)  What more can u ask for in toughness?  I will say that someone using the player will want to reenforce the band.  That way it will not fall of the clip when it is on your arm or something (I use string.)

<Title>Don't waste your money!
<Date>Sun Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had the Rio S35S for about a year, when for no reason it just stopped working while I was running.  The "USB connecting" message comes on and it won't play any songs.  The thing randomly started working again, only to stop again the next time I ran.  Now the bottons won't work at all, and it intermittently stops and starts working for no reason.  Overall this product is very unreliable, and having read other peoples' comments I'm not even going to waste my time calling the useless, non-English speaking Rio tech support.  Don't waste your money!

<Title>Small and durable, great for exercising
<Date>Wed Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had it for 8 months now and ready to upgrade my  memory a bit.  While running, I have yanked the cord by mistake with my arm and the headphones have stayed on my ears while the player hit the pavement.  This has happened a few times and it's still working.  My 140 lb dog has chewed it, only thing that didn't make it was the battery cover.  I'm very happy with it.  Radio doesn't come in that great.  My only complaint is that the cover for armband and waistband wear is difficult to get on and off the unit.

<Title>Durable & User-friendly
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Pros:  I've been using this little guy everyday as part of my daily fitness regimen; hiking, mountain biking, running, and into the gym for serious lifting... you name it, it's been there. It's very durable and on a couple of occasions while biking, I've fallen on it with not even a scratch thanks to its protective rubber-coating. I don't know how water-resistant it is, but I've put a good amount of sweat and some drizzle from the rain on it with no problems yet. The menus are very user-friendly and the LCD layout is clean, crisp, and can be read even when you're on the move. The sound output is great; I'd suggest using mp3 at a 96 bit rate to save on storage. The battery life is very dependable; on average I change out batteries once every one and a half to two weeks (I use it aprx. 2 hours a day). As for the software, I had some trouble getting it loaded up on my pc (b/c it's over 5 years old) but on my school's pc, it had no problems. The uploading of songs takes some time (depending on your CPU's speed), but it's not a big issue. The software menu layout is as easy as drag-and-drop and you're ready to go. All in all, I LOVE IT... with this little gizmo by my side, I've been able to lose 45+ pounds. Thank you Rio for an AMAZING product!  Cons:  The radio tuner is non-existant, not a big deal since I don't listen to the radio, but there are downloadable patches on the companies website to upgrade the radio signal. The in-stock earphones aren't that great, it's suggest finding ones that fit more ergonomically to your head anyway. Storage can hold 20 songs at 182 kbs or 40 songs at 96 kbs, although sound quality is still great at 96kbs.  If you need more than that, I'd suggest purchasing an add-on a memory stick.   NOTE: I bought this MP3 player when it originally came out (almost 2 years ago) for full price.  Now, it's less than half the original price and still a better deal than most sport MP3 players today.

<Title>Good Sound - Poorly built
<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased 2 of these believing that they would be great for working out (one was for my wife).  They sound good and the software is easy to use. However - I would not buy this item again.  The supplied sleeve to carry the player on your belt or in the supplied arm strap is not cut properly to access the buttons properly.  The arm strap is not well designed to hold the player - the player will actually flip out with repeated arm movements(runners beware).  Then, God forbid you drop the thing at all it will fall apart.  It is not durable and the design creates situations where it will fall.  I've had mine less than 6 months and have not used it very much.  After it popped out of it's strap a couple of times, the unit began to separate at it's seem.  There is no way for a consumer to attempt to put it back together properly.  Too bad.  I strongly advise against this item as a sports mp3 player - it is simply not durable at all.

<Title>My first player---a great way to start
<Date>Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this primarily for my morning run.  It sounds great, and it is light as can be.  Some things to consider:<p>+ size and weight are small and light<br>+ stylish looking<br>+ easy to use. Once you tell it where you store your MP3 files, you just select, click, and you are good to go!<p>- At 128kb--a CD quality MP3--this does not hold four hours worth of music (as SonicBlue claims). It holds about two hours.<p>- Battery life is less than 15 hours, as advertised.  More like 7 - 10, from what I can tell.  To be fair, I've not used it without having it on to download new tunes. I'm sure this drains some battery life.<p>So do a little homework, and if you can live with a couple of hours worth of tunes, this may be a great unit for you!

<Title>Great player! Works fine right out the box.
<Date>Fri Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Opened it up, got the software installed and it worked! I was very skeptical after reading all the reviews on various web sites. The software is a little hokey, could be better. However, I put the disk in, installed the sw and was dropping songs onto the player in under 5 minutes. <p>Menu navigation is very intuitive and the backlit display is a huge plus in my book. Also, you have lots of information in the display(battery life, song title, artist, album, date, track time, bit rate, etc...)Another plus for me is the time is always displayed in the upper left. <p>After I did that, I flashed the firmware. This, too, went smoothly. Now I am running ver. 1.6 with no problems. And-In the README file it says it has been tested with sd512 cards successfully! That means that you could potentially have up to 640MB of storage. Pretty much the size of a cd. I'm very impressed with that feature(this is one of the main reasons I bought it). Between the size of the unit and potential memory capacity, you cannot go wrong. <p>One drawback is I can't figure out how to set FM presets in the radio. This really isn't a problem seeing as I did not intend on even using the radio feature. However, would still be nice to have. Tried tech support and was politely told by a robot to call back later. Oh well, I'm not too disappointed. <p>All in all, a great little unit for the price. If size, weight, large storage capacity, great display features, and upgradeability are a factor then this is the player for you(and me).

<Content>Let me cut through the chase....I installed and transferred my first track to this sporty little player in a whopping 10 minutes (on Windows XP). So for ease of use, can you say "simple"?  As far as the FM radio...it isn't very good. But then again, if I wanted an FM receiver, I would have bought one of those instead.

<Content>Pros:  Great little unit for my morning workout.  Lightweight, great sound, easy to attach to arm or waist, good volume control, easy change in song selection.  Haven't used the radio too much because of the great clarity in downloaded music.  <p>Cons:  Initial EXTREME frustration with software to get my Toshiba PS141U-01F3 Laptop (XP Windows version) to 'communicate' to the Rio S35S.  I had to wait on the telephone and eventually talk to a customer service representative, (2 occassions totalling 2.5 hours) to walk me through the software updates and help me get it to work. The company definitely needs to improve instruction manual that is included in the packaging.  It seems that others have had the same type problems as this.  However, once the computer and unit were compatable, it has worked well. <br>  <br>Would recommend this product.  I will be purchasing the extra MMC card next.

Everything she suggested I had already tried.  She admitted that there is a problem with Windows ME which I have.  It is unable to recognize current driver.  I would appreciate a reply to this if anyone has been able to fix it.  Her only suggestion was to try on a different operating system.  My USB recognizes it as the Sonic but that is as far as it gets.  Then the program stops responding.<p> I will now spend the rest of my time trying to return the product for a refund!

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player with plenty of room to grow!
<Date>Fri Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought my S35S because I wanted a small portable device that could hold a lot of data.  The RIO S35S is exactly what I was looking for.  It comes with 128MB intenal memory, and is also expandable through a MMC memory card slot.  The documentation that comes with the player and the box says it is expandable with up to another 128MB of memory, but once you have upgraded the firmware through Sonicblue's website, it can be expanded up to another 512MB! (and potentially even more depending on how large MMC cards get in the future!)  I have a Sandisk 256MB SD memory card in mine, and it works like a charm.  Some SD memory cards require firmware version 1.62 or higher, so make sure you have upgraded if you want to use that type of memory (check out www.rioworld.org if SonicBlue's website only has firmware 1.60.  Sonicblue hadn't updated their website as of this posting.).  Even though the FM tuner doesn't get good reception inside buildings, it works fine outside with local stations.  Also, because this device is firmware upgradable, future enhancements can be easily added as SonicBlue develops them!  I would highly recommend this MP3 player for anyone looking for a very compact and expandable portable music player.

<Content>This player is an incredible piece of machinery, despite the reviews to the contrary.  I run with my on a daily basis and it by far exceeds any CD player I have run with in the past.  The convenience of this MP3 player has made my protable CD players obsolete.<br>The only problem this player has is that there is no radio reception, but as a previous review said, who cares??  If you want a radio then buy a tuner instead.  I found the transition between my computer and the Rio flawless, and a lot faster than burning a cd.  If anyone has a problem using the Rio, then that problem probably lies with a defect in the particular Rio they received, or they own a computer incapable of handling the transition for one reason or another.  I use both the included software and RealOne, both have been equal in performance on my end!!

<Date>Tue Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had been looking for a mp3 player with a radio for about a year with no success.  So when I saw this model I grabbed it up right away.  After 2 1/2  months of steady use, it has not given me any problems.  The installation went off with out a hitch, and I've had no problems with any of the firmware.  It definitly sucks down batteries (AAA) so I recommend buying a set of rechargable batteries and charger.  Also the radio is not the strongest... it is crackely indoors, but no problem outside even in a modestly sized city like Boston.  It takes a little work to figure out the radio presets but if you read the instructions there shouldn't be any problems.  Have fun and keep running...

<Content>I've owned 2 RIO S35S MP3 players in the past 12 months.  Both of them started behaving poorly within one month of purchase.  The first one would randomly restart itself from the beginning of the playlist, and would occasionally just stop playing altogether, even with new batteries.  After 1 month, the 2nd one began locking up in the middle of music uploads from my PC.  Eventually it just stopped functioning.

It's very easy to trade music in and out -- the supplied software is just fine, and it also works well with the Musicmatch Jukebox package. It's not comparable to a hard-drive player, but it's a good little flash memory machine, with decent battery life. <p>The accessories are, as others have noted, terrible. The case doesn't fit, and the headphones are the worst I've ever come across. I sliced off the top of the case to unblock the buttons and still use the clip part, which I've found sturdy enough, and, with my own decent set of 'phones, it's a good item for the money.

<Title>Great Sound Quality, Wonderful Software & Extremely Durable
<Date>Sun May 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Rio Sport for about 2 years.  I've taken it across country (from California to South Carolina), I've dropped it, accidently sat on it, gotten it wet & it just keeps coming back for more!  <p>Other reviewers criticize the beltclip, and they're right.  The beltclip is lame.  I just put the Rio in my pocket.  When my wife goes running, it's so small, she just puts it down her sports bra.  No worries.<p>Now the good news!<p>The easily readable, brightly back-lit LCD is reminiscent of the "IndiGlow" wristwatch.  It displays everything you'd expect it to.  Song title and the names of the artist and the album.  <p>If the song title is too long ("Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars" for example) then the title slowly scrolls from Left to Right.  Mighty slick!<p>A small status bar shows how far into each song you are.<p>Pressing the Enter button toggles you through information such as file type (wma, mp3, wav, etc.), time remaining, time elapsed, KBPS Rate (32 Kbs, 64 Kbs or 128 kbs), Date, Pause/Play, Stereo or Mono and track number out of total (e.g. if you've got 100 sound files onboard, and you're listening to song number 38, the it will display "38/100").<p>If its time-of-day clock is too small (which it probably is), then use your wristwatch.<p>An easy-to see battery indicator estimates how much juice you have remaining (with about 6 increments inlcuding a blinking battery to symbolize a sort of "2-minute warning").<p>Battery life: I sometimes advance to the next song, max out the volume (or frequently CHANGE the volume), back up & play songs over and turn it on & off a lot.  <p>With all this activity - I can usually rely on about 8 accumulative hours of operation.<p>I would guess Sony's optimistic assessment of "15 hours on one battery" (or whatever) is based on putting in a fresh alkaline battery and letting the device play over & over until it finally runs out of battery.<p>Buttons are extremely responsive and there's also a "button-lock" (keystroke: MENU+ENTER) which means you need not worry about accidently bumping the advance button when you're right in the middle of something good.<p>This unit comes with good-quality Earbuds.  While there's nothing wrong with them, I personally don't care for the basic design of earbuds in general, even if they're the highest quality.  <p>My wife loves hers, but I'm picky so I bought wrap-around headphones (TDK/$10 such a deal!)  <p>Neato software!  The included "Rio Music Manager" is the main software used to get music FROM your hard drive INTO your MP3 player.  But wait! There's more!<p>If you prefer Windows Media Player, then you don't even NEED Music Manager.  From within Media Player, you just click "Copy To CD or Device."<p>Or by using the "other accessories" button, the Setup Wizard creates a Rio Player icon in your "My Computer" window, which allows you to simply drag music files onto the icon (the one drawback to this is you lose the tag information (Song name, artist, album, etc.)<p>The included software also comes with "RIO Taxi", which enables you to use the Rio Sport as a storage device!<p>For example - say you've got some big ol' 18 MB Powerpoint file you want to take to a friend's house.  Using Rio Taxi, you can put the 18 MB file on your Rio Sport, take the Sport to your friends house, plug it into his computer & download the file from your Rio Sport to your friend's computer!  FREAKY TIKI!<p>The SOUND QUALITY is nothing less than exquisite.  But the actual VOLUME output isn't always as powerful as you might like.  Sometimes ambient sounds (garbage trucks, barking dogs, police sirens) can drown out the MP3 music.  <p>SOLUTION!  An oft-overlooked FREE accessory that comes with the Windows Operating System.  It's called Windows Movie-Maker.  <p>In addition to being a darn fine movie editor, you can also use this Freebie to boost the volume of ANY sound (wma, mp3 or wav) and save it as a regular wma file.  It also allows you to adjust the quality from 16 KBS to 256 KBS!<p>The Drop-Test:  I'm not proud of this, but I am clumsy & subsequently very hard on my toys.  <p>I have accidently dropped the Rio Sport from a height of about 5 feet (chest level).  It has dropped, bounced & tumbled on asphalt, concrete & other hard surfaces.  I even dropped it water once (rescued within 5 seconds).   <p>This has caused a few minor problems.  About ever 3 months, I can't turn it off.  I need to remove & reinsert the AAA battery causing the clock to return to 12:NOON.  But I never lose files, and the sound quality is (& always has been) supurb!<p>In short, this is a wonderful little MP3 player & I strongly recommend it to anyone with an active life!

<Title>Big sound out of a small package
<Date>Fri Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have owned this item for close to a year now and I have been nothing but happy with this device.  <p>I think that this MP3 player is very well laid out.  I run quite a bit and it is very easy for me to skip through songs and adjust the volume while the unit is strapped to my arm.  The arm band that this player comes with holds the MP3 player very well, and leaves all buttons exposed so they are very easy to access.<p>The sound quality it one of the best I've heard from a MP3 player.  I recently purchased an IPOD Mini and I still find myself going back to this Rio to listen to during my workouts.  I feel that the sound quality of this device is steps above the IPOD.<p>The battery life is also impressive.  It takes 1 AAA battery which lasts me a few weeks with moderate use (an hour every other day).  <p>The software it comes with is decent but not the best I've seen, but it gets the job done and it isn't difficult at all to transfer songs to the MP3 player. <p>I only had one issue.  When I first bought the player it would sometimes automatically pause after certain songs were played.  I simply went to Rio's web site and updated the firmware, and I haven't had the problem since. <p>It's been about a year and I still can highly recommend this device.  It's easy to use and sounds great.

<Title>Decent Player
<Date>Thu Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this player mainly for when I'm at the gym. I have used it over a year and have been very happy with it. The only complaint I have it the battery life is shorter then when I would like. Even with the battery life I would highly recommend, and buy another RIO product.

<Title>This MP3 Player is awesome
<Date>Wed Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When I bought this MP3 Player i didnt know what to expect.  I had heard from previous reviews that it was an alright gadget but after a few weeks of using the Rio S35S MP3 Player I have figured out that it is a great MP3 Player.  This MP3 Player can withstand any kind of activity whether its working out at the gym or just shootin' hoops in the driveway.  The case and arm-strap are great.  I have never dropped my MP3 Player because its so well supported by the case and armband.  It downloads songs from your computer in seconds.  My MP3 Player came with a 64 MB card which made the total megs 196 MB.  It can hold anywhere from 30 to 35 songs on it.  The songs sound very clear when played on this MP3 Player.  I have had a couple of minor problems.  ONe of the minor problems was that for a week or so my Rio wouldnt fast-forward or rewind any of the songs but that was resolved somehow and now it still works.  Also occasionally the MP3 Player &quot;lags&quot; going from song to song.  Other then that this MP3 Player is of excellent quality.  Because this MP3 Player is an excellentgadget i give it 5 stars because there are many good thkngs about it and almost nothing bad abomut it.

<Title>Great player, lousy plastic
<Date>Thu Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I worked out with this player every day for over a year.  The sound quality, ease of use, and battery life are all excellent.  However, during one unfortunate run the player came out of the arm band attachment and shattered like glass when it hit the concrete. Play with ease, run with caution.

<Title>False Advertizing
<Date>Wed Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Although it makes as a great mp3 player, it is not as rugged as they say it is. My dad and I bought one each but both broke. Mine was moderately hit and completely broke. My dad's started coming open and and the volume wouldn't go down. It makes as a great mp3 player but just doesn't stand up rugged of a teenager.

<Title>Great for everything but pockets
<Date>Wed Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Delighted with the Rio - I use it for my daily commute (either on foot, bike or bus) and for running. I had no problems with the software - interfaces very nicely with iTunes and am pleased with sound quality. My sole complaint is that the big round button is too easy to push - when i put the Rio in a pocket (coat or bag) it often get paused or skips a song just from touching the inside of the pocket. not an irredeemable problem since it comes with a nice clip, but i don't like it to be too visible... so: not perfect, but acceptably close.

<Title>Poor engineering!!!
<Date>Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I can't belive I spent money on this mp3 player.  It constantly "hangs-up" and skips.  Also, you can't save your equalizer settings.  Every time you turn it off and turn it back on, you have to reset the equalizer.  The sound quality is also very poor.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone!!!

<Title>No Driver problems here
<Date>Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>So I've noticed a large number of complaints about installing/configuring the drivers for Windows XP.  <p>Let's see, I installed the software, plugged in the device, and the driver was automatically found and installed.  Yes I can see how that would be difficult.<p>Anyway, yeah the radio is kind of pointless, but there's a reason why this is called an MP3 player, not a 'portable radio machine.'  <p>To store more songs, just turn the compression rate on your MP3s down a bit.  The difference between 128 and 112 really isn't noticeable for the most part.  <p>Overall it's a great little unit, perfect for tucking into my pocket while riding my bike indoors.

<Date>Sat Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was listening to my MP3s within 20 minutes of opening the packaging! (Everything loaded easy as pie on my Dell laptop with Windows 2K) Great step-by-step instructions. As advertised it is very lightweight and the ear pieces fit over your ear so they stay in place while working out. The armband is a great feature so you can keep your hands free. Couldn't be happier with my purchase!

<Content>I have been using the Sonic Blue RIO  S35S for the past 2 weeks without any problems.  It was simple to get up and running.  Lightweight, simple to operate.  Two things that would make this product better. 1) Longer Battery life.( use the lithium batteries if possible)  2) A lock for the buttons, if you brush up against something, it may cause your music to stop. <p>Other than that great system.

<Title>Initial observations
<Date>Mon Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is my first mp3 player after many dropped and broken CD players.  So far so good.  I had no problems loading the drivers and updating the firmware from the sonicblue website. <br>Transfering mp3s was easy with the supplied software but less flexibile than windows media player, which I'll probably stick with.<br>I intend to increase the memory but I want more info on SD vs MMC from this forum.<br>I'll update this review after my intended use: treadmill and resistance machines, but my only concerns at this point are dropping/breaking and skipping tracks due to the exposed buttons.<br>Was unpleasantly surprised that I could't fast forward within a song.

<Title>Great Purchase
<Date>Tue Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Let me start by saying that this is a FANTASTIC MP3 player!! I did not know too much about MP3 players but I have to say this one is pretty user friendly.  To clear up a few things, you can only get around 2 hours of music in the MP3 format, BUT if you convert all of your music into the WMA format like I did, you get OVER 4 hours of music without the use of a MMC.  The sound is just as good as cd (depending of the quality of your downloads) and the Rio Music Manager Program easily transfers the songs over quickly. A single AAA battery can also last about 10 solid hours, which is really good compared to other MP3 players and is not too costly considering you only use one battery at a time.  The only reason I gave this fabulous MP3 player 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because if its FM tuner, it conveniently can hold up to 8 preset stations, but its reception leaves a bit to be desired and is clearly this players only weak point.  All in all I strongly recommend this product, it is simply awesome and you will not go wrong!!!!

<Title>Could this be any easier???
<Date>Tue Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was extremely concerned with the software issues when I first looked into this player.  If you have ANY computer sense at all, you will have no problem with this device (at least for XP users).  I was transfering music to the player within 15 minutes of putting the cd in the cd-rom drive.  It really isn't anywhere close to as hard as a lot of the reviews make it out to be.  <p>As for the player itself.. Its very easy to use and has all the features I was looking for.  The tuner worked pretty well and I didn't have any static problems (maybe I'm lucky).  I like the compact size while the belt clip and armband are a huge plus (especially for working out).  You never really know its there. One other feature I like is I can plug it into my car cd player (using a cable I already have) and play music that way too.<p>The only drawback I have is the headset.  They really are cheap.<p>Overall I'd highly recommend this player to anyone especially for workouts.
