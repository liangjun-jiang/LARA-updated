<Title>The best sounding MP3 player currently on the market
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am an owner of an 80 gig Apple ipod, the Sony NW-HD5 and the Creative Zen 30 Gig "M" player. When it comes to sound, the Apple ipod surely comes in last, and while the other two have great sound quality (especially the NW-HD5), the Sony NWZA818 REALLY blows the others out of the water (so much so, I was somewhat taken aback).  There are so many EQ adjustments on this player, it's silly. The hardware and software design is great, it feels solid in spite of it's size, the buttons are well-placed and it is simplicity itself to load and delete music. It's also got a fast processor, a vivid, colorful (albeit SMALL) screen to watch videos and wonderful battery life.  GOODBYE SONICSTAGE, and good riddance! At last, Sony has done away with the notoriously buggy software that it previously used for managing its portable devices. Now users have the choice of using either the "drag and drop" method or Windows Media Player to manage their music files, thanks to Microsoft's "Play For Sure" compatibility.  The included headphones are outstanding in both build and sound quality; as some have taken note, the going price for Sony's MDR-EX082 Headphones is around $50. What this means is that most people will be quite satisfied with the sound right out of the box, with no need to buy a decent pair of headphones to supplement the player (a rarity indeed amongst MP3/MP4 portable players).  In fact, while there are some negatives (the unnecessarily proprietary USB charger, no removable battery slot, no SD card slot, relatively small hard drive capacity, no FM radio, no recording capability), they are not enough in any way to negate this player's awesome positives... particularly the Sony NWZA818's truly exceptional sound.  If you're an audiophile like me, this is simply a must have.

<Title>Pleasantly Surprised!
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Sony Walkman NWZA818BLK, 8 gig MP3 player and I couldn't be happier! I love it! It looks much better in person, I think, than what you see online. It is sleek, smooth, shiny and very cool. It is something you won't be embarrassed for others to see. Actually, you will probably want to show this one off! If Fonzie, or the Fonz, was transported to our time, he would definitely have this MP3 player. It is made of metal with a silvery high polish and complimented with black. It is the "Harley" of MP3 players!   I have had all sorts of MP3 players through the years, everything from A-pple to Z-en. I didn't buy a Zune though, as I thought it looked cheap. My friend has one and I borrowed it. Glad I did, because it just doesn't look great and I don't think it looks well made. This one looks like it will last. Sony must have decided to come back to the market and bring back a simple to use, well made construction player with EXCELLENT sound! The sound is about as perfect as you can get for a MP3 player. You can customize it with many choices. For example, there is a function for Clear Sound using a cord, an extention cord too. Playback can be in all ranges or selected. The Equalizer has None, Heavy, Pop, Jazz, Unique or you can customize it. There is VPT Surround Sound of None, Studio, Live, Club, Arena, Matrix or Karaoke. DSEE Sound Enhance can be on or off. Clear Studio and also Dynamic Normalizer can be on or off. There is also an AVLS Volume limit you can turn on to protect your hearing, if you want it. There is a Time and Date Screensaver to pop on every so many seconds that is nice. You can also decide when the screensaver kicks in such as 15 sec. 30 sec. or 60 sec. The battery life is wonderful. Look for many hours of fun.   I also bought the Sony Docking Cradle. I got it at the Sony website for around 50-60 bucks. It looks fantastic with the Walkman. It is also shiny high polished silvery steel with black. You can record to your Walkman, play to your stereo or speakers, transfer data to and from your computer and of course the nicest feature of all, you can charge it up without the computer. You do get a USB cable with your Walkman for transfer of music and to charge it via your computer.   The headphones are sleek, super cool looking and there are three ear piece sizes to customize your earpieces to your ears and they sound wonderful. I also tried the Walkman with my Koss and other Sony headphones and they work equally well. Sometimes I like the larger headphones to have the music surround me with sound, but these earphones supplied work very well indeed!   I tinkered around with my music settings and for me, I love the Live VPT sound. It sounds like they are right there in the room with you! I like the Heavy for the Equalizer. I thought Pop sounded a little off, to me, but that may be because my music is more geared toward Bass and more heavy sounds. The Dynamic Normalizer really works great for me with it on. I notice a big difference. Clear Sound on also made my music more crisp.   The pictures look great on here. The menus are simple and easy to move around. One of the best features is the very simple drag and drop via Windows Explorer. I tried the Windows Music Player you can download with the supplied software and used the Sync function, but it was WAY too time consuming for me and I have a Duo Core Intel Pentium, so not exactly a slow computer. The Windows Explorer was quick and easy. I made sure I have my file folders put into each music group. Like Pop, Rock, Oldies, Latin, Classic, Jazz, etc. Then I just drop those into the Walkman and Voila! I use the Music Library Folder and it takes me to my folders and I can just go to and hear whatever I am craving.   Also it has a nice search function. There is the video function I haven't used since I filled my Walkman with all music! There are shuffle functions, playlist function for dropping playlists into as well. All functions are quick and easy. Note: You can also use an online CDDB or some database to sync your MP3s to update genres and all that, so you can go right to each category. The folders alone work well for me and don't take hours to do. It can play a lot of different files such as WMA, WAV, MP3 among others. It can even play AAC, MP4, if they are not copy protected. I wish Windows and Apple would get together and allow ALL music to play on ALL players, but still, this player plays more types than many others.  Pros: Simple to use; sleek and cool looking; well made, metal looks great with the black; excellent sound; easy to use menus and transfers; nice clear pictures; bright, crisp window; excellent battery life and the Fonz would approve! I have had many players and by far this one is the best sounding player I have ever had and one of the easiest to use.  Cons: I wish it had a few more gigs, like 10 or 16 gigs. Still I have more then 2,000 songs on there, so that is a lot! There isn't a carrying strap included, so you need to factor that into the price of buying one, I think one should be supplied. I wasn't impressed with Windows Media Player's sync function. But you don't have to download Windows Media Player at all, which I like that option. Windows Explorer is just easier and quicker. The earphones, as great sounding as they are, should have just one longer cord instead of two sections you connect together and should be longer, but it is adequate. I use other earphones on this player too and they work equally well.  I am SO glad I purchased this one. Thanks Amazon!!    UPDATE: I have had this Sony player for about a three weeks now and just have to add that it works great! I have not had any problems with it. I got Rhapsody To Go on it without any problems, despite someone commenting that you couldn't use Rhapsody with this player, but it works great on it.   The only thing I wish is that it had a 16 gig since I have to take off music and put music on, because I have too many music files.  I have to decide which to put on and to take off, but I do not regret buying this one at all. The sound is excellent and I have already had several people comment in public about how nice a player it looks and my friend with the Zune has begged to trade with me. NO WAY! He updated his Zune and now it won't play due to the sorry software on it. Anyway, Sony did it right with this player!

<Title>Buy This Product - No, I'm Not A Corporate Shill
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sony FINALLY scuttled its abysmal propietary SonicStage interface.  FINALLY.  That is the first observation anyone familiar with their older players will make.  I had long wanted Sony quality, but was unwilling to grit my teeth and use the horrendous software Sony mandated. The whole tactic smacked of Microsoft.   That software is gone, so I purchased this without hesitation immediately.  This player is MTP, meaning you plug it in, it appears like a hard drive, you drag and drop files. It supports all the usual playback options, sorting by Artist, etc., but also lets you sort, view, and play by FOLDERS.  This simple but highly useful feature is not available on Sansa, Creative, etc. players.  I put my audio books in one folder, lectures another, music another, and have subfolders for artist/album.  On most other players, they all get jumpled into one heap, and if the ID3 tags aren't perfect (frequently the case with downloaded music), you have a mess on your hands no matter how perfect the interface.  Being able to switch to folder view in certain situations is a VERY useful feature I am amazed so many manufacturers neglect.  Everything else is what you have come to expect from Sony, especially the:  Breathtaking sound quality.  I cannot overstate this point.  I listened to 2-Pac, Enya, Louis Armstrong, Sinatra, Britney Spears. . .songs that sound somewhat flat on other players have life on this one.  The bass resounds for Tupac, Enya's high notes really resonate, you can hear the horns in Louis. I do not have an audiophile's ear, and was very surprised that I noticed such a profound difference in sound. I have owned Creative, Sansa, and a few other players (no I-Pod because I won't tolerate I-tunes any more than Sonic).  This player has FAR & AWAY the best sound I have ever heard on an MP3 player.  In part this is because Sony spent the extra few bucks on some great, space-age-looking headphones (the ones that arrived with every other player I ordered were a joke, and thrown out).  But when I run this player through my Alpine car unit with a plug-in headphone jack (I have MB Quart Speakers), it sounds noticbly better than other players.  Clearly, Sony has learned something about the electronic guts of music players that other, primarily computer, manufacturers have not.  It just makes sense: do you buy your MP3 music player from a computer maker like Apple, or a company that has been producing high quaity audio equipment for decades?  The interface is the easiest I've seen, the three button format allows you to truly browse like a web browser, going back or forward. The player is remarkably small, much smaller than comparable products, and constructed with pleasing, subtle aesthetics.  The screen is clear, bright, very readable.   Cons:  My 8 GB player has 7.3 GB usable space, there is always some loss, but this was very significant. No extra memory card, so buy a big one. Proprietary connector (USB to Proprietary), meaning gougathon on cable replacements, and when travelling, another cable to add to the pile. Wouldn't it be great if companies stopped this, and a single cigarette-lighter adapter and USB cable allowed you to operate ALL your devices.  Too much to hope for, I'm sure, but a company that did this would earn many converts. Flowing text on screen is somewhat slow, cannot find way to speed up, but I do read fast.   These are pretty serious cons, but they are dwarfed by the exceptional sound quality and easy navigation of this player.   I'm generally not a fan of corporations, but I have bought Sony products for years and have NEVER gotten anything that wasn't outstanding.   This is a pretty glowing review, and I have to reiterate the fact that I am not some corporate shill. I didn't bother writing scathing reviews of Sansa and Creative products due to time, but this is such an impressive product I hopped online to spread the word.   I can't speak about the features of I-Pod, but I know this sounds better. Much better. Tried it side by side with my buddy's with the exact same files. Not even a contest.   Simply put:  buy this player.  Any minor shortcomings in features will be FAR outweighed by the ridiculous sound quality.

<Title>hot tunes!
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So I am not going to provide a technical-intensive review of this player, BUT I do want to share that I just received my player in the mail today and I am thrilled with my purchasing decision.  The player sounds fantastic, the userface is uber intuitive and nicely organized, drag and drop data transfers are thee bomb!, and the player is solidly made-- it looks and feels great.  And I also purchased the hard, clear case for it, which I initially found to be pricey at $27.99 at my local SonyStyle store, but I am now very happy with it.  It'll be perfect for my runs.  I bought this player with the priority of enjoying my music; the video function is definitely secondary for me, and an fm tuner and audio recorder I decided weren't essential.  I'm ecstatic with my selection.

<Title>Fantastic MP3/Video Player
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sorry Amazon i orederd directly from SonyStyle to get the Silver.First Impressions out of the box. Very stylish and sleek.  Easy to use...I turned it on plugged it into my USB port and synced with Rhapsody to go.  The sound quality will blow you away.  I have/had the Sansa View, E280, and ipod Nano.  Playing music through this just feels solid.  The ear buds are very nice.  This is my first experience with Sony ear buds and was a little confused at first with length of the cord for the left ear bud being shorter than the right.  One call to Sony tech support and problem solved.  Tech support was very friendly and prompt and even followed up with an email pertaining to my problem.  I would definitely reccomend this to everyone.

<Title>This Walkman Simply ROCKS!
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>WOW.  This player simply handles music superbly well and just ROCKS!!!  Before getting this player, I originally was going to get either the iPod Touch or the Samsung YP-P2, from my dying 4G iPod and insufficient 1G 1GB Nano.  The touch interfaces are pretty cool, but eventually thought that they were ultimately a gimmick and also provided no tactile controls.  Plus, excellent sound quality is a top priority for me, and then cost.  Before I made up my mind to spring for the YP-P2 for it's above average sound quality versus the Touch on Amazon, I came across the Sony Walkman NWZ-A818 which won a CNET Editor's Choice for it's excellent sound quality and bundles of features.  After reading CNET's review, I became a member of AtracLife forums and read almost all of the reviews for this player.  Sony has always made quality players with superb sound quality, but software packaging always marred the overall user experience and package.  However, I learned that this Sony, the NWZ-A818, no longer supports the notoriously horrid SonicStage and thus the ATRAC format. Rather, the player supports Drag & Drop and MPT, which users will be able to sync and use the player with Windows Media Player, and music formats of WMA, ACC, MP3, and WAV.  I have always been a fan of iTunes and it's excellent integration with iPods.  Before the iPod, I had a Rio Karma, which I still miss today because of it's excellent sound quality.  After the Karma came the 4G iPod, and then the 1G iPod nano.  I have always thought the iPod's sound quality lacked something, a particular enveloping warm sound and low levels of bass. (I highly disregard the iPod's EQ, but bass reproduction is certainly biased with ok to good sound with the use of Sony's MDR-EX51 or Vmoda bass freq, or so I thought until I got the Sony A818)  Then came this Sony NWZ-A818.  I simply cannot emphasize how excellent the sound quality of this player is, so I'm certainly not biased in anyway in giving high praises for this Sony Walkman.  I listen to a variety of music genres, but my love is for EDM genres such as trance, dance, or drum & bass.  Sound quality is of a high caliber on the flat settings.  I'm listing to the player as of writing this review.  I have the volume on a relatively low level, at 10/30, and the sound is very well balanced.  The treble and bass are very well defined and correlate together perfectly in harmony.  And then there are the multiple options of boosting the sound even further with two custom equalizers (5-band parameter settings) along with other presets and other 'surround sound' (most noteable is the Matrix setting).  Not to mention that it comes with Clear Stereo, proprietary DSEE (sound enhancer for high bitrate files), and dynamic normalizer, which all work well. As a bonus, Sony included $70 MDR-082 earbuds, which are one of the best balanced earbuds I have owned.  The player above all simply works great right out of the box, with no hassle of purchasing better earbuds.  Many user reviews for the sound quality of the NWZ-A818 are certainly not kidding (such as the excellent reviews from "S. Su" or "Wookalia 'Wookalia'").  It really doesn't surprise me since Sony and sound quality really come hand in hand since they have nearly 2 decades of sound expertise from their original Walkman.  You will really appreciate the sound quality of this player, especially coming from the iPod line. Sound is crisp, warm, and enveloping, which is just simply bliss. Classical music sounds clear, so well defined that you can hear all the ranges.  Enya never sounded better.  Sound reproduction of her work is so good that she seems to be literally standing in front of you and you can visualize the movement of lips singing. From what I hear, the treble is very crisp and detailed.  With bass on the flat settings, it is clear and defined.  It doesn't have the low quality muffled sound that degenerates the treble.  I have to be honest and say that I'm a basshead. The "Clear Bass" of up to +3 definitely cures any of my cravings for pounding bass, and the name is very appropriate... the bass really is clear and not muffled.  It is deep, defined, and and gives off a very nice punch.  Bass heavy tracks are just simply amazing. Kanye's work is very punchy but not overwhelming so that you can't hear the treble, in another words well balanced and you won't be fatigued with long listening periods of bass intense tracks (on flat settings). Tracks from the more electronic genres such as Tiesto, Trentemoller, Armin, or Diesel boy simply makes my head spin with joy.  Apart from sound quality, the excellent user interface is logical and fast to find songs.  A 35 hour battery life is just stunning for such a thin package.  I got a polycarbonate hard clear case for this model and it's still thin at 14mm (which i prefer over the original player of 9mm).  How thin is too thin? Probably when Apple comes out with the iPod Pico, that is literally paper thin and has 1 hour of battery life, considering the rate that each phase of the nano is going haha ;).  Pictures and Videos look excellent, but I rather save the memory for of course music ;).  Sony is also coming out with Media Manager for Walkman soon, which is a software that will offer even tighter integration with music files (hopefully gapless) and conversion of various files.  One downer though about this player (at its current firmware) is that it does not support on the fly playlist creation and rating songs.  I am quite sure sony will address this issue with future firmware updates, since the NW-A808 (a European sibling of the NWZ-A818) supported playlist creation and rating of songs on the player.  I can live without these features missing at the moment, since my music library consists of 106 GB and playlists can be transferred quickly from iTunes to Windows Media Player and then synced to the player.  All in all, I am extremely happy with the purchase of this player, and quite frankly will probably not go back to the iPod line until Apple does something about it's sound quality (such as a custom EQ), which will probably be never since I have been waiting for that feature since the 4G.  It is VERY VERY ironic since they can create such a fantastic User Interface and OSx on the iPod Touch but not create a much more simpler program such as user defined EQ?  Ultimately, the build quality, sound quality, user interface, and other unique features of this Sony NWZ-A818 most definitely outweigh any of the player's cons. I'm very confident that true music lovers and audiophiles will not be disappointed with this player :D.  [EDIT]  After owning this player for about a week, it's really amazing what this player can do.  Not to kid, but the player actually has breathed new life in my older songs.  For instance, the bundle of the player and the MDR earbuds enable me to hear subtle background noises with great clarity, such as the ping of a music triangle. Seal's new album "System" just sounded wonderful.  I was listening to the player in the library at a low volume of 6/30 and even at this low level, the music is still VERY WELL defined.  I do use the dynamic normalizer on the player and the sound image (at flat settings) is just amazing!  To me all ranges of the treble, mid, and bass are just perfectly balanced.  Or rather, this player really enables you to truly listen to what the artist originally recorded. Perhaps it was the significant upgrade of the MDR-EX51 to the MDX-EX082, as headphones do make a huge difference in sound quality, but i did a sound comparison of my 4G iPod and this Sony.  With the Sony stock earbuds, i hooked it up to the iPod and played "I can't get no satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones.  Volume was at 50% and sound definition was good. But lower than 50%, i started to lose the sound definition.  What is interesting though was that the Sony at a volume of 10/30 matches the volume level of the iPod at 50% approximately. Of course the Sony sounded much better, sound was definitely warmer and more defined in all ranges.  Even at a lower volume on the Sony, say 5/30, the sound retained the track's definition but at a lower decibel. I can definitely see why this player got the CNET's Editor's choice, this player really makes me appreciate the artist's work!

<Content>I recently purchased this player on the strength of the glowing reviews I read and with some wishful thinking that Sony had at last removed its proprietary limits.   It IS a good player, but I discovered it would not work with Rhapsody to Go.  Both Sony and Rhapsody confirmed this.  Before buying, verify that it will work with the subscription service you plan to use with it.   I will reluctantly  return my Walkman to Amazon.

This passes all the teste with flying colors.  I use a Mac, and the drag-n-drop features work flawlessly.  The sound is dynamic whether I'm using the stock phones (pretty darn good ones) or plugging it into my car stereo. I listen primarily to Americana/bluegrass and West Coast blues and it handles low and high range just fine.  My only gripe and the reason for no 5th star is the proprietary cable (no std USB), but that's a minor complaint. This is a superior MP3 player and I plan to get plenty of use from it.

<Title>so much better then my old I-Pod
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My old ipod fell apart a few weeks ago and the search was on for a new mp3 player, I was thinking about a zune, because i bought one for my wife and actually liked it, but didn't want her music on my player and visa versa.  So I stumbled upon this little thing.  Why sony is not promoting this mp3 player better is beyond me. now that i've had it for about 2 weeks now and have everything on it like, photos and music, I know without a doubt this was the best choice for me. fits in my pocket perfectly my old 30 gig ipod was a little uncomfortable. The sound quality is amazing.  the battery life is insanely long, photo resolution is crisp and clean. I like being able to zoom in close on a cd and show my friends what i'm listening to if they like it.  I can't see myself ever going back to apple.  Sony had let me down a few times in the past but this was a nice suprise and a first step at them regaining some confidence in me and buying there products again.  I hope in time they make some models with my space, but I can live with the 8 gig for now, and like a few other people have said, the cord, it needs to be about 3-6 inches longer and that's it, i'm 5' 10" and at the gym it tends to tug on my ear and that is about the only complaint I have about this little wonder.  If you are contemplating an 8 gig mp3 player and can't decide between apple,microsoft or Sony,  Sony have jumped into my number 1 spot followed by my wifes zune. you absolutely can't go wrong with this machine.  buy it.  glad I did.

<Content>I've been looking for an MP3 player good enough to listen to classical music on, and this one fills the bill. Wish it had 16G, but I can live with 8. It sounds great, has an intuitive user interface, seems solidly built, and has good battery life. The video sample looked sharp although I don't plan to use it for video. I looked at one or the other Cowan players for a long time - but it's sort of nice to be able to buy from a company that actually does user support.

<Title>FANTASTIC mp3 player.....
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK.... let me start out by saying that I am an active musician.  I have been playing the guitar for 7+ years and I am currently involved in recording my own music professionally.  I really appreciate excellent sound quality when it comes to digital music recordings..... and OH MY does this SONY WALKMAN sound fantastic.  It is with out a doubt the best sounding mp3 player I have ever heard.  When I listen to music at home I use my studio recording headphones by Beyerdynamic-- they cost me 200 dollars at guitar center.  The included earbuds are the best sounding buds ever paired with an mp3 player in their box.  SONY WINS.  Pros: Excellent sound quality Great UI Fantastic earbuds Strong physical build quality---- metal, glass screen MTP device (no itunes or stupid software to transfer files) I have only had this for 1 day, but have been using for at least 10 hours--the battery life is excellent--- rated at 33 hours continuous music  Cons: No on the fly playlist creating Proprietary usb cable Can't change the background to a picture of your own   The PROS of the SONY WALKMAN greatly out weigh the cons, those of which are not a huge issue.  I have purchased and returned 2 mp3 players before I settled on this SONY.  I bought a Zune 8 gb, had problems with my computer with the ****** Zune sofeware. Returned it.  Then I bought a Samsung YP-2P.  The Samsung was an excellent mp3, good sound quality and the touch interface was awesome.  However, I could not find a protective case for it anyware online or instore as it is fairly new.  Also, it was quite expensie for only 4gb at 200 dollars.  Returned it.  Read some reviews on C-net about this sony walkman... and what do you know--- it won a c-net editor's choice award.  So I bought it from Amazon with 2-day shipping and Amazon was so awesome I received it the next day!  How cool is that?   Get the Sony Walkman, you won't be disappointed

<Title>Sony Finally Hits a Homerun!!
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am stunned at how great this player is... On my quest to find the least crappy mp3 player, I considered a Zune 8g (small screen w/ thick black border wtf??, poor battery, limiting zune software), Meizu (poor USA CS, QC issues, stuttering tracks problem) and ZEN(plastic-ky, buggy, unstable firmware), Clix2(expensive, D-click issues) Sansa View (big, ugly, cheesy GUI), to name a few and all had deal breaking faults. This player is as close to perfect as you can currently get (received CNET editors choice award)  First off, this player much tinier and slimmer than i expected; think a slightly wider 2nd gen nano with a gigantic screen.  Initially i thought the players design looked busy and old, but this is not so once you see it in person. The pictures really don't do it justice. btw I have the silver version and it is super sexy.   PROS: Metal case, very sturdy and well built. Firmware is very stable, from what i have experienced so far. (I don't have to hope and pray that the manufacturer will fix my players stability issues with firmware updates ala the ZEN) Sound is amazing, tons of sound processing features and customizable eq ( VPT, DSEE, built in dynamic normalizer, Clear Stereo, EQ) Im now appreciating my collection like never before.   Video is sharp and smooth. Battery life is excellent, i haven't done a formal test, but its rated at almost double of what everyone else is offering.  Easy to navigate, very intuitive. GUI is clean and chic.  Drag and drop anything into it with windows explorer, syncs with WMP 11, except the vids (mp4) which WMP doesnt recognize... not Sony's fault, maybe im doing something wrong. (Anxious to try Sony's yet to be released media manager for walkman which will include built in podcasting)  Remembers last position of whatever your watching/listening to, can even switch between vids and music without losing your place. (no bookmarks though)  The headphones really are exceptional.  Search your collection by artist, album or song, using the alphabet (shocking) Song info displayed continuously at bottom of screen no matter what screen youre looking at.  Now playing page, displays song, album art, artist, album genre and year. You can select any one of these to view all the songs in that category.  Can browse folders in player (but cant delete or rename) Player feels great in your hand, comfortable and easy to use. buttons laid out well, volume on the side. although it feels the Back button should of been in the place of Option.  REAL CONS: No FM, No voice recorder, Memory not expandable. Shuffle options are limited: only Shuffle all & Time Machine shuffle (plays all songs in a randomly chosen year).  No gapless playback. Proprietary cable connection, although on the upside it has an automatic flap that prevents dust and dirt sullying the connector, so its practical and makes the player sleeker (no plastic usb mini connector flapping around)  NITPICKING: Can't set background photo. Only two screensavers: blank and clock display. Can't change themes, font, or color of menus. Cant create or modify playlists in-player, must be imported.  Limited vid format support, basically same as ipods sans mov. No included  video converter, must use third party. There are a few free options, I use Super(c), its not really super but it gets the job done.   Annoyingly slow title scrolling (someone mentioned in another review) and slow fastforwarding/rewinding. You expect it to accelerate the longer you hold the forward/back arrow but it doesnt.  This will be a big problem trying to fast forward through a 3 hour movie. **EDIT: Please see D. Sun's Comment on this. My mistake, thanks D. Sun**   No indicator light to show its on, or light around the buttons, the screen just flashes the time every few seconds. (not sure if these are pros or cons)  Chintzy Hold button in inconvenient location. Pressing any button with hold disabled while it's off, turns the player on (potential for inadvertently turning it on; again good and bad).   FINAL THOUGHTS: I almost completely overlooked this player due to all of the hype surrounding other players, and Sony's historically poor selection of mp3, i mean ATRAC players.    This has to be not only the best overall flash mp3 player on the market, but considering build quality, and brand name the best valued player. Even though Sony omitted some "extra" features, there are absolutely no problems that I have to "live with" or "just get used to".   Also I think Sony made some smart cost cutting decisions and emphasized quality where it counts, and price. (Box isn't fancy like the zune's or ipod's, just cheap cardboard in a plain blister pack, no lanyard, no pouch) Sony finally woke up made an outstanding player.   Again let me reiterate it's much, much better looking in person.

<Title>Astounding!
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Absolutely love it! I got a 2GB White one in September.  I got it in Sonystyle store before it became available in other stores. I was disappointed by the design when I first looked at the pictures online. However, once I got to see the real product, I bought it right away. The design is way better than iPod in my opinion. I've had iPod, but I was so disappointed by the quality and battery life. I've been a loyal Sony fan, and never had any problem with all Sony electronic products that I have.   This time, the new Sony MP3 has not disappoint me at all, the price is reasonable, design is great, battery life is just unbeatable. The only problem is that its software (now it uses WMP 11) is still too far to catch up with great software iTune. However, since it allows you to just drag and drop files into the device as a hardware shown on "my computer", we don't really have to bother using software at all, which solves the problem with awkward software. The screen may be a little too small, but the video quality is absolute great!  Also, I am pleased with Sony. In fact, I got this player before its official release to electronic stores, and the price was $20 higher. Once this is officially sold on every electronic outlets, Sony immediately refund $20 to my credit card account. If I did not see the refund, I probably won't even notice the price change.   Even though iPod is going strong, I still believe in Sony, and wish they can come up with more innovative functions, stunning designs and superb quality!  Definitely recommend this to everyone!

<Title>Bull's Eye - finally - Sony's drag and drop - best sound quality MP3 player
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having owned many MP3 players of all makes and sizes - for many years - I have finally found something that tops the charts.  The screen is beautiful, easy to read, easy to load music (no software required), great battery life, and most importantly - amazing audio quality. No playlists on the fly but I can live with that - given it is so easy to navigate. Kudos to Sony.

<Title>Very Pleased.
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like this product. The other reviews are correct. The sound is amazing. I had an IPOD for 3 years. That was fine but I wanted to try another type of MP3 player. I don't use the earphones it came with because I had Sony earphones that I love.  I find 8GB is more than enough for me. I listen to the same stuff over and over. :) And I am happy with the size.  I can fit it in my pockets just fine or a tiny purse. I bought the clear case cause I have butterfingers. But the MP3 player seemed sturdy enough without it. But I don't want to take that chance. :) Actually, I am using it right now.  It is extremely easy to use. I just drop my mp3s and go on my way. Since I had the Ipod, I had a wall adapter. I switch the IPod cord with the Sony cord plugged the USB end into the adapter. And there you go. Wall charger!!! The battery life is great. If I am running low, it could take an hour or so to fully charge using the wall adapter. I haven't used my computer to do a complete charge. It is great for my needs. Great sound, good size, its not too heavy with the clear case. Life is good. :)

<Title>It's Crazy good!!
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The title says it all. Sony has always made great portable audio, with their full rich sound Sig. Now you can have your cake and eat it too, no more sonic stage!! Really, just like the other fine folks, I have owned many daps- cowon, samsung, apple, zune, iriver, creative, rio, meizu, toshiba, kenwood ect. ect. I just have to say this little unit is the best at reproducing full , detailed rich sound. It is incredible with shure e500's, the warmth and soundstage is second to none. The unit is easy to use, the screen is top notch, and the unit is dead sexy and built like a high-end piece of kit.  I also echo the awesome battery performance, and don't let the 5mw output fool you, this baby has enough power to drive some full size cans. I'm a musician too and are super picky about my audio, and I can't stress how good this little unit sounds. I actually had the japanese model "nw a808", but sold it to get the non sonic stage model. The Japanese unit had some extra settings like "on the go" playlisting and a "favorite" shuffle setting plus some other extras. I hope sony adds these to the a818 in a future firmware release.   Even on Head-Fi people are praising it's sound and that says alot, you have some hardcore users there :) One member said he was going to buy another a818 as back-up because he said he couldn't bear to live without it if he lost or broke his. Bottom line, BUY IT!! and sony please release some higher capacity models.  Just wanted to mention a couple of more things, I really like how the "door" on the usb port is spring loaded and snaps back in place to prevent dust and debris from entering the player- Nice! Also even though I am kind of a purest when it comes to sound enhancements, the ones on the a818 are pretty amazing and don't seem to add distortion or coloration to the audio signal. "DSEE" really seems to boost the highs on low bitrate mp3 files, and smooth them out.  "Clear stereo" also seems to make the seperation of channels more distinct, resulting in a wider soundstage, very subtle indeed, but nice. "Clear bass" does a fantastic job of boosting the very low end while bringing in no distortion to the bass, resulting in "feeling the low end " but also keeping a the detail. A fender jazz sounds like it should, and a rickenbacker sounds just like it should:) None of that mushyness you used to get with the old "mega bass"   Since I use high bitrate files, I don't use the dsee, but I do use the clear stereo and clear bass quite a bit. The 5 band eq is competent and more than you get on a zune or ipod :) I must say though even without eq you get the full range of the audio spectrum. There is no bass roll-off as there is in other players- ipod, cough cough. So you get a much fuller and "blended" sound not tinny or harsh.   There are many mediocre daps out there, thats why I think when a gem like this comes around so many people want to share their experiance (with some very detailed reviews!) with others. Music is a magical thing and it's great to have something so small, yet awesome to play it on.   One last thing, sony makes premium stuff usually with premium prices. The a818 is priced less than the inferior zune flash or ipod nano. If you take your music seriously or you just love awesome gadgets, then a purchase of the sony nw a818 is mandatory!!! peace out!

<Title>Great Flash Player
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my new Sony NWZ-A818 for three weeks now and so  far I am pretty impressed. I had a Samsung YP-T9 4 gig, so  as far as I was concerned the Sony had some big shoes to fill.  For starters, the build quality. It really is a step above all the competition. It is all metal, cool to the touch, and weighty for such a small device. The screen is very detailed.  If you watch the included Spider Man 3 demo, you'll know  what I mean.   The sound quality really is special. I'm hearing songs properly  for the first time. There are lots of tweaks for EQ, including  two custom settings.  Caveats are few. There is no FM tuner(I don't care). The sound  doesn't get quite as loud as I would like on some songs, and the battery   life is not approaching the 33-35 hours CNET got(probably because I have it maxed out constantly). Oh, and I am having  problems getting used to the cord hanging next to my neck, where it sticks sometimes while working out(probably a personal issue).  All in all, this is a nice improvement on the Samsung. I am very pleased.

<Title>Amazing bass and price and quality. Better than ipods
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Absolutly amazing I just got this on Christmas Day. I was Really amazed how many functions it had compared to the Ipod. After seeing and hearing this the ipods are junk unless you want alot of memory. Other than that this thing has a alot more technology but i think youve got the point after what it says on the top. Well it comes with 80 dollar headphones in case you didnt know and the bass and quality is just amazing. Its an unatural feeling when you think your whole head is shaking but its not. Another thing its nice really nice shiny not scratchable like the ipods. Also it has amazing battery 33 hours and its true it last me 2 weeks without charging it. Basiclly its get this than an ipod it will be worth you money and they wont dont get stuck like them too becuase of the fast prossesor they have. I highly recommend.

<Title>NOT A VIDEO PLAYER!!!
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for Christmas. I did a lot of shopping and it seemed like the perfect thing based on my needs (I have a lot of MP3s and WMAs on my computer). As an added bonus it claims it is a video player, not happening. Go ahead and try to put a video on this thing (and explain in detail how you did it). I have tried converting files to MPEG4 from AVI & WMV (basically because the thing came with a Spiderman 3 trailer and it is an MP4) , no luck. I even downloaded a TV show from itunes thinking perhaps that would work better then my home made movies. Obviously that didn't work (but I really liked that Bugs Bunny cartoon about baseball). Well I visited the sony site (sonystyle) and it seems that the only thing that they had in mind for this thing to play ...is movie trailers. Why in the heck do these people think that I am going to carry around a commercial? Bad move Sony. This could have been an ipod killer (it easily sounds SOOOO much better and is easier to use). But the video thing is pathetic. I was looking forward to watching a few cartoons on my little 2 inch screen for laughs & I guess I should have got that dumb ipod huh? Did I mention how nice the music sounds?

<Title>Great device, Sony-proprietary USB cable
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Reading the glowing reviews here, convinced me that the proprietary Sony of old had finally learned its lesson, with improved user interface (the Minidisc interface was horrendous), and no proprietary music management software (the SonicStage software effectively ruined the Minidisc). The machine itself is a joy to use, the sound quality is great, and the battery life is astounding.  But then a throwback to Sony's proprietary ways reasserted itself - the USB cable, which is also used to charge the device. It is Sony-specific, which means that the device can only be loaded and charged from a PC with the Sony cable attached. So, unless you buy extra cables (I don't know if there an power adapter available), you are effectively grounded to the one PC. For me, given Sony's history, this restriction was reason enough to return the unit. Shame, because it has the makings of an iPod-killer.

<Title>Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this MP3 player based on other reviews on this site and have not been disappointed. The sound is concert-hall quality (try Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" if you haven't already), but the main reason I bought it was to download free audiobooks from my library's website. The audiobooks on the library website can't be put on IPods but will work with other MP3 players.   My only unfulfilled desire is to be able to fast forward within a single song or section of an audiobook. I imagine this is a pretty advanced feature and there may not be an MP3 player out there that can do it, but it would allow me to switch between listening to a book to listening to music without losing my place in the book.  Other reviewers complained that 8GB wasn't as large as they would like, but I've got (2) 9-hour books and about 50 songs on it and have only used a fraction of a gigabyte. I guess movies eat up a lot more space but I'm not planning to put any video on it (the screen is a decent size for an MP3 player but it's still pretty small and my eyes are over 50:-)) I'm not super technically inclined and it was relatively easy to get set up and download content. I heartily recommend this player.

<Title>Will not dissapoint you!
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This mp3 player is very  Transferring Song - Transferring songs is easy if you know what your doing. The first time i synced my mp3 player it tried to sync all the media i had. But after i adjusted the sync options, it was very easy. And the good news is that the only thing you need to transfer songs is windows media player! Thank you sony! You can also just drag music into your player(for you less advaned users =D).  Sound quality - Amazing! This is the best thing about the player! If your a sound quality nerd, this is the player for you. Theres a lot of EQ options, and sound enhacers. If you mess aroung with the player a little while, your shure to find the perfect sound for you.  Video quality - Videos look fantastic on this, and so do pictures for that matter. I wanted a player that did everything, and i was not dissapointed. Also, for all you people who say you cant get videos on this thing, you most certainly can! Al you need to do is use (Jodix Free iPod Video Converter). There you go!   Durabilty - The player seems to be very durable. The body is metal and will certainly last. The screens seems pretty good, but i've got mild OCD, so for most people it will probably be perfect. While im on the topic, i also bought the sexy leather case sony offers. Check out my review on it.  Extra informatiom - The funtionality of the player is very easy. The actual capacity of the player is 7.3G. The supplied headphones are excellent, but might be a liitle short for some people. All in all the player is excellent, and most people will love it! Add it to your cart!

<Title>Fantastic MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this MP3 Player for Christmas and so far its been great.  The Player comes with these new style headphone, a bit funky to start with but you soon get used to them.  Sound quality is fantastic and is one of the major selling points for the Player.  Navigation is so simple, you really dont need the instructions.  The graphics are great, everything you would expect in a Sony style.  I guess some points to pull it up on are: 1.  The new Sony software to manage music is basic to say the least, use Windows Media Player (as is recommended) or just use the player as a usb drive. 2.  The video has to be of a certain format, i used one of the free utilities on the net, but its a shame Sony cant help us out!  But to be honest, there arent really any negative points.  This MP3 Player is exactly what you expect from Sony, a quality product with superb sound.  Its also a nice change from the iPod!

<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this mp3 player as a backup right after my old mp3 player broke. I was just going to use this mp3 player for a few weeks before getting an actual real mp3 player...but ive had it for a couple of months, and i think im just going to keep on using it!  I love this tiny mp3 player because of the battery life. The battery life is AMAZING...I rarely experience that stressful feeling you get before you go out to go somewhere, and you see that your mp3 is low on battery. And if you charge it for a little bit, it lasts for a sufficient amount of time.   But one thing is that it only comes with the cord that charges the mp3 from the computer. They sell the outlet charger separate. And also, i only use this for music. I rarely use this for movies/pictures...etc. so if you want to use this mp3 player for pictures/movies and other tools, you should look into others.   Since this is so tiny and light, I use it ALL the time when i go running or to the gym. You can easily put it in a pocket, or they sell those running arm bands  For music, this is one of the best mp3s out there!

<Title>CUTE!  VERY, VERY CUTE!  :-)
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>PRO: It's small, very light weight and most importantly, easy to operate.  Drag and drop files are easier than cooking a TG meal, however, not sure why as a few (mp3) refused to transfer over to the player.  If you run into such problem with any ipod/mp3 player, DL a converter software to fix those particular audio mp3 files.  You shouldn't have a problem after that with transferring.  CON: I know accessory no. 1 would have been great if it was included...a "Protective cloth".  I have no choice but to wait for my "case" to arrive and more $$$ for the ac adapter?    UNSURE: I can't speak on battery life yet, since I haven't used it for more than a few hours.  OVERALL!  YOU'LL LIKE IT, IF NOT LOVE IT!

<Title>Outstanding!
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Excellent performance, easy to use, very small unit, probably smaller than an IPOD.  The sound is outstanding because of the ear buds that come with it.  I hear notes that I have not heard before.  Easy to load with music, works every time.  Intuitive enough that instructions are not really needed, but they are available in pdf form on an included disk.  The earbuds come with an extension which is normally used all the time.  The value of the extension is that if the ear buds get tangled, pulling the cord into two pieces makes it easier to untangle.  Another feature not often mentioned is that the right ear but has a longer line and the left ear bud has a shorter line.  This makes it easier to tell which is L and R without having to look for little bitty print.  Got one for myself and my wife.  Has made a believer of my wife, who has never liked to use earphones in the past.

The low frequencies are actually there, sounding as they should sound, and the higher ones don't resemble tin cans vibrating. Sony go for it!!!: If you manufacture a 160g mp3 player with this sound quality in the spirit of the Walkman Professional cassette player of the 80's, you will win all music lovers over, who will wonder "Steve Jobs who?"

<Title>UPDATED: Something to add about transferring media...
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I agree with all the positive reviews.  I think this is a great player.  I want to specifically address transferring media because I don't see alot of mention in the reviews.  For transferring music, WMP 11 works awesome.  If the music files are unprotected, they transfer lightning fast (about 1 to 1.5 seconds per song).  If they are protected, they transfer a little bit slower but have no trouble playing (I transferred some songs I bought from Wal-Mart download service).  It copies album art and all the tag info from WMP 11 with the files.  For photos I personally did not think that WMP 11 did a good job getting the photos onto the player.  It copies the files in the same folder hierarchy as they are on your system which may be a problem because for photos the player only recognizes files one (or two?) folders deep.  It also does not resize the photos and many thumbnails did not show up on the player.  For photos, I recommend downloading the "Sony Media Manager for Walkman 1.1" from the website.  It works great and all your photos will be copied to the player in the correct format, with thumbnails.  Sony Media Manager also works great for copying the music to the player, but I like using WMP 11 better for music since all my playlists, etc. are there.  I have yet to successfully get any of my (old) videos to play on the player.  They are mostly .mpg and I can't figure out how to convert them (or what format to convert them to [says .mp4 in manual]).  I haven't tried very hard though because I don't care about videos on my Walkman.  It would be kind of kool to figure out how to correctly convert my old videos so they would work though.  UPDATE:  I purchased the PRO version of the Media Manager for Walkman 1.1 online for $12.95 and ALL of my videos were converted and transferred to the Walkman perfectly.  Unless you are smart with converting different video formats and already have conversion software, I recommend the upgrade.

<Title>Great Quality MP3 Player.
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a lot of shopping after my Creative Zen Vision:M screen cracked. This player was under the radar, and if it wasn't for amazon, I wouldn't have found this beauty. It is very small in size compared to my older MP3 players. I like the flash memory because it allows me to exercise while using it. 8GB is plenty for me, I have all my MP3's and WMA's on it (About 1500, encoded from 128-320kbps) which is excellent. The sound quality is incredible. There are so many different options that can be turned on to enhance the sound. In addition, the included earbuds sound spectacular, much better than any included headphones I've ever used before. The navigation is solid - I like all the tactile buttons, instead of touch surfaces you get on ipods. I've seen complaints about the hold button being on the back, but it really doesn't bother me. And it is a little difficult to get video onto the player, but then again, this is an MP3 player. It excels at what it was designed for. It is also a steal - I got mine on Amazon in late November for $163. I highly recommend this gem to anyone in the market for a flash-based player. It is a Nano killer.

<Title>WOW!! It's a Sony!
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for Christmas from my wife ( OK - I ordered it, 'cause she doesn't know much about this stuff ), and I'm blown away by the quality and ease of use. I still have my Dell DJ20 which works fine except not with Vista and I plan to keep it to use while I'm working in the yard, but this Sony is hands down a great player. I was able to transfer my entire music drive to it in about 12 minutes using drag & drop, and the sync function in WMP11 works flawlessly which in itself is saying something with Windows. The only thing so far is the fact that the player's so small and seemingly delicate. I ordered the silicone case set and may decide on the hard case because I travel a lot and I don't want inadvertent damage on the plane or while the security gorillas are pawing through my bag. The music quality is, to me, just fine. I have an eclectic mix of oldies and rock -- no constant moronic "bump-bump" of rap  and no classical so I find the tonal ranges and presets to be just fine.    Also, I have my own set of Shure noise-canceling earbuds so I probably won't ever use the included set although they look fine and have several size options. My greatest joy is not being chained to a certain manufacturer's ideas of what can and can't be played on my own system for my own enjoyment. Thanks, Sony, for a quality device that actually works without Big Brother's interference.

<Title>Best Bang for your Buck
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had been looking at the iPod Touch for my new mp3 player, but I was unwilling to shell out $300 for one.  I had seen the Sony mp3 player at a store in Vegas, and after doing some research and reading reviews, I was completely sold.  After getting my mp3 player, it took me about 5 minutes to get everything set up and have my music downloading.  It's great to be able to use Windows Media Player to download my music since that's what I use to listen to it, and the earphones that the Sony came with are great - ones like that usually retail for $70 and they were included with this amazing mp3 player.  The size is great, around the size of an iPod Nano, and the 8GB memory is perfect for me.  An easy to use interface and superior sound quality make this a no-brainer for anybody looking for a mp3 player that doesn't want to shell out the money for an iPod.  Everybody should own one of these.

<Title>Solid Performer
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sony feels solid in your hand with a chrome band around the outside and metal front and back. The buttons work well with the volume toggle on the side. The screen is sharp and vibrant.   The sound is fantastic. With EQ settings and clear bass you can customize the sound the way you like it. It is very close to my RH1 Minidisc with the Sony having more sound stage but a bit colder than the MD. The bass is extenuated more than a 1st generation Nano but the Sony outshines in overall sound quality. The provided headphones are good, but if you want that golden sound you will want to upgrade. You cannot create, alter play lists or delete songs without being jacked in to your computer. You can search by artist, album, genre ,release year, folder.   The picture viewer is good. Movie viewing on such a tiny screen require young eyes. The video looks great on the sharp screen and the DVDs have to be converted.  Battery life is good, I got an external charger to charge without USB.  Overall I am very satisfied with this player. I gave it a 4 because of the movie viewing on a tiny screen. I would recommend this player for listening to music which is what I got it for.

<Title>Great Sound Tiny package
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Walkman for about a week now and this is hands-down the best sounding portable audio unit I've every had in 20+ years of owning Walkmen. Video is crisp and clear and I like that you can change the video orientation on the fly. It's easy to use and easy to navigate the menus. To nitpick a little, the 'Hold' button is a little inconveniently placed and there is no radio built in. This last one keeps me from giving it 5 stars. If you are serious about sound quality this is the unit for you.

<Title>You can stop browsing, and buy this one!
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you're looking for simply the best tiny MP3 player on the market, this one is it.  It's simply stunning quality and value.  First thing you notice is quality everywhere... the build of the player is much better than any competitor.  Pure elegance.  I couldn't believe the headphones bundled with the player.  They're Sony's top-of-the-line earbuds that retail for $99, and I've not seen them discounted for less than $75 anywhere.  That alone makes this player one of the best bargains around.  Sony did well with the music samples they decided to put on the player, as they really show off the quality of the sound.  Once I powered it on and played it, I'm now not too fond of the sound coming from my other larger player.  With this one, you don't have to mess with iTunes or other garbage bundled software.  You simply hook it up via USB and it looks like a hard drive on your system that you can simply drag and drop your music or videos into the proper folders.  Convert your movies using DVDFab Platinum or other software (use iPod MP4 setting), and then just drag the resulting file to the player.  It doesn't get any easier than that.  My wife stopped traffic in the airplane recently while watching movies on this thing.  She was pretty annoyed with everyone asking where to get one, so I guess that's the biggest down-side to this player.  Ha!

<Title>This player is the best!
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just got this player for Xmas and I am amazed at the quality.  The interface is exceptional. Very easy to use and navigate.  I have been an Iriver fan for the last few years and this totally beats it.  My last player was an Iriver CLix, which got a higher rating on Cnet than the Sony.  I can tell you from experience, the interface on the Iriver is not as good, it is much slower, additionally, when you turn on the Sony, it starts up immediately; th Clix took some time to load.  Additionally, the sound quality is the same if not better. I think Cnet gave it a higher rating because the Iriver has an FM tuner, voice recording and flash games.  Personally I dont need those functions, I think if Iriver did not have those three options the Sony would have been rated higher.  My wife has an Ipod, the sound on hers doesnt even come close.  The Sony has an option to have two customizable EQ's, which in my book is key.  You can easily switch between EQ setting while in the song my pressing the option button which brings a drop down menu to get into your settings. Also, another very key point is the drag and drop option, just open windows explorer and move your files. I am now a Sony fan! Update - After owning the player for a couple of weeks, I have to say I'm truly amazed.  I just downloaded a full length movie that a converted from a dvd, and it played it beautifully.  The sound quality continues to impress me. A couple of things they should add for futore Sony players is being able to create a playlist on the fly and deleting files from the player. Also, you can only create playlists from Windows Media Player, it would be great if I could just create a playlist from explorer.

<Content>PROS --works flawlessly with Vista 64BIT even tho Sony system requirements says it won't work --sound quality --equalizer --screen quality --user interface / responsiveness --DRAG n DROP --price CONS --Proprietary connection --Wish it came with a case (no big deal, most players don't come with cases)  SUMMARY Not much I can say that is bad.  I truly love this product. I bought it based on all these reviews and it has truly lived up to the reviews.  I was a little hesitant to buy this since SONY said it wouldn't work with 64-bit Operating Systems but I thought since it is true drag and drop why wouldn't it work so I gave it a try.  Well it works flawlessly and syncing up with Windows Media Player 11 is a breeze.    My choice came down to this player or the Nano.  I made no mistake choosing this player.  Plus I couldn't turn down a deal at Circuit City that had the 4GB version for $120 -- $30 less than the 4GB nano with better ear buds and sound quality!  Giddy up!

<Title>Awesome Sound--Easy to Use
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My wife bought me this Sony as a Christmas present.  I did all the shopping and read lots of reviews (Amazon, CNet and elsewhere) before telling her that the Sony 8GB was the one.  Excellent choice Dear!!!  The first thing that I noticed about this player when I unpackaged it and got music loaded was the wonderful sound quality.  In our family, we have a Zen M 30GB (nice but too big) , an iPod mini 4GB (ok if you're an iPod fan) and my old Sansa 1GB.  The Sony blows all of them away in terms of pure sound quality and ease of use.  The ear buds that come with this unit are top-notch.  I find myself hearing subtle instrumental sounds within songs that I had not noticed before.  With the ability to simply drag & drop music and videos, this player is very easy to use and you don't need to use any special software or music services.  Navigating is very straightforward.  The buttons are just the right size and the layout is easy to remember.  I especially like the sound adjustments and enhancements on the Sony.  They allow the music to sound great whether using the buds or hooked up to the Aux. jack for the car stereo.  The 2" video screen is, of course, small, but it's very clear.  I turn everything sideways and it handles widescreen stuff perfectly.  I've had this for a few weeks now and have yet to find something that I don't like about it.

<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Have been looking for an Ipod or MP3 for several months.   Finally decided on the Sony, primarily because I wanted to load my library of CD's.  Reviews said that Sony had quality sound and ease of downloading.  You know what they were right.  It couldn't be easier.  Player looks sturdy and simple to use.  Directions helpful and almost not necessary.  I'm over 60 and not regarded as an electronic wizzard, but I was listening to music is a half hour or less.  I was a little skeptical of using earbuds, but I find them to be comfortable and sturdy.  Only negative comment might be that there's no AC adaptor, but I can live without one especially with a 33 hour battery life.  Bottom line - excellent unit.

<Content>There is much good to report on this product. Price was great. Sound/Ear phones are great. Easy to use. Two draw backs. No standard adapter plug for wall socket. That runs extra $40.00. That's a REAL negative. Also, instruction for converting Itunes is lacking. Should come with some type of converter package. Someday Sony needs to realize they are not in the electronics world all by themselves. They need to learn to play with all the other boys and girls in town. With that said, I still recommend it.

<Title>Love the Sony Walkman
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have been a fan of Sony for a long time - but was not happy with their early attempts at creating mp3 players.  I owned a Sony walkman Bean and the next generation.  The price was right but the Sony Sonic Stage software was horrendous!  Well, that is no longer an issue - this is the easiest player in the world to use.  I just use Windows Explorer to drag and drop music files onto the unit - it takes no time at all - and I am ready to go.  I also use Windows Media Player when I want to be a bit more selective and that is a breeze as well.    For me though, the 2 things that I like the best about this player are the sound quality (incredible) and the long battery life.  I travel frequently and the 30+ hours of battery life on this player means that I do not have to worry about losing my ability to play music during a flight or a workout.  Now the sound.  Some people have mentioned the great headphones that come with this unit (an they are)the only thing wrong with the headphones is the short cable but they do throw an extension cord in with them.  I use Shure headphones and I am hearing nuances in the music that I have only heard while sitting in my living room listening through studio headphones.  There is no hiss or buzz in the background - just music.  Great options for equalizer.    I am very pleased with this and look forward to the day they make one with more memory -

I put like 350 selections on it & could only get 30 or 40 to play.  What kind of stupid folder system is this????? Then I saw the SONY 818 & read its glowing reviews.  People let me tell you.  This is the real deal.  I got it about 2 days ago, and have over 1100 selections on it (many of which are album length) & all are at my fingertips. I am in heaven. It's all true.  Tremendous earphones, great bass response, etc. AND it's got video also.  I'll mess with it eventually. You cannot go wrong with this player. One more thing:  The Creative Muvo took FOREVER to transfer music: about an hour for almost 2 gigs.  The Sony 818 took about an hour for about 7 gigs, or an average of 3.5 secs./3 min. song.

I actually went to a Sony Style store and spoke with a salesperson to ensure that I could, really, transfer music to this device from I-Tunes.  I was repeatedly told that it would be no problem at all. After a frustrating several hours of playing with it, and e-mailing their on-line support center, I called customer support.  I was then told that I could not transfer files from I-Tunes, everything is copywrite protected. Back to Sony it goes tomorrow.

<Title>Awesome in every way!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Two months ago I tragically lost my great Sony NW-HD5 player which I had for a while and was working great for me. I always loved the sound quality of Sony ever since I had their walkman CD player. They are just unbeatable in this aspect. So I have done some research looking for another player that can meet my music needs. I was deciding between this player or the new Ipod nano which both had 8gbs, since there was no other player that was bigger and as good. Both were equal in so many ways including video playability and portability. I read reviews of both and finally decided on the NWZA818 because of the great reviews and my knowledge of Sony's sound.  After owning it for half a month, I am more than happy with it and can say it is amazing. It is so much easier to transfer songs into it due to a simple drag and drop function and its awesome compatibility with windows media player 11 which allows easy synchronization. I imediately was able to get all the songs that used to be in my old player into this one due to a quick transfer. Like many reviewers said, the sound is flawless and with the high quality headphones this player provides, every song sounds so beautiful, especially when you tweak the clear bass and other sound options. Also, video can be easily transfered into the player via Nero 7(which I use) that converts the video files which is just great. Pictures put into the player looks great.  Battery life is long lasting as well. All in all, this is probably the best player out there unless you have a million songs and cannot fit it into a 8gb. The player itself looks great and the size is just perfect for any pocket or bag. I recommend this player to anyone that needs a good mp3 player that can do it all.

<Title>Just a really good MP3 player
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned in order, an old iRiver 256MB AA-powered flash player, an H120 (iRiver HD 20GB player), a Creative Zen Micro (8 GB), a Creative Zen Nano (4GB) and a Creative Nano (512 MB). They've all be satisfactory for their generation (i would never use that 20GB HD iRiver now... it was huge even then!), and they served me well.  However, the Sony A818 blows them all COMPLETELY OUT OF THE WATER.   I don't know how to describe the A818 series other than to say, it is the first player out of all the ones i've owned that actually gives me pleasure using. Pleasure totally separate from the music/photos/videos it holds and plays so well. It sounds a little strange i'm sure (more than a little?) but if you own one, you'll understand what i'm talking about, there's just something about it, between the incredibly intuitive and well thought-out interface, the elegant and pocket friendly form factor, the beautiful screen, the amazing sound... it's just really well done. Did i mention Sony finally got rid of SonicStage and ATRAC? there are no restrictions WHATSOEVER on this player. i use Mediamonkey to load/edit files on it.   The only things i don't like about it are the lack of on-the-fly playlists, and the fact that altering ID3 tags for files that are ALREADY on the player is at times troublesome (nothing unusual about that for non-iPods tho). But these are insignificant in the face of all that this player does right.  I'll give you one example of Sony's attention to detail. First of all, it has a feature that's far too rare these days; the ability to browse both by ID tags (e.g. Artist, album, genre) AND by folder. On my iRivers, i got very used to folder-organization, and for some people this is crucial. However, when browsing by ID3 tag, the first initial for whatever field you're searching for is handily displayed at the top of the menu so you can quickly skip through the list. So, you use the Up and Down on the 4-way controller to go through the files as usual, but you use the Left and Right to quickly skip to different initials. I've never seen this before and it makes browsing easy and painless.  Lastly, whatever processor is in this thing is LIGHTNING fast... there is no lag whatsoever between button-press, execution and display. that was deal breaker for me on the iPod Nanos (reminded me of my terrible cellphone).  Did i mention the battery life? It's amazing, i have no idea what the  battery life is because i've never seen it dip below a full bar, and i use it for like 7-8 hours a day...   All in all, i think it's the best player on the market. iPods still have iTunes which is crucial for some people, but if you want to look outside Apple world, you're not giving up anything by stepping into Sony's.

<Title>It's all about the SOUND QUALITY.
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Why does one purchase a mp3 player?  Of course, the obvious answer is to listen to music.  I've had previous mp3 players:  I started with a 2nd gen iPod and since then I'm gone with Creative all the way.  Main reason why is because of Creative's experience in the sound card field--therefore I knew their players had to sound better than Apple.    I'll admit, I did not know about this player until it earned a CNET Editor's choice award in the digital audio field.  Because I trust their reviews, I decided to take a closer look.    After playing with the player for a few SECONDS in the SonyStyle store, I was immediately sold.  I really just don't know how to explain it... the sound quality is amazing.  I'm not a professional when it comes to audio, but I do know outstanding sound quality when I hear it.  I thought it was just the headphones (because if you do your research you'll find that these come with earbuds which sell for $70 on the SonyStyle website), but it really is the player.  I've taken the same mp3 file and played it on a 3rd generation nano, and just switched out my headphones back and forth between the apple and the sony.  There is a considerable amount of difference.  The sony has richer bass as well as clearer vocals.  For clarification, I did customize my EQ settings in the Sony while the iPod I used default settings (wasn't my iPod).  The sound is so clear on the Sony that on some files I can hear background noise/vocals that I never new existed.  It's like listen to songs for the first time all over again.  No joke.  As happy as I am with the player, I did run into some issues.  First off, the player is too dependent on Windows Media Player 11.  On my computer, my WMP can't add any songs to the library (and I've tried everything, I'm honestly really computer literate), so I couldn't sync or upload song the preferred way.  I used RealPlayer with some success... only thing is that when you create a playlist it copies the mp3 files with it so you'll have double of the same file on your player.  Do NOT use the Walkman Media Manager (which you can download from the Sony support site)... if you have all your music files in one single folder, the Media Manager will take the album art from the top file and use it for every single file that follows.  Rather annoying, and even if the album art is embedded into the file it'll still show up as that first file's.  Not only that but when you view album art the art is half the size then it should be.  But anyways, I copied all my music to an external hard drive, used another computer, and everything works great using WMP 11.  Battery life is outstanding as well.  Video is OK... the screen is beautiful but don't watch anything that's too long... if you want to use this as a video player then buy something with a bigger screen.

<Title>Complete package!

<Content>I have never owned an MP3/Video player, this is my first. I researched for months and months and finally settled on the Sony NWZA818.   I am so happy with my decision. I was down to the Nano and this one in the end and am glad I chose Sony. This is what nixed it for me and what I love about it:  1) Looks - Very small and sleek. I am one of the rare people who do not like Apple's scroll wheel. The buttons on Sony are very intuitive and easy to use. I did not even need to open up the manual except to check for video orientation settings. I am afraid I might damage it, its so delicate but I don't feel like spending $25 for a cover, so its OK.  2) Sound - I don't know where to start. I can't believe such a small thing can throw up such a beautiful sound! I mostly listen to Hindi music or Indian classical. This takes it to a whole new level. I love the equalizer settings too. The headphones that come in the package are very good, unlike the ones bundled with the Nano. Spending $70 on headphones might be OK for many people but why buy when you can get it as a part of the player?  3) Video and Photos: I loaded some photos onto the player on Day 1 and they look good. The screen is clear and sharp but I don't think I can watch a full-length movie on it, because of the screen size. Songs/short videos are fun to watch. I used a free converter called Jodix to convert an AVI file to MPEG4 and it worked well. I had a 25 minute video converted in 10 minutes and loaded onto the player using drag and drop.  4) Data Transfer - I used both Media Player and drag and drop. Both worked fine. The syncing function through Media Player is very fast.   I still have to try loading some podcasts/shoutcasts on this. But I hope it will work out fine. In all, I am happy with my purchase. I look forward to many pleasant commutes with my Walkman... :)
