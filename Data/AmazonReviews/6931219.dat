<Title>Great Performance and Great Design
<Date>Mon Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Sounds great!   I couldn't believe how easy the set up was.  This was my first time using an MP3 player and I did not even need to use the manual to set up and start downloading.  Earbuds are high quality with incredible depth and range.  Very cool design with earbuds integrated into the neck cord.  Not much bigger than a tube of Lib Balm.  Also has this great arm band attachment which really holds up as you exercise.  Easy to read and use display window. Nicely backlit in blue.  Highly reccomend this for yourself or as a gift.

<Title>good for working out
<Date>Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I LOVE the compact size of this MP3 player and use this specifically to use when working out.  It is very difficult reaching customer service.  I advise you to keep very careful documentation of the player; this is the easist way.  The company started in 1998, so I think they are still developing their customer service department.   I enjoy mine, but needed different headphones from the ones that were provided; the provided headphones were very short.

<Title>Great Little Player
<Date>Fri Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased this player after a lot of research.  I wanted something lightweight for running.  This player is great!  The sound quality is excellent.  I use my own headphones because I do not like earbuds, however, the quality of the earbuds is very good.  The belt clip works wonderfully, I have not had a problem.  I have not used the armband.  I like the player so much I listen to it in my car! I had no trouble with the music software.  I was up and running w/ in minutes.   I would highly recommend purchasing this product.  I have had this player for 7 months and it still works great.  The only problem is it does not play WMA files.  I did not care about this when I purchased it, everything I downloaded was MP3.  However, all I can find now is WMA files.

<Title>Compact and easy to use
<Date>Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a great player.  The size is amazingly small but the sound quality is great!  <p>The software that comes with the player is a little difficult to understand, but I took their advice and downloaded the plug-in for Real One Player.  I find it easier to use and with many more features. I do save my favorite cds as mp3 and the sound quality does not diminish.<p>I agree with the previous reveiwer about the headphones...the ones provided, though great sound, are very short. Great if clipped to shirt pocket or armband, but not to your shorts or even holding it at arm length.  I bought another good quality earbud and am using that instead.<p>Overall....good quality, good features, great sound.

<Title>A Great Product in a Small Package
<Date>Wed Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received this MP3 player for my birthday.  It's a great player for those who are content to load your songs on and go.  On average, I can get about 30 songs on there of high mp3 quality.  The biggest con is that it won't play wma format.<p>I have been extremely happy with this mp3 player.  I wish that I could expand the memory to play more songs, but I usually don't even use all of the memory anyway for a typical amount of listening time.  <p>The battery lasts about 10 hours long, so on long trips I have had to change out batteries.  But the sound quality and the size are the best features of this great player.  I would recommend this to a friend.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I really love this player.<br>It does exactly what it says it does.  It is compact and very light.  After receiving it I can see why it won design awards.  It is a very cool looking unit.  All I wanted it for was to listen to my tunes at the gym.  I have already used it for other things.  I connected it to my BOSE wave radio and the sound was incredible.  The ear buds that come with it have a incredible output.  The only negative thing I have found was the same as others the length of the ear bud's cord is a little short.<br>After going to the companys web page I figured out what I was doing wrong in tryig to play WMA and now it does play both MP3 and WMA files.  I know the 128 MB does not play the WMA files.  I would by this product again.  It is great for the gym.  It does not have a voice recorder or a fm tuner.  I did not buy it wanting those features. Like I said all I wanted to do is listen to music at the gym in something compact and it has already proven that and more.  The preset equalizer setting is a nice feature.

<Title>Very impressive little package
<Date>Sat Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I finally decided to buy an MP3 player and this little unit is just great.  Software was easy to install.  Adding and deleting songs is as simple as dragging and dropping into any folder on your hard drive.  The one AAA battery needed seems to last a long time.  Love the fact that you can wear it around your neck as a necklace with the earbuds attached.  I can listen to music and read while my spouse is watching TV right next to me.  Great to have with you while waiting in the Doctor's office, etc.  I would recommend to friends and buy them as xmas gifts as well.

<Title>Very good product
<Date>Fri Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a great product. The sound quality is very good. It is easy to transfer songs to it. It is compact and very comfortable to run with. The only minus that I have found is that its battery level gauge is misleading. You would expect that 2 out 3 lines on the battery scale means that you have quite a lot of battery power left, but this is not the case and 2 out of 3 should be actually interpreted as close to empty.

<Title>STUPID HEADSET
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I opened the box and repacked right away for a refund. I was so disappointed.  Don't get me wrong.  I own the MPIO FL100 and love it.  The design is so sleek and chic. I'm going to get another one.  The sound on the FL100 is amazingly clear.  I thought I would buy another product from MPIO and this DMK looked unique - small.  Ooohhh, how disappointed.  The head set is like a freaking 'necklace' You literally have to put this silly thing over your neck and the earplugs comes out of the side.  It's as though you are wearing an eyeglass holder around your neck and your glasses are daggling on your chest.  You can't tell at all by the picture.

<Date>Sun Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>1.  The headphones broke within one month at the gym. 2.  New software is not compatible with WinXP SP2.  I thought it was just me but I did a search and many people have had problems with it.  Not just the DMK but all the MPIO products.

<Title>Bad Design
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 Player uses a AAA battery. This is a terrible design decision. It severely curtails play life (by 1/3 to 1/2 compared to a AA) while the batteries themselves are not significantly cheaper than AA's.  I have also had a hard time finding rechargeable AAA's compared to AA's.  And while it sounds trivial, it is NOT minor that AAA batteries disappear much more easily that AA batteries at almost 3x the size.  I bought 4 rechargeables shortly after getting this.  A month later, 2 have disappeared.  Did I mention AAA batteries are not notably cheaper than AA's?&#60;br /&#62;Dont buy this.

<Title>I Changed My Mind!  (You'll See Why)
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I previously wrote a good review for this MP3 player, which I have since deleted.  Basically, what happened was a week after a wrote the review, the thing conked out on me for no apparent reason.  What happened was I had just finished downloading Service Pack 2 for Windows XP (don't know if this caused the problem, but I found it to be an odd coincidence).  I went to erase the songs, which went smoothly, but when I tried to download some different ones, the program froze up on me.  This had happened before, and usually I would just restart the program and it would pick up where it left off.  This time, though, the program would not start.  I tried again and again, to no avail.  Well, I figured, I'll give the program a rest.  At least I have about ten songs in the MP3 player.  I'll just listen to those.  Well, I went to turn on the player...nothing.  I changed the battery...nothing.    Over the course of three weeks, I e-mailed, called and wrote MPIO a letter detailing the problem and asking for a refund or replacement.  I heard nothing back, not even an automatic e-mail message.  The only good thing about their customer service is that that don't leave you on hold forever.  After fifteen minutes, they ask you to leave a message detailing the problem.  That's great...if they made the effort to return your call.  Well, finally, I gave up, chucked the player and bought a new one (another brand of course).  I talked to several people in the know about this stuff and they said Service Pack 2 was probably not a factor in the player's demise.  Also, my new player works fine, despite my still having Service Pack 2.  I wouldn't have been so ticked off if the thing hadn't cost 100 dollars and I had it for a whopping nine months.  I expect something at that price to last for a few years, not a few months.  Well, I won't EVER be buying anything from MPIO again, even if they come out with a player that holds a million songs and looks better than the overglorified IPOD.  I am EXTREMELY disappointed in their product and their non-existent customer service.  I once highly recommend this player, but now I say don't waste your money.  You're 100 dollars is better spent on something else.

<Title>Highly Recommend
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The DMK was my first experience with mp3 players and I'd have to say it's worked great. I've had it for about a year and a half now and it's survived countless high-velocity impacts on pavement. The thing is covered in dents and I lost the battery cover but it's still alive and kicking perfectly. Its small size is really a plus, making it ideal for running or working out at the gym. I've read various complaints about the inconvenience of the "necklace" headset configuration, but I've actually found this to be advantageous, as I can carry the thing around without any belt clips or whatnot. The earbuds and wires are also easily concealable, which is helpful when i'm listening to music during class:) I bring it with me everywhere, couldn't live w/out it. Overall a great buy.

<Title>works fine, but not w/o quirks
<Date>Sat May 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Cons: after about a year of use (during which time SP2 was installed on my pc), the player and the manaing program started locking up -- i had to manually kill the process and remove the batter from the player to stop it. After browsing the MPIO website and downloading the updated driver for SP2, i found out that the update does not work (i.e. the file mentioned in the instructions was not included in the download). I removed the manager from my pc, downloaded the newer version of it, formatted the internal memory of the player and so far have not encountered any problems. Also, the included clip does not hold that well.  pros: small size, VERY durable, perfect for workouts. In my opinion, beats the expensive HDD players.

<Title>I've registered solely to warn you AGAINST purchasing this.
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The MPIO DMK MP3 player is an unmitigated piece of junk - a terrible, terrible purchase that has only caused me a ton of frustration and, well, even a tinge of embarrassment.   I say frustration because, since having initially managed to successfully upload songs onto the device ONCE (which I suppose could in a way justify the mandatory one-star rating I've had no choice but to give it,) it has for all intensive purposes ceased to function, it would seem entirely of its own volition. I have tried installing and re-installing the included MPIO software onto no less than three different fully up-to-date PCs with no success. MP3 files simply refuse to transfer to the device. I have spent tireless hours trying to troubleshoot the problems - even braving the, uh, let's just call it "loosely translated" instruction manual - to no avail. Alas, I  have since given up, having come to the realization that there is so much more to life than sitting by the computer and trying to beat this piece of crap into functioning the way it's supposed to. I have come to the end of my unfortunate epic journey of frustration with the knowledge that there is no software, firewire or missing piece that will rectify the problems with the MPIO DMK 128 MB MP3 Player. The problem is intrinsically in the poor manufacturing. To say that THIS THING SUCKS is an understatement.  It is also important to note that though the MPIO DMK is marketed as being cross-platform compatible (i.e. it claims to work on both Mac and PC,) this is outright false advertising. A blatant lie. iTunes and this thing are like water and oil. Plugging this piece of garbage into a Mac (yes, I've tried it on a Mac as well as the aforementioned three PCs) will only result in a frozen computer. Try connecting device. Restart computer. Try again. Restart. Try again. Restart. Scream. Punch hole in wall. Drink heavily to dull pain. Again.  Furthermore, the MPIO DMK wasted no time in starting to fall apart physically as well. It's not too major, but the rubber cap that seals the firewire input dock ceased to fit, leaving the dock exposed at all times. Can you spell A-W-E-S-O-M-E?  I say that the MPIO DMK 128 MB MP3 Player caused me embarrassment as well because I had the added misfortune of having bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. It would have been her first MP3 Player. She watched and waited as I tried in vain to get her music to work. When I finally gave up, pounding fists on the desk and sobbing unconsolably from the unrelenting emotional toll raised by my endless unsuccessful efforts, she dried my tears, stroked my hair and assured me that it didn't matter. But as much as I tried to grapple with her sincerity, I could see the truth plainly revealed in her eyes: she thought me to be less of a man.  Just kidding. It wasn't like that. But close.  But seriously, I have since replaced this piece of crap with an iPod Shuffle, which works without incident and sounds infinitely better.  So, in conclusion, if you are in the market for a portable MP3 Player, I implore you to save yourself the trouble and look in another direction. I can tell you with all conviction not to purchase the MPIO DMK 128 MB MP3 Player under any circumstance. You might as well set your money on fire.  In fact, I will go so far as to say that If I could manage to get in touch with the President of MPIO - or, say, a customer service representative...or, geeze, even a frickin' company secretary for that matter - I would, without hesitation, ask for his resignation.

<Content>I absolutely love this mp3. It was my first mp3 player.  I had recieved for my brithday and have used it for almost 3 years and it still works perfectly.  I've taken it running, snowboarding, and etc. I like it how you do not need to charge it because it runs on AAA batteries.  Loading songs onto the mp3 is incredibly simple.  You just drag down songs.  The controls are also very easy to use.

<Title>No reason to buy this
<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player a year and a half ago, and it's really not worth getting.  I had serious compatibility issues uploading songs onto the thing, it got so bad that only one in about ten tries would successfully work, and sometimes if you were uploading one song it would freeze and corrupt the entire memory.  As long as you weren't changing songs it worked ok, but that's hardly a justification for it's flaws.  It's possible this was just a compatibility problem with my pc, but I wouldn't tell anybody to risk that anyway.  I personally won't ever risk buying a digital way product for a while.  For the same price as this you can get a Samsung YP-MT6X 512 mb mp3 player, that is better than this one in ever way:  - it plays OGG and WMV files - it has 4 times the memory - it has 4 times the battery life.
