<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>great player. 50$ bucks cheaper than nano is what made me buy this. but then its features keep amazing me. fm player, recorder, fm recorder, photo viewer, video player, cool looking. i have run it for two weeks now and have faced no major problems. downsides: 1) doesnt come with armband. 2) Slideshow feature doesnt work 3) slightly heavier and probably thicker than nano

<Title>A quality product
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to replace my SanDisk SDMX1 mp3 player. The only reason I did not give it a 5 rating is that the manual is rudimentary at the best. It tells how to use a function but does not explain what the funtion is for. The navigation is somewhat odd. Although my music are organized in folders, once they are copied to the e260, the folders are no more visible. The player lets you play all songs, by artist, albums, genre, playlists, etc. This is completely different from the SDMX1 in which you navigate by folders. The photo display is sharp with good contrast. The video playing is also very good. I still recommend it.

<Title>Disappointment 
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went to BestBuy to purchase a 1GB shuffler (for running) and a regular ipod 30GB for my long commute everyday 2.5hr. The sales person recommended the Sansa 260e, for $190 4GB and all the options it made sense for me to purchase it.....however file transfer was confusing (MCP mode all the songs displays unknown) while connected to USB can not use the sansa, also the unit comes with sample songs which it freezed the unit,  but it dose not have a reset button so you have to wait till battery drains. One good thing was video transfer was simple and worked. Unfortunately I have to get the ipod but I'm glad I decided to purchase it locally vs. shipping

<Title>love it!
<Date>Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i've been looking for an mp3 player like this for a long time.  the ipod is nice, but i always had little gripes that stopped me from getting one (such as the inability to use anything but itunes to load music).    this player is a great alternative to ipod.  it's about the same size as a nano, but a tiny bit thicker, and a little heavier.  the scroll wheel has a nice tactile feel to it, and contrary to other reviewers i like the way it feels (although i concede the buttons are a little hard to press without adjusting my hand).  the screen is impressive-- bigger, brighter, and clearer than nano.  the menus are well thought out, though this is my first tag-based player (vs. folder-based) so there is a slight learning curve for me.  mine came already loaded with the most current firmware.  the first time i connected it to my computer i nearly panicked-- the unit would turn on, then show an error and turn off.  then i realized i had the "hold" button on.  switching it off fixed the problem.  i didn't install any of the sandisk software and windows xp found the device and gave me the option to sync it with my music in windows media player.  you can also open the player as a folder in my computer and just copy music that way if you prefer.  to copy photos or videos you do have to install the sandisk software.  i copied over all the music i could think of (maybe 30 albums?), and i still have 1.5gb left.  i was considering ordering an extra mini-sd card to expand the memory, but now i think i will hold off since i'm having a hard time filling it as it is!  all in all, great mp3 player!  i will update my review if my impressions change.

<Title>Some notes about the e200 series
<Date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The other reviews have already commented on the features and performance, so I'll try to comment on those aspects that haven't gotten much attention.  This is a great player, but I will concentrate on some annoying aspects:  1. When you charge via USB, the display on the device is always on. It doesn't fall asleep or go dim. The device is also nonresponsive in this mode, ie the buttons won't work and you won't be able to play or do anything.  2. If you have a USB wall charger, the display will dim and the buttons will work while charging. But the device must be on, it won't charge via AC if the device is turned off.  3. Playlists can be made on the fly, but you have to play each song you want to add to the playlist in order to bring up the option.   4. Video conversion software only installs on windows XP. It also breaks up larger files into smaller ones, and it's not very intuitive to copy whole DVD's. The quicktime format it uses is proprietary. Also, video files are only recognized in the root folder, so the device won't see files located in subfolders. Videos run at 15 fps.   5. Has the option of choosing MSC or MTP mode. MSC loads the player like a flash drive so you manually drag and drop files. MTP works with wmp 10, and some other third party software to manage your syncing. I prefer MSC, but I switched to MTP because when you unplug the USB cable in MSC mode, the device reboots itself. It does not do this is MSC mode.   This is a great player, but you'll need to spend some time configuring everything to your preferences. The Sandisk firmware has good basic functionality, but if you're used to lots of features for customization, be prepared to work for it with this device. I miss features like "play most recently synchronized" that my old player had. The good news is that these firmware drawbacks may soon be addressed when Rockbox firmware is released. The hardware and build quality of this device is truly excellent, and it will be the best flash player on the market once Rockbox firmware is released for the e200 series.

<Title>AWESOME MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is sweet.   PROS:   1. Has more space and more features than the IPOD nano.  2. Video. I have encoded a bunch of Family Guy episodes and they play great.   3. Nice design.  CONS:   1. USB only charger. This is crap. Most MP3 players do this however. You simply need to buy a 5 dollar USB to AC adapter via ebay to be able to charge on the go. MP3 player companies are retarded thinking that a person is always going to have computer access.   2. Breaks up video into small chunks. If you want to watch a 1 hour movie, it will break it up into 10 minute movies. Not a big deal but it just means you'll have like 6 files for an hour long movie.   3. Not many accessories at this time. I want to buy accessories for this puppy but since it's brand new, there's not much out there yet. Hopefully that will change.

<Title>Ipod Terminator
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Strengths: Affordable, Plays Video, Flash-based storage  Weaknesses: Low(er) Capacity (compared to hard drive players), case shows marks/fingerprints easily, cheap headphones included  Excellent player for the price - like a smaller version of a Video Ipod, but better in some ways! It is flash based - so no moving parts to break or wear out. The battery is user replaceable so you're not up a creek when it does go out in a year or two.  The software it comes with is just basic, but simple and easy to use - just choose some files (including DVD .VOB files), and it converts them and puts them on the player for you - pretty quickly, too. (Much faster than 600mb per hour that another reviewer said, though I haven't clocked it.)  There's good community support, and talk of their being RockBox support coming up for this player, which will make it even better! It's arguably the best thing out there for the price!   Highly recommended - you can't go wrong with this one.

<Title>A GrEaT bUy!!!!
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great multimedia device.  After hearing that the ipod gets scratched and cracked too easily I decided to look elsewhere for my traveling entertainment.  I did my research and so far I am glad that I chose this device.  I was reading some of the other reviews and I saw that someone had mentioned no stop button, there IS a stop button!  Also, someone had written that the picture slide show does not work, it definitely does!  Plus, I called Sandisk with some questions and they were very patient and helpful.  The ONLY negative (so far) is that there are no accessories for this item but Sandisk has informed me that they are on the way.  We will have to wait and see...  I would say that this is a great buy!!!

<Title>Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought a SanDisk Sansa e270, and deeply regret the purchase.  I need a travel charger and a spare battery, but you don't sell either, and will not tell me what other chargers, if any are compatible with the e270.  Your technical support representative's answers are absolutely useless - I have cut and pasted my questions and his responses below.  Given the non-existent customer support, I will not buy another SanDisk product again.    ===============     Your Question/Problem: I want to use the Sansa e270 when I travel, but won't be carrying a laptop. How do I charge the battery since you don't sell a travel charger? Can I use the IPod Nano/mini charger brick and plug the Sansa USB into it? If not, what can I use.  Also, I want to buy a spare battery since it is user replaceable, but you don't sell it either. Where do I buy one?  ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/20/2006 08:09)  Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. As of now there is no available wallcharger and spare battery for the Sansa e200 series. Also we do not recommend that you use the charger of the ipod player, considering that is not a product of SanDisk. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!  Sincerely, Michael Louie I. SanDisk Technical Support ________________________________________ Your Response: (06/21/2006 08:03) My trips typically last 2-4 weeks, so I really do need to charge. Since you do not sell chargers and batteries, and recommend not using non-SanDisk chargers, that makes my SanDisk unusable after the charge runs out. The only alternative is to use the IPod charger - please tell me what the correct voltage, amperage, and polarity is to charge the Sansa e270. I am willing to use a non-SanDisk product even if it means voiding the warranty. Otherwise I have wasted almost $300. And when will you start selling spare batteries, since one of the reasons I bought the Sansa was because SanDisk advertised it had a replaceable battery - although this may be true in theory, it is not true if you don't sell one! ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/21/2006 08:03)   Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. The ampherage, polarity and voltage are all proprietary information that we are unable to release at this time. You may try to do a search on a compatible charger for the Sansa e200 series player. However we do not guarantee that anything will work with it until we put a charger on the market. But we have no information when it will be out. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!

<Title>e260 vs Nano - an easy decision, heres why
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased a new nano for my fiancee, and one of the e260 for myself.  My thought was that I wanted to buy her a nice expensive unit, and I would settle for the less expensive unit.  However, it turns out that the e260 is way better than the Nano.  I'll break down why, and to be fair there is a couple of things also listed that the Nano does better.  THINGS THAT e260 DOES BETTER THAN NANO: 1.) e260 can do more     - You can play video on the e260 - great for little vacation clips from your camera. 2.) e260 screen is bigger, more colorful and brighter 3.) e260 battery is replaceble, no need to throw your unit away when the battery dies (since apple ipod would charge too much to send it in and get battery etc). 4.) Price per Storage ratio.  Nano cost $175 for 2GB, e260 was $140 for 4GB (prices at my purchase time) Thats TWICE AS MUCH for LESS MONEY. 5.) e260 is more scratch and break resistant.  Built better. 6.) e260 has an FM TUNER, you can listen to radio! 7.) You cannot use a coupon or coupon code on any Apple products at any store anywhere, you can with e260. 8.) e260 has memory card slot, yes you can add even more storage and/or move stuff off/on with a little micro-sd card. 9.) Battery charge - you get at least a couple of hours more from full charge out of the e260. 10.) Drag and drop your music onto the unit, no need for management software.  This means the unit can also be used as a file storage device like a USB drive.  THINGS THAT NANO DOES BETTER THAN e260: 1.) Nano is slightly thinner. 2.) Nano has more accessories on the market, its hard to find them for e260. 3.) The scroll wheel of e260 is mechanical, the nano scroll is sort of touch based.  Some prefer the mechanical, but the touch based is prefered by me.  Its no contest for me, I will never buy IPOD again, you just do not get what you pay for.  Really, if there was an IPOD Nano out there with the same features as the e260 and same storage space, apple would charge over $500 for it.

<Title>Would not purchase this product again
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought a Sandisk Sansa e260 and our son had problems getting it to synchronize from the time that he took it out of the box. Then today his Sandisk Sansa e260 fell 2 feet to the floor while he was sitting down and now the screen is destroyed with lines running through it internally. One would think that a 24" fall would not be enough to destroy a flash drive player, but even a rubber skin on the player was not enough to protect this poorly designed player from internal damage. I called the Sandisk company and spoke with a manager who stated that the Sandisk players are not designed to resist ANY TYPE of falls "even if it only falls 12" or less." I did not tell this manager that our kids previously owned the Sandisk Sansa m240 which not only stood up to the abuse of MANY impacts and falls, but one of them went through the wash and still worked! The new Sandisk Sansas do not hold up to the quality that their players once were. These e260 players are less expensive than some and they have decent sound quality, but don't waste your money on these players if you want a player that will last more than a few months.

<Title>An Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is far and away better than an iPod Nano. Like anything else, it has it's pros and cons, listed here:  Pros * Excellent size and feel. It's small, yet fits in the hand perfectly. It's only slightly thicker than a Nano. * The screen is bright, crisp, and displays video. The video is a double-edged sword, however. More on that in the cons. * 4GB is a lot of space, and you can add even more with the MicroSD slot for a good price.  Cons There are two different categories in the Cons. Cons that can be fixed (via a firmware update), and those that can't. First, the Cons that can be fixed: * You can only delete songs from the computer, not through the interface. This can be easily fixed in a firmware update. * Sometimes a weird glitch occurs where you see songs on the MP3 player that don't really exist. You select it and nothing happens. I find simply taking everything off the MP3 player to the computer, then back to the MP3 player will fix this. The downside to this method is that you lose the ratings you give your songs. * The movies are gigantic. The software included streamlines the process, but it manages to take a 54MB .mp4 file and convert it into a 300MB+ Motion JPEG file. I'm not sure if this is normal for the Motion JPEG codec, but it boggles the mind. Also, it breaks up videos into segments of ten minutes. I'm assuming this is because you can only fast-forward at one speed, so it helps make it easier to find where you left off. This can be fixed by simply using the same feature it uses for it's songs, the "Scan through song" feature. Hopefully this can be addressed in a future firmware update.  Unfixable Con: * The buttons are hard to push. If the scroll wheel (which lights up with a cool blue whenever you use it) was set into the MP3 player just a liiittle bit deeper, it would be easier to hit the buttons. But it's not. So it isn't. You end up putting your thumb on the wheel, and tilting your thumb toward the button, or you use your fingernails. Sort of annoying. The menu button doesn't have a responsive "click" or anything of the sort, so you have to push it and hope it registers. Also sort of annoying.  I know there are way more cons then pros, but it's human nature to point out the flaws. But if/when the fixable cons get fixed, it becomes obvious the pros outweigh the cons. I can still wholeheartedly recommend this MP3 player right now.

<Title>Best MP3 for Yahoo Music
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have tried many MP3s over the years and this by far is the most iPod like.  It works extremely well with the Yahoo Music subscription whereas others in the past have had many software issues. the memory expansion slot is a plus but with 4 gigs, you can get a load of songs on it anyway. the only thing i can find wrong is that it does not work well with Yahoo Music playlists. Extra steps are required to copy them over which isn't worth the time. But the extremely long battery life is worth the lack of playlist functionality.

<Title>Sanse e260 player
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There were a few qualities that I looked for in an mp3 player, portability, ease of use, and price.   Portability - it travels well and is surprisingly durable, a necessity for me Ease of use - At first, I got confused by a couple of the menus but, after a couple of minutes, I was able to navigate through with no problems.  I can port my files onto the player without having to use special software - another big point for me.  My only gripe is with the ear buds as they never fit right in my ears, but that's hardly Sandisk's fault.  I'll simply purchase something a little more flexible and smaller. Price - after doing a comparison, I found this to be the best value for my money.   All in all, enjoyable so far.

<Title>Hmm, nice, but...
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was really looking forward to this and when I got it I started having mixed feelings. It has a good size, feels sturdy but a bit on the heavy side. The interface is nice, easy to use, but as someone pointed out you cannot delete a file from the player, you must use the computer. The beautiful wheel gets on the way of the buttons, also pointed out by others, and though it is not very smooth it turns reasonably well unless you are trying to go through a lot of songs at once. Then there is the whole issue of only being able to charge it through an usb connection, together with the fact that it uses a proprietary cable and you can't just use one of the standard usb cables available on the market (ok, many players have the same issue...). One other concern are the openings for the microsd card slot and the cable connections that have no protection. Being able to add extra memory is a nice feature. It sounds good but the earphones that come with it are of low quality what brings me to the issue that you can't adjust the equalizer to your own   settings; you have to use one of the preset options. The Sansa e260 is ok for adding some family videos to carry around, but seriously, who is going to watch a whole video in such a small screen? It is not the main purpose of the player; if you want to watch videos get a larger screen/larger storage video player. 4GB is a great amount of memory for music, that is why I bought it. Curious that the movies are .mov, a quicktime/apple standard, and yet it doesn't support mac, you can't even access it as a hard drive if you plug it into a mac.

<Title>Above average mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have this product for about a month now. It's a nice product for the price. I dont have any major problems yet. Before buying it I have read several reviews on Internet, most of them say that it has nice featurs and a good sound quality. So, I bought it and found that its sound quality is not as good as I expected. By the way I am comparing sansa with iPod nano. At some instances I hear hissing sound in some songs which sounds great in my car audio system. I may have to see if there any setting which can improve the sound quality. I like some of the features like loading mp3s from computer. You dont have to go through format change, you can simply drag and drop as in Windows Explorer, FM radio is fairly good and ability to store and display color pictures. It is not better than iPod for sure. iPod has a nice sound and touch pad navigation, in sensa navigation is done by wheel. The height of this wheel is little more than it should be, which makes harder to press the buttons around it. Overall I found it little better than average mp3 player.

<Title>Klutsy, bit it sounds great
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I've had it about a month and yes, the Sansa e260 and Yahoo Music have replaced my ipod.  Never thought it would happen.  Pro's - The sound is wonderful.  The earbuds that came with the Sansa are quite good but I am tiring of plastic in my ear so  I bought a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 earphones.  Great combination.  All the music I want from Yahoo for a flat fee and a player that produces wonderful sound and only slightly larger than a nano.  Good FM reception and sound.  Cons - A klutsy mechanical interface. Mechanical buttons you have to press very deliberately or nothing happens.  The volume control/scroll wheel is mechanical, not touch-pad like like the ipods.  All in all, it's a better way to listen to all the music you can imagine on a great sounding portable device.  You get used to the ideosyncraisies - and the price is right.

<Title>Better than an iPod, but still a few kinks
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is a great buy.  Let's go through the good and the bad on this little guy.  Pros: A great machine.  This MP3 player sounds very nice out of a fine pair of quality headphones, and even from those pack-in earbuds (that are surprisingly good themselves).  The screen is beautifully clear and colorful, which is great because the system allows for video playback and image viewing.  The unit feels nice in your hand or pocket and looks very stylish as well.  UI is easy to navigate, even though the buttons themselves hamper use a bit.  This player does not require itself to be synced to a computer player like the iTunes/iPod partnership, and therefore music can easily be added and removed with no DRM slowing (or stopping) the process.  Other features like FM radio and voice-recorder are nice bonus features.  Cons: But it's not without quirks.  There are a few minor issues that must be dealt with.  When you drag music in via My Computer, the Sansa ignores track numbers and plays in any order; only adding music via Windows Media Player keeps tracks in order.  Player occassionally locks up during normal use, but not enough to be a bother.  Face buttons are cramped by scrollwheel and a little hard to press, and the scrollwheel itself isn't as nice as, oh, a touchwheel.  Also, the fast-forwarding is quite slow, and it can be a pain to find your place in an audiobook or podcast if stopped.  Minus the quirks- most of which could be fixed by a firmware update- this is one fine machine.  If you want something like a iPod Nano, but would like to get more bang for your buck, then buy this player.

<Title>Great little unit, love sansa products
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought a refurb for $50 on ebay after my wife got one.  My last player was a creative zen which wouldn't last more than a couple hours of battery life, and if you left it sit for a couple weeks the battery would die by itself.  I can leave this sitting around for months and it will still retain it's charge.  Battery lasts a long time during use too.  Seems like some allow you to connect as a MSD (mass storage device) so that you dont' have to sync with rhapsody, the one I got wasn't (which is one of my complaints).  I also don't like that there's no adapter to use this with an ipod connector (for the car).  I would think it wouldn't be hard since the connector is the same, and this unit is capable of remote control, but the pin layout is different.  I've contacted Sansa about a possible future adapter and I've gotten no response.

<Title>Worth Its Weight
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Used it out west for 8 days on the slopes and help up beautifully.  lenty of space for media, but its nice to have the expansion slot when nearing the tipping point.  A lot of nice options, easy to use, recommended to anyone looking for an all media player.

<Title>Sansa E260
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great product, intuitive and easy-to-use format, FM radio has excellent reception, sound is balanced and has a reasonable frequency response.  Overall, an excellent value.  You should be aware that the unit does not have a volume control.  The two selectable volumes (which both sound the same to me) are adequate for most situations but I would like to boost it a bit at times.  I would buy this unit again.

<Title>Good MP3 player, could've used more interface
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player for my son, and after playing with it for a few hours, I wanted one.  I purchased an Insignia 4GB Sport from BestBuy, but returned it to buy this one.  I regret that decision now.  This player is a good one, and it sounds great.  My only dislike is the user interface.  I use the rating system alot.  I don't have time to listen to every song I have loaded on my computer, so I copy them to my MP3 player, and as I am running (exercise), or sitting in a waiting room, I rate the songs, best to worse, then I delete the bad ones later.  The Insignia model had dedicated buttons on the side, so you can rate on the fly, the Sansa model you have to run through the Music menu to rate.  Also, the Insignia model would show you the rating on the screen while you were listening, the Sansa model, you have to go throught the menu again to see if you have already rated it.  Also, I didn't realize I was buying a (version 1) MP3 player.  I guess there is a (version 2) with more features in the software, but I did not know that when I purchased.  I guess you can delete songs from the player with a ver2, but mine you have to connect to a PC to delete songs.  The other thing I did not like is the inability to add songs to playlists on the MP3 player.  You can have different playlists, but the only way to change the playlists is to copy them from a PC.  The Sansa came with one playlist already loaded, called the GoList, and it is the only playlist you can change on the player.  I guess I assumed that the best feature of an MP3 player would be that you can create multiple playlists for any occasion.  With this Sansa, you can have multiple playlists, but they did not make it easy for you, in my opinion.  I do not use the movie or picture options.  To view a movie would take alot of the memory space needed for songs, and why would you want to watch a movie on such a little screen.  On the good side, it has a good looking clear interface, has good sound, built in FM tuner, and decent EQ.  My recommendation goes to the Insignia Sport models.

<Title>Why pay retail when you can by refurb from Amazon?
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have really been pleased with the refurb Sansa E260.  I had my doubts but bought it anyway.  It is the same as new except the word refurb on the back.  New at Walmart is $150, refurb $60.  Absolutely no problems.  I ordered 2 more.  Delivery was speedy.

<Title>Rubbish  customer support
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this for six months now and for a time I was pleased but it always bugged me that it wouldn't sync album art over from Windows Media Player 11. Microsoft says it requires a firmware update from Sandisk, but all I get from them are 'canned' responses and the like, or instructions on how to format the player, very complex instructions on MANUALLY adding album art to the player from JPEG files, etc etc, none of which has helped one little bit. I keep telling them NO, I just want it to sync as easily as music does, but all I get back is another idiobot response. I suppose the firmware will not be forthcoming because they have a whole new roster of players now and are probably not concerned with the e200 series anymore. Sound quality is good and everything but if you want a player that will properly function with WMP11 I would get a Zune or Creative.

<Title>Let the music play
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this SanDisk Sansa for my husband's birthday almost a year ago and its still going strong. For the money... its hard to beat. He absolutely loves the thing and has had no complaints. He tells me its one of the best gifts he's ever gotten from me. Hmmmmm.... well its obvious he's tickled pink with my selection and I'm sure anyone who buys the Sansa 260 will be as well. I also bought him a toughskin case to protect and preserve the unit and it certainly does the job quite nicely. There is only ONE thing that would make SanDisk Sansa better and that is if the accessories were more readily available like those for the IPOD.

<Title>Thoroughly enjoyable
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this unit as a Refurb, since it cost $20 less than new and carried the same warranty. I wanted a flash drive player rather than a mini hard drive because there's less chance of mechanical failure. I use it primarily as a music player while traveling, rather than for pictures or video. The e200 was up and running in just a few minutes, with barely a need for the manual. (Actually, there is no manual; it comes on the CD.) The sound is great, even with inexpensive headphones. The screen display quality is good. It feels solid and secure. I've had trouble filling up 4GB of storage, but it's nice to know the unit is expandable via an add-on chip. The four buttons surrounding the Select button are pretty small and require real concentration to operate. These allow you to pause/go forward/go backward/change menus. But all players have some minor failing. I use USB to recharge the battery, though will probably buy one of the many inexpensive AC chargers now available. I would rate the e200 at 5 stars except that it might have some fault so far undiscovered. My first player was a Creative 256k model. The sound and features of the SanDisk are far superior.

<Title>not bad
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am familiar with sandisk memory cards that I use for my audio recorders and video games for my kids. They have been around a long time so I was interested in how they would do with an mp3 player and I think it's very good. I like the fact that you can essentially upgrade the unit by simply getting another memory card so that you could have an unlimited number of songs. Nice!

<Title>Great player. But you'll need to get the some extras.
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The sansa it's all about the features. Fm radio, Mp3/WMA player, video player, voice/sound/fm recorder, and more.   The quality is great, so far, i've been using it for about 2 months now. The sound quality is quite good. Battery lasts about 20 hours with regular constant use. Firmware is good, but could be better. But to get the most out of your player, i recommend you get the following:  * A wall outlet charger, since the sansa comes with an usb charger only (1st reason for the 4 stars instead of 5). Unless you carry around a laptop everyware, or dont mind spending 2 hours in a cybercafe just to charge the player.  * A protective case, unless you're very carefull with the player, it could get scratched easily (2nd reason for the 4 stars instead of 5).   * Rockbox firmware. This really helps you "get the juice" out of the sansa player, adding great extra features such as text reader, voice operation, game boy color emulator, video/photo viewing without the need to ccompress the files, customizable skins/fonts/colors, file and folder management, text file creation, louder volume, full equalizer, bass/trebble control, and more. Besides, you can install it without uninstalling the original firmware.

<Title>Save on gas read library books on line
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Handley library in Winchester VA just added a free audio books on line feature for library card holders. Download an audio book to your desktop and then to your mp3 player. After 2 weeks the book disappears. The problem, it doesn't work with ipod. So I bought the e260. It works flawlessly with the free software downloaded from the library. No more trips to the library to borrow tapes or cds and no more "OOOWW, I forgot to return that book last month." Although the capacity of the e260 mhas not been a problem, I wish that it came in 8 0r 16 gig flavors.

<Content>decent product as far as features go but I bought 2 of them, 1 for me  1 for  my son. On Both players the screen broke inside . Support is frustrating at best. Bottom line is I'm stuck with 2 useless and expensive mp3 players.

<Content>The first Sandisk was under warranty when it crashed.  Since I've had the replacement, I've dealt with continual frustration trying to get the software and the system to function as it should.  An internal sound issue has occured where neither the headphones or DLO FM transmitter work.  Tech Support only says there is nothing they can do. DO NOT BUY SANDISK.  There are much better products available on the market.

<Title>Great mp3 player, I'd buy it again
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had mine for almost 3 weeks now and use it daily, both around the house while reading and while out and about or on the train to and from work.  If I had the choice agian I'd buy it again.  CONS: The little round thing to use to select different things.  PROS: Everything but that little round button, the brightness of the screen, the sound, the size, the SD expansion slot is a huge plus, since I can turn my 4gb player into a 10gb player for a hell of a lot cheaper then buying a 10gb player.  Going to buy another one for my wife.

<Title>A great product
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this thing. I love the small size, the FM radio feature (though AM would've been nice), and the voice recording. The picture feature is nice, but the video featureisn't very usefull, as the software converts the video into a format that hogs up much of the player's 4 GB. Without videos, 4 GB is perfect for me and fits around 1000 songs. I love that you can drag and drop music into the folders of the player without having to go through clunky software (though pictures and video require the Sansa software). I wish the blue light around the center button wasn't so powerful, as it is quite noticeable in a dark room. It'd be nice if you could dim it or shut it off. Aside from these minor issues, its a fantastic product at a good price. Today, however, this model is a little dated, and you might find that you can get more for your money in newer MP3 players. Not saying that you shouldn't pick this one up, but be sure to do your research.

<Title>I was skeptical but now I am sold
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the Sansa E260 for Christmas.  I thought about the IPOD but want to have the freedom to put anything on it not just Apple stuff.  I have yet to fill it up.  I have music, audio books, video and pictures on it.    It has never frozen on me and the software works great.  I was careful to back up my computer before loading the software in case there was a problem but I have had nothing but smooth sailing.  The software converts all my video into the correct format.  I have updated the sansa software with no problems.    I really like how it feels in my hand and how it operates.  I wanted something simple to use and easy to load.  I don't have hours to spend on  a computer working on the software when I want to change videos or songs.  I want to spend 2 minutes and unplug and go.  The battery life is amazing it never seems to run down.  I watch videos for hours.  I spent 3 bucks and bought an power adapter for the wall so I wouldn't have to have my computer on.  I bought a nice case at Walmart by Case Logic that fits it perfectly.  I have a 2 gig memory card but haven't needed it yet.  I listen to a range of music plus audio books and videos so I am never bored with this.  It's small enough to fit in my tiny purse and I can use it when I am waiting on my kids or doing some chore I would rather not be doing.   Great for the treadmill and I love the "lock" function so I don't have to worry about pressing buttons by accident when I use it.  It's nice to be able to show of pics of family and places I've been.    I really like mine. Best purchase I have made in a while.  Found on sale the week of Thanksgiving through Amazon for 79.00!

<Title>Great item
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It's locked up a few times in the year I've had it, but it's a matter of a simple reset, no data lost. great controls, great sound. I never use the movie or pictures functions, it's a waste on a tiny screen. I use the AM/FM sometimes, and the main advantage is the file formats it supports as opposed to the limited iPod.   In addition, you can pull all your music back off the player, if you have recently wiped/reinstalled your computer and lost your collection. It's a handy backup.
