<Title>Great while it lasts
<Date>Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I decieded to get a new Mp3 player almost right after this thing came out and since I've trusted Rio in the past, I decided to try this baby out. So for four months I was the envy of all my friends with this sleek little gadget and I had no qualms. It performed just as the packaging and reviews suggested it would.<p>Then it all started going to hell.<p>I had noticed earlier that some times when it got bumped hard or I tossed it on my bed, couch or something it would stop playing and the internal time setting would get screwed up. This I dealt with. Then the cheap belt clip broke one day while I was putting it on my coat. This I could live with. I had some unrelated computer problems that gave rise for me to re-install my OS and when i went to put my "trusty" Rio's drivers back on I couldn't find the CD. No problem I thought, I'll just get them off the main site. Wrong! Not to be found anywhere on the main site, and it gave need for me to order a replacement CD. This I was mad about but I could live with it. But then one day I got up and was getting ready for class, when I reaced in my drawer for my "loyal sidekick" when I found that in the night it's LCD mysteriously cracked. I live alone and it was just fine when I put it in the night before. While the player still worked it was difficult to manange with and was really trying my patience. Then came the straw that broke the camels back. I don't know if it's heat expansion or what but occassionally the players casing pops appart and must be snapped back together. Excuse me but isn't this a "Sports Player?" Should it be build a little bit more durable? Or at least be build to last more than a few months? It was great while it worked but spend your $ on something a little more long lasting and worth it.

<Title>Don't buy this because it says "Sport"
<Date>Mon Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Le me start by saying this is not a bad MP3 player.  In fact, it's quite nice when I'm traveling or sitting around in a quiet place.  BUT!!! If that's what you are looking for then buy the SONICblue Rio S10 64 MB MP3 Player and save a few bucks.  I have ran, rode a mountain bike, rollerbladed and hiked with the S10 and S30 and the S30 is nothing more than the S10 with a velcro-strap. <p>Why not the S30 for sports?  First, it's not water/weather resistant.  Sonic could have easily made it so there was a plastic protector over the USB/Head-phone port....which by the way, is on the top of the player so don't sweat with it next to your body or with it on the armband and don't expose to a light mist or rain....it will malfunction!!!  Second, the arm band is just a velcro-strap.  Got to the dollar store and buy one for the S10.  Third, the plastic cover is cumbersome and practically useless.  It doesn't protect the player like the thick one that comes with the S10 and it restricts your ability to access volume/menu buttons.  Fourth, I changed the equalizer settings and every time I turn it on, the music is muffled until I go back to the equalizer settings menu.  That may be a problem with my player.<p>Things that are okay: The earphones are fine, the volume is good, the software is super-user friendly, the music doesn't skip.<p>Summary: Great player if you are into liesure or indoor sports, but if that's the case, go with the lower priced S10. I exchanged the S10 for the S30 ONLY to get a more durable, sport-friendly model and it's definitely not the case.

<Title>Nice, just right for workouts!
<Date>Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have read several reviews on this model and I agree with everyone that says the headphones are bad.  I bought new ones for around $15.00 and the music sounds GREAT.  It is small and great for running.  The large button is easy to find when you are running for changing songs, whether it is located on your hip or arm.  It was easy to understand the menu.  Nice backlight for night use.  Nice display.  Software was user friendly and tranfers quick.  Bought a 128mg memory card for $44.00 and now have more than enough memory with the 64mg that is in the unit. Saved $50.00 by not buying the s35s and put that money towards the 128 memory.  Only fault I have found so far was the headphones

<Title>Get the Firmware
<Date>Sun Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got the RioS30s about two months ago and this is what I noticed.<p>The sound quality is great, the small size is good, and I loved it overall. But I noticed it would restart itself sometimes or when I went into FM mode when the batteries are low. I also noticed that the FM reception was poor overall.<p>With the firmware upgrade for the SonicBlue website, I think the FM reception has gotten a lot better, and the lockups and resets are all but nonexistent now. <p>I highly recommend this product, but remember to get the firmware.<p>The five star rating is for after the firmware upgrade.<br>(Plus it's really cute looking, I like to hug it, ha ha)

<Date>Sun May 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've got the Rio Sport (S30S) and I LOVE IT.  Mine says on the package, "Upgradeable up to 576 MB using SD or MMC memory Cards - and I don't know why it says 192mb on this site... Check that out if you are thinking about buying!<br>Store Prices as of Mid May around all around...bucks and some refurbs are available around $... Visit [the website] for more info about all that jazz.  Good luck in your purchase.  I hope you will enjoy it and that it may inspire you (as it has me) to continue good health!!<br>P.S. The included software really isn't that great, but you can use WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER to "copy to cd or device" and just have the Rio sport as your device... that works wonderfully easy!

<Title>Too much work
<Date>Mon May 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My brief affair with this player lasted about a week, then we broke up.  I wasn't interested in a high maintenance relationship.<p>It all started on the download.  I couldn't get the software to install properly, and the single sheet of instructions provided was NOT helpful.  ...<p>The software seemed easy enough and I enjoyed the player for a while but was constantly readjusting the ear peices to get better sound.  After a trip to the gym, I knew I'd take it back as the ear peices were awful.<p>Perhaps this player would better suit a Mac user for an easier download, and perhaps the ear plugs could be replaced, but I wasn't ready to invest anymore in this bumpy ride...

<Title>A nice MP3 player
<Date>Mon May 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased the S30S after looking at the other MP3 players, to replace my aging Nomad MP3 player.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.  Compared to my older MP3 player, the S30S is better in every respect.  <p>Granted, the S30S doesn't have as much internal memory as other MP3 players, but it accepts MMC (MulitMediaCard) memory cards up to 128MB.  With the firmware upgrade (available at the website), this unit will now support SD memory cards up to 512MB.  <p>The included music manager software is a barebones (and mediocre) file manager designed to get mp3s and WMA files to and from the device.  It is much easier to use Windows Media Player to copy the files - it will even tell you what files won't fit when you max out the memory.  <p>Originally, FM radio reception was fair to poor, but it wasn't even a consideration when I purchased it.  It was greatly improved by the firmware upgrade.  I still don't use the FM receiver.  <p>I would recommend a pair of comfortable headphones.  The headphones that were included were uncomfortable to me.  Depending on the shape of your ear you may or may not suffer discomfort.  In either case, I would recommend a higher quality set of headphones.  <p>Several other reviews mentioned that the device power cycled.  Beware copy protected music files.  Attempting to play a copy protected Microsoft media file will cause the device to power cycle.   I discovered this the hard way and was about to return the player until I figured out that the files I had purchased from a music vendor were copy protected.  There are no error messages, no errors, the S30S just quits and reboots.  Since I discovered this, the unit has performed flawlessly. <p>Also, check the firmware version and upgrade if possible.

<Title>Nice player, but it has shortcomings
<Date>Sun Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Pros:<br>- Sound is great<br>- Ease of use is great<p>Cons:<br>- Armband and belt clip are cheap<br>- Plastic belt clip (which you need if you want to use the arm band) is nearly impossible to remove without scratching the device<br>- Radio reception is really poor (this might be because I tossed the earbuds that came with the player and used my Sony behind-the-neck headphones instead - I've never found earbuds that produce good sound)<p>This player certainly seemed to have potential when I read about it here at Amazon.  I've been on the hunt for a good player for what seems like years now.  After buying this player and using it for a few days, I am now painfully ($$$) aware that the hunt continues.<p>Can't anyone make a good player &lt;b>for the gym&lt;/b> that has lots of memory, gets good radio reception, and most importantly, sounds good?  This is just frustrating.<p>By the way, the new Nike/Phillips players are great, but they don't combine the mp3 part with the radio part.  I have a Nike/Phillips PSA radio.  It's a really good device, but I wish it had the ability to play mp3s as well.

<Content>I was shopping for mp3 players when the rio s30s caught my eye. Im one of the few mac users so this was perfect because it was mac compatible.When i plugged it into my computer and installed itunes i was already adding songs into it. For those of you who are a little behind on technology this is pretty straightforward.it has decent space to begin with but it is expandalbe.All you need is an MMC card or a SD card to increase the memory.To top this all off this thing is built like a tank! ive dropped a cuopple of times on stone tiles and it was fine. It could have easily ben made water proof but tkats fine.I highly suggest buying this mp3 player!

<Content>I bought this after trying several others, and for me it's great. The interface software is excellent and easy to use. You can defintely get by only referring to the quick start guide, although an entire manual is on the CD.<p>The sound is very good and the ear buds are very good too - I like the way they fit my ears. I primarily used this while lifting in the gym or doing some cario work, and they work out perfectly. For under $80.00, this is quite a bargain considering what else is out there. <p>Very highly recommended!

<Title>BackLight Buzz on the FM?
<Date>Mon May 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The FM radio is OK, but it buzzes any time the backlight comes on. Customer service neither knows their product or offers a solution. Their solution is for me to try to fix it by going to their website and updating the firmware. This is brand new and they want me troubleshoot it and fix it. How about making a product that works out of the box. This is another example of a product with alot of Hype, and poor execution. This product would get good rating if it was free of that backlight buzz.

<Title>Product problems - don't buy
<Date>Fri Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have bought two of these devices, and both have failed.  They just stop working.  Customer service is a disaster.  It took me three days and conversations with three people for them to agree to replace one of my non-working players.  Then, I got a call from a fourth person saying they had to charge me.  Two other people didn't return my calls over two days, and in the end, it took me five days, conversations with six people, and a total of two hours to get the problem resolved, and even then, I still have to pay to get them to fix their non-working product.  Avoid this company as poor product reliability combined with unhelpful time-consuming customer service is a disaster.

<Title>My Rio S30S Review
<Date>Sat Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Had this Mp3 player two weeks and the volume up botton stopped working, I took the player apart and resoldered the micro switch and that solved the problem.   As I'm electronic technician this wasen't much of a problem for me but to all others considering  this product beware the construction of this thing is hardly rugged. On the plus side it has great sound and the battery life is pretty good, it also supports low bitrate files which is why I bought it.  Hope my little review helps with your buying decision.

<Title>Great Except for MMC Compatibilities
<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had this mp3 player for almost about a year now and so far it has been really worth my money. Talking about the cost it is cheap and the performance is great save for i have to constantly buy new batteries, i guess the power consumption of this player is not that efficient.   I also bought myself a new 256Mb MMC and its quite frustrating to know that the player can only detect 128Mb while searching for additional info, the official support site said that it can support upto 1Gb. I upgraded to the latest firmware and yet it can only detect upto 128.  Aside from my MMC frustration, this device works perfectly well i dropped it several times and yet its still functioning properly except for the FM tuner. Im located here in the Philippines and the only radio stations who have good reception can be heard properly.   I considered buying a new mp3 player but i just settled for a new MMC since after a year this player still works fine for me. I can appreciate help for my MMC problems and i hope the support releases better versions of the firmware to support MMCs.

<Title>A fantastic little thing
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I love this mp3 player! I've had it for about 1 1/2 years. It has been through a lot, and it's still working fine. If you bought one, you probably wouldn't abuse it as much as I did. Mine has been through drops, some water, and just some general wear and tear, but all it has to show for it is a few scratches! One of the reasons I chose Rio was because of the large screen, with which I could see much of the info about the song, like the artist and album. Many others have only one line of info, and you must wait for it to scroll or something like that. Also, the rubber outside is a plus. It feels very nice, and has a nice grip. It could definetely have more memory, but since it has a memory card slot, it isnt really a problem for me. Some of the new Rio players, and many other mp3 players, have a stick control, where one stick controls all of the play/pause etc. This Rio has a larger control pad, which I find to be much easier to use. The FM tuner...is a piece of junk. I could only get 5 or so stations that were remotely clear. Also, the stopwatch is very hard to use. You have to go through the menu and select your stopwatch mode in order to start/stop your stopwatch. Then, if you want to go back to your player mode, you must go through the menu again. But overall, this mp3 player is definetly worth the money.

<Content>This is a great cheap player, nice interface.  You can add the one gigabyte SD cards.  (I bought a 1 gig Sandisk for cheap), you may need to update the firmware (you should anyway, it is very easy to do).  Only took off a star because the SQ while excellent was not up the the Rio Karma I own (I guess that is expected as that may be the best sounding DAP on the market).   SQ overall is great but I want everything for nothing and dont hand out 5 stars :)

<Title>Best value for the price!
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Rio S30S Sport for about 3 weeks now. I absolutely love it. It is small, weighs almost nothing, and stores more than enough music to cover my daily workouts for more than a week. The software that comes with it is very good. Makes downloading songs to the Rio very easy and was very intuitive . . . never had to look in the help files or read the manual. If you buy this product, you will want to plan on buying an SD card as well. I believe the maximum this Rio Sport will take is a 256MB card, but that size holds a lot of songs.   My only complaint about this item is that when I clip it to my belt, I sometimes bump the stop position on the round toggle with my hand. (This never happens if I attach it to my left side, so I am attributing that problem to a weird right-hand swing!) It comes with a plastic clip-on case and an arm-band. I'm a walker, so the arm-band would be an overkill for me. But I'm sure joggers would find that works better for them.

<Content>Don't consider this over a similar MP3 Player because of the FM tuner.  The reception is miserable.  Besides that drawback, this is a nice product.  It's small and lightweight and great for working out.  The display is large and bright, and it's very user friendly.  It's very easy to transfer songs from a computer to the player.

<Date>Sat Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This player sounds like a great deal: expandable, radio included, perfect for the gym.  BUT once you get it out of the box the honeymoon is over.  The buttons aren't as solid feeling as they should be.  The menu isn't that great, and like many have said before the radio is a joke unless you live very close to the towers.  Sound quality is ok, but the real nightmare began when I connected it to my computer (win98).  I installed the driver, and the Rio music management software.  But once I connected the player, it flipped from recognizing the device, to not recognizing it every 5 seconds.  The help line, which is a long distance number-on hold for 40 minutes-ended up telling me that my computer was the problem.  Long story short, I returned it the next day and got the Nike psa 64.  It works perfectly.  Guess it's not my computer.

<Title>Not recomended
<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this primarily to use for running. The sound quality was nothing to brag about with the headphones provided. However when I used my old headphones I was very impressed with the sound. The FM reception is a joke but it's good enough to use in a gym that broadcasts the TV audio through FM. My big problem is that the unit will shut down or reboot itself in the middle of a workout. At first I thought maybe the battery was low or loose but replacing it didn't help. Customer service was useless so this unit is going back. It's a shame because the unit has all the features I want for a good price.

They told me to download latest firmware and flash ROM...that worked - it unlocked the unit and I was able to use unit for several days before it locked up again.
