<Title>Awesome Flash Drive/MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have experienced no problems at all with this nifty gadget.  I even dropped it once while running and it didn't skip a beat (pun intended).  I love this player.  I use it everyday while riding the bus to work.  I even use it to store files for my job.  I work as a computer help desk specialist at a college and I need files to be transferred to computers all over the campus.   The backlight is flawless.  I intended to use it in the dark and I do just that.  Awesome!  128MB is just enough for me.  Excellent Nextar product.  When I first opened the package and inserted it into my computers USB port I was impressed at the speed it was recognized.  Then it's drag and drop from there.  Just drag you files from your hard drive and drop then into the Removable drive folder that pops up in your "My Computer" just like a normal Flash Drive operates.  I began to listen to the tunes and used my own headphones (Sony) instead of the ones supplied.  I get better stereo sound from them.  I don't even use the supplied USB cable since there's no need.  Just pop off the cap and plug it into you computer.  And another thing: the scrolling music filenames are wonderful.  I love how the song's artist name, album name, and track name are displayed as a marquee (scrolling across the little screen).  Oh and by the way, the screen is crystal clear.  Lovely piece of equipment.  Nextar rocks.

It is very durable and easy to handle.  It is also easy to use, no hi tec things to figure out.  I love that.  We love it and both my kids are very happy.  We first had an Iriver and I couldn't download to save my life.  this was a puiece of cake.

<Title>Great little player for the price
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Doesnt hold a lot of music, but it is small and plays well...battery life above average...I dont use the ear buds it came with, they are not good, but with another set, it sounds better.  This is a decent mp3 player and loading music onto it is super easy, drag and drop.  This is not for someone who wants a lot of music, it only holds about 20 songs.

<Title>works great, but won't play protected files
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player works great, but it will not play wma's purchased from the walmart downloading service (it does play unprotected wma's and mp3's without any problems). This isn't because there's anything wrong with the player, but because of the way they encode their files.

<Title>Very nice product!! Worth the money!!!
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this device, I had initially purchased a $20 CoBy Mp3 player /Usb flash drive which was garbage. This is the total opposite. The device can load up to 3 hrs of music, is easy to carry and I can use it conveniently for working out in the gym, running and playing soccer. I am glad to have coughed up an extra 10 bucks for this device. It has not failed even with the sweat that I grease it with everyday and keeps my ear full with the music I need to keep me working.

<Title>Nice price but not reliable
<Date>Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had one of these for a while now, it worked well for what I got it for (listening for a few podcasts while taking a walk followed by delete and re-load), but it proved a bit unreliable...it comes with a warning that it can get fried by static electricity: they haven't done a good job of shielding it. And, true enough, it got zapped several times when I used it in the winter, due to static from my polyester coat (when I took a walk) and from my blankets (when I used it to listen in bed before turning in). It still more-or-less works, but sometimes restarts unpredictably...it's hard to listen to a podcast when the player re-boots half way through several times and you keep losing your place.  The other down side is no built-in battery...powering it with triple-a batteries gets to be quite a pain: if you want to be able to use it on a regular basis, you have to buy 4 batteries. Only very expensive chargers allow you to charge one battery by itself (since this is a budget DAP, buying an expensive battery charger for it would be a total waste), so you have to drain both batteries in a pair before you can re-charge it, which means you can't charge your batteries when you want them ready unless you have a second pair. In addition to the hassle, the cost of the batteries (+ charger if you don't have one) also makes this (and other bring-your-own-battery DAPs) more expensive than you may realize.

<Content>I bought this for my 7 year old nephew and he loved it.  It was easy for him to use.  It was available in cool colors.  It even worked great, until he dropped it in the toilet!

<Title>Nextar lemon
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have three of these.  The blue one just stopped working for no apparent reason.  I've changed the batteries but no change.  Also I hate that the on button is soooo sensitive!!!  Sometimes it gets turned on accidently.  I guess that's the price you pay for the price you pay...I do wish I knew what was wrong with the blue one.

<Title>Wish I bought an ipod
<Date>Sat Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item for my five year old son since he was always after my ipod. However, I don't believe this item to be easy to use at all. My music is imported on itunes and I could not convert the files to MP3 format. We also had a hard time trying to figure out how to use the buttons and features. The item has many features, but it takes some time to figure out. If you don't have MP3 or WAV files of music, I suggest sticking with the ipod. A shuffle costs about 79 bucks, but so much easier to use.

<Title>Great for Kids! Easy to Use
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these for myself and one for my 10 yr old. SUPER easy to download songs w/ media player and I am usually not able to figure those things out! Does NOT hold a lot of songs (maybe 20??) but just enough for us. Very durable so far, uses 1 AAA battery, comes w/ decent earphones. My 4 yr old has drug mine around and has yet to ruin it:) A great price, and I don't have to worry if it gets stolen on the school bus.
