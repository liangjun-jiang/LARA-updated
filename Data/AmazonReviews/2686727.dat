I purchased it solely for music but may play with some of the other features eventually.   It's not quite perfect:   * I haven't yet found a case for it (but a small $10 Case Logic case for a digital camera works fine for now);  * FM radio is a bit scratchy but I can live with it;  * There's a lanyard strap hole but no lanyard (what would it cost them?  4 cents?);  * It will only charge via the proprietary USB cable (but I'm not likely to spend 30 hours in the woods with it so it's no problem to recharge it).  But darn close: * Great design, seemingly sturdy, fun to just poke and discover all the features; * Intuitive - I'm no gear head and this is my first mp3 player but I managed to organize and load songs without consulting the online manual; * Easy navigation - folks complained that the screen on the T9 was too sensitive but I haven't had any problems with the T10 and find it easy to move around the menus; * Great sound, includes both preset and custom EQ settings.  I don't care for ear buds but several different headphones sound sweet; * The sample videos that it came with look great; * Nice price.  It's exactly what I wanted and more.  Very much recommended.
