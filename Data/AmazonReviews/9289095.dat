<Title>almost perfect...

<Content>i think that i'm the first person ever in the world to review this player...  i looked everywhere for a review to see if i should buy this thing or not, but couldn't find any...  so i went for it anyways...  it's a nice small player, and worth it for the price, there's only one really big thing that you people might find small, but, there's no clip or anything for when you run...  it's like you made a leather case for the thing, can't you add a little clip?  it's not that hard... secondly, you have to go into the menu to access the volume and the hold function, which is weird...  and the headphones they give with it, are actually pretty nice...  pretty good sound...  it looks really nice too, i just really wish there was a clip man...  now i gotta hold it in my hand when i run, which sucks... oh well...

<Title>Joy Be Player is a Joy!

<Content>The JoyBe MP3 player is about portability (hang it on your neck) and ease of use.  It holds 32 tracks, which is enough for the length of my workouts!  With Windows XP, you just use Microsoft Explorer to transfer files.  You need to set up file order by naming convention in Explore.  Then scroll through files on the Joy Be.  Titles show up on the screen.  The USB connection is integrated into the unit -- no extra cords necessary -- just like a memory stick.  The menu is simple, the "reset" works, the unit seems rugged enough to last as long as its battery.   Lowlights:  There is no charge level indicator, volume is 2nd level menu, the USB connector is probably the mechanical weak spot of the unit.  The earphones are not comfortable for me, but sound OK. I do wish for more storage, but plan to wear this player out first!

<Content>for the money this is great! I agree with the other reviews about getting to the volume...but not that big of a problem when you get use to it. I was really happy to see it arrive with all the accessories.  This is a great gift idea for kids/teens that want their first MP3 player. The leather case looks cool but no clip, and no way to turn player off/on when in the case. You can however reach the pause/play feature when in the case. Nonetheless I give it FOUR STARS for an awesome bargain. and it sounds great too!
