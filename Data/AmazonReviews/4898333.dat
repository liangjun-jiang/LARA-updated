<Title>A little gem!
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Creative Muvo is a great little mp3 player.  Easy to transfer files from the computer.  Although tiny in size it produces excellent sound quality.  The one AAA battery lasts ages.  The scroller, used for accessing menu options, takes a little bit of practise.  Excellent value for money for a quality mp3 player.

<Title>An average player at a good price
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had the Creative Zend Nano 1GB before and the first impression after opening the new player straight from the box is this think is bigger! Though the MuVo has a great advantage over Nano with the built-in USB for connecting to Win PCs with no hassle, no cables. The major issues with the USB is its speed - it took 20 minutes for 300mb to be copied. It will pose a problem if in a hurry and want to refresh your library in a timely manner.  This is the first impression after opening the box and plugging the Muvo to a PC.

<Title>Vastly Improved
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my 3rd Muvo player.  Things that made me a repeat purchaser: ------------------------------------------ + Extremely compact (Roughly the size of a cigarette lighter) + One handed navigation + Excellent battery life (About 16-20 hours on a single AAA) + Crisp, Clear Audio + Customizable EQ + No cables necessary to connect to a computer + No need to install proprietary software (Works like a flash drive)  Improvements with this model: ----------------------------- + 2 GB Capacity + Now features lyrics and 'libraries' for organization + More compact + More customization options + Lyrics display (if you're willing to supply the file)  Complaints with this model: --------------------------- - When you go to skip a folder, it doesn't bring you to the folder that's currently playing, as in previous models, but the very first one in the list.  Somewhat annoying. - No key ring attachment (But there are holes to attach a strap)

<Title>Great player for 90 days, then it died
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Neat little player that worked great for me for almost 3 months.  Then it dies for no apparent reason other than it is poorly made junk.  You hit the scroll wheel and it turns off.  I wish the power button worked half as well.  I'm shopping for a new player but it won't be one from Creative.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the best small mp3 player that I ever had, I bought it for recording my song from the guitar then it becomes my favorite mp3 player, I have a IPOD 20gb but it's bulky and don't have sound recording and it has no file browsing, you have to open terrible  Itunes to upload a single song and you have to add mp3 tags for each songs. it's a pain. But with creative you just plug the usb cable and upload your musics like an another harddrive, you don't need to add mp3 tags, it reads the file name. Record from the microphone or line in it's great. I am sure you are not expecting studio quality it's only good for quick guitar demo.  also it's works with AAA battery, I don't need to wait for charging like IPOD, I have AAA battery charger and 4 AAA batteries, I replace the batteries then the old one is died. I am carrying one extra AAA wiht me and I am always in tune.  it is very light and comes with arm band, perfect for trade mill.  Only thing is lcd screen is small and it's hard to use the navigation button if you have large fingers. I don't mind but my friends father didn't like it.  I think they shouldn't call it creative nano, because it's better then nano, it should have unique name like Creative IHateIPOD :)

<Title>A review with the blind or visually impaired in mind.
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>(I'd like to see more reviews which talk of access issues, similar to the following review.) First I'll give the pluses.  What I consider a plus for the MuVo V-100 is the direct plug and play access without any stinkin' proprietory software to muck around with.  That, to me, is more a must than a plus! Second plus, although, not necessarily anything real big or important, is the fact one can take this equipment apart and just use the guts of the unit, when separated from the battery pack, as a thumb drive. Third plus and must, is the multiple level directories one can work with, the way mp3 players should work in mine humpble opinion, not this single directory junk where the device does it's own numbering system according to when each file was loaded into the player.  That's a big fat minus where the Ipod shuffle, or any other device like that is concerned.  Fourth plus is, of course, the space at 2 gigabytes.  Now for the minuses, which are unfortunately way more than the plusses. Firstly, there are only four buttons or switches on this device, volume up and down, scroll switch, and play/power button. So, right there, you know that the scroll switch is going to be the main controlling factor on this unit as far as moving from track to track, or going through menues which I'll get to in a bit. Secondly, no audio feedback, of course, unless you stay in "Music" or maybe "recorded tracks," and you turn the device on by holding the play/power button for roughly five seconds, then wait for the unit to boot up, which can take upwards of 12 seconds, depending upon how much data is stored. As for the menues -- which are accessed by pressing the scroll switch -- they do not default.  So, even if you memorize the menues, you have to remember where the heck you left off at.  So, if you left off at Microphone, there's a possibility that once you manage to turn the device on, you might be continuing the recording.  Oh, to select what you want in a menu, you press the scroll switch again.   And, of course, there is no audible monitor through the headset when you record.  So, of course, you have to ask a sighted person if the recorder is going. Oh, speaking of having a sighted person help, what is with these stupid symbols rather than actual written text stating where one is in the menues? Furthermore, what is with this bad habit of these devices that stay in a menu for no more than maybe 5 seconds at the most?  For someone trying to help a blind person out, or for someone with difficulty with focus issues, that just does not work, people!  Hellllllllo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As for recording, the quality is poor.  Now, I'm taking into consideration the fact that the recordings are being done in low bit-rate wave files.  However, the recording volume -- or maybe it's the volume setting used for "recorded tracks" -- is very much lacking. We won't discuss how badly put together the mannual provided on the accompanying CD-rom was.  No step by step instructions on how to work the device, just some cursory explanation of some of the features. So, here's my final grading of the MuVo V-100 by Creative.   I give it an A for concept, an A for space,,  However, for ease of use and accessibility, I give it a D minus. Why a D minus rather than an F for accessibility?  Well, as long as you stay in "music" and as long as you don't accidentally press the scroll switch before moving it left or right to go from track to track, or for scanning tracks, then you're okay.  Secondly -- for folks who are left handed, one can go into the settings menu and rotate the display.  I guess that can actually be a help if a blind person is getting help from a sighted person and it makes it easier for the sighted person to se the screen. Creative seemed to have had a neat idea when they made the first MuVo with no display.  However, I got the impression that those particular models were lacking in space.

<Title>Just okay
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a few other flash players and, in comparison, this is the poorest purchase.  I bought it because it plays audible and fits a niche between my 1g players and my much larger ones.  The sound of the music is comparable to the other players.   The cons for me are as follows:  1. I always lock my player both while listening and while off.  The muvo's lock is  in the settings section rather than being a simple switch.  That makes it inconvenient to lock quickly. 2. Transferring files to the muvo takes much longer than with the other players.   3. The usb needs to connect directly to the computer- not to a hub.  It's thicker than a regular usb connection.  On my computer the way the usb ports are set up, it took up two slots. 4. The navigation system is similar to the one on my Iriver t10 but not as stable. 5. A minor complaint is that it came with no case or arm strap. The size is comparable to the Iriver t10  and to the Sansa both of which come with cases. For someone who is new to mp3 players, I would recommend the comparably prices Sansa m250.  It is far simpler to use and has similar features with fewer negatives.  An update: I've been using this player now for a few months.  Far from growing on me, I am even more unhappy with it.  I'd lower my rating if I could.  I alternate between this and my older 1GB Sansa.  It takes  20 minutes to transfer 1 book to the Muvo and 5 minutes for the same files with the Sansa.  Possibly the Muvo still uses the defunct 1.1USB format. The 2GB version of my Sansa is the same price as this player and is a far better player. It also has a radio and voice recorder. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-6925435-5758463">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  It works great in every way.  It's also a lot of memory for a great price!  We have already loaded over 300 songs and still have almost half the memory free.  The only negative I would have is that it is a little hard to power up.  You sometimes have to hold the power button down hard to get it to start.

<Title>Isn't recognized by my computer!
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Anyone have trouble with your computer recognizing the USB connection with your MP3 player?  I have tried numerous times to get my computer to recognize the Creative V100 (has the USB built in, no cord) and the computer simply does not see it.  After looking through Creative's web forum, it appears I am not the only one with this problem with this unit.  I've reinstalled the software and even tried plugging the player in without software to see if my PC recognizes it and it doesn't.  I don't have any problems using my USB port when downloading from my digital camera.  I am curious if anyone has had trouble with the SanDisk M250 2 GB.

<Content>C'mon - this is ridiculous. I just bought it. Great unit. Reason I bought was for audio quality. Can't use any of my WMA Lossless? If I had realized that, I would've just bought an iPod for the inferior audio quality. Also, it takes forever to upload it.
