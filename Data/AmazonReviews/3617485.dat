<Title>Compromise between funtionality and useability
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little machine does everything -- Flash video, audio, video, photo, text reader, FM radio, recording with onboard mic, FM, or audio/video in, built in Tetris-like game, it'll copy files off your usb flash drive without a computer, it's got a full-size SD card slot, and a li-poly battery, charges off the usb port, onboard speaker, etc.    This all comes at a price though -- the user interface is, well, bad.  Want to turn off the backlight when playing music?  Press the M button, toggle down to "save power", push toggle in.  You can't read the screen with the backlight off, and if you do anything other than change volume or skip, it comes back on, then you have to go through all that to turn it back off.  Everything works like that -- the speaker is turned on and off in the setup function, and it has no relation to whether the headphones are plugged in.  So you can't pull out the headphones and let your friends hear what you're listening to without leaving the music player, going to setup, turning on the speaker, going back to music, etc.  You get the idea.  EVERYTHING works like that!  It'll do dang near anything if you've got the patience to go through all the steps.  I bought it because it was the cheapest mp3 player that'll display a .txt file so I can read e-books at lunch.  The e-book reader is really simple.  It wraps the l ine after 23 characters  -- period.  So most li nes end with a split wo rd, like this.  Nine li nes per page, if there's a bookmark function I can't find it.  You have to press the M button to see what page number you're on, memorize it, then select that page again when you come back.  Also the "Dictionary Function" is a myth -- it's nowhere to be found, and there's no firmware update on Coby's site.  At least the letters are big and easy to read.  But it was only a hundred and twenty clams in Jan. '07 and it does a little bit of everything. (Oh, and it's really got the 1Gb, not 512Mb.)

<Title>Product needs more improvements
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player with the intention of downloading and watching movies in my free time. I wouldn't recommend this product for video reproduction because of the following reasons:  1. When the movie is playing you can notice a small delay every 3 or 4 seconds and the images don't move    smoothly.There was not improvement after replacing the standard SD with the Ultra SD card.  2. Files (movies) larger than 300 mb are not loaded from the flash card. You have to reset the unit since it    never starts playing the video.  3. The converter that comes with the CD has limitations regarding the frame rate and the picture size(width,      length). Also not all the files that were converted work necessarily in the player.  4. Any movie that carries the new HDTV picture size is rejected or not processed by the software.  5. Movies that were converted by Blaze Video Magic (Coby software) work very fine in other players like Zen Vision.  The other player functions like MP3 music, FM radio, voice recording, browser and document reading seem to be working within their own limitations. I was surprised after watching a 90 minutes movie that the battery indicator still did not show any discharge.
