<Title>WOW! THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO MUSIC!
<Date>Sun Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!

<Title>The first MP3 Handheld available on the Consumer market
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I had high hopes for the Diamond Rio and it certainly lived up 2 the hype. Lightweight and excellent quality with some good connecting software. My only gripe can be with memory. You definately need another 32Mb to store  your music. If you want one, my advice is to wait for the new upgraded  version with 64Mb and a graphic equaliser!

<Title>Next Millenium Consumer Electronics
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<p>Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3). This makes  its use and performance comparable with other CD-quality playing devices  while putting the power of the internet into the palm of your hand. If you  want to make a statement of &quot;being digital&quot;, the RIO is a must!

<Title>Brilliant!
<Date>Tue Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Remember when the Walkman hit the market years ago?  At first it was fad, then it became a craze before finally becoming as ubiquitous as taxi cabs in Manhattan.  The Diamond Rio is the first product with the potential to  eventually REPLACE the Walkman.  Think about it - portable music that  sounds as clear as a compact disc from a device that looks and feels like a  pager.  Unshockable, no matter how much you jump around or how bumpy the  bus ride.  This is the perfect gift for your favorite &quot;gadget  junkie&quot;, as long as they have a PC to download from.  Pssst...here's a  secret:  you can record your own CD's into MP3 format and download the  songs into your RIO - it isn't just for internet music!!  Great product.

<Content>Only a half an hour of &quot;near&quot; quality music makes this format seriously flawed. To change music you eventually have to upload new music, i.e. a huge inconveneince when a computer is available. Mini disc is also  shock proof, recordable, near cd quality but in addition you can change  music with out the inconvenience of uploading music from a computer.

<Content>I've had my Rio for about 4 months.  The other day I went to download some songs to it, and now it says that it only has 16mb of memory.  I don't know what happened to it.<p>Also, the 32mb of memory is not enough if you're like me and use the player all day.  If I bought another mp3 player to replace this broken one, it would have to have at least 64 mb of memory.  I could fit a maximum of 8 songs on the Rio.

<Title>Rio excellent player
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I got the Special edition 64 mb's RAM and a 32 MB flash card for 96 MB's of RAM.  Very nice, and skip free so when I work I don't have to worry about skipping like I did on my CD player.  Very compact, easy to fit in a pocket or even better it's got a clip if you don't have pockets.  Some people complain about batteries but I get the same performance out of a single battery in the Rio than 2 in a CD player.  It's not an issue to me anyway since I use rehargable batteries, but some complain anyway.  Download speeds to the Rio are pretty good, would like a faster download time though.  Anyone think of Firewire or USB?  As far as durability I accedentally dropped it on concrete and it still works perfectly.  Overall a fine product, I'd pick it up again after my experience with it.

<Title>Great little device for short duration play
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I got my Rio PMP 300 from my employer as a gift.  It was my first exposure to MP3, as up to that point I had been dismissing it as a fad.  Having the device, and about 150 CD's, I figured why not give it a shot.<p>The installation of the software went smooth.  I found an update, and installed that as well with no problems.  Then I started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable.  I was running on Windows NT, which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer, but with some caveats.  I would start ripping and the software would crash.  I would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash.  I would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didn't actually make it.  Bottom line - the connectivity for this device was pathetic.<p>But speaking for the device itself - I loved it.  The music played cleanly, without interruption, regardless of how much I shook the device.  The buttons on the front are well placed, well labeled, and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access, but you don't have to worry about them protruding.  It has all the features you might want including random and repeat.  The display let's me know how much memory I have, what track number is playing, and the time of the song.  There are also various other indicators that are helpfull (battery, etc.).<p>The memory on this device is small - 32Mb.  And the manufacturer says it will only support up to 64Mb total with an expansion card.  That expansion card can hold it's own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory.  However, vendor chose the odd memory type of 3.3V for the external memory versus typical CompactFlash.  <p>There's a convenient &quot;lock&quot; switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering.  This can be good in two ways: it won't get turned on accidentally and burn battery, and you won't accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening.  The belt clip is handy, and detachable, and the battery life (one AA) is quite respectable.<p>In all, I really love my Rio PMP 300.  It's perfect for a trip to the gym, a jog around the neighborhood, or even for a short plane flight.  If all you need is an hour (30 mins on internal memory alone at a 128 sample rate) to pass the time, then you really don't need to spend more - this is the perfect device.

<Content>I've had my player for just over a year.  No problems!  No skipping, doesn't have a mind of its own.  In otherwords, the play options (random...) never switch on me without my promt.  It functions very well.  Battery uses quickly.  It's only just very recently that it's beginning to die on me.  It plays, then won't.  It's something to do with the battery and the connection.  Also, the screen is fading from the top down.  This may be to slight rain sprinkles, or its visit to a sandy beach in the Turks (this occured in February though).  I am getting another!

<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This seemed like such a great idea: music that won't skip; I can record what I want. Then I got it.<p>The software is far more complicated than it needs to be, and it's unbearably time-consuming to put everything you want on the machine.<p>Then it there's not enough memory to record all you'll need for a long enough stretch.<p>I could go on for pages but won't waste your time with it. My last straw, however, was when, after I'd purchsed some additional memory, the lid to hold the battery in won't close. So the little, grandly over-priced toy is a total waste. <p>Stick to your CD player. Maybe it's not all the up-to-date, i.e., the hi-tech industry has replaced it with this little thing. But you'll enjoy it more.

<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>while this is truly great product which I enjoy. The limited playback time hinders the Rio. If your going to have mp3's on your computer it's more convient to use winamp for free then spend 170 for a portable version. It's  easier just to hook your audio output to your stereo and make mix tapes,  yes tapes then waste your time with the Rio. I suggest waiting for the next  portable player with at least 60 min. of playback otherwise, keep to the  tapes.

<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I was given a Rio as a gift, and I really thought I wouldn't use it, but it's been incrediably handy.  I now take it with me whenever I go jogging, because, unlike a c.d. player, it never skips. You can also easily move  between and within songs, unlike a cassette Walkman.  My only problems with  it is it takes longer than I thought it would to download songs to the Rio  from my computer.  Also, it's pretty hard to find free, *good* downloadable  MP3s on the Web (you'll get lots of porn sites when you try).  But to make  a mix from your c.d.s to take on the road with you is great.  The battery  doesn't last a super long time (about 12 hours I think), but it only takes  one.  I've recommended the Rio to friends, and I really enjoy mine.

<Title>Not bad, but far away from best
<Date>Tue Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Weve seen it so many times. Companies make a product that lookspretty cool, give it a name that most people will remember, andadvertise a lot.  Then it WILL sell, dosent matter how good the product actually is. RIO is a good example of that. And it was easy to do such a thing becourse the other portable mp3-players on the market are pretty anonymous. They dont advertise that much. Probably cuz they want to focus on doing a great player. Like the first portable mp3-player, MPMan. Its out in a new version that is far better than the RIO-player. It has flash memorycards, is easy to deal with and does even support other fileformats for storing. The main problem with mp3-players is the amount of space for storing music. To get near cd-quality you got to have 128kbps or more(156 recommended). The best solution to this right now i think is a player with a harddisk or cd-rom built in. Then you can store many hours and hours of music. But it makes a little bigger and more expensive player. So i think the next step from that is flash memory cards. They are small and can store pretty much and best of all they are replaceble. So, summary: Dont buy the RIO-player if not your only demand is to get a small player. Check out the other cool players instead.

<Date>Wed Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I like the rio a lot, my big problem with it is the lack of storage space.  The parallel connection is VERY slow for downloading, maybe next gen will have 64MB and a USB connection.  The thing I like the most about my rio is  the fact that I don't have to carry my valuable CD collection around in my  car where they can easily be damaged by sunlight, mishandling or worse yet,  stolen.  With a cheap adapter I can plug my rio straight into my car  casette deck and I only have to worry about the rio getting stolen, not  $100's worth of CD's.  <p>I think the music industry is less worried about  the MP3 market stealing music as it is the Rio market stealing sales for  replacement CD's that are easily damaged or stolen.  Now the CD's I buy  stay locked up safely in my house.

<Date>Fri Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Now don't get me wrong, I'm a big advocate of mp3, but I think that even with additional (and expensive) flash cards, Rio doesn't haven't have as much memory as I need. I really don't like listen to music at 64kbps,  although that rate is perfect for talking. 128kps is good enough for most  songs, but Rio only can take 30 minutes of music at that rate. I do  congradulate Diamond for the size and design of the Rio, however. There  already is a newer version that has double the space, but it looks like an  iMac. (Boo!)<p>One thing to watch out for is a tiny little hard drive  called Microdrive from IBM. It holds 340 Mb, which is good four about 6  hours of music at 128kps, and 12 hours at 64k. Expect that around  Christmas.

Although the headphones it came with have absolutly  no bass boost I would recomend buying your own pair. The software it comes  with cannot get any easier. To get songs onto the Rio from your computer is  so easy and takes VERY little time, about 15 seconds per song! This is a  great product and IS durable, I have dropped it numerous times and it works  FINE. It has never skipped... won't.

<Title>cool technology but don't run out and buy one just yet
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>MP3 players are truly a great idea, but this product is not very practical.  It only has 32MB of memory and the upgrade cost is almost like buying another whole player.  I enjoy using mine for exercising - it's  light and doesn't skip.  However, it is very touchy/quirky.  Don't bump it  or the whole thing will turn off.  And sometimes it will automatically  pause play even when I have the &quot;hold&quot; feature engaged.  The  technology is great, and I'd like to upgrade but I'm going to wait until  players can hold more memory or until MP3s can be further compressed.  This  would be one of the coolest products ever if it could hold your entire  library of music.  For those of you that can't wait that long, go for at  least 64MB.

<Title>Can't believe other reviews
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>First of all, I have used software named &quot;Streambox&quot; to cut down the size of my files.  So, instead of playing the selection at 128 kbs, I have cut it down to 16 kbs.  Believe me, the quality does not deteriorate  that much!  By doing this, I now can hold 100 tunes (mine are all jazz)--50  on each of my two 32 mb modules.  If I choose to do so, I just cut down on  the number of tunes, for example to 47, and replace them with three old  radio shows.  As long as I keep the number of selections at 50 or less and  do not exceed the 32 mb on each module, there is no problem.  Now for the  negative--Yes, it is rather cheaply made.  Bump it and it will turn off;  the battery compartment is not well thought out.  But, if you have problems  within the warranty period (one year), Diamond will replace the unit.  One  more thing--the cost of the 32 mb modules is beginning to drop.  I would be  lost without my Rio!

<Title>lacking memory
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>when I first received my Rio for my 16th birthday I was excited, as well as a little doubtful.  could such a tiny device live up to all its claims?  well, it's been a little over a year, and my Rio and I are constantly  attached at the hip.  it's little, it's light, it doesn't skip when I  exercise, and the software is so easy to use that even my mother has  figured it out.  the only drawback is that the onboard memory is limited to  32mb, which, for me, just isn't enough.  I can only squeeze between 6 and  12 CD quality (128 kb/s) songs on at a time, so I always feel like I need  to change the songs halfway through my day.  my advice is to splurge and  shell out the extra cash for the special edition Rio 300 with twice the  onboard memory (64mb), or even better wait for the Rio 800, which should be  out soon, and promises to be the best Rio yet.

<Title>Good Value
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Many people like to criticize the Rio 300 (and the newer model,the 600) because it only comes with 32MB of memory.  While thiscriticism is valid, I'd like to point out that the Rio 300 (and other 32MB players) are considerably CHEAPER than their newer 64MB siblings. ... <p>Think about it, folks, ...  A 32MB SmartCard, if you search around online, only costs about [30% of a 64 MB player].  If you're that upset about the skimpy memory on the Rio 300, simply shell out the extra sixty bucks and you'll still have saved yourself fifty-plus dollars.<p>As for memory, you can gain more music space on your player if you DON'T transfer songs at high bit rates.  For example, I typically transfer my songs (from an origianl CD) at 112 kps (CD quality) and sometimes at 96kps (near CD-quality, and believe me you can't tell the difference).  In short, I love my Rio 300 and will soon buy extra memory for it and still have money left over in my pocket.

I must say that the Rio is efficient on batteries, has very good sound with very little distortion (if it's distorted, it's probably the ripper/encoder that made the MP3), and since it's completely electronic with no mechanical parts, it obviously never skips.  I run with mine and use it in the car with a cassette adapter, and I love how light it is.  Despite all these pluses, there are a few things the wary consumer should know:..As for mechanics, the Rio 300 has limited onboard memory - I get along fine with the 32 MB, but at times, especially on long trips, I wish I could play more than about 3/4 of a CD at 128bps (about &quot;CD quality&quot;).  Be ready to shell out more for that flash memory add-on.  The case on the Rio 300 is relatively fragile.  Don't count on putting it through a lot of abuse, and be careful with the belt clip, as it may strain the thin plastic - - mine cracked, but a little superglue fixed it and it's fine now.  The bottom line: if you don't have a lot of money but you want that MP3 player, it's a good buy.  As for me, I'm about to convert to a minidisc player/recorder with a USB MP3 adapter.

<Title>Portable relaxation machine
<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've had a PMP300 for a little over a year now, and the only complaint I  have is with the transfer cable. I had to return the first unit I got as  the cable was defective, and now it seems to be failing again.<p>I have a  32 meg flash card, and at 48k bitrate I can store 43 songs on my Rio. I  mostly listen to celtic and classical music to help me relax and drown out  distracting noises, and prefer a larger variety of music to near-CD  quality. 48k is supposedly AM radio quality, but I quess I'm no audiophile  as it works for me.<p>I will probably have to upgrade to a Rio500 or  something similar, but I won't go back to CD or even cassettes. It's small  enough to fit in a shirt or pants pocket, and it is skip-free unless you  bump it fairly hard.

<Title>Very nice gadget, i like mine.
<Date>Sat Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I just got my rio , i got the older version with 32 megs of ram , instead of the new overpriced version with 64 megs. I find 32 megs of ram to be not enough memory for the music i wish to store for trips , or vacations  without computers for example. But for everyday use, I find 30 minutes of  music to be enough for my work day, after work I just upload new music for  the next day. It would be nice if it had more memory though. Now that the  price for the older model is dropped to 100 bucks after rebate I find it a  good value. I really like mine. I recommend it to people who like variety  in their music during everday life, and don't mind changing tracks everyday  or so.

<Date>Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>This product is a GREAT idea. But if you want to get something similar to this that plays MP3's, you should wait a year or two so the memory increases on the product. because right now, it only plays 30 minutes of  music, which is about space for about 5-8 songs. My advice is to get the  MINI-DISC player for now. It will play a very long time's worth of music,  and you can buy MORE blank CD's to record more. Plus you can get songs off  CD's, Tapes, PC, 8-Track, and more! I'm sure there are lots of players for  that you can find at amazon.com.

<Title>Sounds like a good idea.... But leaves much to be desired
<Date>Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I bought my Rio about 2 months ago. It plays perfectly, and I have no complaints with the performance. But if you are going to take this with you as a truely &quot;portable&quot; unit you are going to be stuck with only  30 minutes of storage for cd quality music. Maybe that's not a problem for  you, but personally I need more of a variety of music when I take this on a  trip. And the extra 32-meg flash memory cards cost $100!! That's way too  much just to hold an extra 30 minutes of music. I recently sold my Rio and  purchased a portable Minidsic player/recorder for $275. My advice to people  would be to save an extra $100 and go for the minidisc. It uses digital  sound, and does not skip. You can use it to record mp3's from your computer  and the blank 74 minute discs cost less than $5 a piece, as opposed to $100  for a 30-minute flash memory card for the Rio. Minidisc is a much better  overall value than the Rio. I would not recomend any buy a portable mp3  player until the storage can be greatly increased at a much lower cost.

<Content>I use my &quot;Rio&quot; on my Motorcycle. A CD player obviously is out of the question and the portable walkman AM-FM device loses signal strength at every turn and I don't like tape. I have added the extra 32 meg flash card  to mine to enhance the playing time.<p> I record at 80kbps for good quality  and 1 1/2 hours of music. (on a motorcycle at 60 mph, CD quality isn't my  main concern.) <p>For my application and similar ones I feel the RIO is a  great audio source. The lack of memory is a concern and the flash cards are  expensive. The download time isn't that bad but I would have preferred a  USB connection. The output level is a concern but 12 hrs of playtime on a  single AA battery is great.<p>Don't buy the RIO as a replacement for you CD  player just yet. If you have a need for non-skipping, lightweight and a  small audio source then the RIO is the ticket.

<Content>I borrowed one of these from a neighbor of mine. It's great, and I personally cannot tell the difference between CD and mp3. If you have the internet, it's better, because you can get free music and download other  programs to allow your CD'd to be turned to mp3's, so you can have your own  little megamix. However, there needs to be more RAM, or have something like  an Iomega Zip Drive attached so that you can have more space. But hey, it's  a start! A Great Start into the future of portable music!

<Title>Perfect portable tunes for people who exercise
<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The Rio is absolutely the best device I've ever seen for providing high-quality portable audio to those who work out. It never skips, a single AA battery will keep it playing for at least 8 hours, and it weighs almost  nothing. I used to make tapes to play at the gym, but now I just convert CD  tracks to MP3's and download. The compression software is included, and it  only takes about 15 minutes to compress an entire CD into MP3's. While it  is true that the Rio only plays for about 30 minutes in near-cd quality as  shipped, there is a slot for an extra 32MB flash card which doubles the  playing time. This extra memory costs about $90, but it's worth the price.  The Rio also ships with a $50 rebate coupon from Diamond, although I've  been waiting six weeks for my rebate check. All in all, if you're looking  for convenient, rugged high-quality portable audio for your workouts the  Rio is the device of choice.

<Title>The first mp3 player ever is a big hit!
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I read a lot of what other people have been saying about the diamond rio.  For the most part, the reviews have been good, but when they weren't good, they were BAD.  I don't understand how someone can complain about the rio  just because they can't install it on their computer, or they didn't look  at the computer requirements.  Or if they mistreated it...  The sound  quality on this is excellent.  For those people who said it is NEVER cd  quality sound could never be more wrong.  The Diamond rio can actually be  above cd quality sound, depending on the speed of your encoder.  I was  almost completely satisfied with the Diamond Rio, but the 30 minutes of  sound it could hold weren't quite enough, maybe if it just had 45 minutes.   I didn't want to buy a memory card for it because they're about $100, and  it reduces the sound quality by 50%.  I bought this mp3 player last summer,  and i still have it in one piece.  I've dropped it a few times, and had to  make simple repairs, but i've never had to do anything that actually cost  me money.  There are better mp3 players out there now, like the diamond rio  500, and some nomad ones, but they're probably considerably more expensive.   The diamond rio is a bit fragile, and if you drop it, then it will skip,  because the battery could be knocked out of place.  But as long as you're  fairly careful, it'll stay in one piece.  I've been biking with mine,  skateboarding, through the airport, etc...  and as i said before, it still  works.  You might want to shoot for the diamond rio 500, but the price on  this baby is killer.  The only thing that beats an mp3 player, sadly, is a  minidisc player, mainly because you can bring your songs with you, and many  other reasons, but i'm not going to go into that ^_^  the bottom line is,  if you want a VERY small mp3 player which holds FREE downloadable music  from the internet which works on fairly new computer, and is fairly  durable, go for this one!

<Title>Good product, bad support.
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I purchased a Diamond RIO 300 almost a year ago, and I definitely say it has been great.  The one problem I've had was with the battery compartment. When Diamond designed the RIO, they took the duracell ultra batter and  built the RIO around it. Low and behold, the Duracell Ultra tends to be  bigger then most AA batteries, so I had problems when using rechargable  batteries (stupid me, saving the environment) that made the RIO shut down  every time it was bumped.  Diamond addressed this issue in a knowledge base  (which was hard to find) and basically said &quot;shove something in there  to make the battery fit.  I use foil now (which sometimes makes the  compartment pop open, but only when it's in my backpack) and haven't had  much problems yet.  However, Diamond's tech support is very horrible in  trying to get merchandise replaced (which I've tried with my rio and other  diamond products).  I'll probably purchase a RIO 500 just because it has a  better battery compartment design.

<Content>I have this unit with the 32 Meg Flash Card. When I first bought the product, I was running around like a happy fool glad to be ride of my walkman bouncing around my waste on short jogs. After the honeymoon was  over I started to have issues. The software that came with it, was the  music match software.It was good for only a limited number of plays before  expiry.I called diamond and they told me their RIO Port software was to  come out shortly. When the software did come out I found it didn't work  properly on the PMP300. I looked for some help files on &quot;configuration  / troubleshooting &quot; but there was none. Tech support told me this was  a known issue the pmp300 doesn't always show up as a configurable option so  reinstall the software. 3 reinstalls later I still couldn't get the Rio  port software to work, so I gave up and I just reinstall the music match  software when it expires every two weeks. Since then my LCD has become dim  and the plastic belt handle broke. The unit is about a year old now and  cost about 230 $ new.<p> I really like my MP3 player but I will not buy  another RIO .I am looking at alternatives

<Title>Excellent Player that's Easy to Use
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've had my Rio for almost a year now, and it goes everywhere with me. I  have had very few problems with it. The sound is not always perfect, but  errors are few and easy enough to tune out. I have an expansion card for  it, which doubles the memory, but since I've had it, the player has started  to &quot;skip&quot; (that is, every time a certain song is played, it  leaves out a second). It's a great player for running and hiking, though,  because dropping and bouncing it do no damage. That's what I use it for the  most, and I find it to be a far better option than a skipping CD player or  a cassette player. The earphones are useable, and in fact are ideal for the  activities mentioned above. The device can also be hooked up to speakers  through the earphone jack.  MusicMatch Jukebox is the included recording  software. It creates quality mp3s, but may not work well on older computers  or with additional programs open. The Rio Manager software used to download  to the player (which uses an EASY parallel port connection) is  self-explanatory and also serves as a music player on your PC. I've tried  playing music through RealPlayer, MusicMatch, and Napster as well, and in  my opinion, this is the best software. My complaints: there's no radio  tuner, and the player cannot be hooked up to an AC adapter. Being an  environmentally-conscious person, this bothers me. Also, see complaints  about batteries in Michael Slabodnick's review.  Otherwise, it's a great  piece of technology with a lot of possibilities.

<Content>I bought this mp3 player thinking I was going to be on the cutting edge. What i ended up with was an ok piece of hardware that just wasn't worth the money - only 1 hour of music? What a waste! BUT, the worst part was that it  was so flimsy that it broke within the first week! I dropped it about 1  foot - not on a hard floor, but on a soft carpeted floor, and that tiny  fall completely killed it. It wouldn't turn on. So i had amazon.com send me  another one. Guess what happened after i got a new one. The exact same  thing, 2 weeks later. So i returned it for a refund and am now going to  wait for portable mp3 players to get better and cheaper.

<Content>The Rio, for being a first generation MP3 player, is awesome. The design is well thought out, and simple. The audio quality is great at 128kbps, an in general it sounds &quot;right.&quot; I bought it mostly for jogging because I wanted to choose what I listen to. (Anyone who has been  interupted by commercials in a great part of their run can relate, I'm  sure.) I wasn't looking for much, so this meets my expectations. I'm not  much of an audiophile, so the features offered wasn't an issue. Price was,  and . . . for  32mb... I'm happy.<p>I've only had my  Rio for three days, so I can't really comment on durability issues. My one  problem with the player is the headphone jack. It seems to be really cheap,  and so I worry about it being the first thing to fail. The software is  really cutsie, and easy to use. Being what I consider a power user, I'd  rather see it simpler, and more streamlined. All in all, I'm pleased with  my purchase.

<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is REAL. Im 13 years old and i live in Pennsylvania . LISTEN! A VERY good player has good sound and is very portable. There are a few small set backs , the plastic outside is flimsy , stronger than it looks , if u drop it on hard linoleum it will be fine but i wouldnt go mountain biking with  it. The battery case thingy pops open and is poorly designed , if u bump it  too hard it turns off . that can be fixed by putting a small spring inside  or something though.The headphones are ok , they sound decent and are comfy  4 me , the software is decent but i like RealJukeBox better.I wish it had  better EQ but the ROCK setting is good 4 me ( CLASIC setting is best 4 punk  rock). Sometimes the rio doesnt connect to the port cord cuz gunk gets in  the uncovered connection but it can be cleaned( with a Q-tip not with  water).It's easy to set up , if u can use a remote 4 a TV all u need to  know is the port conection which is fast and EZ. Music is of good quality  at 64kbps and free with Napster or Scour Exchange.Battery life is GREAT one  batter has lasted me about two weeks( not with constent but frequent use).  My battery life indicator measures wrong but that doesnt really matter to  me , its no prob . it measures almost dead wen the battery is brand new but  the battery still works.no other complaints. over all a Great product ,  small lightweight , relativly strong. Their are players that record and  have Fm tuners , u can get a FM tuner 4 extra money and u can have it  support other formats 4 more money too .It cant record , but no biggy.with  64kbps u get about 24-30 songs... get a smartmedia card.  i got 32mb  which adds the capacity to about 56-60 songs, but i geuss 16 MB would do.my  bro has an MD rio ranks lower cuz extra memory is expensive but the rio its  self is half that of a MD player. Great product , buy it. Excellent  present.

But there are many differnt programs you can use to accomplish this.  Then  after you have it converted to MP3, send it to the Rio. <p>Looks like  Diamon has released the Diamond Rio SPECIAL EDITION to quell these  complaints about limited playback time.

<Title>Bad sound, expensive media, short recording time
<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I've compared MP3 with MiniDisc and CD.  MiniDisc is nearly indistinguishable from CD; MP3 is not.  Even at 256kbps, MP3 quality is clearly inferior to both MD and CD.  At 128kbps, it isn't &quot;near&quot;  CD at all.<p>Added to that, 30 minutes of audio isn't nearly enough; I  wanted something I could listen to on a six hour plane flight.  An hour's  worth of add-on RAM for an MP3 player is way too expensive when compared  with $2.50 for a blank MiniDisc.<p>Solid-state digital audio may eventually  be the way of the future, but it has a long way to go yet.  The one reason  to get a Rio is if you need something that absolutely will not skip even  when shaken violently.  If you just need something that'll stand up to  jogging, go with MiniDisc.  I did, and I can still download MP3s and dub  them onto discs to listen to portably, so I get the best of both worlds.

I'm so pleased that I've ordered one of  the new 64mb models so I don't spend so much time reloading my favorite  playlists after my 13 yr old son sneaks the Rio out of the house for his  runs....I run better listening to vintage Cream and CSN rather than the  Backstreet Boys...(we don't have exactly the same taste in music).<p>If you  run while listening to music, you can't go wrong with the Rio! If you want  to be able to mix artists with little hassle..the Rio is it! If you need  more play time...more memory is available... enough said?

<Title>Too slow
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>It takes about .7X minutes to load X minutes of music, e.g. 23minutes to load 32 minutes worth of music.  Also, my early model has a64K and another 32K buffer, and you have to address each separately, loading one with music, then the other, instead of them representing a continguous data space. It's a pain, and there is more 'left-over' unused memory as a result.

<Title>Very Limited
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I returned mine after 3 days - compression below 96K produces very poor quality for all but voice. Most downloadable MP3 music is 128K compression. At these rates you get 30-45 minutes of music and then you need to have  access to a pc to change the music. May be OK for a jogger, but not much  use if you are going to be away from your computer for long. You can get a  good cassette player for less money that is not much bigger than the Rio...  then if you're a jogger you still have the size advantage and if you  aren't, you have the changable selections - and the ability to record about  the same amount of music.

<Title>RIO rules--minidisc sucks
<Date>Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>How long does it take to make minidiscs?  about 10 times longer than it takes to load up free Web tunes to the RIO.  How much does it cost to store MP3 files in a computer: 17.2 Gigabytes is about $200 for a computer hard  disk.  It would cost about $600 to store all the same music on minidiscs.   HELLO--the device is not a storage device, but MP3 is the better storage  media. RIO is a short trip, exercising, taking the bus kind of device. Get  one; it kicks butt.

<Title>Pretty Damn Good
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>What most of these reviewers are forgetting is that the Diamond Rio 300 was the FIRST MP3 player to hit the market.  And it was a great struggle in the courts to even get it released.  <p>I had one of these pre-ordered for  almost 3 months and finally got it 2 days after it was released.  I have  been pretty happy with the way it has held up.  I did a 16 MB upgrade for  it and it seems to hold enough music for me.  <p>It is durable, but the  button control now falls off unexpectadly.  This is probably why they moved  away from this design on the 500.<p>Personally, I would still consider this  a very good MP3 player.  When I bought it it was over $200 and I thought  that was a bargin.  I really just depends on what format your music  collection is...mine is 99% MP3, so these little guys are awesome.

<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The rio 300 was great, untill i broke it.......twice!  The first time it broke was for NO apparent reason, which is never a good. I thought it was just a defect, untill 2 weeks of constant jarring and crushing in my  backpack proved otherwise. The front plate was completly torn off. It did  look a little flimsy and weak. So if your a high school student, just  trying to keep up with the ever changing music fads, wait untill one of the  other, stonger Mp3 players drops in price, because it just wont last in  your backpack! For this imperfection, I give the Rio pmp300 TWO STARS.

<Title>Flaws
<Date>Fri May 26 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>It is cool to have such the technology to listen to music at not have it skip. But Diamond needs work in many areas before they have a great product. First the battery location is not well placed or it needs a better  locking mechanism(mine has tape holding it closed). Second, their customer  service really needs improvement. My first player didn't work correctly. SO  after calling long distance on my dime they sent me out a new one which  intially didn't work. Then I called long distance again to be told that  &quot;this is a common problem&quot; that is not in the manual. But i enjoy  it though.

<Content>This product is AWESOME!  It was really easy to use, probably because I'm a 13-year-old computer nerd, but anyway, it was really easy to set up.  You plug in the Parallel adapter, and off you go!  I already had RealJukebox and a small collection of mp3's.  And, since I can't really notice any  difference in the quality, I can fit up to 20+ songs without any extra  memory!  This was well worth the $ I paid after a rebate and 3-7 day  shipping.  BUY IT IF YOU HAVE A NEWER COMPUTER AND LIKE MODERN MUSIC  (modern is easier to find)<p>Ciao!

<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Love the concept.  Love the transportabilty, BUT onehour...means more like 30 minutes AND after you download 50 songs theyexpect you to pay (from there software provider-music match) for adding other songs to your play list.  I am sure there are ways around it, but who wants to spend the time figuring it out?  I want ease and Daimond is not making it easy!  I own stock in the company and am really annoyed that they expect me to pay after I forked over the cash for an over priced piece of...  I will get around it because I grew up on computers, but WHY make it more difficult for me so that I am DRIVEN to write a BAD review at amazon.  I made an effort to write this review so that the comapny will make a change.  Simply...I want to hear a song right now, but because my roommate is sleeping and I USED up my 50 songs I would have to make an even BIGGER effort than signing on and spending 10 minutes writing a NEGATIVE review to DIAMOND in hopes that they will make their product more USER FRIENDLY. When I paid $150, I was not aware that the product ACTUALLY held only 30 minutes and I would be responsible for anything over 50 songs.  I want to feel at ease, in that I can recond ALBUMS and not be selective in songs.  DO SOMETHING DIAMOND OR SONY WILL TRULY MONOPOLIZE THE MARKET!

<Title>Somewhat disappointing
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>When I bought this product, the price seemed right, and the sound was great. Overtime however, my control pad wore out smooth!  My battery mechanism holder broke!  And the headphones broke as well!  I got a  replacement pair, but those eventually broke too. The Rio offers an hour of  music storage.....which is only true if you use 64kbps!  Pretty much  cassette tape quality. An expansion card will allow the Rio to hold more,  but at almost 100$!  The sound never TRULY disappointed me, but it should  be noted that it ISNT EVER CD quality. NEVER. It takes away bass from songs  to allow more volume. The durability on this product is a joke. The  software that came with it was efficient, but not great. It would be more  cost efficient to get a CD-Recorder and make CDs rather than to use this!   Don't waste your money!  Get an Mp3 player from a better company such as  Creative, or possibly even Sony.

<Title>Works great for me
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This thing was the first MP3 ever? Wow! Not too shabby. Its durable,it has good sound (satisfactory at 64kbs), it looks cool, and most importantly: it gets the job done.  Throwing music on the Rio from my CD's and my computer is simple. Who cares if it doesn't support USB? I can go brush my teeth or  clean my room while I wait 5 minutes for all 17 songs to download onto the  Rio. That's right, 17 songs at 64kbs, which makes me happy since I haven't  even upgraded this inexpensive device yet. In fact, i might not even need  to upgrade it; I'm already content. No moving parts, no skipping, la dee da  da, bla bla,great sound, and it all does the job with one &quot;AA&quot;  battery, which lasts for hours upon hours. I honestly, have no complaints,  really. Listen to this picky electronics consumer's advice: if you know how  to use a computer and you want a quality MP3 player worth your hard earned  money, go buy the Rio.  ..., sweet.

<Date>Fri Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I think this is a wonderful product.  I purchased the SE (64 meg) and have  not experienced the problems mentioned in previous reviews.  Downloads  taking too long?  Try closing other applications and freeing up some  resources -- mine takes about 30 seconds for a 4 minute song.  Music isn't  loud enough?  Try using other headphones -- I keep the volume between  &quot;5&quot; and &quot;8&quot; while running and it's plenty loud.  All I  years?  Since when has *any* of the cool, new stuff been available for the  Mac?  &quot;Thinking differently&quot; has its drawbacks guys!  ;-)  And  finally don't even try to weigh it against the Minidisc, it's like  comparing apples and oranges.<p>If you're only curious about the RIO, the  one sold here with is a great deal after the $50 rebate.  If you know  you'll want to store gobs of music and upgrade later, go ahead and spring  for the SE... You won't be disappointed

<Title>Rio works for Talk Radio too!
<Date>Fri Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I use the Rio SE to hold 8-10 hours of talk radio programs converted to MP3 from RA.  While the Rio sounds terrific playing music encoded at 128 kps, at 16 kps you can get lengthy play time.  Since talk radio is  generally heard on AM radio, the lower quality sampling rate sounds  familiar.<p>Since I always thought MP3 was the venue for pirated copies,  garage bands, and alternative music, I had always ignored the format.  This  Rio is the answer to a talk radio addict's dream.

<Title>Great product with a few limitations
<Date>Sat Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I have had my rio for quite some time now, and i must say that it was the best money i spent on an audio device, or computer peripheral. It is extremely light weight, slightly smaller than a pack of cigerettes, runs on  one AA battery (lasts about 14 hours). The music, despite what some people  say, can sound great. the software you use makes a huge difference. the  included software is good, but you can download free software that is  better. It will hold about 7-8 of your favorite tracks at almost CD  quality. Most of the time cd's only have that many good tracks anyway. The  only downside is that you can't change tracks when away from your computer,  but most of the time even that's not a big deal. I bought my rio when it  was still $199 and i feel that it was well worth the price.

<Title>Excellent product/Too little storage
<Date>Sat Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>This device is great for on the go people. It's small, lite, and the playback is great. What really annoys me though is the short playtime you get if you don't compress the music into the player. Compressing the music  will only make your music (if you really care about what you are listening  to) sound pretty bad. I recently bought a 32MB memory card for my Rio,  which is the other problem: MEMORY IS EXPENSIVE. It cost me $99!! And  what's worse is the fact that a new Rio is coming out with 64MB of flash  memory included! Also, I've encountered another problem with Rio, if it  suddenly gets hit, the thing will just stop playing. Sure, it doesn't skip  if you shake it, but a sudden jolt on the thing while riding in your car or  working out will make it stop for some reason. Another problem is the slow  process of recording your CDs and putting it into the device. All in all  though, I'm pretty satisfied with the device. Because of it's portability  and great sound quality, it more than makes up for its weaknesses.

<Title>The NiQ Electronics review- Great for an Mp3 Player/300vs500
<Date>Sun Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I had first purchased a PMP300, but wasn't satisfied.  The design of the PMP500 intigued me, and i couldn't resist.  It was a very good buy.  This is a review and comparison of both products.<p>Hardware:<p>Like the PMP300,  the PMP500 can play mp3 tracks and cd tracks, but unlike the PMP300, the  PMP500 can also play MPEG2.5, ADPCM, and Audible.com content.  The PMP500  plays Mp3s 16 to 320 Kbps and VBR.  It includes a Basic equalizer with song  adjustments such as treble, bass, etc.  The PMP300's equalizer consisted of  only four synthetic options: Normal, Rock, Classical, and Jazz.   <p>Connection:<p>The song transfere speed from your computer to your device  for both products is relitively the same, with the PMP500 being a little  faster.  Connection from the PMP300 is made by parallel-port connection.   It is hooked into your printer port and has another parallel port in the  back for your printer so that way you can operate your printer and your  player at the same time.  The PMP500 has easy connection thru a USB socket.   NOTICE: YOU MUST HAVE A USB SOCKET IN YOUR COMPUTER TO OPERATE THE PMP500.   THE PMP500 DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS N/T OR WINDOWS 95.<p>Buttons:<p>The  buttons on the PMP300 are far better than the buttons on the PMP500.  The  buttons on both products are easy to use and good, but the buttons on the  PMP300 are bigger and cooler.<p>Memory:<p>Memory on the PMP500 is better  than the PMP300.  But keep in mind.  If you buy memory chips (They are like  disks.  There is a slot on both product for insertion.  The chips can be  easily ejected.  They are called Flash Cards.  You can buy them here.)  You  can store play lists on diferent disks, label them, and when you want to  hear your pesonal mix, just pop in that certain disk.

I went to the diamond website and they imidiantly said they would  replace it for only a shipping charge. I got it back in about 3 days from  when i shipped it,and it didn't skip. <p>If your want one, but can wait a  few months the 600 is coming out for about 170. I've heard from amazon and  diamond that it has 32 to start with. It has a memory card slot and a  seperate &quot;backpack which expands it to 320mb. <p>Get on any major  problem fast although dont worry about small things like the battery hatch  coming off (you can just stick it back on.) Among 9 friends who have this  player I've encountered severel prolems (skipping, batery hatch comes off,  it says its on hold when its not on hold, and the play button comes off(my  second did that.) To avoid prolems dont use the hold key, get the seperate  remote instead of beating on the regular keys.  The 300 comes with  everything u need, but get the case and remote. I use mine about 5 hours a  day and i love it.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I got a Rio for Christmas, and I absolutely love it. I rarely use my CD player anymore! It's an absolute dream for jogging, nowhere near as bulky as a walkman (just clips right onto your shorts) and doesn't skip like a CD  player, plus 1 hr of CD quality music (with a 32 MB flash card in there) is  plenty long enough for a jog. Also, you can switch the music when you get  bored of it. It's also great for short trips, so much better than having to  drag around a CD player with a couple of CDs. For longer trips I often have  my laptop along anyway so I just pack the cable as well and load new songs  onto the Rio when I feel like it. The case does feel a bit flimsy, but I  have dropped it many times, no problems. I once even accidentally left it  soaking in a puddle of water for a few minutes... the LCD screen died for a  day but then it came back, and now (a month later) it's still running fine.  The sound quality is good, if you play around with the equalizer settings a  bit (I like Rock better than Normal, it gives some bass boost).<p>To all  the people complaining about the buttons accidentally getting hit when you  carry the Rio in your bag: use the Hold button, that's what it's there for!  This isn't just a Rio thing, I have the same problem with my portable CD  player.<p>Drawbacks? The parallel port connection is slooooooow, and 32 MB  is not enough memory. Spring for the 500 if you can afford it and your OS  is USB-compatible. (I run Linux and Win95, which is why I got the 300.) And  definitely get a 32 MB flashcard to increase the memory.<p>Also.... I  wouldn't recommend it if you're not already an MP3 convert. If you've got a  large MP3 collection that you want to take along with you, you'll love the  Rio. If you're just wondering what this whole MP3 thing is about, the Rio  is probably not for you.

<Content>I think this product is a good bargain for the money. People are complaining that it only has 32 MEGS  then why don't they just get the 550 or more memory! I'm not thrilled about it only having 32 MB but for its  price im not compliaining.

<Title>Great Product for Workouts
<Date>Tue Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The Rio and the MusicMatch Jukebox software that comes with it are a great way to make use of your PC to store music from your own CD collection and the internet.  You can load about 1 hour of music at 64kbps on the Rio  which is not perfect CD quality, but is more than adequate when running or  in the gym.  I'd say that a good way to improve the product would be to  increase the memory on the Rio (which is in the works) to hold  about 2  hours of capacity at 128kbps which sounds really good.  With the 50 dollar  rebate it is a lot cheaper than a minidisc player/recorder.  Plus, the Rio  Player is not intended to be a storage device itself.  Who wants to have a  whole pile of minidiscs to keep track of anyway?  Why not just download the  songs into the Rio to take to the gym or out for the day, and then change  the songs on it the next time?  It is so small and unshockable you can do  anything and listen to music on the move which is what the Rio Player is  intended for.

<Title>Great idea, but not finished
<Date>Tue Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I like the player, but my biggest peeve, other than than the poor headphones and no backlight, is that I cannot get the volume very loud.  I use my Walkman to mow the grass, but the sound on the Rio is so low that I  can't hear it over the sound of the lawn mower.  So it's back to the  Walkman for mowing.

<Title>Nifty idea, wish I could get &quot;free upgrades&quot;!
<Date>Fri Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>My brother spoiled me with a Rio when they first came out. It's been great to be able to listen on the road to mp3s of songs that you never hear on the radio and are hard to come by even in stores. The music quality depends  on the software used to rip the tracks, and w/great-quality songs, Rio  delivers great sound.  My complaints are too little memory (and EXPENSIVE  memory cards) and the lack of some sort of AC outlet option for when you're  not away from an electrical outlet.  Those little machines suck up  batteries in a big way.  The former problem (sniff) I hear will be  addressed in the next Rio.  I hope the latter problem will be too.  If  only, like lots of shareware, I could get free upgrades...!

<Title>The mp3 format is not yet ready for the portable market.
<Date>Sat Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I have experimented with the mp3 format on the upgraded (64 meg)version of the player.  As widely described by everyone else, the time allotment in 128bps recording leaves a lot to be desired.  And the sound quality of the  music in 64 bps mode sucks. Ha,Ha!!!!  However,once they get the amount of  music that you can store on the Rio player up at 128 bps, it might actually  have something to show the other formats.  I think it would be a nice piece  to play through your car audio system if you want to listen to a song, but  do not have the cd.  Only drawback is you have to be fortunate enough to  have a IBM Compatible PC and Windows like me. =0)

<Content>Although the concept is good Diamond has done a poor job of designing the product as well as a poor job of supporting it.  The volume is too low even at its highest setting.  The 'hold' switch is poorly designed so that you  can't tell if its engaged.  The clip holding the battery in is easily  broken and the add on 32meg external memory didn't work when it arrived.

<Title>Player not worth the money
<Date>Sun Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The 32MB Rio is definitely not worth the money, and the reason is quite simple.  I own a Minidisc player/recorder I purchased for about the same price.  It is less than 200 grams with a 10 hour lithium battery and a  disc.  Yes, I admit the Rio is convenient for the road, but the time to get  the stuff on there is way too much.  Encoding eats up processing power and  lags the system, even on a Pentium III.  If I were to use the normal 128 or  160kbps bitrates, I would be stuck with only 7 or 8 songs, whereas a  Minidisc, for a comparable price, can provide 17 or 18, with replacable  discs.  And regarding the problem of remembering what songs are where?   That's what colours and the TOC are for.

Technology is growing  and those portable MP3 players should grow with it.  We own 3 Diamond Rio  Players and are experimenting with them, with there ability for the  Multi-OS compatibility.

I'd say I had it loaded up  with music and was off to run within 30 minutes or so. Easy.  <p>The 300 is  just what it is advertised as and with the rebate the price is right.  Without the rebate I'm not sure it would be worth it due to the small  memory; but at 90 or so bucks it's an a-ok value and good introduction to  portable players.<p>I'm happy with the purchase and am enjoying the  product.

<Content>If you are a jogger and go for 45-60 minutes, the Diamond pmp300 is the greatest thing since sliced bread!  The player is super-light, has NEVER skipped, and the download/music selection software works great.  I converted some of my favorite jammin' CDs (from my own personal library) to  96 kbs MP3's and get about an hour of very acceptable sound quality.  The  quality is much better than cassette but not quite that of CD.  I have had  the pmp300 for 8 months and have not experienced any problems at all.  I  would highly recommend using the RealJukebox player for  recording and storage of your MP3 library.  It works great with the pmp300.   This might be the best hundred bucks I ever spent!  Get one!

I have called their tech support line to find out that I must wait ten to fifteen minutes to get help.  The only problem with this  is that is not a free call.  Therefore I have emailed them just to get an  email back to find out that they need more info.  So I email them back and  didn't get a response.  Besides this I cannot comment on the usefulness of  the product because I have yet to get it to work.  All in all, I must say I  bought an expensive paper weight.  So far, I can tell you that I will not  purchase a product from this company again because of the poor customer  service which I feel is a major trait that any business should possess.   Lastly, I feel giving this player 1 star is too much.<p>Thank you,<p>Brett

<Title>Complete Flop!
<Date>Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I have recently bought the Diamond Rio PMP300 player and it was a complete dissapointment right fromt he get-go. As soon as I got home, I was so excited to put my MP3's on to it and begin to listen to it. WRONG!  If you  dont have a computer that was made yesterday, it wont work.  My computer  was made in 96 and already it is too old to support the software. I had to  call Rio and wait 20 mins for a operator who as soon as I talked to him,  said my computer was hopeless and the only way it might work was to go and  download all of this information and purchase new parallel port adaptors.  NO WAY!  no where on the box did it say this. I have finally gotten it to  work, but it is skipping like crazy. something is wrong with it and this  sucker is going back to the store. Its a complete flop, and NO ONE should  buy it. It only has 32MB memory, and the cards cost a fortune. it is always  running, so the battery slowly wears down. I love the earbuds, and the size  and wieght, thats why there are 2 stars. No other reason. Overall, this  product stinks!

<Title>Great technology, needs better implementation
<Date>Sun Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Almost there... Although the Rio series from Diamond are a refreshing and commendable technology advance, even if not the first, I am holding out for the Nomad by Creative Labs for its recording capability and FM tuner. For a  game designer who wants to record high quality sounds out in the field,  this is a cool device. <p>The issue here still seems to be the high cost of  FLASH memory. <p>It is amazing to me why nobody has made an MP3 player that  utilizes zip, super disks or even the smallish Clik! disks from Iomega. At  least this way, you wouldn't need specialized 'cradles' to bring music back  and forth, and you could always carry MP3's on disk with you for long  trips. <p>There could always be internal memory to hold songs (for skip  free playback) but I would think that this skip free requirement wouldn't  be needed all the time. <p>In any case, I am sure innovation will occur.  <p>Another thing I'd like to see....a REMOVABLE MEDIA based MP3 player for  my car or home, based off a JAZ 2 or CD, with an internal hard drive.  <p>This would be pretty killer. The idea of sticking a single JAZ 2 in my  car audio device and listening to MP3's encoded at 128 is pretty amazing.  It also seems a JAZ 2 would be more reliable and less skip prone than a CD.  <p>In any event, I expect RAM will be coming way down in price and we can  just use non volatile RAM for our music, even to the point of having gigs  of storage. <p>Why doesn't AMAZON have the NOMAD player?

<Date>Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Im a big advocate for mp3 and diamond multimedia, and i commend their  revolutionary leap into the digital music industry. I hear a lot of people  complaining here, but let's not forget what this new player means to us  more experienced, long-time mp3 users. It means a transfer of mp3 file to  mp3 reader. That means no sound quality is compromised like when you burn  cds. And the memory capacity will not be a problem for long at rate of  today's data storage boom. Also the minidisc player is much larger in  dimensions, and the minidiscs are considerably larger than the flash memory  in the rio. The rio also burns on less battery than the MD, and I find the  rio much more convienient to hold in my pocket than a walkman-sized  minidisc system. The only valid complaints i would say is the pricing,  which will without-a-doubt become less of a problem in the future. And the  need for ID3 tag support. Otherwise, a good product

(maybe this loss wouldn't be noticable  on a noisy bus, but in a quiet room it's definitely there).<p>Storing songs  at 64KPS would also mean that I'd need to store *two versions* of  everything on my hard disk, one for the RIO at 64KBPS and another one at  128KBPS for listening at home. It just doesn't seem worth the  effort....<p>When the memory increases to something like 256Mb, or somebody  stuffs one of those new tiny IBM hard disks into a player (320Mb of storage  and *much* cheaper than flash memory), then you should think about buying  this sort of device.<p>Until then, resign yourself to listening to ten  songs over and over again in an endless loop....

This is perfact for running, on the way to work, school, or if your going  on a plane trip.  I had a Philips CD discman that could play cdr's and  cdrw's w/45 skip protection and it skiped like crazy. Putting 14 songs on  the rio with near cd quality sound is fine by me. I suggest this product to  anyone. After all its only $100. If something goes wrong with this product  use the warranty and send it in to get fixed (For those people who complain  about problems with the memory).<br><br>

<Content>I got the PMP300 as a birthday present, and I love it.  I am a college student, and i already have a huge MP3 library on my desktop.  I also discovered that more than half my MP3s are encoded at 64 kbps, so I can fit a little over an hour of my favorites on it and take it with me to (boring)  lectures, the library, or to work out.  This BS about only fitting 30  minutes of music is because the encoding is at CD-quality...I've never  noticed a difference.  With the rebates, it is almost as inexpensive as a  Sport Discman, but gets better battery life, weighs less, and i can listen  to what I want without switching CDs (as if I could carry more than one CD  when i'm jogging anyways).   I am definitely a computer geek, so I wasn't  worried about setting it up...but the setup was so simple a 5 year old  could do it.   Looking forward to taking it on long bus rides to crew races  this spring.   Great little player for the money.

(on the  minus side, they don't list the artists, only the song names). all in all a  great player if you are willing to trade lower cost for lower less memory  (actually, a rio 300 with a 99 dollar 32mb upgrade card would be cheaper  (after 50 dollar rebate) than rio 500. additionally, the player is  attractive, well-made and goes forever and a day on a single double A.  great sound and small size are real pluses as well.

<Date>Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The play button on the front of this unit is driving me crazy!  It depresses with very little pressure, so the Rio regularly gets turned on by accident while I carry it in my bag. By the time I get to the gym the  battery  is dead.  Whoever designed this thing NEVER  carried it around and  used it for any length  of time.

<Date>Mon Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The first generation of MP3 players offers a lot of promise for the future. I would hold out for future generations of players, however. The sound can be tinny, the controls are awkward at times, and the PC interface  is not very user friendly. Wait until the players offer at least 64MB of on  board RAM, and let's hope the new versions improve sound quality.

<Title>Big step in the right direction...but...
<Date>Tue Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I just purchased the PMP-300(standard edition) hoping that some of the complaints that I read were exaggerated.  Well, unfortunately...I have to confirm 2 of them. With this model...you only get 32megs of flash memory so  I was hoping that at the 64Kbps recording...it would be somewhat  acceptable. Boy...was I wrong...no way can I record and listen to music at  this rate.  However, the 128Kbps is a big improvement with a big sacrifice.   Your recording time gets cut in half which only allows for 6-8 songs at  most.  This is not going to get me through my workouts at the gym...the  primary reason I purchased the unit.  I got tired of fighting with my sony  cassette player...tape getting tangled up, auto reverse going into an  endless back and forth cycle, and so on.<p>The other concern was the volume  level.  I'm sure it's in my best interest to play at moderate levels but  there are times in which the volume has  to be turned up...this unit's  highest setting(at 20 from a scale from 0-20) is a comparatively moderate  level at best.<p>So, where does that leave me?  I'm going to get the extra  cash around and get the PMP500.  I have looked at quite a few different  models on the market from many other manufacturers and I believe    that  Diamond Rio will still dominate with this new   player thanks to the USB  connection and the 64megs on board with an optional 32megs upgrade.  It  also adds quite a few other goodies like seperate bass and treble  controls.<p>I'm willing to pay the extra money thanks to having a small  taste of MP3's potential with the PMP300.<p>Can't wait for the PMP500 to  hit the shelves!<p>Drew

<Title>The Rio Sucks
<Date>Wed Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I have a Sony Mini-Disc Mzr-55 and my friends dad told me that the Rio is much better, well im sorry to disapoint you but the product sucks. first of all a mini-disc costs less than a rio disc and it has more memory  (Rio=64Mb, MD=650Mb). The sound quality is the same or better than a Cd.  the MD is easier to record with, you can connect it to anything (Portable  Cd Player, Stereo system, Computer, other MD's and any systems with a line  out), the Rio can only connect with the computer and you have to download  the songs that you like or transfer them from CD to MP3.<p>thats why i  chose the MD and i got it for a lower price than the Rio.

<Content>Okay, the Diamond Rio PMP 300 SE is one of the less baddest MP3 portable players. You all agree if I say that this player is way to expensive. It can hold only a little more than 1 hour of audio (Yeah... yeah... I hear  you saying &quot;no way, I have over 2 hours of music on mine&quot;) I'dd  like to hear good quality audio instead of a lousy 64Kb/s<p>And there is  something else.... a Flash card that can store a half an hour of audio cost  you more than a HD of 2 Gigs<p>Conclusion : Wait until there is a serious  MP3 player competition going on between the manufacturers. Or.... buy one  now and cry if the price drops down 50 % within a year.<p>IBM!!! get your  lazy a** over here!!! and fill the body's of the next generation MP3  players with your holy Micro HD's

<Content>I was going to originally purchase a CD-ROM writer so that I could burn some CD's of my favorite songs for use in my weightlifting sessions.  A friend happened to remind me of the Diamond Rio PMP 300 so I shifted the  funds from the CD-ROM writer to the Rio....and, boy, was I impressed!  Best  lil' gadget to come along in a while!  No more bulky discmans to lug around  (along with the CDs that would be required).  No more skipping songs when  you're doing cardiovascular workouts.  And the sound quality is  great!<p>The price might seem kinda steep, but hey...weren't walkmans when  they first came out??  Come now, I know some of you remember those archaic  mechanisms.  For the price, you just can't beat a portable music player  with no moving parts to break.  No cassette tapes to jam.  No CDs to  scratch.<p>Kudos to the folks at Diamond!

<Title>Great Idea, but wait at least 6 months
<Date>Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I have been up to date on the developments in mp3 technology for well over a year now so I'm quite interested in this product.  I have about 1 Gigabyte of mp3s on my computer at home and theoretically would find such a  device invaluable. I could use this while skiing/snowboarding, riding on a  bumpy car or bus, or for countless other uses.  Here comes the big  &quot;but&quot;: The software that comes with the player only lets you  encode at 128 kbps (less than CD-quality).  If you want CD-quality audio,  you'll have to pay $30 for software like MusicMatch Jukebox 4.0.  All of  the mp3s I rip are at 192 kbps which I consider to be the best quality for  the amount of space they consume.  Which brings me to the next problem:  capacity.  If you use 160 or 192 mp3s, you're only going to get about 6 to  8 songs onto that thing.  Quite a bummer for paying as much as a 40 second  electronic shock protection CD-player or a Minidisk player. I don't own a  Diamond Rio myself but I know some people who do, and I say wait until they  can hold AT LEAST 74 min of CD-quality audio!

<Title>This MP3 Player is the BEST!
<Date>Sun Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>This unit has awesome sound.  MP3 is the best idea since the CD, but this is better.  MP3's won't skip and are FREE.  The only drawback to this unit is that it only has 32 megabytes.  I put usually 8 songs @ 128 and 160  kbps, which is fine for me.  I just wish Smart Cards were cheaper that's  all.  Some of the other people think the volume doesn't go loud enough,  don't listen to them, it goes very loud and produces much needed base.  You  can also hook up the MP3 Player to a stereo at home or in the car with a  tape adapter you put in the headphones plugin (it really sounds awesome!  Overall this is a GREAT unit!

<Title>This Product is good, but it in no way shows its potential.
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>It would be nice if for once a company would think about what they could do with a product before they just slapped it together and threw it on the shelf, specially for $200+. They could have made this product capable of so  much more, such as recording from most any audio device. They could and  should have given it more memory.I also believe that if they can't offer  you more quality, more memory, and more options for recording from  different devices; they should take the price down, atleast 50-100 dollars.  Is that to much to ask. I think the product is a wonderful idea, but it  should have been given more thought. Thank you.

<Title>Miniscule storage capacity
<Date>Wed Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The PMP 300, quite simply, does not have enough storage space.  If you care at all about your music, you will want to encode your MP3s at 128 kbps or higher--you can tell the difference, if your hearing is at all normal.   So, if you're creating songs that average 5 MB each, you'll be able to fit  6, maybe 7, on this thing.  Ridiculous.

I've been into the whole MP3 thing since MP2's first came out, so needless to say, I was eigerly  awaiting this product.<p>GOOD - Lightweight, small, quick to upload  to<p>BAD  - Somewhat flimsy design, display is hard to read, holds only 6  songs at CD-Quality<p>UGLY - Bad memory causes skips over time, extra flash  cards are super expensive<p>So, my suggestion, if you want something that  is cheap, consider the Rio, at under $100, to be a great substitute for a  tape walkman. If you can afford it, go with MiniDisc, otherwise buy the  Rio, keeping in mind that it is NOT a great alternative to a CD-Diskman, or  an MD-Player!<p>- E-Mail me at nairos@home.com if you have any questions -

<Content>&quot;Minidisks the wave of the future&quot; ...all that I have to say about this is ...HA.  All minidisks are, are glorified cd's.  But this review is about the Diamond Rio pmp300 which I have recently purchased.  I find that the diamond rio 300 is one of the most excellent values out  there...not only with no moving parts there is no skip (as opposed to a  mini-disk which has 40 second protection) but also, the price value is  excellent.  I say this because all those poor feebs now who have mini disk  players have to pay $CASH$ for their music.   Why do that when I could log  on to a popular Mp3 music servers and download free music.  The only gripe  I have with the Rio 300 is that it only comes with 32 megs of memory...and  flash cards are a tad expensive at the moment.  I have to say though...this  machine is perfect.

<Title>Follow-up review
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Last time, I only gave the Rio 300 4 stars because of the lack of memory size (only 8-9 songs per 32 MB). Now, I must take that comment back. If you encode the files to 96 or 112 kbps onto it, yeah, you'll get the occasional  skip (once a song, at the most), but I'll sacrifice that any day, now that  I'm able to encode almost 12-14 songs for each 32 MB. What else is great  (besides getting new songs) is being able to find older songs or songs out  of print from the internet (I prefer Napster). I still strongly suggest  getting a fast net connection, or you'll have to wait all night to get one  4 MB song. (This is for us unlucky scrubs that can't download songs at  work....) Rationalize it this way: $40-$50 per mo. for broadband internet  service. Faster browsing and downloading programs, and you don't have to  buy a CD again. If you bought 3 CD's a month, it just paid for itself. And  you don't have old jewel cases lying around gathering dust. <p>If the  recording industry figures out how to prevent digitizing of music and  outsmarts the computer industry, the Rio would be in trouble. But any  industry that throws money at N'Sync, Dwight Yoakum, and Ben Folds Five is  probably not too tough an adversary.<p>P.S. Why are these reviews even  necessary? As you can see, Amazon's been sold out since before Christmas.

On the other hand, it only holds six or seven songs, the door on the battery case  doesn't stay shut so well after a few months of use, and a little abuse,  and the &quot;hold&quot; switch gets sticky after a while and becomes  difficult to move.

<Title>1st-generation mp3 player
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The Diamond Rio 300 made news when it first came out at the forefront of the 1st generation mp3 portables. Once the best in its class, it's no longer cutting-edge: its lack of memory (32 MB, which can only hold 30 minutes of CD-quality sound) and stodgy controls have been vastly improved  upon by its more recent bretheren, the Rio 500 and others.<p>As a result,  it's difficult to rate this product a worthwhile buy nowadays. Purchasers  would be better off with the more advanced Rio 500, Creative Nomad 64, or  RCA Lyra (64 MB version)-- or, better yet, ordering an mp3/CD player like  the MamboX or Brujo, which put traditional portables to  shame with the ability to read mp3 tracks from CDs.

<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The concept is great, the product is small and light, but the company stating that the player holds up to 60 minutes of music is entirely false.  I would think a more accurate number is more like 30 minutes.<p>When I was  looking into purchasing a MP3 player I looked at the RIO300 and RIO500.   The RIO300 was offering a $50 rebate and the RIO500 was over $200, but I  thought for $100 an hour of music would be sufficient.  THE THING ONLY  HOLDS APPROX 30 MINUTES.  I would have spent the extra money to buy the  RIO500 which is said to hold up to 2hrs, probably more like 1hr.<p>Lastly,  if any of the buttons on the RIO300 are pressed, the machine turns on and  starts to play.  I am constantly having to shut it off.

<Title>Fairly great product, but quality depends on you.
<Date>Tue Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I was very enthusiastic after I received the Diamond Mp3 player (32 MB). I would be able to play Mp3s on a portable scale. However, there are a few drawbacks to this:<p>1.) You can only download and listen to LEGALLY  acquired music. Basically, people you never heard of, but in any case,  people still listen to mp3s they get from people or FTPs, but I don't think  it's such a big deal.<p>2.) The amount of music you can put on depends on  the size that it was encoded. For example, if most of your music is 2-5MB,  which would be encoded at 128-190 kbps, then you could only hold from 7-10  songs, which is not that many. Plus, if you're on vacation, you don't want  to be listening to the same song over and over, so this product is really  useful if you have a laptop. Otherwise, boredom sets in.<p>3.) The  &quot;equalizers&quot; don't give you much option to change the treble/bass  of the music. You are only provided with Jazz/Classical/Rock/Normal  settings, which will be based on what you listen to.<p>4.) THE SOFTWARE  PROVIDED DOES NOT GIVE YOU A FREE Mp3 RIPPER/ENCODER! YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR  IT TO USE IT! ALL THEY DO IS GIVE YOU THE SOFTWARE TO REGISTER IT AND PAY!  SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE $$$ DOWN THE DRAIN (of course, there are LOTS of FREE  ones on the Internet that are MUCH better at ripping/encoding).<p>4.)  Battery drains at a medium pace, so bring extras.<p>5.) Flash cards cost A  LOT!<p>All in all, this product is good for its portability and the fact  that you can listen to mp3's without buying the CDs. But there are lot of  other things to consider, so it's all up to you.

<Title>Incredible product - this is the future of music!
<Date>Tue Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I recently bought my RIO and I couldn't be happier with it. I fit about 9 songs on the 32 available megs. For those that need more space, the RIO is expanadable. Simply purchase a seperate flash card (or buy one of the newer  models).The sound is flawless. At 128kps you'll think you were listening to  the actual CD. Even 96kps is fairly crisp. I was extremely impressed by how  easy it is to upload/download files. It takes just a few minutes to load  the RIO up with a whole new set of songs. You can also rearrange existing  tracks. I'm been using this thing non-stop and I'm still on the original  battery so Diamonds claim that it lasts 12 hours on a single AA battery  seems to be holding true.The RIO is also extremely lightweight. Its under 3  ounces. Perfect for working out and running. Speaking of running, thats  another nice thing, motion has no effect on the RIO. The only complaint I  have is with the headphones. I ended up getting a new pair bacause the set  that they included was painful within 15 minutes of use. Other than that  the RIO ROCKS!!!

<Title>A great product, saving you much money in the long run.
<Date>Fri Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>If you like to buy CD players, cassette players, or even the new mini disk players, a major problem is song sampling. For example, the new Limp Bizkit album, Signifigant Other, may have five songs you really like on it, but  you do not care for the singles they've released, not knowing what the rest  of the album sounds like. Using MP3's, you can download the b-side tracks  of the CD, sample them, and if you like them you can buy the album you  otherwise would have never bought. You will end up with a better CD library  and you won't waste your money on the one-hit wonders.

<Title>It's useful, but poorly designed
<Date>Wed Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I don't want to terribly discourage anyone that really wants the Rio player, but I just thought that you'd like to know that the Rio Player is  really flimsy.  My black PMP300's battery slot cover broke and so did both  of my friend's. I guess that is the downside to having a really light unit.   I understand that Diamond is really good with that and will replace it at  no extra cost, but it's just a pain.  I wish I had started with buying an  MD player..  because you can still take songs off your computer ... they're  just stored as waves on the MD... &lt;sigh&gt;

<Title>This product is better than some people say
<Date>Thu Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I just bought got mine today and it is great! The software was easy to install. I got 8 full length songs on the thing with only 32 meg. I have a 32 meg smartmedia card on order and then i'll have twice as much room! The sound quality is Fantastic. But this depends on source recording (your CD) and the computer you create the mp3 on. Anyone who complains about that needs to either get a decent encoder/ripper or a better computer. As for MusicMaker, I bought it a couple of monthes ago so I could listen to music on my laptop while I travel. (Register your shareware! It's worth it!) The Rio is a much lighter way of listening to my tunes. <p>If you youv'e been wanting to get the Rio and werent sure about it, buy this product

<Title>rio's problems exaggerated by others
<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I just bought a rio about 4 days ago and feel I have had enough time to review this product.  I also read all the other reviews and feel I  must address some of the issues.   <p>Lack of space: for me this really hasnt  been a problem.  I have access to my computer all day and its easy to  change the songs.<p>Quality:  I am no audiophile i admit, but I really  don't mind the songs at 64kbps, I can notice a difference in quality when i  compare it directly to a 128kbps, but it isnt as horrible as it seems.  At  80 its pretty dang good.<p>Speed:  Another thing I don't have a problem  with.  I actually am able to do other things while downloading my songs  (like im doing right now) and it doesnt take all that long.<p>Plus i found  the rio is the best buy right now, with the rebate, especially if the price  of flash cards drops which i assume it will.

<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I have been using my Rio about a year now without a problem. The Rio 300 does not support Macintosh. So my solution was to build a 486 from the parts box and transfer the files via ethernet from the Mac to the PC. The  486 runs fast enough to upload the files to the Rio 300. The extra memory  for the Rio is a must, so count on spending another hundred bucks. I use my  Rio almost everyday and it sounds and works great.

<Title>Nice idea but highly impractical.
<Date>Mon Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Anyone considering buying a portable MP3 player please consider: MiniDisc is better!!!  Better quality, cheaper (740 minutes of music for $20 opposed to 60 minutes for $100), and you can just as easily transfer MP3s to  MiniDisc. <p>MP3 players are not worth your hard earned money because: - I  don't care what anyone says near CD quality means, not CD quality. - 32  megs is the maximum storage on a card and it costs you almost $100.    If  you enjoy paying $100 to listen to 5 songs over and over again, fine.  -  Most players are not Mac compatible besides most don't even a use USB  interface. - Most players are manufactured poorly.  If you don't want a  product that will break    wait until respectable companies like JVC make  MP3 players.<p>get a MiniDisc player!

<Title>An audiophile by heart - The Rio does it's job!
<Date>Thu Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The Rio product does what it is supposed to do - deliver digital-quality music in a unit that offers re-recording, has no moving parts, and because the music is digitally stored, retains all of it's quality play-after-play.  Some people writing in this message board have to understand the Rio isn't  here to replace small digital-discs... it's here as it's own  representation. (The small discs DO have moving parts) As stated in many  other posts, you can download songs to this thing at various rates from  64Kbps to (I believe) 192Kbps. The quality of music you are going to hear  is based on the original format, and the rate it is stored at on your Rio.  At 64Kbps the music has some digital music artifacts and was quite lossy at  low levels, but generally was acceptable - Like a tape that has been played  MANY times. 96Kbps is a good medium rate that offers good music resolution,  but cuts down on the # of songs you can store. At 128Kbps and higher the  music is very crisp. The first thing you will want to do is make sure you  are using a GOOD set of headphones! Most of today's have poor LOW-END  response. You want to do listen to your MP3's in the car? Do what I do - Buy a  tape-player adapter with a 1/8&quot; plug and jam it into your Rio - then  put the tape adapter into your car's tape player... or buy a small FM  xmitter (SoundFeeder). Instant Digital Gratification. If you know how to  appreciate it ...the Rio is definitely worth it. Besides, imagine what the  (grand)kids will say when they see it in 30 years! &lt;grin&gt;

<Title>A mindisc fan gets Rio
<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I am an ardent MD fan.  I bought the Diamond Rio because of the price.  I love gadgets.  I use it for exercise (even skip protection on MD and CD players sometimes is not perfect)...it does NOT skip, period.  Holds about  50 minutes of good quality music.  Construction quality ok (although I  would get a headphone or headphone adapter with a right angle plug).  Easy  to play.  Good on batteries (1AA alkaline).<p>Problems?   Yes.  The  software comes with basically two programs, the RIO Manager: used to load  Rio from computer.  Easy.  Drag and Drop items from Windows Explorer.  Very  easy and painless.  No problems with RIO Manager.  The other software, for  getting music from CD stinks. Search the internet for freeware, and you  will find some jewels.  You need need software to convert .wav to .mp3 and  .mp3 to .wav.  It does NOT come with this conversion software.  The RIO has  three &quot;speeds&quot;.  If you do not use the right &quot;speed&quot;,  or bitrate, the sound will be off speed (like playing a 33 record on a 45  turntable).  So you need to be flexible.<p>The second problem is the  parallel port adapter. Some devices AFTER the plug adapter (it goes inline  with cables, and has a cable that plugs into the side of it) do not work.   Major pain. Just my printer and the adapter are fine.  But throw in my  scanner, and boom, the scanner don't work.  Anyway, the fix was not a port  sharing device, nothing worked.  The solution is another parallel port card  (for lpt2).  Cheap, and protects computer from plugging and unplugging the  Rio.<p>Those are the ONLY two &quot;problems&quot;.  Easily fixed, and  worth it to get the Rio.  For the price, it is GREAT.  You need good  headphones.  With good headphones at 128kbps you get very near CD sound.  NOT as good as minidisc.  But ok.  the medium RIO speed 80kbps is ok (it  depends on the encoding software you use).  <p>The &quot;equalization&quot;  of the RIO his four modes: NORMAL, CLASIC, JAZZ, and ROCK.  This thing has  the best type of digital sound shaping I have heard.  Sounds  good!<p>Controls are Volume, Play/Pause, forward search/skip, reverse  search/skip, stop, Random, repeat (all or song), A-B, and HOLD (locks  buttons).<p>I am very happy with the Rio.  I will get extra memory  soon.<p>I will say it is not as flexible as minidisc.  With MD you use a 74  minute replacable disk. You can buy MANY MANY MD's for the price of 32mb  memory for RIO.  <p>But Rio has it's place.  In my pocket when I exercise!

<Title>My second review of the Rio pmp300
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I reviewed the Rio pmp300 a couple of weeks ago, and I still love it!  I am writting a second review to let people out there know that I found an extremely easy way to download mp3's for the Rio. You don't have to spend  hours searching the internet for the music you want.  It is called Napster,  I can't give the url so just type it in Yahoo's search engine.  Once you  install the software, you will have access to more that 200,000 mp3s.  I  also found a way to download files from the Rio into your PC it is called  Rioexplorer.  I can't give the url for this either but you can download it  from download safari.  This program basicaly turns the Rio into a large  portable hard drive.  With the information I have given you here you don't  have to contemplate buying a Rio, just go do it.  After downloading these  programs you won't ever have to buy cd's again, and your zip drive just  became obsolete. Rio Rules!

<Title>A good little device
<Date>Sat Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I got this MP3 player after seeing it in a magazine article about cool new technology.  The price was (and still is) a little steep, but I love my little Rio anyway.  The software that comes with it is pretty easy to use,  and it's not too hard to connect it to your computer.  I don't like the  fact that it can really only hold 6 or 7 songs, unless you buy extra  memory, which is very, very expensive.  I also wish it came with an FM  tuner, for when I just feel like listening to the radio without carrying  around my big ol' Walkman.  But overall, it's a nice thing to have; very  lightweight, doesn't skip, excellent sound quality, and runs on just one AA  battery!

The truth is that you have plenty of memory for around 10 3 minute songs!

It provides ease of use as well as varied  options to edit your playlist. It also has drag-and-drop  capibilities.<p>Overall, save yourself a hundred dollars and buy the Rio  PMP 300.

<Title>Pretty cool!
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I own a 300SE and aside from the fact that it has updated firmware and more memory it is exactly the same.  I was worried about things that I had read stating that the case was shoddy, the volume level was insufficient  and the memory didn't hold enough.  I just wanted to say that all of this  IS NOT true.  It seems really solid to me, not that I'd ever drop the thing  or be rough with it, but it does just fine while jogging or riding a  bike...as for the volume level comments perhaps people are just listening  to songs encoded at a low base level because I listen to mine on level 5 of  20 and it's fine for most songs unless I'm in a REALLY noisy  environment...lastly I listen to all of my songs at 128k. and I can fit an  acceptable amount of music on my 64megs--no it isn't as much as a CD but  with 2 32meg smartmedia cards on the way that should be more than enough to  get me through all but the longest of plane flights.  With the portability  of the transfer cable and software I can just burn all of my mp3s to a Cd  or 2, throw it in my luggage and change the songs out from wherever I  happen to be...much more efficient than lugging around all of my CDR mixes  and other CDs.  True the parallel transfer is much slower than the USB that  the 500 offers, but do I really want to use USB when places that I travel  might not offer USB support?  Also the backlight of the new 500s are  supposed to drain the battery power and I don't find the lack of a  backlight to be as big of a problem as I thought it would be, however.  I  would definately recommend purchasing the rio remote as it super easy to  use and extends the headphone's cord length by a good 2 feet.  See ya!

<Content>I own one of the original PMP 300 MP3 Players and it has served me well for over a year now.  I have never upgraded the memory though I plan to, but it still will store around 8-10 songs depending on the quality and length.  Moreover it runs forever on a single AA battery and never skips  whatsoever.  The transfering procedure is a little slow but not horribly  slow.  Finally I also found out this great website where you can download excerpts from audiobooks since they don't have  nearly the quality of music you can put hours of them on the Rio.

I also don't have to waste the time and money of  copying cd's and then throwing them out when i get tired of the music.  Now  all i do is go plug the rio into the computer download some limp bizcut or  what ever, and i'm off.  The sound quality is awesome, and i don't know  what some of the others were talking about but the headphones are great.  I  showed the Rio to all of my relatives at christmas and they were all very  impressed.  Thank you Diamond for such a great product, at such a great  price.

<Title>A Wonderful Beginner MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I bought my Rio PMP 300 a few weeks ago before Amazon ran out, and it is wonderful! The controls are very easy to use, although the memory is somewhat small, I figured how to change my downloaded MP3s into a smaller bit-rate, taking out very little quality. One thing that I read in previous  reviews that somewhat discouraged me was that it tended to be very  responsive, and easy to accidently press a button, but when I began using  my Rio, I noticed the handy hold feature which helped out greatly, after I  had set the settings I liked for the tracks i was listening to. Overall,  this product was a good beginner model, even though its lack of memory, and  i would highly recommend it to beginners, and I would suggest the Creative  Nomad 64 Megabyte for more advanced users of MP3.

<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I my self have recently perchesed a RIO and can say it is so much better than a MD because it's worth ever penney. Think of it this way, an MD is bout $250(recordable). The Rio is only $100 right now. It is true the MD  can play more songs, but at that price you'd most likely be to scared to  take it anywhere for fear of breaking it.  For example if you where to go  bike tiding and it fell or somthin, not a big loss, $100 compared to the  MD, $250 gone. You do the math. And also, unless you got the stuff, with  the MD you'll still have to buy CD's, unlike wiht the RIO

<Content>Want a horror story? Check this... This past summer, I put in a bid on Diamond's e-Auction for a refurb Rio SE and won (yeah, &quot;won&quot; - right). First they sent me a 32MB Rio by mistake. Then they sent me a Rio  SE - broken and filthy dirty (so much for being &quot;refurbished&quot;).  After that, they sent me a brand new Rio SE - the next day, the control  button falls off of it. Finally, they sent me another brand new unit - the  display doesn't work. Diamond will no longer respond to my e-mails and the  1-800 number won't go through from my calling area. Also, with each unit  they sent me, I had to pay $22 Cdn (GST - I live in Canada) - I'd be able  to get it back from Canadian Customs but Diamond won't send me a letter to  confirm the RMAs I sent back to them. Still want to buy from Diamond...?

<Content>So this thing is supposed to be great eh?  That's what I thought too, till I got one for xmas!  It turns out that with the bitrate everyone encodes mp3's with (128kbps) only about 30 minutes of music fit on this piece of junk!  I only call it a peice of junk because I opened the box and looked  the unit over and found that there was a place where the glue had failed  and I could see the little circuit board inside my player!  So, that aside,  went to see if I could get a flash card to upgrade so I could put as much  as 1 entire hour (that's at least 20 minutes less than the largest cd's) on  my riopmp300, but it costs almost 100 bucks for another 32megs!  So now I'm  fed up with diamond as well as the place I bought it from (not here, I just  came here to warn you guys) because that damn rebate makes it unreturnable!   They're trying to get rid of them because they know they suck!   &quot;They&quot; want to get you to buy the 270 dollar rio that might be  worth what this one cost if you can put 90 minutes of music on it.

<Title>Sounds Fine to Me
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Had a Rio PMP300 player for about a week. It is tiny, battery life is excellent compared with other portable music solutions and there are no moving parts so it doesn't skip. The upload sofware is intuitive, I was up  and running in a couple of minutes. I havn't looked at the packaged CD  ripping/encoding software as I prefer to use my own software to do this. As  to the quality/memory size issue: if you play a song recorded at 128kpbs  and then play the same song at 64kbps you will notice the difference.  However I couldn't really say that one is 'better' than the other, in terms  of sound quality. The 128kpbs version is of course closer to the original  CD if that is what is meant by 'better quality'. I'd say its nothing that  can't be corrected with equilisation. If you played two dissimilar songs,  one encoded at 64kbps and one at 128kpbs I'm not sure I could reliably tell  you which was which. In short the difference isn't enough for me to care.  At 128kbps, the play time is about 30 minutes, at 64kbps it is about 60  minutes. If you want 60 minutes play time, I'd try a 32Mb player first then  if you care about the 128kbps issue buy a 32Mb Flash card upgrade. Simple  as that.

<Content>You can't talk about the future unless the audio player support the future.  You have to compare what you have on the market.  When you compare a MP3 player and what's on the market like a Minidisc, MP3 hasn't matured  and isn't worth it.  Damn manufacters just ripping us off (similar to  CD-writers when it was first put on the market).  The only advantages MP3s  have are its battery life, weight, and it's ability to transfer data to the  PC (files, pictures, etc..what's a zipdisk/LS120/CDRW anyways).  I don't  know why they don't want to do that with Minidiscs.  Minidiscs are  basically the same things as optical drives.  Anyways, I have a sharp  recordable minidisc player and play tennis with it strapped to my belt and  it does not skip (I'm not an old timer either).  CD players can't compare  to minidisk in versatility and its definitely too late for a recordable one  that operates independently of a computer unless its for the real poor.   Hopefully, besides making it more like a optical hardrive, they will add a  radio to minidisk players as well, but for now a $50 pocket radio with  TV/weather from Sangean or pocket shortwave radio from Sony is fine.<p>Back  to comparisons.  Minidisks are cheaply swappable (listen to music/record a  lecture; why can't MP3s), on the go edittable, have an optical link for  digital quality (if you have a digital link on your soundcard minidisks are  just like MP3 players), can record directly from different sources of audio  like my shortwave radio(MP3s can only record using the computer and through  it's mic, why's that?), it has a smart function where it records only when  there's audio, clearly it is more independent in operations.<p>MP3's aren't  truly portable audio anyway. I haven't heard of a Sony MP3 player.  Sharing  a song with a friend you'll need a computer disk or CD.  The memmory stick  or smartcard is currently too pricey.  You can buy minidisks like CDs.   Have a variety of music with you on your travels.  What can I say overall.   There are those who aren't spoiled and demand a lot more for their  cash.<p>Come on people demand better and you'll get better in a shorter  time then if you just buy things when its first released.  Newer MP3 models  looks pretty good though.

<Title>Diamond Rio PMP300 is great!!!!!
<Date>Sun Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I just bought the Diamond Rio PMP300 and I must say that I love it. As for quality, how can you complain? At 64Kbps it sounds great. I was also very surprised at how fast it transfers to the player from the computer. The  volume is very load if you have encoded it at a high volume. You can't  expect it to make a really low volume MP3 really load. The software that  comes with it is great except for the fact there is a 50 MP3 limit on the  encoder. You can allways download Real Jukebox. It's  better anyway. This is a must buy.

And if you can attach a printer to your computer, you can attach your  Rioport... it even comes with a parallel pass-thru. All in all, a worthy  piece of electronics and a recommended product.

<Content>The best hifi gadget I ever bought was my portable Mini Disc recorder and I can't see this MP3 player or much that will come after changing my mind. Are add-on-plug-in memory cartridges ever going to be as cheap as MD's? No  way, and even in the unlikely event the capacity of the 'memory sticks'  reaches some reasonable level, I'm sure Sony will have brought out a double  or high density MD by then!<p>Anyway, I can have hi quality, random access  portable music thru my MD without ever going near a PC... and equally, if I  want I can simply run a line out from my sound card and record anything my  PC can play...<p>Other folks here have put the minidisc case well, I just  thought I'd give them a hand.<p>Hurrah for MD!

<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Well, this product looks good, but if you think a little bit about his performance and you are a MP3 lover you will think that 2 hours of MP3 songs isn't enough.<p>You probably know that is law penalty if you have mp3  or make mp3 files if you don't own the original cd. <p>In the past a  walkman or discman was so nice in a trip, but in this days of technology  will be excelent if you make your own cd's of mp3 files (of course having  the originals) that contains near 150 songs in 650Mb and put in a really  good mp3 player (I'll call mp3man).<p>In a few words, the best mp3 player  (mp3man) is the unit in what you put a cd of mp3 and play your 150songs for  more than 2 hours.<p>With this mp3man, you don't need any flash memory  aditional to upgrade the charge capacity, you will need only cd's.<p>I hope  that in near future this unit comes true.<p>Think 150 times before you  purchase this unit.

If I need to change music I have 10 gigs of mp3s on cd-r at home!

<Content>I have had my Rio PMP300 since April 99, and I must say I adore it.  <p>Ripping your CDs is easy, and they sound beautiful in playback.  It's incredible to be able to select ONLY the tracks I want to hear every  morning.  I am never without mine.  Its small size and low weight make  carrying it everywhere I go painless. And no skipping!  No fast forwarding  through tracks I don't want!  Plus, it only uses one double-A battery that  lasts for weeks! What a dream!<p>One note... if you're thinking of buying  one, shell out the extra money for one with more memory.  The 32 meg model  stores at MOST 10 songs, usually more around 7 or 8 (without flash memory).   That's fine for a day, but can get old fast, especially on long trips.   <p>Unlike one other reviewer, I have had no trouble with my unit  whatsoever. It has been nothing but solid.<p>A great gift for your  favourite geek.  Or if you're buying for yourself, go for it!  You won't  regret it!

It brakes after a while.  I loved it but now, i cant move forward track  because the button is missing.

<Content>This is still the best MP3 player out in the market, even though it has been a year since Diamond released it. This Special Edition version is great. It comes with 64mb of memory and is expandable to 96mb. That's over  90 minutes of near cd quality music. Get it while it is still available.  Also, if you have the black Rio 300, you can trade it in for $100 off the  purchase of this special edition.<p>Pros: Cool Translucent Teal Case,        Expandable to 96mb,       Easy to use software,       One AA battery lasts  13 hours! ,       Buttons are conveniently placed       Sound is crystal  clear; no skipping<p>Cons: Earbud headphones could be better

<Content>I have to say, this thing works awesome and the price is right.  If you want to spend 250% more, go ahead and buy the Rio 500, but this thing does exactly what it is supposed to do: play high quality music without  skipping.  I skied with it last weekend and was amazed.  I would say that  you are probably not going to want to listen to classical music with this;  it lends itself more towards &quot;loud&quot; music.  The only down side is  the completely unresponsive customer service.  Eric Thomas with Diamond  never returned my 5 calls when I tried to find out how to get the rebate  (go to the website).

<Title>...Rio PMP 300 Special-Edition tops!
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>...CDs are too cumbersome and skip prone for any active portability.  MiniDisk is dead because of MP3's.  MiniDisk's just don't have enough support and if you  want a model that records it will cost you every bit as much as a MP3  player.  As far as storage capacity, two hours of your favorite tunes in  the order that you choose is plenty for any portable device.  How many  joggers or walkers carry more than two hours worth of CDs with them when  they go out?  Heck, radio stations start to repeat songs after two  hours...if you need better than two hours worth of digitally recorded music  when you go out then leave the 74-min. MDs and the CDs (usually no more  than 80 mins. per disk) at home too.  The Rio is a great portable music  device for ripping songs from favorite CDs and taking them on the go.  If  you want 5 hours worth of CD-quality to listen to in one sitting then sit  at home and listen to CDs.  With the Rio, you can have different sets of  playlists stored in your MP3 library and load two hours worth of songs that  fit your mood or tasts in each playlist...It is my opinion that the Rio is  better than any portable CD or MD player on the market. One last  point...the two hours of memory is interchangable...you can put whatever  songs or playlist you want to load on the Rio, then load something else  later on that same memory without losing your songs or playlist.  With a  recordable CD or MD you have to record a separate disk for each set of  songs.  I'd rather have 3 saved &quot;Love Songs&quot; files to choose from  and load on my Rio, than to have to buy 3 MDs labled &quot;Love Songs Vol.  1,2 and 3&quot;.  You can store as many songs as you like on your computer  and use the Rio as opposed to having to buy a separate tape, CD or MD for  each mix or special set you record.  If MP3 isn't for you then stick with  the old way of having to carry around tapes and disks when you jog.   Otherwise, the Rio is a great buy for portable audio anyway you look at it.

<Content>I received this player through a computer package deal. At first I thought I had a problem when the unit was shaken,it made an awful sound and seemed to freeze up. After a while this went away (I was about ready to contact  customer service,but hey it stopped right? Another peeve has got to be  memory, why so little ?(32mg). I find that If I don`t use the high quality  setting, the songs have skips,hesitations,and they are sometimes cut off a  little at the beginning or end. High quality downloads only get you about  six songs(!).this, and the expensive cost of additional memory cards makes  me feel like using it as a door stopper! Also,trying to find decent free  downloads off the internet is like pulling teeth, Basically I just download  my own cd music and use it with an adapter in my car until I get sick of  those six songs,then I download more. But please people, don`t take my word  for it go out and get one for yourself and all your friends.It is after  all, cutting edge technology !

<Content>I dont have the Rio 300 but ive used it , it was my friends. It was a very good product and im getting one . The biggest problem is its memory  capacity , wich doesnt bother me much because im a music freak and i dont  think even 36 kbps is bad for things like Nirvana.I do prefere at least 64  or 96 Kbps though . The battery pannel doesnt BREAK easy , it just pops off  and that happens with my 3 walkmans and my Cd players too if it bothers you  that much try tape.It would to have the LCD screen display song titles and  have a backlight but my cd player doesnt have that so again it doesnt  bother me much.If your a MAC user( which im not) u can either get the Rio  500 which costs more but works with MAcs and has 64 Mb of memory or u CAN  buy software to make the Rio compatible.Some people listen to hours of  music but im only a teen ager and i dont get much time so the bus ride to  and from school only gives me 10 min of music anyway.If you want more than  an hour ( at 64 kbps) then i do recomend getting at least a 16 mb upgrade  card. I would. ANd the cheapest ive found MD for is $300 , im not paying  that for a Cd player wen i already have one. Buy rio , you get your moneys  worth.

<Content>I loved rio during the first few weeks after buying it. Although it carries only 30 MINUTES of CD-QUALITY (or 1 HOUR RADIO QUALITY) music, it still is good.  I used it every day and carry it with me everywhere I  go--jogging, on my way to school and even at home. The problem is the case  is not very durable.  It cracks easily and they don't sell any cases so you  have to be really careful with it--it's a delicate electronic thing.  The  first part which cracked was the cover which holds the battery.  So what I  did was to use a rubber band to hold it in place (I can't use it in jogging  anymore).  Then the belt clip followed.  I e-mailed Rio's support people  and they told me that to buy a carrying case instead.  It is not a very  durable product.  I'm getting myself the 64 MB version--I hope it's more  dependable than the 32 MB one.

<Title>Do you really want to listen to the same music over and over
<Date>Tue Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>OK now...who needs the hassle of having to always have their computer around to change the songs they want to listen to.  If you go on vacation where are you going to upload new songs?  The only reasonable alternative  is a Minidisc player/recorder.  Each disc holds 74, or up to 80 minutes of  music.  The sound is incredible, and don't worry about abusing the discs  since they are protected by their own plastic shells.  Minidiscs are the  only reasonable route for sheer portability until something better comes  along.  Don't forget to add another $100 on the Rio so you can listen to 60  more minutes of music.  Now which is the real bargain.  $100-60 min. of  music on the Rio, or $3-74 min on Minidisc?

<Title>A great portable system with a few problems.
<Date>Sat Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The Rio PMP300 is a great portable system if you have access to your own computer. Some advantages are that it's very small, very light, it doesn't skip, It only takes 1 battery which runs for at least 10 hrs, and the music can be free on the internet. You can also take tracks right off your  favorite CDs. The 1 problem that I have with it is that it only holds 32 MB  which is about 7 or 8 CD quality songs. It could hold more if you don't  mind radio quality. If you want to get more memory on this thing it's not  cheap. You can double your memory from 32MB to 64MB for about $100. I am  going to wait for the price to go down before I buy more memory for mine. The  software that it comes with is pretty good too. I also like the overall  design of the buttons and player. It has a Hold option, 5 different  Equalizers, Replay and Random modes, and a cool A~B feature which is  pointless fun to play with.

<Title>Great!, just a few things they left out.
<Date>Sat Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>This is a great product just a few things that I thought the rio company left out. pros&gt; great sound quality and everything is neat. cons&gt;It is a little tricky to set up,the port stuff is a little hard they didnt  include great detail on it. next the software is ok that they give you but  It doesnt give you the choice of what sound quality&lt;kbps&gt; that you  want, which will save you memory if you get the right quality you want. I  recommend you download realjuke box if you get the rio, it is a little  better than the rio manager software.

<Title>The Best Ever
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I love listening to music, this is the best. Easy to use, excellent sound quality no matter what your musical taste. Download from the net, or record your own play list. It doesn't get any better than this. Less expensive  then other players, but much better. Take it anywhere, it doesn't skip. I  can't say enough about this.

<Title>If only it was better made....
<Date>Wed Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Unlike many of the other Minidisc owners on here, I happen to like MP3. The minidisks are great....but for something small and light to tuck in my pocket, nothing beats the Rio! It's at least half the size and a third the  weight of my minidisk player. And yes, the size DOES make a difference to  many people. <p>I love getting free MP3's off the web, and while I *could*  put them on minidisks, I like being able to every day or so put a  completely different assortment of songs on the Rio to listen to. It's  certainly not much harder than recording a disk and I'm one of those people  that can listen to favorite songs over and over so a little repetition  doesn't bother ME any.<p>Unfortunately, the Rio is not without faults. In  fact, I have a hard time recommending it. 32 meg is definitely NOT enough.  I got a Flash card, and have started having varying problems, first with my  memory being unusable, and then having small chunks become corrupted. Am  now having problems with the player intermittently stopping on its own and  freezing up so I have to remove the battery. Oh, should mention that the  first Rio I got had a broken battery compartment and was returned. Am still  waiting on my rebates. HATE not being able to use it on Windows NT, and not  having USB. And the headsets that come with it are worthless for many  people. Personally, I'm not sure I even want to try the later Rio models,  as I've had so much trouble with this one in only a few months of owning  it.

<Title>Numerous problems with hardware and software - Don't Buy
<Date>Thu Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>PROS:<br> The form factor of the device is good.  It is small, easy to exercise with.<p><p>CONS:<br> + NT drivers are horrible.  They don't support NT. You have to find shareware to download MP3's to it.<br> + On  Win98 machine, the out-of-the-box software that Rio came with would not  recognize my second memory card.<br> + The base 32MB of memory was  corrupted on mine.  Some songs skip around or get mixed up as a result. +  Rio customer service is sub-par.  I waited about an hour to talk to  someone.<br> <p> All in all, a very bad customer experience.  I will  probably buy a different MP3 player to replace this.

<Title>It IS worth it
<Date>Thu Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I read every single review on this page before making my purchase, and all I can say is that IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT, but only if you have a fast internet connection (I have cable). I also suggest getting the additional  flash card. It takes 3-4 minutes to download a 4 MB song from the Internet.   You need a lot of HD space or a ZIP drive also, because once you start  downloading songs, you can kind of get addicted to downloading them and  being able to hear new stuff.  And the convenience and sound quality is  amazing. I primarily use it on my drive to and from work, and the 64 MB of  space holds plenty of music (15-17 songs), until I get home and can change  out the songs. That is so much more convenient than having to switch CD's  every time you want to hear your favorite songs, or having to wait for the  CD Changer in your car to shuttle between discs just to hear one song. The  leather carrying case is worth it, although I had to rig a small strap onto  it in order to hang it from the Stairmaster at the gym. I'm sure there are  better MP3 players available, but they're so much more expensive, and  you're better served using that money towards more memory. <p>P.S.  Don't  believe Sony's hype. All you MiniDisc lovers spent too much money on a  format that's going the way of the Betamax.

<Title>very conveniet, but can be improved
<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I got this Rio PMP300 for my birthday, and I love it!  It's lightweight, and has a belt clip so I can wear it and do whatever I want to (walk, run)...and it still won't skip.  It has a very long battery life (about 12 hours with one AA battery), especially if you use Duracell Ultra, which is  included with this.  The sound quality is surprisingly good considering its  portability.  However, Diamond has decided to distribute earbud headphones  with the Rio now (not the ones pictured here), and their quality is not  very good.  The music will sound better if you use another pair of  headphones instead.  There is a hold function that disables all buttons  when it is turned on, which is extremely convenient for me, since I carry  the Rio around in my backpack where other things sometimes accidentally  press against the keys and could turn the player on.  The Rio does not play  wav files, but that problem can be solved since wav files can be converted  to mp3.  The PMP300's memory is less than what I would like -- only 32MB.   Flash cards can be used to expand the memory, but they cost even more than  the Rio itself (with rebate, it is a great deal)!  The software included  with this is easy to install and use, and will convert your CDs into mp3s  for you.  There is also a CD sampler with lots of mp3 files on it.

<Title>OK Sound Quality, Solid Product, Messed up LCD.
<Date>Sat Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I purchased the Diamond Rio, and it has great sound. One problem: The LCD is messed up. I don't feel like returning it, but I hate when something has a problem like that. I am still neutral because of the LCD problem, but one more problem with it and it's going back. It could also use a better warranty

<Title>Rio: Serves its purpose well, don't expect so much
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I just recently received my RIO300.  The 300 comes with outdated software that is a pain to use, but you will only need to download  the free version of RealPlayerJukebox to be able to take full advantage of the RIO.  The fact that the 300 uses a parallel connector, opposed to the 500's USB connector, means it will take about 5 minutes to fill 32MB.  But considering it'll take much-much longer to rip 32Megs of songs from a CD, this wait to download tot he RIO is neglegable to all but the most impatient.  At 64Kbps, the sound quality is still  pretty good.  For those who would take their RIO's to the gym, you won't  notice the little distortions.  Actually, it's more of a "fading"  effect as you tone down to 64Kbps, easily corrected by turning up the  volume.  The volume doesn't go as high as to make your ears bleed, but you  it can be high enough to have them ringing nicely if that's your pleasure.   At 64Kbps, you can hold almost 1 1/2 hours of music.  So with that nifty  32MB Upgrade for ONLY $100 (ouch) you'll have enough tunes to last you  through Titanic.  While the newer portable MP3 players are MUCH nicer and  probably come with better software, it doesn't take an economist to see  that they're WAY overpriced.   The RIO300 shouldn't be compared to a new  home entertainment system, especially since it's the only portable mp3  player that isn't priced like one.
