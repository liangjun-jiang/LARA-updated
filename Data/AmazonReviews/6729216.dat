<Title>Cowon iAudio 7 is fantastic and versatile!!!!!
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't even think about iPod.  The Cowon iAudio 7 fills all your audio needs with none of the headaches of iPod.  The computer recognizes it as a "removable storage device" so there is no special software necessary, although it comes with Jet Audio software which is great in its own right.  You can just drop and drag files into the player. The sound is phenomenal and much fuller and richer than iPod and Zune that I have tried. Although versatility is its greatest asset.  It just does what its told, without acting all parental like iPod and Zune.  My only regret is that I wish I had bought the 16 GB model.

<Title>Forget ipod - iAudio products are outstanding
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned an ipod 4G - nothing but issue after issue until it went out of warrantee and became no longer worth working with.  The files would corrupt, I'd have to reset it, re-install, and iTunes or even gPod was just awful.  After listening to iAudio, the sound on an ipod is not so good, actually.  Beautiful design, but 400.00 for a barely functional player? Never again.    I researched much more carefully when I purchased my next player.  iAudio products play mp3 or ogg and a couple of other formats.  I rip at 196 or even 210 bits, instead of the default 128 crap files - because you can hear the difference, especially in ogg, on the iAudio - I'd also recommend finding a pair of Ultimate Ear in ear monitors, just outstanding.  Makes flying on a plane with a baby in the next aisle totally do-able.   I just bought the 8 GB.  I have an iAudio x5 60 GB hard drive player, 2 years old, never a problem.  I had a 1GB flash player by iAudio - four years old, and my son has had it for the last year and a half.  It weaned him off the ipod habit.  Again, never an issue. I'd never buy an ipod again, ever.   Great sound, real audiophile quality.  Play it through a set of Bose Companion speakers when on the road and it's like having a home system with you.  Work out with it.    Drop files on the players - they mount on windows or linux as drives, and the files can just be placed on the players without special software.  I rip to both mp3 and ogg, and use the ogg files exclusively on the iAudio players. Use Exact Audio Copy and oggenc2.exe and lame to rip.    Highly highly recommended - these are five year or more players, absolutely the highest quality.

<Title>Very Nice
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>pros - awesome sound quality (blows ipods away) - enough power to drive good headphones - crazy long battery life - record FM radio (you can also use the timer to auto-record a show) - FLAC and Ogg Vorbis support - connects like any other extermal storage device so you can just drag and drop music, files, whatever. This lets it work with podcastready too which is a small program you keep on the player and then you can update podcasts from any computer (you manage the podcasts from their site, it's really slick). - Also due to the above it is Linux and Mac compatible. I believe the software for converting videos is windows only (maybe Mac too?) though, but I haven't tried running it under wine in Linux (don't care at all about playing videos personally). - text file viewer (handy I suppose if you want to throw a shopping list or directions or whatever on there)  cons - FM tuner reception is a bit weak - voice recorder is less than spectacular - fingerprint magnet - conrols are touchy and take a bit of getting used to. It's easy to accidentally start the voice or FM recorder. The hold switch is essential if you are carrying it around (disables all controls). I have it set so I can still pause and change the volume. Aside from some minor gripes the UI is very easy to use once you get the hang of it though and hopefully will continue to get better with firmware upgrades. - the stock headphones actually sound pretty good, but were uncomfortable and constantly falling out. My ears are small though. I'm using some $20 JVC air cushon in-ear phones for now that I really like, but will probably invest in some high end in-ear phones at some point as I use it almost 8 hours a day 5 days a week. - thick (I don't care, it's still tiny, but yeah it doesn't look as slick as an ipod).  Overall, highly recommended.

<Title>MOVE OVER IPODS HERE COMES COWON
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For a very long time I have been looking for an excellent sound performer mp3 player.The first thing I did was purchasing a reliable set of headphones, my final choice after many trials was a Westone UM-2 dual drivers,expensive $300 but worth every dime.Now the problem was matching these to a comparable player; the answer: cowon's I7.The sound quality with so many wistles and bells avail,you can twick the music to make it sound just perfect.Imagine having a variable loudness control just like in the old Mc Intosh amps,you get perfect amount of bass and I mean clear Low end bass, the custom EQ lets you match your headphones to your personal taste, no overwhelming mids and annoying high ends.The amp is very powerfull and it does not compromise the battery life, you can actually get 15 hours of play.  The only small problem I found is getting use to all functions since there is no manual avail. Now the fun part, since it supports Flac compression (among others)one can rip a cd without loosing any quality of sound , problem found in all mp3 playes due to the compression support system. If you are looking for a generic player and sound quality is no issue , this is not the unit for you. If you are an audiofile purist and demand that the music be heard as natural as possible,please consider this player.I just love it and all my other players have been put to rest. Point made.

<Title>Wonderful audio player
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm very happy with the iAudio 7 - it's light, fast to boot, good storage space, excellent codec support, lots of nice features (such as embedded lyrics) but most of all the audio quality is SUPERB!  Using it with high quality earphones such as the vmoda vibe are allowing me to hear subtleties in songs I've never heard before (particularly when playing back flac), but high bitrate ogg/mp3 over the included speakerphones is also surprisingly good.  With regular use I haven't been able to move the battery indicator off of "Full".  I found the controls easy enough to get used to and have come to like them quite a bit.  As to the got-to-have it factor ... well, there was a time when having those white earphones meant you knew something everyone else didn't.  Now, you're driving a black Ford model T (and paying too much for something non-exclusive -- go figure).   The only downside is that it is a fingerprint magnet ... on the plus side a single wipe and its clean.  I do recommend upgrading the firmware to the 1.15+ (apparently 1.17 is just now out as well).  Be aware that flashing the firmware clobbers your files so back it up first :)

<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first mp3 player, and I'm in my 60s. I've enjoyed making music files all my life, going back to using reel-to-reel tapes, and then cassettes, and then CDs. This machine does what it says. The line in recorder function allows easy download from any number of sources. (You do need to buy the linein audio cable separately, its not provided). The FM receiver is very strong. I live in a radio fringe area of the country and can pick up a strong FM signal with the iaudio7, and the super simple button push to record the FM is great. The sound is very powerful, and the equalizer and bass effect really enhance that. I figure I have replaced a wall of high quality sound equipment with this little player. The control buttons and slide mechanism are sensitive, as many people say, but I find it easily manageable once you adapt to how lightly you need to touch the controls to get what you want. I agree with the company statements.......its an extreme mp3 experience and delivers on all that they say it will do.

<Title>A pain in the rear for a Mac owner
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned the Cowon iAudio7 for about one month and am thinking I might have been best served to buy an iPod.  I'll confess at this point that I am a Mac owner.  Based on several user reviews and what I had learned on CNet and a few other consumer electronics review sites, I thought I would be able to work with the disclaimer in the instructions that indicated "data transfer only" beside the campatability listing for Mac OS.  Well, "data transfer only" means data transfer only.  The supplied software with the Cowon IAudio7 is only for Windows.  I can run Windows and therefore the Cowon software on my Mac; however, the software is not nearly as intuitive as iTunes.  Now, I'm a recent convert to Mac (~3 months), but when the manufacturer of a device claims to be compaitble with Mac, I think it's reasonable to expect it to be FULLY compatible with a Mac.  Worst of all, the iAudio7 doesn't play songs imported from CD which have been converted into m4a format via iTunes.  It seemes to only play MP3s without any tinkering around.    Pros: Large capacity for the price with good sound.  Not like all the other kids on the block with iPods.  Great battery life.    Cons: Incredibly awkward navigation both on PC side and player.  Doesn't seem to recognize as many file formats as some reviewers claim (unless I'm doing something incorrectly).  Small screen, sensitive buttons, and screen orientation make it a bit difficult to navigate songs quickly while working out.  Available armband seems to be a two-part contraption that is more expensive than one might think it should be.    For a PC owner, this might be just the thing you're looking for.  I just didn't want to believe that with a Mac, the buck stopped at an iPod.

<Title>Perfect for Audio Books
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iAudio 7 is what hours of research boiled down to, but in the end, I am finicky when it comes to electronics. This player passes the test. First off, upgrade the firmware and then complain about the sensitivity. Default on the player when I got it was So sensitive that I literally did not touch the buttons and they would trigger. But firmware (1.17 currently) has fixed that. Normal sensitivity setting is perfect now.   This player is Audio Booking made easy. I had an iRiver H10 which was horrible for audio books. It didn't have bookmarking, so if pause/resume failed, I had to search through the hour long music file at a few seconds per tic of fast fwd. However, what my research did not uncover was, you can set the fast forward rate up to 30s per tick. I have it at 5s for now and it blazes. That means at a rate of 30s per tick of ffwd, you can reach 30min into a chapter in just a few seconds. That's handy. And of course you can save 20 bookmarks.   The sound is as good as everyone boasts. I like the look and am not worried about it cracking as i would a wimpy ipod.   There is a lot to program in the settings, like secondary functions of buttons - hold the Menu button down to Record Radio, Bookmark, Voice Record, etc. whatever you want to set it at. 2 programmable function buttons like that.  Pros: bookmarking, fast fast forwarding, programability, great sound, sturdy, mega battery, sharp looking.  Cons: small viewing screen for movies, must convert movies from avi/mpeg into the jetaudio format, which takes about 30 minutes for 700mb.

<Title>Does what I want, and does it well!
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros 1. Phenomenal sound 2. No proprietary software 3. Excellent battery life  Cons 1. Small screen 2. Thick  First off, a little bit about myself and my mp3 player purchasing so you can properly evaluate whether this review will suffice your needs.  I am a self-described audiophile who likes to listen to things with the best possible sound.  I originally started out in the mp3 player market with a Creative Nomad Jukebox (had a 2.5" 6gb hard drive and ran on 4AA batteries for about 4 hours).  I later upgraded to a Cowon iAudio G3 in 2004 or 2005.   The play button no longer registers on the G3, so I started searching for a replacement.    Design The device is similar in dimensions to a bic lighter, just a little wider and a little thicker (about as thick as a AA battery).  I like the fact that the device has some dimension but weighs very little.  The controls on the front of the device are touch sensitive.  People have complained that it's too sensitive.  I so far have not found this true, however when I keep it in my pocket, I use the hold button, which prevents accidentally skipping tracks.  The cover over the USB port feels solid.  As for the screen, it is small.  Probably about the size of a postage stamp.  I would not this device for video purposes.  Also, the device is very glossy, which is very fingerprint prone.  I have no case for the device, and I still have no scratches (although realize I have only been using for about 2-3 weeks at this point).   User Interface This is the area where there are lots of differences between users.  As mentioned above, the touch controls are sometimes rated to be too sensitive.  However, one nice feature is that the user can adjust the hold button to permit the buttons on top of the player to continue to adjust volume as well as play/pause.    As for file searching, I tend to use the folder mode, for two reasons: (1) I previously had the iAudio G3, and that device was only folder mode, so my music is organized in folders in a very easy to search way and (2) for whatever reason, Cowon does not have a way to use DPL (Dynamic Playlist - the ability to create a playlist on the fly) when using ID3 searching.    Features  This device has many features beyond just audio playback, but even with audio playback, it can playback more than just mp3 and wma.  It also can playback ogg and flac.  It can play video files (I hear that a conversion is required to put it on the device, but I have yet to use this for video).  In addition, it can record both voice and line-in.  I hear that the line-in recording (wire not included) will automatically start new tracks when there is a gap in the music.   There is also a radio with decent reception and, if you are listening and hear a song you like, you can record. Performance Music Transfer is purely drag and drop.  No need for any proprietary software.  And all very good is that the device uses standard mini USB, not a proprietary software.  First off, let's get this out right here - I have NEVER opened the earbuds that came with the device.  I am listening to is using my Sennheiser PX100 (entry level portable headphones).  One of the main reasons I purchased this device was my level of satisfaction with the G3.  It sounds absolutely phenomenal.  It's almost like having a portable stereo system.  Between BBE, Mach3Bass, and customizable EQ, this device sounds amazing.  As for other playback features this device has (video, pictures, text, etc.), I have not used tested this device.  As mentioned earlier, the screen is very small, so it probably is not the greatest device for these other options.  Summary If you are looking for a device for quality audio playback, look no further.  This device sounds phenomenal, especially when paired with a good set of headphones.

<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I currently own a Sandisk e280 and this Iaudio 7 mp3 player. Sound quality on the I7 is by far much much better than the e280. The equalizer on the I7 is far superior also. Not only do you have presets but you can also create your own. It also has an advanced EQ settings where you can set the frenquencey of each band. Wide,normal and narrow waves are available for the EQ as well.   You can delete a song as it is playing which is a great idea. The touch pads are not as sensitive after updateing the firmware. That by the way is really easy to do. Did an experiment on the battery life and got 36 hours out of it. Keep in mind though I kept the display on and had a set of speakers hooked up to it at the time. With normal use will get 50+ hours easy.   The headphones used for sound quality testing were Sennheiser PX100,Grado SR 60, and AKG K 26 P. This little player was able to have punch on all three even the Grados. That is amazing from such a small unit. Only thing is I wish I had gotten the 16GB model.   Update: 02/13/08. After normal use the battery life lasted 54 hours before it flashed red. This thing still gets a top vote to me.

<Title>Every bit as good as advertised
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product was everything it was advertised to be.  The primary reason I bought the Cowon iAudio 7 was because of how much Cowon stressed it would be completely simple to use with Linux, and that is totally the case.  Yeah, it is a little thicker than an iPod nano, but when it's still this small does it matter?  And that extra thickness sure serves is purpose. Packed in the little device is an FM tuner and an outstanding battery.  I've had mine now for 3 or 4 weeks, I take it to the gym and to work, and I've only had to charge it three times.  The headphones that come with it are pretty cheap.  I got a nicer pair and the sound is even better!

<Title>Great Sound, OK Usability
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had the 8GB iAudio 7 for a few weeks.  First, the good:   - The sound quality is excellent, with lots of adjustments to tweak the sound to personal taste.  I have used several players before, and this one is the most flexible.  You can equalize (of course), bass-enhance, set the soundstage for varying 3d effect, etc.  The only caution I'd give is that it's tempting to layer too many enhancements just because you can, and it is possible to overdo it.   - Rated battery life is outstanding.  I have not tested to the 50-60hr rated limit (I've read both), but in playing for many hours I haven't been able to budge the battery level meter.   - Support for file types: Having FLAC and OGG support is not common, and allows the player to reach quality levels not possible by those only supporting AAC, MP3 and compressed WMA.   - In MSC mode, can automatically execute a program when plugged into USB port.  This is handy for easily starting a podcast download program when it's connected.  I have had trouble setting this on other players.   Needs Improvement:   - The FF/REV slider is a cool concept that works ok, but it needs improvement.  Others have commented that it's overly sensitive despite having three levels, and that's true.  However, at any of the levels the performance is inconsistent.  For example, I listen to long podcasts, and when fast-forwarding through commercials the player will sometimes revert to the start of the file.  This is quite frustrating, since it can take over a minute to get back to the right point in the file, and of course it can happen repeatedly.  Interestingly, it hasn't happened in the reverse direction.  I returned one player due to this problem, but the replacement isn't much better.  In summary, if you want top quality sound, there's no better player than this one (to be fair, other Cowons have similar features with less battery life).  To maximize quality you'll need to buy top of the line earphones...I use Ultimate Ears and they're fantastic.  I no longer carry around my bulky noise-cancelling headphones since they were bigger with inferior sound.  If you want to store FLAC files, buy the 16GB unit or else you'll be limited to a couple hundred songs.  Happy listening.

<Title>Great FLAC player
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this because I wanted a flash-based digital audio player that would play FLAC files natively.  (I have a 4G iPod with the Rockbox software installed, but Rockbox is frustratingly sluggish on my iPod and my iPod has occasional battery and disk issues anyway.)  My observations are generally in line with what others have reported.  It is smaller than I expected, and the screen is indeed tiny; it really looks like it's the size of a postage stamp, but fortunately it's clear and bright.  I don't think this would be as good as, say, the iPod Shuffle for those looking for something for workout sessions based on the screen size and sensitive controls.  The battery life is excellent; I haven't had to recharge mine even after several weeks of occasional use.  The controls are indeed extremely sensitive, and there is a learning curve to using them (I accidentally kept setting an A-B repeat in the middle of a song instead of browsing the menu as I intended to do).  If you are dissatisfied with the sound, there are several options to make it fit your taste (customizable equalizer settings, crossfade, MP3 enhancement, etc.).  The capacity is of course nowhere close to a hard-drive-based player, but that's the price you pay for lossless audio.  With a pair of ear canal headphones, this makes a very compact travel audio system.

<Title>firm-where?
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player (if that is what it can be called) rocks. The variety of codecs, esp. OGG, with tag support is great and the sound quality over other players through earphones that come with the player is even better.  I have looked at other mp3 players, flash memory, battery life and codec support were my selling points of the iAUDIO 7. Most mp3 players that contain flash memory also have an expanded battery life, but very few have the codec support.  My only problem with Cowon, not the iAudio, is the lack of firmware support. This is easily overcome by searching the internet for "iAUDIO 7 firmware". Many people have asked that question already and you are bound to stubble across someone nice enough to give a link and instructions on the firmware.

<Title>Once you get out of the iPod hype you really start to discover gems like this mp3 player
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all I want to state I am no Ipod/Apple fan boy or hater, I am just an engineer that is quite fond of music and tries to get the most out of his hard earned money.  What can I say about the iAudio 7, hmmm First of all for context, I've had (or someone in my family) an iPod Shuffle, and iPod Video 80Gb, a creative zen video 30Gb, a Sansa 8Gb,a sony Ericsson w800i (it's basically a mp3 player we all know that) and now a Cowon iAudio 7 so I can say I have been around always keeping an open mind, just looking for the best purchase money/features.  The iAudio 7 is a very small flash based device, albeit thick like a sony ericsson phone (believe me it is not bad at all, don't listen to nano owners, thin is not everything) it has quite a fast boot speed and as most flash based players (8gb) it has fast access between songs. I have been looking thoroughly for my next mp3 player since my iPod video died I took a while and went over most of the mp3 players on the market trying to outsmart the consumer advertising hype and looking for real facts.  I decided to give cowon a chance and after a few solid days this is my opinion Pros: Multiple format support, ogg, FLAC (I'm an open source guy this is a must for me) plus all the standard ones Supports podcasts, DRM music (Haven't actually tried this one out as I don't believe in DRMs I buy the music CD I want and rip the whole thing) Lite, compact and small yet fells sturdy (as sturdy as a small precision electronic device can be) Connectivity through mini USB Radio, customizable radio recording, voice customizable voice recording Video and photo support (Though it needs conversion for videos, that is a minor thing for me, videos looks great, and let's face it an mp3 player with a screen an inch or so shouldn't be bought to watch videos, you can though and they look great) Music playback supports lyrics Text reader User programmable buttons Awesome sound quality (Best amongst all PMP I've had) Decent, above average earphones provided Interface, needs time to master but is quite accurate and natural (This could go as a Negative feature, depending on the owner, controls are great IMO) Outstanding battery life (Might be wrong but I feel it outlasts iPod and creative 3-1 in battery life 2-1 at least) Great and extensive equalizer settings.   Cons: Device is a fingerprint magnet Few peripherals and add-ons available (iPod fans) Thick (Some might say this is a Con, if feel it has adequate dimensions, still depends on the owner, might go either way) Graphics, it reminds me of the 90's computer games or SNES games, other mp3/video devices have much nicer and impressive graphical interfaces) Jet Audio is it's "itunes" to put it in a certain way, as much as I like it and it gets the job done great, it is not as flashy as Itunes, just as solid IMO Videos are a bit uncomfortable to watch in such a screen.  As usual it depends on what you mainly intend to use the device for. For me it is mainly a flash based, multi-open-format support with good sound and battery life, because this little device handled my needs so well I can't think of any more flaws.  I just tried to be as straight forward with the facts as I could. If you look for a video player, look elsewhere, hope this review helps Cheers

<Content>first, this will run forever it seems. i usually listen to it all day at work, commuting, and at the gym. it only needs to be charged every week or so... pretty impressive.   i'm not an audiophile but sound quality was the most important requirement. i listen to a lot of technical death metal, and i don't want any slop getting in the way when i try to follow a particular instrument. experience with their A2 media player convinced me that cowon might live up to expectations. the iAudio 7 definitely sounds amazing when paired with some bose headphones. still playing around with it, but i really like the 5 band eq with adjustable band frequency and band width.   i do hate drm with a burning passion, so any media player i buy won't saddle me with ANY proprietary encoding or protections. the iAudio acts just like any usb key. wonderful! i only use the software to re-encode movies as all my music resides in a meticulously organized directory structure.  it has plenty of power to give a good signal when plugged into the car stereo, receiver at home, or some quiet comfort 2 headphones.  the swing touch takes a little getting used to. i found it to be over-sensitive out of the box but the sensitivity can be turned down. now i'm used to it and i have no complaints.   i did have it lock up on me once. i think it had to do with a combination of inputs being activated simultaneously. luckily there is a reset button which took care of the problem. no settings were changed after a hard reset, which is good.  the whole device is very configurable... from the music effects and eq, to timers (alarm and sleep), to display, play list behavior, 2 programmable "buttons" (a longer press activates the programmed function)... the list goes on.   it has a small screen, so pictures and movies are not it's strong suit. the screen is beautiful though, i was impressed.   8gb is plenty of space for me, especially because the musical phases i go through never involve that much music at once. if i were going on a long road trip, i'd bring the A2 along. it holds everything and i could transfer music from the A2 to the I7 if that 8gb was getting boring.  everything i needed was included in the box, which is very nice. the I7 charges off a usb connection (pretty quickly it seems). i didn't even bother plugging the included headphones in, so no comment their quality.  overall, very satisfied. in any specific area, also satisfied. this is a great product and i highly recommend it.

<Title>great sound, great battery life, poor interface
<Date>Tue Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use V-modas and Audio Technica ANC-Ath7 with this MP3 player.  I had to work out the software and organization of the files for a few hours, but after you get use to it, this is an awesome player.    Pros: 1)GREAT sound quality-one of the best, if not the best, sound quality mp3 player right now.  other cowons and irivers, and samsungs are also good in quality. 2)60 hours of battery life- awesome!  It really feels good not to have to charge it for two weeks. 3)great sound adjustment- with BBE technology...you can adjust the bass, surround sound, and other cool sound adjustments. 4) pretty cheap.  its around $200 for 8 gb, which is good compared to other mp3 players.    Cons: 1)The interface is not that great.  The ipod, which has one of the best interfaces, is far better. 2)Style is crappy...it doesnt look that great...it's like a brick, but i don't really mind b/c it makes up for it wit the pros and its small size. 3)It takes some time to figure out how this thing works.  I still can't make videos work, although i dont intend to watch videos on this, i just wanted to experiment.  The software that it comes with helps u convert file formats, which is pretty cool.

<Title>not perfect, but definitely close
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Since the early days of 256MB flash mp3 players, I've owned and used plenty of different types of mp3 players before (>20 different types) and I have to say that iAudio mp3 players have, by far, impressed me the most. I was looking for a small, versatile, flash-based mp3 player with superb audio quality and features such as FM radio, voice recording, and line-in recording. Though I don't use the latter two functions often, it is nice to know that the option is there if needed. I was deciding between getting an Apple iPod nano (the 2nd generation: short, stocky, and unbelievably thin with a large screen) or the Cowon iAudio 7. My co-worker has the iPod nano and let me check it out for a day. I flipped through songs, tested the features, and watched videos. It is an impressive unit. However, I had used two different iAudio mp3 players in the past (the iAudio U2 and the iAudio U3) and felt nothing but sheer satisfaction with them. I had found out that Cowon/iAudio had released a new 8GB flash-based mp3 player (a direct competitor with the 8GB flash-based 2nd generation iPod nano) and was automatically drawn to it as the company has released great products in the past.  I took a chance and purchased the iAudio 7. It arrived in the mail a few days later and I tested it out. First, I plugged it in using the included USB cable, and proceeded to fill up all 8GB of capacity with around 1,200 songs (256kbps). I started listening to a few tracks. Then I got disappointed. It took an agonizingly long time to load up, and then each time I switched to a new song, there was a 4 second delay pause. This started to get irritating, and I started to feel remorse towards my purchase. The next day, I looked online for any firmware updates. My firmware version at the time was 1.13, and I had found that a new firmware version 1.15 was available. I downloaded and updated the firmware to my iAudio 7. After it completed the update, I loaded all my songs again (a word of caution, all files will be erased from the iAudio 7 when you update the firmware) and checked it out again. WOW. It was much much MUCH faster. The response time to switch songs, even at random, was instantaneous. Load time to power up the little player was about 2 seconds. The firmware did it! Cowon has made me a true believer. I will never doubt this company's products again. The iAudio 7 is UNTOUCHABLE (no pun intended). Excellent audio quality (the signal-noise ratio is even better than the U3 (far surpassing the iPod), the battery life is amazing (it can last me a week without a recharge), it is loaded with useful features (FM radio, voice recording, line-in recording, FM radio recording, video, etc), and I really like the fact that you don't need proprietary software to upload files to it (whether it be music, video, or whatever). Want to know something else that's cool about this? You can change tempo. Yes, you can increase the speed at which an audio file plays, or slow it down. If you have it, try it. It's a very cool feature (though you probably wouldn't use it much, unless you're trying to analyze the audio).  So overall, my grade for the iAudio 7 is an A. A superb little player. The only shortcoming I see with this player is the touch-sensitive controls. I prefer tactile buttons/controls, and if you slip your fingers or fiddle around with it, you may accidentally go to another track or fast forward or start recording. I'm aware other users have voiced how this is a drawback for getting this player, but everything else more than makes up for it in my opinion.

<Title>Top Notch Sound Quality!
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've read some earlier reviews on this player.  Let me tell you, as a VERY limited high tech user, this is simple to use...all of its features and layout.  I NEVER read the instruction manual...not once.  After a few attempts by means of trial and error with regards to downloading music, it was rather simple.  The ability to adjust the infinitely (practically) adjustable equalizer is simple and untuitive (a result of my having never read the instruction manual on any of it!!!).  The sound quality, even with the relatively cheap earpieces, is AWESOME!!  Again, AWESOME!  And that's what it's all about, isn't it?  The best sounding, relatively simple-to-use player on the market, in my opinion.  The only thing I did was buy some Sony MDR-A35 headphones and it suddenly became the best "sports" player on the market.  My only complaint might be the touchy nature of the play and forward/reverse buttons (recessed) on the face or the player.  Even when adjusting these buttons so that they are not as "touchy", I find that I have, on numerous occasions, accidentally hit these while jogging, walking, etc.  And this is with the leather Cowan case I purchased which protects the unit.  Other than that, nice job Cowan!

<Title>Product OK but Cowan Stinks
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have never been able to register my MP3 at the Cowan website. Therefore, I can't get the warranty or any downloadable software updates. I followed their instructions at the website, but they never e-mailed me a password. (And, no, it didn't go to spam can.)There are no telephone numbers or addresses on the web page. Also, I agree with other reviewers that the touch controls are too sensitive even when set to the minimum sensitivity. Usage in a shirt pocket can be a problem if you are moving around much. But, it drives my Grado 325s with no problem. The audio performance is awesome. Its FM receiver was much stronger than I expected.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased this device for my teenage daughter. The first one I received didn't work. After spending a good hour on Live Chat, I was asked to send it back. Second one didn't work either, except for the FM radio. All in all a flimsy device without intuitive controls. Perhaps if you're an engineer, and can get it to work, you'll like it. But for the ordinary person seeking a bit of simplicity, it won't fit the bil

<Title>Pros - Great Sound, Features / Cons - Too Touch Sensitive
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just bought the Iaudio 7 8BG since I had experienced an Iaudio U2 1GB which was tiny with great sound quality. Overall the Iaudio 7 has most of the important features I need - great capacity;  great sound quality with MP enhance, equalizers, bass enhance etc; fm tuner; video capability; and of course - NOT AN IPOD, so no need for annoying proprietary software.   The only bad is that the Iaudio7 has gone for cool with the touch keys and they are way too sensitive to use while in your pocket. I find the songs frequently skipping and having trouble going to the next songs without looking at it and having it in my hands. The Iaudio U2 didn't have that problem.

<Title>Excellent product with some cons
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will not be covering what others have already written.  Rather, I will give my perspective from a guy who owns a few brands of players (Creative Vision W, Creative Zen, Ipod Classic, ipod nano) and has a week of use with this player.  The good: i) The best sounding player I ever had.  The EQ is very good but even with a flat EQ, they trump both the Ipods and Creatives. ii) Amazing battery life iii) Powerful amp - It drives my Sennheiser HD555 superbly. iv) Just-right form factor.  I like this size.  I find the ipod nano way too small to be comfortable.  The bad: i) User interface is iffy at best.  It is almost impossible to use the player on the run without the hold button on because the touch interface is super sensitive, even at the low setting.  That said, if you customize the hold setting to enable you to use the volume buttons as forward and back buttons when hold is set to on, the player works well (but you can't change volume on the run then...).  Conclusion: If you care about sound like I do, get this player.  If you care more about user interface, get a creative.  I can't recommend ipods for anymore as I find them too expensive, I hate itunes, and I hate DRM music.
