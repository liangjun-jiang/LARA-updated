<Product Name>Coby MP-C893 MP3 Player with 2 GB Flash Memory & USB Drive
<Title>Good Basic MP3

<Content>This is a good basic MP3 player.  Don't expect more than it can deliver.  If all you want is to store music or podcasts and play them back (no screen to see titles), then this is a good product for you.  It satisfies all my needs as I primarily use it to listen to podcasts, so I don't have a lot of titles on the player.  
<Overall>4

<Title>MP3 player cuts out fairly often

<Content>I'm returning this item.  If the mp3 player gets bumped slightly, it shuts off... this is fairly bad news if you plan to jog with it.
