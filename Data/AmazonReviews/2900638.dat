<Title>Good player
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> Bad News 1. Only 4 Gigs 2. iRiver Plus 3 is a huge pain to put video onto player 3. Screen feels really sensitive 4. Feels like it will slip out of hand 5. Sometimes clicking noise can be annoying 6. Can't listen to music while charging 7. Learning curve for user interface can take a while  Good news ( and plenty of it) 1. Beautiful and huge screen 2. 4 GB is a lot when you don't have a lot of songs. 3. Very small and pocketable/ portable 4. Great battery life 5. Tons of setting options  6. If you look online ( www.clixhere.net), you can find hundreds of themes and tons of flash games to put on your Clix for free. 7. Flash games 8. Videos at good resolution 9. Good sound quality 10. Totally customizable themes (background/font/interface) 11. Pictures look totally gorgeous 12. Comes with free songs/ videos/ flash games/ pictures/ audio books/ preloaded 13. Ever expanding community of active Clix members who love to create free stuff (www. misticaudio.com, www.clixhere.net).  To Protect the Clix, I would suggest a silicon case (mines from misticaudio) and a screen protector. To wipe of fingerprints (of which you will get a lot) a moist tissue (NOT WET) will do. I realize a main competitior of the Clix 2 is the touch screen Cowon- i never tried it, but I don't like the idea of a touch screen- thats just me.

<Title>What other reviews leave out
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just received my iRiver clix2 and I thought I should list some important information that other reviews I read, neglected to mention.  First off, I am having a very pleasant experience with the clix2 and if there was a little more direction and support from the documentation or website, I would have been completely happy.   Important list of things to know:  The difference between MTP and MSC- If you do not set your Clix2 to the MSC mode the computer and the coupled software will not recognize the device. By default it is off. You can do this in the 'advanced' menu but make sure you do this before adding any music, you will lose it all in the necessary format. MSC mode is better anyways so do this first.   Wheres the shuffle?- I have only played around with it for a little while, but the only way I could figure out a shuffle mode (my favorite setting on an mp3) was by setting the smart key to "shuffle all"  Looseness of the cover- Yeah apparently it is supposed to be that way, the cover is actually D-navigation buttons, so don't fret about the seeming looseness during the 3-4 hour initial battery charge  Guide recommends that you turn on player then charge- Mine was so dead when I got it, that it would not turn on so this step wasn't possible. In that case just skip step 1 and plug it in, it will auto charge.   Battery- I was scared about the battery so I turned brightness to "low" which is still pretty bright, and went to "timer" to have the back light turn off in 5 seconds to save power.    Yeah there is a guide on the cd but its not very helpful unless you read the whole thing, including all the small print.   Volume buttons are seemingly switched up.   Wheres the podcast directory?- It may be there, I didn't look too hard  Look for the 'auto power-off' and sleep settings-set to your preference ----- Now the easily recognizable positives, based on a day of use.   The interface and menu is very easy to navigate- just click the sides of the device.  The sound- Amazing.   Video- Looks good, though the screen is really small for video watching, plus it drains the battery a lot faster. Beautiful screen and transitional effects with several themes to choose from. All the themes and fonts can be added from an online source (or you can make them)  I don't want this to run too long so I'll end with this.  Barring any unforeseen failures or future problems, this thing is great. It is well worth the 184-200$ it costs at this time though if it had been easier to set up (the info above) I would have had a much better initial reaction. I'll update this review after a while using it.

<Title>THE iPod killer
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>wow. Think of anything you'd want an mp3 to have, and the clix 2 already has it. FM radio, flash games, nice wallpapers/themes, audiobook, voice recorder, supports all languages, pictures, music, and videos. And not only that, some sites can give you customized flash games, wallpapers, themes, and fonts. Also, not wanting to give out all the surprises, some VIP members in rare mp3 sites can get updates for the clix 2 and realllllllly nice games and customizable wallpapers... what more do you want?

<Title>Iriver Clix2 Clix 4gb (U20)...
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought for someone near and dear who's into portable electronics.  She seems to love it - but she 'accidentally' hit the delete key and lost all her music.  Fortunately, she reloaded the music in 10 minutes, the Clix2 seems to be a little 'sensitive' in it's functionality.    I ordered it early in the a.m. on 07/28/07, and received it via UPS on the 07/31/07, beating the delivery estimate by 5 days (thanks Amazon and UPS!).  For the joy it seems to bring - I give it five stars...

<Title>Excellent Screen and Sound
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very impressed with this player. The styling is simple and elegant -- there are no words on the front, not even the silly "menu" word. The screen is fantastic. Sound is great (on Sennheiser headphones -- I have not tried the supplied phones). Vocals are very clear. In classical music I can hear the individual instruments - this level of detail usually requires a good hifi setup. The menu navigation is very simple and easy. On the first day with the Clix I took it running. It passed the test: I could change volume and song track just by reaching into my pocket without looking (but always use the hold button at the bottom if you are running).

<Title>Great MP3 Player!
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had experiences with Apple iPod Video, Shuffle, and Nano, and my previous Toshiba Gigabeat S30 (which is an absolute iPod killer). The clix2 is overall a SOLID MP3 player and this is my experience thus far:  The sounds quality is great; it contains a vast array of different EQ settings suited for your sound system/headphones.   The menu system is very easy to use with the innovative D-click system. The screen is, as other people have stated, very bright and attractive.   The extra features are fantastic- alarm clock, the fun flash games, text reader, the built-in mic recorder (good for class), the FM tuner, and above all, the ability to completely customize your little clix2. You can change the themes, fonts, the way you browse yours music, and also there is a "Smart Key" on the side of the player where you can program it to do a number of things that best suits you. There are fan based sites that contain slick themes in addition to the nice stock ones.   The ability to synchronize with WMP11 as well good ol' drag and drop is a very convenient feature. It is compatible with my URGE subscription, which happens to be a very good music store (just putting that out there).    Some drawbacks I will point out. (some are reiterated from other people): 4 GB is too small for me, seeing as how my music library is around 13 GB. If you do not like updating your playlists constantly, as I am doing now, then perhaps the Clix2 is not a great idea. But my motivation for buying it regardless of this was that it was a way to make sure my music is fresh (which has been working so far).   The clix2 is smaller than I imagined. This is a small con because it means a lesser experience when watching videos, but it does keep the navigation quick because the D-click system utilizes the entire face place to navigate through menus.    Overall, this MP3 player is very solid. I am only giving it a 4 because of its small storage space. But if this is not an issue for you, then I give my highest recommendations for the Clix 2. This player is an example of one of the great quality products you can find outside the "iPod craze." It will definitely make you stand out when you bust this slick player out.       BTW, one of the reviews mentioned not being able to shuffle songs- this is not true, you just need to read the manual. It's clearly written.

<Title>iriver clix2 - very nice alternative to ipod
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iriver clix2 is a very nicely designed multi-media device. I am not a fan of apple and decided not to get an ipod. The clix2 plays mp3's and movies, and displays pictures. The screen is very clear and bright. The sample movie clips alone will blow you away. The sound is equally good. The usb interface offers two modes: drag and drop or software sync.  The ear phones were a little disappointing. I replaced them with some quality ear buds. Make sure the battery is fully charged before a long trip.

<Title>iriver clix 2nd generation. Absolutely AMAZING!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the iriver Clix 2nd generation is an absolutely amazing device that offers you all the features you would ever need and the most beautiful screen in it's class.  Pros-  -2.2 inch AMOLED screen produces colors clear and crisp. one of the best screens of it's size. 320x240 resolution at 30fps. -Fantastic audio quality (much better than the iPod) -Intuitive D-clix system. Each side of the surface is a button. it is in essence a D-pad with a screen in the middle. -Great battery life (25 hours of music, 5 hours video). -Flashed based memory is solid state (no moving parts) so it will not break as easily as a hard drive based player. -MSC and MTP transfer mode, which makes it compatible with any modern OS like Windows, Mac, and Linux. -Amazingly smooth user interface -Video, Photo, Radio, Voice recording, Flash Games, and many other features. -Easy syncing to any computer -Small and reliable -Dedicated volume buttons  Cons  -Not as solid build as it should be, but still reliable and very useable -Strange location of headphone jack -4 gigs is the standard capacity, and an 8 gig player is hard to find. This is not very much memory, especially if you want to utilize the pretty screen with videos.  -Volume and power buttons feel cheap and are set into the groove between the surface and the rest of the player, making them somewhat uncomfortable to use. At least this keeps them from being accidentally pressed in your pocket. -A little expensive at retail price.  So if you are looking for a beautiful flash memory based media player with lots of features, an intuitive control scheme and user interface, with amazing audio and video quality, and don't mind a slightly expensive price tag, this will not disappoint.

<Title>Holy Crap is Iriver's Service Awful - BEWARE
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved the player when I bought it May.  Two weeks later it failed to power on and Iriver gave me an RMA immediately.  They have confirmed that I will be receiving a new clix2, but there service center is backed up.  Eight Weeks later they still haven't sent me a new one and can't tell me when I will receive one.  I thought the player was pretty cool in May, but the new Nano matches most of the features and you will feel much more comfortable with a warranty from an established US entity.  Buy a Nano!  ps the Flash menus are pretty cool (especially when you can make your own)

<Title>Awesome product...under rated in the U.S. !!! Great Anti-IPOD
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this for about 3 months and I absolutely love it.  The battery last for about 20+ hours. Depending on what you are using, if it is the video, of course it would be shorter.  I got this after it won a lot of different tech awards, and they were right.  It is a great, and realiable product. The video is clear, music can be equalized to fit what your ear likes to hear, and has almost unlimited amounts of functions!!!  It even has a radio (which IPOD's don't have), and amazing radio and external recorder built in. Lets just say that everyone who I have shown it to, DOES WANT ONE,  PERIOD!!!

<Title>mom of 3
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Within 4 months of use, the screen went blank.(the screen going out is a common problem)  Sent it in to be repaired.  It took 3 months to get it back.  When we got it back it was DEAD!  I have called customer service so many times but they never return any calls.  They have been useless.  I would not buy this product because any problems will only cost you more $$$$$$ to replace the unit.
