<Content>I am not pleased with this product.  The manual says it is supposed to load MP3, WMP, etc. formats -  BUT IT DOESN'T! It only does MP3.    I called the 800 number Tech Support line and was told by a recording that they were busy and someone would return my call within 48 hours -  NEVER HAPPENED!  I  DO NOT recommend this product!

<Title>Fine for podcasts
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this mp3 player as a Christmas gift.  I've mainly used it for playing podcasts to listen to over portable speakers while I drive.  It's worked fine for me - I think that as long as you have the right cables and software for downloads there shouldn't be a problem.  Is the Ipod better?  Of course, but you most likely won't find one for this price.  I think this is fine for limited or beginner use.
