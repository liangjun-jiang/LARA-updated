<Content>If you don't mind the size, this is the greatest portable media player out there.... And you can't really make it any smaller if you want to still take advantage of the 3.5 inch screen and 30 Gb....  And I've never heard a better sound than the one coming from my Toshiba....

<Content>I found the Gigabeat very easy to handle and use. Loading pictures was quick and easy. The best feature is playing the slide show, with music, on a big screen TV. Highly recomended.

<Title>There's a reason its discontinued!
<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit is absolute garbage.  Forget the moronic design, lack of features, etc. The actual construction is terrible.  The allegations as to battery life are utter fabrications, the buttons don't always work, but, get this, IT SPONTANEOUSLY ERASED ABOUT 20 GIGS OF MUSIC.  Pretty sure Toshiba got wise and took this junk off the streets.  Anything you buy has been sitting in a warehouse somewhere since 2003.  Spend the extra cash and get a reputable unit. Toshiba does not know how to make media players.

<Title>Beware of the movies

<Content>This is a wonderful product, beware of the movies feature. It was somewhat involved to get them on there. It also doesn't charge when connected to the USB port. Other than that, it works great!

<Title>great mp3 player
<Date>Fri Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is easy to use, has great sound, and a much larger video screen than the ipod video.  The only downside is that are no protective cases to be found for this model.  I'm using a PDA case, and it seems to work out OK.

<Title>A solid product when used correctly
<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Toshiba MEV30K last week after searching for something powerful and cheap, and it's pretty much everything I had hoped for. (BTW, I got it for $144 from BeachCamera through Amazon, and I noticed they've since raised the price, so you're probably getting gypped if it's still $170-something.) Sure, there's a few mistakes in design, but overall, it's not half bad.  Let's get one fact down: when treated as an independent entity, the Gigabeat V is an absolute dream. Intuitive controls, INCREDIBLE sound quality (the external speaker is kinda quiet, but I guess that's better than loud and distorted), good resolution (granted, not perfect, but not as bad as some of the other reviews make it out to be either), and lots of features. But it kind of falls short any time it has to communicate with anything else. For example, it can't be charged over USB, nor can be charged through a power cord while it's connected via USB (i.e. two hours of synchronization complete, we're halfway there! Oops, "Gigabeat has a low battery and will turn off soon" -- looks like we gotta unplug it and go charge!) Second of all, the synchronization is problematic with WMP. But there's hope! Luckily, whoever wrote the product description that said it can only sync with Windows MP was smoking reefer at the time. You CAN use some third-party programs to sync the gigabeat. I recommend MediaMonkey, since it's free and usually error-free; Winamp works also. (Let's face it -- WMP is the devil! I tried to sync with it one time, let it run for three hours and when I turned on the gigabeat, it had synchronized NONE of the songs I told it to and EVERY OTHER MEDIA OBJECT ON MY COMPUTER. What the --? When I finally got that sorted out, it was still pretty lame, considering it's nearly impossible to get it to recognize changes in ID3 Tags as a valid reason to update the sync files without having to do a LOT of waiting.) Trust me, don't use WMP, you'll regret it.  The physical shape of the MEV30K is a little awkward, but not that bad. It still turns some heads, in a good way. It's lopsided, but still rests at a close-to-upright position. And its size is a little annoying. Not as versatile as some of the smaller ones, but what do you expect with you're getting an awesome wide-screen display?  The product is advertised as having 30 hours of continuous audio playback battery life. Ok. This morning, I woke up with it fully charged and by the end of the day, it was already telling me I had to charge it again. I had watched no videos on it during that time. Maybe there's a drastic difference in regular/continuous playback, or maybe I still haven't worn the battery in yet, who knows? But it's not that bad. Just remember to plug it in every night before you go to bed and you'll be fine.  Here's a fun factoid: Toshiba gives almost no support for this product. Firmware upgrades? Nah. Cool accessories? Nope. A decent form of protection so you can actually carry it around without having to worry about damaging the giant screen?...NuUh......  Now for some miscellaneous facts. When connected to the computer, the Gigabeat uses a media protocol that treats it differently than some other devices; you've probably run into it before, but just in case...there's no drive letter, so you'll have to be creative in manipulating it. You CAN use it as a portable hard drive, although the ramshackle filing system it uses leaves much to be desired. For example, if you try to put a windows briefcase file on it, it will convert it into a regular file folder. Then convert back when you drag it back out. Let's see, what else?? There's a lot of settings you can fiddle with. Brightness, scrolling speed, system sounds, the usual lineup. Lots of language options. I can't vouch for the video playback since that's not really my thing. The few I have tried look just fine. But it's the sound quality that counts, and I've heard sounds with the gigabeat I'd never heard before, even in my favorite songs. The gigabeat really brings out some things you've never noticed. One thing that's annoying is that the screen stays illuminated in order to display the battery indicator while it's charging, even when the unit is turned off. So the corner of your room will be glowing late at night when it's hooked up. Just throw a towel over it.  Overall: 5/5. Perfect? No. Still deserving of a 5 though. It certainly exceeded my expectations, and it's not nearly as bad as some of the more critical web sites make it out to be. Bottom line, if you can find a good price for it, don't let this great product pass you by...

<Content>More space then IPOD for less cost.  Easy navigation.  Nothing very fancy.  A lot bigger than an IPOD though, so if you are looking for size you might want to reconsider.  Also does not come with a carrying case, will have to buy one or make one.  Overall, great product!
