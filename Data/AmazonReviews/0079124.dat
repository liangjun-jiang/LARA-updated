<Title>A fantastic Player - 1 year ago
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I purchased my zen over a year ago I thought it was the greatest thing out there. It had so much potential and the abilities is had were up there with the best.... and then Creative pretty much abandoned the product. There hasn't been a firmware upgrade in over a year, all the accessories that were supposed to come out never did. (No Docking station, no case, etc.) The problems with the interface that were promised to be fixed weren't and the product has just slowly become obsolete.  I would look at some of the other players out there before purchasing this player and at least look to a product that is being supported and not just being sold.

<Title>THE BEST MULTIMEDIA PLAYER SO FAR!
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this product for a year now and I have to say I am extremely satisfied.  It performed all the features flawlessly and then some.  I even dropped this player couple of time but had no malfunction or problem.  This is even better than iPod when it comes to ease of use and features.  I'm glad I chose this instead of iCrap.  The best feature about this product is when I get tired of looking at small screen I could hook it up to TV & watch how cool is that.  Hopefully creative will come up with thinner version of this in future.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHBZHC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6838194-5494265">Creative Zen Vision W 60 GB Widescreen Multimedia Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Will never own an Apple product again, EVER!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Until you try a player like the Zen Vision W, you don't really realize how much of a garbage product the Ipod is. OMG! The only thing that the iPod has going for it is design and size, that's it!  About the Zen - I discovered on my own that you don't need Windows Media Player, Winamp or the included software to sort out your music. You open it as a hard drive, all your folders are listed in there, just drop your MP3s in there and start listening. There's no renaming like in the Ipod, no moving, scrambling, no third party software, nothing. It is a portable hard drive, so you use it as one. No, I tunes, no account set up, no restrictions on how many computers you can hook up your device to, full freedom to use it as you please. You take out and you ad music when you want and share it with whoever you want. As simple as it gets. Video? Awesome. Had some movies on my hard drive sitting around, just opened the movie folder in the Vision W and pasted them in there, all play perfect. Didn't have to resize, compress, nothing. Everything about this player is well though out. You can tell that they put some effort into it to make it easy to use. The battery? Detachable! When it wears out, you take it out and put a new one in. No need to send it in to Apple to have them open your device to change it for you and charge you an arm and a leg for it. Another thing about the battery is that it lasts. I charged it last night, started using it this morning at 7:30Am It is 2 pm right now and the battery is full!!! If this was an Ipod, it'd be at 50% if that. It has a speaker so you don't HAVE to have earphones to listen to it, it has radio as well. You have a Digital SLR camera with a CF card? Use it to back up your pictures with the CF slot built into the Vision W. What more can I say. It is large compared to the iPod, yes but so is the screen. I just can't believe I ever purchased an iPod when there are devices available out there that make so much more sense. Never an Apple product AGAIN!

<Content>I have owned this for approximately six weeks now and after some initial hiccups with software used for DVD movies this device has worked like a charm.  Screen size is great and as I travel every week I receive constant stares as people walk up and down the aisle of the airplane! It is like an IPOD on Steroids!!!

<Title>Where is the Software for Download
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are plenty of the DVD transfer softwares for iPod and PSP, but no way to Vision W. As like a good Digita SLR Camera without a flash memory.

<Title>We Love Them!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband and I bought each other these for Christmas...They are great!  Lots of storage (I've got ALL of our digital pics on mine), plus we've moved various tv shows we've recorded to them to have them portable for viewing (either in bed, in the car, etc.).  The jack it comes with knows if it's connecting to a tv (and therefore sends video) or a stereo (and therefore just sends audio), and the sound through real speakers is awesome.  (The sound through the built in speaker leaves something to be desired, but even computer speakers work well.)  Friends of ours have already said that when the next version comes out, they are sure we will get new ones and our boys will get these...  Louise

<Title>Best PVP on the market!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So easy to use, big beautiful screen, great battery life for such a large device, plays every music, video, and picture format I throw at it, compactflash reader, excellent audio quality, highly recommend.  If looking for something smaller, not very small, quite large, but still pocketable.

<Title>Beats IPOD Hands Down!
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own an IPOD and it is a good unit once you get by the ACC file conversions. However, if you are looking for great video and music with a picture that you don't have to magnify to watch then the Zen is for you. It will do just about any thing you want to. The size of the unit is a little big but then I am not running with the unit. It has a removable battery which is great too. If you have a really good ear I would recommend a BOSE headset instead of the ear buds.

<Title>Excellent fix for the media addict
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, why don't places like Best Buy and Circuit City sell more goodies like this?.. This product is superb... excellent compatability as media player, or as removable hard drive, and the OS is set up quite nicely. Great battery life, and I truly was impressed with the clarity of the screen when watching higher-resolution videos.   The size may deter some folks away, but this thing fits in my inner jacket pocket, so there shouldn't be any troubles keeping comfortably at-hand while flying, etc.   One last thing that impressed me is Creative's extra effort to increase compatibility... When you upload a non-compatible video to your ipod, you are out of luck. Buy the software for conversions, and you might get lucky. With Creative, however, any incompatible format will be converted automatically when you try to upload it to the Zen W.   I have a total of 7 mp3 players and/or media players, and I couldn't have asked for anything more in my newest toy, the Creative Zen W. Thanks for such an excellent product!

<Title>The almost perfect entertainment device
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Vision W fulfills every need for a portable entertainment device.  If battery life was just a little longer it would be perfect. I know others might criticize the size and weight,but how else are you going to have decent sized wide screen?  The device has to be at least as big as the screen.  If you want small then buy a smaller device.  Beautiful!
