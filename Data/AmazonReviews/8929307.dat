<Title>At least it looks nice
<Date>Tue Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my 605 for about a week now and I'm seriously considering returning it.  As said in other reviews, it has a wonderful screen and lots of space but that's about it as far as positives go.      The first thing that really bothered me was that the battery life is nowhere close to what Archos advertises.  17 hours for music playback? The most I've managed to get before it dies is 7. Not even half. As far as Video goes, you'll be lucky to get 2 hours on a complete charge.    The audio quality is what Really makes me want to return it. Not only is it quiet, but the EQ is not a true EQ. It actually attenuates one frequency when another is turned up, so it doesn't really boost the frequency you want, it just appears to be boosted by lowering other frequencies.  The sound quality is a Big step back from even my old Archos Jukebox Recorder V2 and it gives me headaches after a while, which is something that has never happened to me while listening to music before.  Pros- Excellent screen, lots of space, easy file transfer  Cons- Sub-par to Bad sound quality, Horrible battery life

<Title>Very good PMP
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 Wi-Fi is a great PMP. You almost don't have to worry about video or audio formats, it will play pretty much anything (mainstream, that is). All you have to do is copy it to the specified folder in the internal HD and that's it. No boring conversions. It works pretty well with Windows Media Player and will sync without a glitch.  The user interface is good and the touch-screen works flawlessly. I was even amazed by how easy it was to type in the touch-screen based keyboard - to the point that I wish it had some sort of text editor in it, so I could take notes.  It is not perfect, though. The battery is just ok - it will play around 4:30 hours of video in good days. If you need an extra juice, you have to buy an external battery, that looks somewhat bulky.  I don't like that it does not have an expansion port for memory cards nor a video-out connection (it comes with the optional DVR Station, which is a must have). And while I also don't like that the web-browser and other video formats are optional, I understand that it is a reasonable way to cut costs, since it is not everyone that need them.  The thing I miss the most is a way to search for music. With 80GB of songs, it is at least boring to go through folders. Since the keyboard works so well, there should be a search function. It is so obvious that maybe there is one and I couldn't find it...

<Title>It's not perfect, but I'm happy with it
<Date>Fri Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to replace a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CS7U1C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6560660-1602060">Creative Zen Vision:M 30 GB MP3 and Video Player (Black)</a> that had been stolen. I really liked my Zen, but I wanted to see what new stuff had come out in the time since I bought it. This led me to getting the Archos 605 80GB instead, mainly because of the optional TV hookups. I've never liked to watch movies or TV shows (or even music videos) on my PC monitor because I can't relax and enjoy something passive while I'm at my computer. I'd also never used the Zen's video capabilities much because the screen was too small. The Archos 605, on the other hand, could be hooked up to a TV (with the DVR station or other accessories--I bought the DVR station), which would allow me to watch downloaded TV shows and movies in comfort--and even better, with other people (it's difficult to crowd around a computer desk to watch a movie), plus I'd be able to watch stuff on the go with its larger screen.  The wifi access, web browser plug-in and PDF reader also helped sell me on the Archos 605. I particularly looked forward to being able to read ebooks in PDF format.  So when I ordered the Archos 605, I was thinking of it as an MP3 "with benefits."  When the Archos 605 arrived, I found out that its screen was totally large enough to watch video comfortably. Shortly after I got it, I watched two and a half seasons of Weeds on it. It's fantastic! I can carry a TV show into the kitchen to grab a snack, etc. When I'm home alone, I'm even able to rely on the built-in speaker--for TV shows, I don't need fantastic sound quality; I just need to be able to hear what they're saying. It's very cool; I'm very addicted. :)  Like I said, I bought the DVR station with it. I had wondered how a video file from the Archos would hold up enlarged on a TV screen, but no worries--the picture quality is good (we have a 32" set). I've recorded some stuff from our TiVo onto the Archos, and the picture quality is good in that direction, too. Since we do have a TiVo, I haven't used the Archos as a DVR (with the downloaded TV listings and scheduled recordings), so I can't say how easy that is to use, but it's definitely easy to manually record something, and I was happy to see that I could tell it how long to record for.  As an MP3 player, it's not as good as the Zen, simply because it's not, primarily, an MP3.   One way the Zen (and probably most other MP3 players) is a better MP3 player than the Archos is that if you power the Archos 605 off while you're playing music, it doesn't automatically start up where you left off when you turn it back on. Instead you boot up to the main screen, and then you have to tap the "resume" icon; otherwise nothing happens. In this way it's less "plug and go" than my Zen was; sometimes if I'm only going to be driving for a few minutes (like a hop from the grocery store to the gas station), I won't bother starting it up at all. Also, the way you lock the controls takes a few seconds longer than the Zen did. With the Zen, you just slid the switch to the lock position. With the Archos, you hold down the TV button until the lock icon appears on the screen.  If you're playing from a playlist when you turn the unit off, and then you hit "resume" after you turn it back on, it doesn't seem to resume the playlist--it does indeed play the song you were on, but it's playing it from the album instead of the playlist, so the next song after that is the next song on the album, not the next song on the playlist. Possibly this is glitch that will be fixed in a firmware update (or perhaps has been--I haven't updated my firmware in a couple weeks).  Finally, changing the play mode (normal, shuffle, repeat one, repeat all), takes a lot more navigating around than it did on the Zen. It really shouldn't take that many clicks.  Sound-wise, the Archos is good as the Zen was, and its drawbacks as an MP3 player aren't so onerous that I'd consider buying a separate MP3 player. The Archos does well enough.  The PDF reader, however, turned out to be a disappointment. First, it takes several (loooong) seconds to go to the next page. Second, there's no way to bookmark where you are so that you can pick up where you left off. I figured I could just remember what page I was on and use the Go To Page feature to get back to it, but  the Go To Page feature uses a slider, which is nowhere near as quick as if they'd let me type in a page number, and it takes a long freaking time for it to then load that page. Ugh. So this thing definitely hasn't replaced my Palm Tungsten for e-reading.  I haven't used the web browser or wireless much. It seemed pretty slow the times I have, and there's no "tap feedback" in the Content Portal, so when you tap on a link, you often don't know whether the tap has registered or not because the screen stays the same while the Archos (slooooowly) downloads the data for the next screen. That's frustrating. The web wasn't as frustrating as the Content Portal; I just haven't had much of a need to use it.  Another downside is that there aren't any cases for it that will protect the unit while allowing you direct, immediate access to it, the way the skin I had for my Zen did. Instead it comes with a padded, envelope-like case that you have to slip the unit completely out of if you want to use it. (To be fair, it's much better than the cloth pouch that came with the Zen.) Leather case options are limited, and all the ones I've seen require you to open the case in order to view the screen or access the navigation. The one from Archos won't even let you turn it off with the case closed, which isn't very handy if you're listening to audio and want to shut it off quickly.   I don't know how many hours I'm getting out of my battery. I did listen to music for 10 hours on a recent road trip without it giving out on me, but I didn't keep going to see how much more I could get out of it. I've also watched a couple hours of video without it running out of juice--and again, I ended up dropping it in the DVR station (which charges it) before it did run out, so all I can say about the battery is that it's  lasting long enough for my needs.   Despite the caveats I've listed above, I LOVE my Archos 605. I love being able to take TV shows and movies with me everywhere. I love that I can finally  watch bootleg concerts and other stuff I've downloaded on the "big screen." It's easy to use. The DVR station is easy to use. The two work together seamlessly. The Archos holds a ton off stuff. It plays my music. It lets me browse the web if I need to.   I'm happy with it, definitely. And I'm keeping my fingers crossed that future firmware updates will make me even happier with it.

<Date>Fri Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Archos 605 80 GB for about a month now, and have been very happy with it.  I was upgrading from the Archos Jukebox 20 Recorder (which has served me well for about 5 years now) and that's why I wanted to stay with Archos. The few times that I have used an IPOD I really have not liked it.  The main reason for upgrading was to get more hard drive space. The Jukebox only had 20 GB, which filled up pretty quickly. I didn't think I needed 160 GB, but 80 GB seemed reasonable.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting to use this for video playing, but, as a nice surprise, the screen is very watchable, and makes for easy watching if you are on a plane or somewhere like that.  Upgrade the firmware (to 1.3.52 or later) as soon as you get the unit - with the installed firmware I had an issue where after a while of playback, the sound would start crackling. 1.3.52 fixed that.  Pros:  - 80 GB of space, and not too bulky or heavy - no need for itunes or special software, just plug it in via USB and it appears like an external hard drive - can record inbound audio/video (but requires DVR station - which is a must buy, by the way) - can also also browse via directories on the hard drive itself (my preference), or via artist/album/title/etc - playlists are reasonably easy to create on the unit itself (though not so easy to do on a computer and then transfer the created playlist to the archos, that doesn't seem to work) - has a 'lock' feature so that it can be carried around in a pocket - the DVR player can be plugged in anywhere in the world (100 - 240 V) - touch screen - charge via USB  Cons:  - no voice recording feature like the Jukebox 20 had (used to use the Jukebox 20 as a dictaphone). though this might be possible using the DVR recorder and a microphone, which I have not tried - battery life - as noted here, the battery life doesn't seem to be quite what is advertised, music about 10 hours, video about 4 (though this is with the occasional suspend and resume). The battery dock seems to be a necessary purchase (have not purchased yet) - why is the earphone jack on the opposite side of the player from the control buttons? If I am carrying this thing in my jacket pocket, I need to take it out of my pocket and out of the carrying case to change tracks, volume, etc - not quite sure why there is an external speaker on the unit? seems unnecessary - since it has a touch screen I really don't use the buttons very often - not really a con, but I liked the fact that the Jukebox 20 had removable AA batteries, the archos 605 is an internal battery that cannot be removed  Wish list:  - would be nice if this unit had those headphones where it has some of the controls in the headphone cable itself (like some portable CD players have the headphones where in the cable there is a control for volume, change tracks, etc) so wouldn't have to take the thing out of my pocket to do this  Have not tried yet:  - WiFi web browsing - video recording  Highly recommended unit!

<Title>Great potential... a little 'buggie'
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This has everything we wanted.  We can get rid of all those ugly CD cases cluttering up the living room, show our summer pictures on TV;  record TV shows we want to watch and even surf the net without having to go downstairs to get the laptop.  Sounds great... if it would all work... It's a new product so expect to call the help line.. Though most things download from Windows media player without a hitch, the playlists don't come through nor do the album covers. I hope they are working on that.  I have called the help line 4 times and recieved 4 different solutions; none have works so far. And for a while I was not able to download the  Opera web browser.  I understand the Channel guide, needed to record TV shows is still having problems but as of this writing I haven't tried to use it yet.  That is the down side.  Upside - a great little device with a good screen and terrific potential.  If you want a total smooth installation wait a few months.  But if your willing to put up with a little fussing this is a wonderful device!  Either way I would certainly buy it again.

<Title>Ipod touch has nothing on this.
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Archos 605 about 2 days after it was released and couldn't be happier.  I'll admit, I had never heard of Archos products before until I started to do a little bit of research on PVP's.  Most of my friends have the various forms of Ipods that exist and my little sister has a Zune, both are okay but have very small screens and less than stellar resolution.  The Archos 605 provides a much larger size screen (4.3") with great resolution (800x480) for such a relatively small product (I will however admit, the 605 80G is a little bulkier than the other two products previously mentioned). Being WiFi accessible makes it a sweet investment too, I've taken it on several trips and have been able to sign into any open wifi connection for high speed access, something that the Ipod/Iphone and Zune can not do with their limited technology.  I didn't even mind paying the extra cost for the add-ons (Opera Browser and Video player).  Everytime I have my Archos in hand people ask me what it is, I think the screen and the wifi accessible perks people's interest, it sure suckered me in....I'm definately hooked.

<Title>GOOD PRODUCT
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a real good PVP player except for the battery life.  The video quality is great and the Wifi features makes it all worth it for the price.  The only bad thing is that you have to pay extra for plug-ins that should have already been included.  Also, battery life is not very good. Watching 1 movie might be enough to drain your battery life completely.  (DVR STATION IS A MUST HAVE - to access the product,s full capability)

<Title>Definitely satisfies the gadget freak in me
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 is a good device.  Not perfect, but what is?  Comparing it to it's obvious competitor, the iTouch, it is nowhere near as slick.  No 2 finger zoom, no automatic switching between vertical and horizontal orientation (unnecessary with the large screen of the Archos), not even in the same league in terms of user interface.  The Apple wins hands down...  ...but where the Archos blows away the Apple is in features and functionality, 2 things near and dear to my heart.    Multiple audio formats, multiple video formats, a real browser (additional $30 purchase, an absolute must) that you can actually see and read either in full screen or zoomed.  Zooming is just a double click of the touch screen away which is fine with me.  Browser displays flash too (iTouch doesn't).  Favorites are easy to set and get to, a keyboard automatically pops up when you click into a text field.  Unfortunately you can't listen to music and browse at the same time and I find that quite odd.  Who knows, Archos may (please, please, please) fix that in a later firmware version.  If not then they should have put in a better processor/ram to overcome this obvious deficiency.  You can view photos and listen to music though.  I love that I can just plug my Archos in via USB and copy files over to it using Windows Explorer.  I could also use Windows Media player, but one of my computers is running Windows 2000 and so has an old version of Media player that I don't think syncs devices.  Haven't tried and don't care.  I prefer the former method, but thank you Archos for the CHOICE.  I use the buttons sometimes, though I don't think you can do everything via the buttons only.  Again, haven't tried, thanks for the choice.  I use the stylus for most operations.  I hope I don't lose it because there's no place to store it in the unit.  I guess that's why they gave me 2.  You can also stream video, images and music from a wi-fi connected computer.  Useful if you have one of the smaller GB players, but with the 80gb probably not necessary.  If you leave all your media on your base computer, it won't be available when you leave your house.  Did I mention 80GB (or 30 or 160!)?  Exactly 5x (or 2x or 10x) larger than the iTouch which would hold less than half my music collection.  I need access to it all because I use it as my digital music receiver at home.  I looked for a long time and couldn't find a better device.  I have all my CDs ripped to mp3 format and the CDs are in a box in the basement for backup.  With the DVR device which is available as an optional accessory (again a must have for me), I can place the unit in the DVR and with the included DVR remote, control every function of the 605 and have the screen from the 605 projected to my TV.  This also allows you to surf the web with the remote and see it on the TV.  Also watch videos, YouTube, photos/slideshows & music.  The DVR is a digital media receiver that actually works.  The DVR is just that too (a DVR!), with the ability to download a tv guide and just click on the show you want to watch.  The Archos will record it.  Setup is a little cumbersome and so I will probably not use it for that purpose.  I use it for the docking/charging/video-to-tv option.  If the battery doesn't last long enough for you, you can buy the battery dock which is nice and small and probably doubles the battery life.  There are numerous additional work-arounds people have come up with for additional battery life as well as charging (archosfans forum).  The USB charger is really slow apparently.  This is because USB inherently provides very little power and the battery is relatively large.  So it takes a long time to charge.  Do yourself a favor and decide in advance which of the 4 docks you find most useful and purchase one when you buy the 605.  Any of the docks charges faster than USB.  It has a tiny little speaker that does work in a pinch, and is great for showing someone a video or slideshow with music.  Not something you'd want to use regularly.  Get it.  Now.

Note: the downloads are model specific. My unit was instantly updated and I've experienced no problems whatsoever after nearly 60 days of constant use in the following areas:  surfed numerous websites - the Opera browser is flawless and easy to use purchased the helmet cam and recorded several outdoor adventure videos which were of better quality than my Sony digital camcorder linked unit with my PCs windows media player - instant transfer of all files downloaded videos, movies, pictures, and music without a hitch hooked my unit up to a JBL On-Tour portable speaker system...awesome full room sound quality  THIS IS A DREAM UNIT FOR A TECHNO AUDIOVIDEOWEBAPHIL - my term:)

<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I think this archos player is a nice product.  I bought an ipod classic, but the screen is just to small to be a video player so returned it.  I took it on long trip and it came in handy.  The interface is no apple design, but gets the job done.  Didn't like I had to buy $80 in upgrades to get what I needed, but I guess that's why the price to buy is somewhat reasonable.  Battery like could be a lot better.
