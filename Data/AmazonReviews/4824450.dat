<Title>1 star but if I could I'll put 5 negative stars!!!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll need some self contro to stay polite, to write this review. I bought mine in november, but after one months the device refuse to work anymore, for no reason there was no way to switch it on anymore. During this first month, I won't say that was the perfect MP3 juke box... It bugged at least twice a week, in a way that sometimes I don't know why but I have till the battery was flat to restart it! But for that I was lucky cause the autonomy is far from the constructor datas, the most I was abble to use it was suring maybe 6 sometimes 7 hours... Otherwise I was slow to load the menu play a song or just respond to single command, the sound  wasn't really great, very flat even with the personalized equalizer... Oh I forget to mention the picture, I was only able once to load picture on it, and then never again, I try everything even restore all the factory parameter and delete all my music there was no way!!! So I was happy to contract the extra warranty, best buy give me a new one, my first surprise was that I didn't find the radio on the menu there wasn't any way to turn the radio on, but I didn't really care about the radio... So my new one was just like the old one, same battery autonomy, same weak and flat sound, same bug, but at least it worked for more than a months this time!!! Now it just died again, for no reason??? I'm glad to read other review like this one it means that's not my karma fault!! Just Philips... I came to best buy again, they proposed me to change it, but there was NO WAY!!! So I choose another brand, I hope that ipod will works better, and plus the new one is thinner, so I'll see!

<Title>Pathetic Product, Atrocious Customer Service
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will never - ever - buy anything from Philips again.  This purchase was a Christmas present for my son.  Within a few days of opening it and following all the instructions to the letter, the screen fried, making the unit unusable.  I contacted customer service, and a very helpful agent gave me a support tag number and shipping information.  It was all a ploy.  Philips took their sweet time sending out a replacement unit, and when they did, they gave us an expected delivery date that has long since passed with absolutely no concern about the status of the delivery.  Their attitude is, "hey, we shipped it to you."  Philips' Customer Service is, in a word, shallow.  They cannot tell you who they used to ship replacements, and that department doesn't much care.  Instead, they have to put in a request for a tracking number which can take an additional three business days.  We have already spoken with the vendor.  As soon as this thing ever gets here - if it does - it's going back for a refund and we'll buy a different MP3 player from a company that can at least pretend it knows what it's doing.

<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went to bestbuy to get an ipod but ended up buying "Philips HDD6330 30 GB MP3 Player". I am impressed by its performance. I was little skeptical while buying, as this being a new product from Philips. I got the 2 warranty which costed me another $30 and I am glad i got the warranty after looking at the reviews here. But quite frankly i didnt hv any problems till now. The product looks great!! its nice that they hv a inbuilt voice recorder which records pretty well. i would recommand this for the price. the only drawback is, it doesn't have that many accessories as an ipod.

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Fri Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Picked this up at the local best buy, and of like most of you i was skeptical about the new unit, however i really was impressed with how it operated.. ESPECIALLY processor wise, very quick interface. I've had it for three weeks now and it hasn't given me one issue yet. Always boots up and plays..  And by the way, this was a replacement for my samsung YH-820 that died within 6 months, that was the worst unit ever for many other reasons. I never purchase warranty plans, but you require it on these things..

<Title>Philips' customer care  SUCKS!!!!
<Date>Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sorry but there was no better way to put it.  First of all, I bought this product on Tuesday after coming across it on AOL gifts. I lost my IRiver 40 gb (or it is somewhere in my house) so I decided to buy something different just in case I find it. I'd sell it on Ebay and move on. Anyhow, I went to BestBuy and purchased this product Tuesday evening. It is now Saturday, FOUR DAYS later and I have finally got this thing to work. Now , I am not new to mp3's. I have been using them before they became popular. However, I must say, Philips has the WORST Instruction Manual, description of requirements, and customer service.  First issue- After installing the software, the player would not work. It was being recogognized by my computer but not by the installed software,WMP10 and the Device Manager. Between Tuesday and Wed, I called the  support team  EIGHT times. They couldn't figure out the issue.They had the basic by the book responses. If I could reach into the phone I'd slap them . I held out hope though. I then realized by my own pc's  help, that I needed a high speed USB.  A 2.0 USB, for those who don't have one. We have two pc's and  the one that I loaded the software on is the one that I use  and contains all of my info. It had everything but the  hi speed usb. I loaded the software on the second pc, an hp media center h660 series and it worked perfectly fine. Problem is, how am I supposed to get my songs if it is on the other computer??  So I call the clueless people, cut the crap with the  tag number they like to give you out and gave them the reference number from the previous calls. Now I asked if the problem could be the usb. They couldn't say yes or no. I would have to ask my pc's maker. They don't know.   Great.  Dummies.  THEY SHOULD HAVE HAS ON THE REQUIREMENT LIST- WINDOWS XP SERVICE PACK 1 with IE 6 512MB RAM more than 300 mhz. USB2.0 HI SPEED  Had I known this, I woul dnot have wasted a day. So now Thursday, I go over to Radio Shack and purchased a PCI card. This is a USB 2.0  port that I must now physically install into my pc. Of course, for (...), the pci card is being recognized but it's drivers wont install. So, render it useless. I also purchased a Router to connect my two pc's and just transfer files. (..), and also useless. I do not have DSL and I only have one Ethernet cord. "Go by another one", you say. For what? I don't have DSL and I don't intend on dragging my basement pc to my room in order to transfer files onto this dumb non computer friendly device.  So, after many hours of frustration , I finally managed to get somewhere. I abandoned my other pc and used the HP . Now how did I get my songs? I spent two hours saving them on memory cards from my camcorder and digital camera(Now I wish I had sprung for the 512mb). 2 memory cards, 2 and a half hours, transfering 800 files.   Finally the songs are loaded , they go onto my device. Now for the pictures...where the hell are they? Oh they say they are there but I don't see them.  So guess what? I call the monkeys(no that's not fair, they(monkeys) would have figured this one out)-scratch that, I called those people that call themselves customer support and  told the woman I am not seeing my pics. So she asked me if I used Windows Explorer to transfer the pics. Now if it says use WMP10, then why the hell and how the hell can I use Windows Explorer. Then she tells me to do a device repair. There goes my 600 and some odd songs and some valid time in my life. Did it all over again to factory settings and no pictures.  Well, I Thank GOD that I know how to read. I went to their support site and found the cause of the issue.   If your pictures are not showing, the great possibility is that your philips plug -in is not installed . I checked my add/remove programs (go to control panel) and low and behold it was missing. So after reinstalling the second cd and 5 mins later, the plug -in pops up as it should. I rebooted and tried transferring pics again and now all is well.   Couldn't the rep tell me this in the first place? No. Because they do not know what the hell they are doing.  Ok. so now things are working well but by the sound of the other horror stories, who knows how long that will last. Lucky for me I paid that extra cash and bought the 2 yr warranty through Best Buy. The only reason that I did not give up hope is because it is so cute and has more to offer than the silly IPOD that everyone and their mother thinks is the greatest thing on the earth.  One thing I wish it would have is a carrying case that is attachable to the hip for running or   just period. I mean the concept of the product is good but it was not well executed.  The guy that I'm dating kept doubting it after reading these reviews and told me I was looking at Fashion before function. Sort of true, that is why i kept it. Aside from the smudging, I think it is fierce. Niceely built, sleek and cute, so I held out hope. I don't understand how people complain about the contollers, seeing as they are touch pad but I guess I am doomed to find out.  (...) After all of that trouble , I want some of my money back. I'm also taking the Router and PCI slot back to Radioshack. That's a good hundred dollars right there almost wasted. Almost.

<Title>What the heck???
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really really wanted to write a good review about this product.  But unforunately I can't.  I received this item as a Valentine's Day gift. (cool right)?  Wrong!!! When I received it it worked fine for a day than all of a sudden the device was not being recognized by my pc.  I thought well let me contact support and they can help me.  After a long chat on the web they had me download a patch to make the pc recongize the player again.  That went fine.  Then the player freezed up a few times.  Again I thought hey it's new technology so it's bound to have some bugs.  Well I downloaded 1500 songs into my player and I thought it was the coolest thing since high def tv's I was so happy with it that I went out and brought another one for my partner.  That's when things started to get ugly.  I went to download some pics and surprise they were not showing up in my player.  After venting some I went to the philips web sight to trouble shoot.  I tried everything they said on the website and still no pictures.  It shows that they are there but when you go to view them they are not there.  After six hours lots of cussing and a headache I decided to give up for the night and call cs in the morning.  Well I called cs and what did they do NOTHING, NATTA.  The first thing that they had me do was repair my player.  That means that you completely delete everything in your player.  Now I knew it wouldn't work because neither player was able to load pics.  But I decided to try it.  Well guess what now I have an empty mp3 player that still doesn't load pics.  Then they got really brillant and wanted me to uninstall my windows media player, meaning I would lose the songs stored in the library.  Now we are talking about 2000 songs, they will be in the pc but you have to go through all the trouble of adding them back to your library.  I asked them well what if that doesn't work?  The answer was to try another pc.  Are you kidding me?  I just brought this laptop about two months ago and your telling me it's the pc's problem.  Please!  So now I have two players that aren't working properly.  The only other thing they said I could do was set up a repair and wait till god only knows how long to get them back.  Why should you have to send a product in for repairs that you have only had for a few weeks?  It is taking all my control not to take the thing outside and run it over with my car.  If it wasn't so expensive I probably would do that because I am that mad.  This product does have some cool features like the voice record and fm tuner.  But be warned if you buy it.  I really wish I would have seen the reviews but hey it was gift.  So I had no way of knowing how big of a headache it would be.  If I spend nearly $300 for something I expect it work properly.  The music sounds good the touch pad is sometimes too sensitive, than other times it doesn't want to work.  They had some great ideals when designing this product but when it comes down to it is it really worth it?  I say no but that's just my opinion.  I am returning this thing tomorrow and I'm thinking about just going with the ipod.  I'm so mad I might just get the money back.  I hope this is helpful.  My advice is be careful it may or maynot work properly for you.

<Title>Philips is not a worthy mp3 maker
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>"Absolutly dreadful", as Simon would say...my mp3 somehow managed to turn my computer upsidedown and nothing will work. Not only that but the player itself refuses to work while trying to download my first CD on the day I purchased it, it just froze and now all it wants is to be hooked to the computer and its been that way for hours. I am returning it back to Best Buy where I got it.  A complete waste of time and money. Not even a single day of it worth while.

<Title>I like it when it's working.
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's really unstable and unreliable from my experience with it. When I first got it, I really liked it. It was rather easy to use and the sound quality was more than I could ask for. Didn't use the head buds it came with, I prefer large bulky headphones. :D I got it as a Christmas Present from my parents, specifically for I trip I was taking to work on a project. I would be needing it because I was making makeshift desks and my computer was no longer an adequate Mp3 player anymore. Not exactly portable. This would be my first portable mp3 player.  I was a little suspicious of the touch...button---light things at first, but they grew on me because it could brush on the floor and it wouldn't be effected. I could care less about fancy interfaces or how it looks, just as long as it works. I wanted it for one thing and one thing only, to use it as an mp3 player. And for a time, it was good. It worked, with a small complaint about how long it took to transfer files. But that was no biggie, at the time I only had 2,000 songs. It only took a few hours...  But then one day I pause and get up to go to the bathroom and come back to find that it was frozen...the screen was on and the hardrive was dead. For a while there, I was panicking. Then I went to the ridiculously-over-the-top FAQ and found out how to reset it. I thought my problems were over, I was liking it a little less though, but heck, it was a minor bug and I thought that would be the end of it.  How very wrong I was.   After that I had no problems for a while. It was working and I was very happy with it. It was somewhat reliable, although I couldn't figure out how to do the playlists. (I was liking having the one it came with) And I didn't want to use Windows media player, the program is a little on the evil side. It worked just fine with dragging the files via Windows Explorer.  One day, I turn it on, and the list of songs is empty. There's nothing....I panic. I plug it into the computer and discover that all the songs are still there, mysteriously though they do not show up on the device. I do what I've done before, I get rid of all the songs and start again. I finally give in and see if "syncing" is any faster. It was fast at first, then it slowed down, then it stopped completely, then (biG surprise :O) The program crashes. Thanks a lot WMP. T_T  My collection has grown...a bit since then, too. So now I'm stuck with an empty unreliable buggy mp3 player. Looks like my computer is currently my main jukebox.  Overall nice concept. I don't care for fancified things, I like it when they work, but this machine is unfortunately style over substance.  They should have worked out the very apparent bugs before releasing it. They were in such a hurry to release the Windows answer to the Ipod, which in itself sounds like something worrisome.  I give it two stars. Easy to use and rather nice...when its working. Usually it isn't.

<Title>Frusterating, buy something else
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player since November and I am now putting it on craigslist so that I can buy a real mp3 player. I seem to have some of the same issues others have had.....the player is great when it works, but I have frequent problems.  It constantly freezes.  Sometimes after freezing, it won't recognize any of my songs (playlist shows zero songs).  Connect it to the computer and look via Windows Explorer....yep, they are there, but the player will not recognize them.  One time when re-syncing with Windows Media Player, either WMP or the device deleted a whole directory of my songs on my PC (luckily I back up my files to an external hard drive, so I was ok).  I figured that I could live with this player given some bugs...but it crashes so frequently now that it is too frusterating to use.  Oh...and don't even try calling their customer care.  First off, it does not even seem like they know their products.  Their only remedy is to delete all files from the device and re-sync.  And like other people have said about their customer care, they don't seem overly concerned that you are having problems and seem like they just want to get you off the phone.  Bottom line.....get something else!

<Title>Nice toy...
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well my brother has this nice and cool looking Jukebox player.  It has 30gb which holds up to 15,000 songs! :o  It doesn't have a click wheel but it does have this line/track looking thing which I think is kind of better then the click wheel.  It looks better and it's less hand movement :)  I also give it 2 thumbs up because all of the buttons light up :o! The buttons are kind of like censors....  The only downside to this nice looking toy is that its kind of difficult to add album art and pictures onto it.  Also if you purchase this product I highly reccomend you to purchase another set of headphones/earphones so you can prevent ear damage...  This Jukebox player also comes with a case! so you wont have to purchase a $30 case that will end up ripping....  It is also very VERY easy to transfer music to it :)

<Content>I actually went from a Dell jukebox 20GB to this thing. gotta say, it was pretty weak. I loaded it up full from the 2nd day on and maybe this was the problem but I'm not sure why it glitched out on me all the time.  I had to buy a 1gb player as a backup to my commute!  in any case, you can't edit songs on the player itself, playlists are annoying to edit - but I did love the playlist on the fly function - and the software is like the commodore 64.  brutal.  I had this thing less than 6 mos and sold it for cheap.  never buy this.  never.

The touch screen does just that, responds to your touch, like the iPhone. In fact it looks just like the iPhone, same black, sleek, look. I am so glad I didn't get the iPod. My friend's iPod, when the battery died, lost all the data including ALL that music. iPods are known for their crappy battery problem is all I can say. This player will NOT let you down.

And even worse, their customer service does not care about you, they dont even act like they do. I have gone so far as to complain to the BBB and my Attorney General because this has happened TWICE within a span of slightly over a year- AND they wont give me a refund AND also claim that it is my fault.

I've had this MP3 player for less than four months, and the battery has already began to die on me!  After looking at reviews on Amazon, I found out it's a common problem, and the main reason to avoid this device.  One year warranty, you say?  Don't count on it!  Philips Customer/Technical help is both unapologetic and rude.  They've sent me in circles many times.  Giving me false "reference numbers" and worst of all, false hope that my MP3 player will every function normally.  Remember; you get what you paid for.  Sure, the Philips Go Gear is much cheaper than most other MP3 players, but the quality and service that goes along with it is terrible.  Think about it before investing your hard-earned money on a substandard music player.

<Title>Buy an iPod Video instead
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item from here and sent it back the same day. My reasons for buying were:  * sound recording * huge capacity for my audio books * cheaper than iPod * I really won't be watching videos on it  When it arrived, everything was OK until I realized that the vertical pad didn't fast forward/rewind the song played. You need to keep the forward/backward button pressed and it will fast forward/rewind, but at a very slow speed. For me, the reason for buying such a large capacity mp3 player was long audio books, and there is no way I can feel comfortable without the ability of quickly going to the place I want in the file. Utter disappointment. iPod has a superb wheel thing that lets you move to anywhere in the file conviniently. Right after I realized that the iPod video can also record with an external mic, there was no reason left for me to keep this product. I paid about $20 more for a 30gb iPod video now. Well, sometimes you gotta go mainstream. Plus, iPod has a huge user community and all kind of software is out there. I didn't even try to use this on my Linux box, the player just didn't qualify for other reasons.

<Title>I'm quite frustrated with this product and Philips
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this unit a  few months ago and was very pleased at the outset. Though it took me a while to get the songs and my pictures in properly, the ability to have a large part of my music collection with me at all times outweighed the negatives. However, I'm not so pleased anymore. Its happened at least twice now that I power on my unit only to find that all my songs are gone. The unit won't recognize them. Its happened at the most inopportune times, too, right when I'm about to work out and need loud music to take my mind off the pain! The instruction manual was no help, the web site was no help, but more astoundingly, Philips customer service was no help! Like others have said, they seem to have no more knowledge about the products than their customers. This has proven incredibly frustrating. Philips should not be in this market and I, for one, will not buy anything else from them.

<Title>Philips Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can not believe that a compnay as large as philips would have such terrible customer service.  I received this player for Christmas as a gift.  Well it worked fine jusst unable to find many accessories for it. Well in March this thing just freezes up and I cant turn it off. Well finally it goes off and then I cant get it back on. Call customer service and they were no help so they requested I send it back to them for an exchange. And request that I do delivery confirmation. So somewhere there had to ding for it in order to insure delivery.  Well they keep it two weeks and I call Monda and they say we havent looked at it and call back in a few days. Well low and behold the next afternoon there is a fedex package on my door. I open it and there is a orange and banana in the package. So I call and they give me the run around. But the bottom line was they did not request that someone sign for the package and it was left outside on the balcony in an apartment complex. Im not sure where the mishap happened but....I sent Philips a player and feel they should take every measure to make sure I get one back. So now they are telling me that unless I can send a receipt I will get $179.  And if I get the receipt I can get what I paid minus taxes.  I cant understand why Im having to pay out the pocket the difference when I sent them a paid for device. And customer service has been so rude and I plan to tell everybody I know that you have better be a technician if you get this cause Philips wont or cant fix it. I will NEVER BUT ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM AND I JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN GET A CREATIVE ZEN.

<Title>Frustrating: poor quality all around
<Date>Thu Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must constantly reset the device; the sound quality is sub-par; the processor is slow; the USB/power-cord combo is bulky; works only with Windows Media Player (e.g. not with Rhapsody).  Get a Zen Vision instead.  Worst $300 I ever spent.

<Title>Don't judge a book by it's cover
<Date>Thu Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you notice almost all of the good reviews are from people who don't own one or seem to have had one for about 12 hours. Its a pretty little thing, with its slick looking face & touch sensitve buttons and slide. The navigation is ok, which also looks attractive. Everything about it LOOKS great. Thats where it ends. I am on my fourth one because they keep breaking themselves, so thank god I got a 2 year replacement. If you push buttons too fast, it will glitch itself, and you have to use its software to erase everything, and on two of my other ones that didn't even fix it. I have RhapsodyToGo and it doesn't work right now beacuse of it. I don't have the time or energy to list everthing thats wrong with, so do yourself and everyone else a favor: don't buy it. Tell everyone you know not to buy it. Philips should be ashamed of such a piece of junk.

<Title>Buggy Firmware, Slow, Lousy Headphones.  I got burned.
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For my first mp3 player, I wanted to avoid the iPod, because I wanted to avoid using iTunes.  I got this player for Christmas 2005.  I liked it because: (1) it worked with Windows Media Player (2) the large 30GB capacity (3) the slick look. (4) it displays pics (5) it supports album art (6) it has a radio and voice recorder (7) the handsome up/down scrolling method (8) support for protected .wma files (9) upload songs from any PC  But here is what I DON'T like about this player: (1) It installs some questionable services that cause Windows probelms and don't seem required to run: i.e. LimeAlive.exe.  If you don't install their software, the device won't recognize the songs you've uploaded. (2) It is SLOW to respond.  If music is playing, and you click &lt;&lt; or >>, it might take up to FOUR SECONDS for the device to respond to a button press.  By this time, you've already clicked another button, thinking you missed it the first time.  This is my biggest complaint about this item and seriously hinders any user-friendliness. (3) Scrolling through your track list takes FOREVER, especially if there is music currently playing.  I had 7GB out of 30GB filled, and you must scroll and scroll and scroll to get through the song list. (4)  My system has locked up several times.  The instructions say something like, "don't panic, just do a soft reset by..." etc.  If you don't know how to do a soft reset, your player may just play until the battery runs out. (5) One day, the player just stopped seeing any files on the drive, even though the files still existed.  Philips support said there was a corrupt database, and I would have to re-image the hard drive back to factory spec, and then upload all of my songs again.  TERRIBLE!  There was no work-around for this, and hours were wasted re-compiling and uploading tracks. (6) Philips says up to 18 hours of battery life.  Yeah, Right.  Maybe if you have the radio set to an AM station on volume 1 with the display turned off.  I'd say more like 8 or 9 hours of real-time use. (7) The headphones were lousy.  I replaced them within days.  And still, the volume is so weak, you'll never listen to anything under half-volume.  Mine is maxed out pretty much all the time. (8) I bought a dock from Philips' website so that I could plug in at work or at home.  It was $40.  And it included: a dock.  No cables.  Cables were an extra $25 or so.   (9) Ever seen an iPod scroll through hundreds of pictures with lightning-quick speed?  You won't see that on this model.  Expecially if it's playing music. (10) Philips never bothered to email me back about these concerns.  There has been no firmware update from Christmas 05-June 06.  I would not buy this item again.  I would not recommend this player to anyone.

<Title>What the h--- does "Sync" mean?
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I CANNOT figure out how to just ADD songs to it.  It seems to re-write everything everytime you "Sync" it to the PC.  Which takes forever.  I can never seem to replicate its shenanigans.  And it labels an album as a Playlist, in addition to listing the album.  I only want playlists that I crate and label.  It does not play well with windows media player.  This has eaten way too many hours.  I want a player where I can FIND A SONG when I want it.  I play a lot of world music and cannot remember the foreign titles, so I want them in playlists.  I use it to study a language, so I want to be able to go right to a lesson.   And the controls are finicky.  It's easy to go past the selection you want.  It does not always respond to 'key' input.  A $200 headache.

<Title>Upset to Boot
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this HDD6330/17 only to discover that it will freeze.  I got it replaced but the second one froze, too.  I got a refund.  I called the technical support of Philips and visited their website to learn why.  I had to go through many links before coming across the one that would answer my question.  What was said under the tech support did not match what had happened.  It was suppose to just unfreeze and not erase the music following the steps, but it erased all of the 386 songs that I had sync to my MP3. My thought was if it freezes again, will I have to continue to reload the songs?  But the question was answered because it would not sync any of the songs again. The instructions from a live person said hold down the "on" button while pressing the volume "plus" button until it turns off, and he said that it was in the manual. WELL!! I was insulted by his tone of voice for not going to my manual first.  I am a first time buyer of the MP3, and was shaken when it froze. I froze.  I did not call back when my music was erased for fear of another ice tone of voice as to what I did.  I would not recommend anyone to purchase Philip MP3 because of the technical service person, and it was nothing in the manual to say what to do when you cannot replace the music that was erase.

<Title>Works great so far
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am surprised to read all the bad reviews.  I purchased this item just about a week ago and it has not given me any trouble so far. I upgraded from the HDD070 which only has 2GB capacity. I've had it for 2 years and never had a problem with it either. Did not want an Ipod because everyone I know who has one say they break within a year and frankly I find them to be a little over-rated.  I like the sleek design of the Philips HDD6330 and I find it to be very user friendly.  Very quick to upload music.  Since I am only interested in the music funtion, the pictures, recordings and radio functions are only added bonuses to me. Just like a few other reviewers, I agree that it has too few accessories.
