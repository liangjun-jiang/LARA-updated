<Title>Very nice

<Content>This little mp3 player is about the size of a cigarette lighter and it has very nice sound quality. I was looking for an alternative to an ipod that would work with a mac. The package says it supports mac but the instructions only talk about using it with windows. It comes with software which you can throw in the trash if you own a mac. To use with a mac you drag and drop your mp3 files from your iTunes folder to the mp3 icon, it's very easy. The instructions are not very clear and figuring out how to operate the mp3 player may take a little time. In addition to the power switch there is also an on/off/menu switch, both need to be on in order for it to play. The play button has 3 modes, stop/pause/play, you need to tap the button 3 times in order for it to start playing. The instructions don't tell you this and as far as I can tell it does not show you which mode you are in. You also do not need batteries, it has a built in rechargeable battery which charges off the usb port of your computer, the usb cable is included. I have not used the voice recorder or the fm radio which come with it so I can not comment on those.
