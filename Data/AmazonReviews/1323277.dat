<Title>Zen and the art of consumer electronics
<Date>Mon Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm usually skeptical about buying Creative products because of past experience with "seemingly short" support cycles.  Regardless, I caved and purchased the Zen as a low-cost alternative to the iPod shuffle.  I've only had it for a handful of days, but here's my first impression:  Pros: - Sound is really great! - Intuitive buttons allows choosing without looking. - Small, cute, light and seems durable. - No software needed to load music (HUGE PLUS! - acts like a flash drive) - "Tell All" LED negates the need for an LCD readout.  Cons: - No clip, but you get one if you shell out for the skin accessory. - Control buttons could offer a bit more tactile feedback.  This is a perfect little gem for the gym!  I'm very happy with it so far!

<Title>My "Zen Jr."  is exactly what I've been looking for!!
<Date>Wed Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've only had this about a week, but so far I love it! I'm always in a car or a truck & needed something small and durable..It goes from my duffle bag to my pocket, to the truck dashboard hooked up to the stereo via a Phillips Cassette Adapter..All this could not be done as easily with for example my wife's Zen Vision-M..The sound is great with said adapter, as well as the accompanying earbuds which are actually pretty good..Am ordering one for wife as a backup..Granted, you are not getting the features & quality of a $200 model, but at this price, what more could you want?  P.S.  Windows Vista insisted on installing a driver which I just pushed "cancel" and found the Zen Stone in "computer" The software is VERY buggy on Vista Ultimate..Had to restore the computer to be rid of it..  Also I'm not Suzanne!! lol

<Title>WOW !!  Small but Powerful !
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't let the size fool you.  This little thing just plain ROCKS !! The sound is VERY GOOD - even the Bass tones. With XP you can drag and drop your music files. You can create several folders on it - for example - I have one for Blues, one for Rock etc. The headphones that come with it are pretty good - but I bought a good pair of Sony Headphones which are great with this player. Want to lose weight? Put some AC/DC on this thing and head for the gym !!  It is a GREAT Buy !!

<Title>worthy alternative
<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got the Zen Stone for father's day,I resisted getting a MP3 player because of price and couldn't see myself using one. This product has won me over. Here's why:   Great design! I got the sense CREATIVE Inc. put some real thought into the feel and look of the player, though inexpensive it doesn't look cheap.I got a "cool" when I showed it to my daughters.   I was amazed how simple it was to load and organize songs, very intuitive process. I like the feature that allows you to store songs in different files and access each file on the player, example: if you want to hear only "classical" you switch to that file you named "classical", using a 3 position sliding bar on the side of the player. You cannot do this with an IPOD Shuffle.   Sound quality is crisp and clear. My kids own variuos IPODs and the sound is on par with the Shuffle and Nano, if not slighty better. Note: if you are looking for that throbing bass you get with speakers, ear buds just can't deliver, regardless of the player, investing in good headphones might do the trick.    If you have been waiting to purchase a MP3 player for casual use, I highly recommend getting a Zen Stone.

<Title>Half the price/More than twice the value
<Date>Mon Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 2 of these for gifts to my extended families overseas. Created a MP3  files playlist and sync-ed it to the Zen using Windows Media Player 11 in lest than 5 minutes (not counting the actual transfer time. Did not require any instructions.  I personally own an iPod shuffle (given to me as a gift) and I love it. But this is half the price and equally good. If you want to save some money and are in the Windows world I would HIGHLY recommend this player.

<Title>Very user friendly *-*
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am technologically challenged.  I needed something that was user friendly without a lot of buttons to confuse me.  I needed something that was easy to transfer files to and from.  I needed something small that would fit comfortably in my back pocket while I did a physically demanding job.  The Zen Stone does all that and more.  It is sleek and attractive and holds more than enough music to keep me happy *-*  For 39.99 out the door from Amazon I can't say enough good about it.  If you don't need a LCD screen this is the MP3 player for you...  The headphones that are provided wiht the player bothered by ears because I have small ears.  I invested in a pair with spongey things on them and listen to this all the time.    It is also easy to plug into the computer at work and play through Window Media player to listen to MY music selection instead of a bunch of songs I don't really want to hear.  I checked out other MP3 players at double the cost with features I wouldn't have understood anyway and screens I would have had to put my reading glasses on to see.  Invest in this player and you will not be unhappy *-*  Winona

<Title>Perfect for me.
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think I was the last person to get an mp3 player, I didn't want to spend a lot of money but I wanted something cute and could hold a decent amount of songs. Putting the songs on is a little confusing at first and I still haven't found a way to move songs around and add folders to put songs into, but the good thing about that is the folders take up space, and the less folders the better. I've got around 200 songs on it now and still plenty of room (wma format). I would definately recommend getting the keychain case that goes with it, the first couple of days I had it without the case I put a couple of scratches in it and since then none. I also purchased a set of ear buds that go around my ear because my ears are small and the ones that come with it were too big and hurt or fell out.

<Title>awesome
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Awesome.  I love my Stone.  It's so small and lasts about 10 hours.  I don't know how long it really lasts because I have never used it for 10 hours straight.  Not having a screen doesn't really bother me, but it does have a little light that flashes different colors that mean different things so I still know what it's doing.  Otherwise it's a cool little thing and I would definately get either the skin or the arm band because it will get all scratched up if you don't.

<Title>Simple to use, high quality
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I read about this product in a NYT "Best gadgets under $50" gift idea list.  They said it was cheaper than an iPod shuffle and held more songs.  I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and found it was exactly as advertised.    It comes with everything you need:  the cord to connect it to your computer as well as earbuds, and the software you need is easily downloadable from the company's website.  Even if you don't know much about computers, you can use this.    I'm old enough that I want tech things to be simple and reliable - I don't need every bell and whistle, I just want my mp3 player to play music and not give me any grief.  And if it doesn't kill me price wise, that's ideal.  That's what this gives you.  I liked my boyfriend's so much, I'm probably going to buy myself one soon.

<Content>The Creative Zen Stone 1 GB MP3 player is a great little device.  It's simple to use, tiny and has crystal clear sound quality.  I also use it to listen to audio books and it is the easiest audio book player I've ever used. I would highly recommend this product.  The downside is the price of the accessories.  I think they could be more reasonably priced.  Other than that, buy one, you'll love it!

<Title>Zen Stone 1 Gig
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For the money, this unit was good. I decided, however, to get the 2 gig Stone so I could read the titles of the entries I was playing. However, if you use USB external hard-drives, you need to be cautious about incompatibilities with the Stone players and the HD drivers. The players need to be installed in a certain fashion to avoid crashes. One of my techno-friends is going to show me how to do this one day. In the interim, I don't power up my USB drives when I know I'm going to down files to my Stones. This avoids the problem.

<Title>Dropped mine in the river, and it still worked!
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm writing about how durable and sturdy this MP3 player is. I've had mine for about 8 months now, and it has been through a lot. Getting dropped, sat on, dropped in a river bed, left out in the rain, getting run over by a skateboard, and generally misused. BUT IT STILL WORKS GREAT! The music is crisp and clear, loud too for such a little thing. It's easy to use, just plug into your computer's USB port and drag and drop the music you want. No software to install. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, or attach a lanyard to the back. The Stone lasts enough for a good 12-14 hours of constant play, but i never play it that long, which is why I only have to charge it once a week or so. I can even go two weeks without charging it and it plays good. Also, the 1 GB is more than enough for tons of songs. I compress my WMA's and MP3's down a lot, and find that I can fit over 1200 songs on my Zen Stone. In short, it's great for people who want a simple music player that is easy to use and can survive a tornado. Or a teenager.

<Title>Works great
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>WE gave 2 of these to my girlfriend's younger siblings as a Christmas gift. They love it. It has the same space as the Ipod shuffle at about half the price and works with Windows Media Player which is nice. It does not require other software though there is an optional download that comes with the MP3 player. Simple, easy, and very small. This is the perfect starter MP3 player for kids and may come in handy for its size for adults.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone MP3
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this product for my daughter for Christmas.  She is in her twenties.  From what she has told me, she loves it. We were both amazed how small it is!  She is very happy with the gift and has not experienced any problems with the product at all.  She recently purchased portable speakers for the unit that are battery operated.  This allows you to listen to your music out loud without the earphones.  When I asked her if she would recommend this MP3 player to someone else, she stated that she would, although, she really didn't have anything else to compare it to.

<Content>This is a great player for someone like me who never thought they would break down and buy an mp3 player. I'm not "into" all the latest technology, but I was getting tired of getting off the treadmill to change cd's constantly! This little thing is soooo easy to figure out. I taught myself how to operate it and how to download songs in no time. It may be a cheaper player, but the sound is awesome. I've had mine for probably 4-6 months now, with no problems. I recommend this for beginners or anyone who just needs a basic, easy to use mp3 player.

<Content>I bought this as a present for my mom and she loves it.  It's lightweight so she can slip it in her purse anywhere. She's also not a techy person so this MP3 is just the right thing for her since it has only a few buttons so she can't go wrong in learning how to use it. Transferring music is very easy and manageable through the computer. Sound quality is excellent and battery life so far has been good. It's definitely a good buy for the price.

<Title>A Great MP3 Player That Works Seamlessly With Windows Explorer
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been waiting for a long time for a more mainstream, non-Mac MP3 player that would work with Windows Explorer.  This one is great.  I use it in my car. It is highly recommended. What baffles me is that no one seems to think very much of the fact that this player works seamlessly with Windows Explorer. Even Creative doesn't do much to advertise the fact. It is more than a matter of convenience.  It is a matter of principle. Countless MP3 services and MP3 player, CD, and DVD manufacturers think nothing of imposing needless restrictions on their customers.  This is how we end up with CDs, MP3s, and DVDs that we've purchased legally and cannot make copies of.  This is how we get DVDs that install malicious software on our PCs (thanks Sony).  The Zen Stone is untainted by any of this nonsense. You plug it in via usb, it appears as a new storage drive, and you drag MP3s onto it. It's as easy as that. It doesn't impose any DRM or format restriction. It is a pure, unrestriced computational process, which is exactly what it should be.

<Title>Very good so far
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had mine for about a month, and it seems great. I mostly listen to books while I clean, and it's loud and clear enough to listen to while vacuuming. One gig is a lot of space for the price, and it's small and lightweight enough to take with you always. The only conceivable downside is that it has no display, which can be troublesome when trying to find a specific place on a long track. This is made up for by the very low cost and the intuitive controls. So far, I love it.

<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought it to use in the gym and it is very good for just that.  It does not come with software which is not a big deal other than to be able to control the built-in volume limits. (I chose not to download it and install more junk in my Computer.) It does not have a clip so you have to buy that separate.  The clip is poorly engineered and it's hard to work without pressing the skip button.  It's half the price of the shuffle and nice for limited use.

<Content>I have had my stone for over a month and I find that it is a great device to have around. The software is free to download, but you can even use Windows Explorer to load the files - clean simple design and it takes a standard USB 2.0 plug, same as my digital camera - so it is easy to find a cable when I need one. Battery life seems good too.  The only thing that would be a nice addition would be a small clip on it so that I could clip it to my shirt.

<Title>Pretty good, nothing fancy
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I like my little stone, it's easy to use and fairly good looking- verrryyy tiny.  The earbuds that came with it are almost completely useless, they fell out of my ears 8 times in twenty minutes, and I was just sitting down.  The player works just fine, will easily accept drag and drop music (and Jpegs and whatever you want to stick on it)... but the stupid USB adapter cord is hard to keep track of.  I'm actually not sure where it is at the moment.  All in all, I like my little ipod nano knockoff, but it doesn't have any frills, so don't buy one if you want fancy equalizers or radio or pretty moving pictures.

<Content>This is very easy to figure out, and the lack of screen is fine for me (saves battery, I'm sure). Plug-n-play, drag-n-drop in Windows XP, at least. The price is very good for the capacity. While it's very light, the Stone feels solid in the hand and doesn't creak anywhere.  One annoyance for me is that the volume control isn't fine enough; its lowest setting isn't low enough for me while in the library, but this is addressable by changing the music I put into it.

<Title>Zen Stone Rocks
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a bit of an electronics junkie--I've owned four mp3 players.  Gotta say that the Zen Stone has been the easiest to use by far, and the cheapest!  I have seen people say the controls aren't as tactile as they might like.  I haven't personally had that problem but could see how someone with larger fingers might.  My only complaint about this player is a problem I've had with every mp3 player I've owned--the shuffle is woefully inadequate.  It seems to me like whatever algorithm is used to create a random shuffle on players is never random--seems to play songs from the same few artists and albums and then switch to another few.  But, that's really the only problem I've had.  The price is right on this player, it's EASY to use, it's tiny and adorable, and absolutely perfect for the gym!

<Content>I bought The Stone as a gift for my Son's 12th Birthday.  I did a lot of back and fourth research of so many different 1G mp3 players for weeks and weeks before I finally decided on The Stone.  At first, I bought it for 3 reasons.  One, it was half the price of a 1G iPod Shuffle.  Two, it was black.  And three, free shipping.  We found The Stone was a hands down AWESOME buy.  NO SOFTWARE NECESSARY!  We didn't have to upload/download anything to start adding music to The Stone.  AND, unlike most mp3 players of this type, FILES can be made and different genres of music can be stored in The Stone.  You know, some days he feels like Hip Hop, some days he feels like Metal, and he can listen to whatever he wants without the genres being mixed.  The Stone is pure and simple with that little extra feature...at A GREAT price...absolutely a good buy.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone 1GB - Nice starter or spare MP3
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone 1GB is a nice value in starter MP3 players.  It has the same capacity as the iPod Shuffle at $40.  For $20 more, you can get the 2GB Stone Plus which also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + simple design with more color options  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - below-average battery life of 10 hours or less - software issues - Creative software is buggy - DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable from 1GB (no SD card slot) - no FM tuner or voice recording - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles - for just $20 more you get the 2GB Stone Plus with added features  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  The 1GB Zen Stone is decent but not perfect.  It suffers from quality issues and is really ideal for specific uses.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express nor as cool as an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations.  The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This burns out faster than the old battery operated unit, but is more convenient.  The sound is nice, and it comes through in stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds, which most people replace.  The Zen Stone Plus is the only larger option at 2GB. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.

<Title>It is what it is
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: 1.  Small 2.  Rechargeable through USB (no AA battery like MuVo) 3.  Easy to use 4.  Blinking LED lets you know status of charging and whether or not it's playing.   Cons: 1.  It takes about 20 seconds between the time you hit Play and the music actually starts. 2.  The headphones that came with it were crappy.  Would rather not get headphones at all then pay for crappy ones. 3.  IT HAS NO CLIP FOR RUNNING.  It comes with no clip to add on like the Muvo did, you have to buy an armband separately.  I used to have an iPod shuffle, which had its own clip already built onto it, which was nice. 4.  The iPod shuffle had a nice feature where if you hit the play button three times quickly it would jump immediately to the first song on the list.  This one doesn't do that.

<Title>A tiny, lightweight player with standards
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this thing!  It uses standard mp3 files and mounts as a standard portable drive, so there's no need for any additional software to load it up--just drag and drop from Explorer or Konqueror or whatever.  It connects to the computer via a standard small-format USB cable, the same style as used on my digicam, which will be handy if I ever lose the cable.  And it weighs literally 15 grams--about half of what my already-lightweight eyeglasses do.  My experience with the battery life is somewhere in the neighborhood of 6-10 hours depending on how loud I have it, which for me means I charge it up about once a week.

<Content>I find this mp3 player very handy when I go on walks. It's very small, yet has good sound quality. The interface for loading mp3s is really easy too and you don't need to download additional software. But, if you want to download the free software, be sure to write down the number on the outside of the box! (I threw the box away before I did, oops.) I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simple, inexpensive player.

<Title>Perfect gift for a technophobe music lover
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a gift for my 74 year old father, who is completely untechnical but has a love for obscure music that nobody else wants to listen to.  I loaded it up for him, using the Creative Media Lite software, and set it to shuffle.  All he has to remember how to do is to press the middle button to turn it on and off.   I found the Creative Media Lite software to be easy and intuitive to use, and the Zen Stone is light, attractive, and SIMPLE for someone who would never be able to navigate screens.  The sound quality is excellent (I replaced the earbuds with an inexpensive portable headset) and my father is thrilled with it.  He "loves his Zen".

<Title>Nice little number for the $
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking to get a simple mp3 player for my mother for her birthday. She would consider herself not "techno-savvy" so I knew it had to be extremely simple. She also didn't need much music (doesn't listen to it unless travelling)and didn't want anything bulky. The player was great for the price. I like that it allows you to shuffle or listen to your songs in a linear fashion. I have a zen nano so I found it easy to load music on   from my own software but it does come with a really simple software you download off net. What are the drawbacks...the biggest one was that during second play she could no longer hear any music and it wouldn't shut off til the battery ran down. After investigation...somehow it crashed and it needed to be reset which lost all music files or vice versa...not sure. Anyway,I reloaded everything and it seems to be working fine. The only other thing is that it doesn't come with a cord to wear around neck. There is a place for a cord so it should come with it- but doesn't. There are however, a number of accessory options that you can buy seperately (i.e keychain, arm band)Other than that little annoyance and the one time episode- It plays 215 or so songs,it's cute, and my mother says it's her favorite present since she was a kid.

<Content>Creative built another winner.  I love this little guy.  It isn't as small as a Shuffle, but it is still very small.  The battery lasts long enough for me to mow the lawn a couple times before needing a recharge.  I wish there was a little more storage for tunes, but Creative did make a new Plus version with 2GB.  Since it does not have a clip, the skin with a clip is a must.

<Title>So far, so good...
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While I could have opted for a player with a bit more space to take on my workouts/runs (2gb+) or one that includes FM radio or a voice recorder, I purchased the Stone for the basic function of holding a good amount of music (64kbp WMA files means around 500 songs, or 30+ hours of music...which is plenty for a MP3 player smaller than my two thumbs put together).  It is small and well-designed, has great sound quality, and is very inexpensive.  Since it has the ability to skip through folders, despite its lack of an LCD screen, the ability to shuffle through all music OR listen to an album/playlist at a time is all there.  Well worth the money I spent.

<Title>Amazing MP3 Player for this price!
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Zen Stone within two days. It's incredibley small, about the size of a .50 cent piece. It's big on sound, storage space and battery life though. I wanted something cheap, but durable and with decent sound quality for exercising with. The Zen Stone delivers all of that and its lightweight and easy to navigate in spite of having no graphic display menu. You can set up several playlists and skip through them with the touck of a finger or you can let it play shuffled files and get the random feel. Recharging and swapping files is as easy as plugging it into your USB port and then drag and drop your files where you want them. You can set up the folders the way you want and number tracks to arrange the playlists to your preferences. The only drawback to this system as it ships is the ear buds. They sound amazing, considering, but they are very uncomfortable and fall out if you blink. They are less than ideal for running. I purchased a Altec Lansing behind the neck headphone to replace the ear buds and they are perfect. They are also available on Amazon.com for around $15. Overall, this is an unbeatable player for this price. I deducted 1 star for the ear buds.

<Title>Simple is Best
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great MP3 player.  I learned the interface in about a minute, and had it playing as soon as it charged up.  Sound quality is excellent, as is true of all Creative products.  There's a palpable elegance to the integrity of the design; it really is sort of Zen.    Windows recognizes it as a portable drive without any restrictions or, really, any need for special software (Creative Media Lite is simple and straightforward, but really only necessary for firm upgrade).  Explorer or similar file management software work just as well.  Also, there's a place to attach a lanyard and hang the Stone from your neck.  I'm using one I got with a flash drive; don't know why Creative doesn't include one.  Only cons I can think of are that file transfer is really slow, varies from 200 to 500 kps.  I assume this is an inevitable result of form factor, but it is annoying when you're in a hurry.  Also, of course, earbuds are worthless.  I ordered Philips clip on earphones at the same time for less than 10 dollars and they work fine.  One more con: my wife and daughter both now want one.  And how can I deny them?

<Content>I love this product. It is small, lightweight, has a gig of memory and great sound reproduction. I bought it to listen to music and e-books that I download from Netlibrary.  The software that comes with it won't transfer the books to the player because of license protection. Not a problem, however, since Windows media player will grab the license from the Internet and then transfer the file easily to the Zenstone. The controls are simple and intuitive.  If you just squeeze the dial to the right or the left you can FF or Review what you are listening to without jumping to the next selection--very handy. It charges up quickly when you plug it into the USB port and can play for hours without needing a recharge. And it's a bargain!  Couldn't be happier with it.

<Title>Nifty Device, with some room for improvement.
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My iPod died and I wanted a cheap replacement while I wait for the next generation of iPods to hit the market.  I've also wanted a smaller,  flash-based mp3 player for awhile, to for activities where my iPod was either too bulky or in danger of getting scuffed or broken.    What I like:  -Love the design, it's tiny and nice looking.  I don't miss having a display.  I almost bought the larger version with the display but decided this version was more aesthetically pleasing and really covered the bases I needed.  I wish it came with a clip though.  Third party options are available, but how hard would it have been to just put a clip on it to begin with?  -You don't need to install any software, you can just drag and drop files right into it, and put them in folders if you wish.  It will play just what is in a certain folder unless you press the button to advance to the next folder, or have it on shuffle mode.    -It does what it's supposed to do, and is very simple.  This is the kind of mp3 player you can give to your parents or any tech-phobe and they should be able to figure out how to operate it pretty easily.    What I dislike:  -There really needs to be a hold button.  Twice now I have come back to find the device with a dead battery.  Both times I am 100% positive I did not leave it on.  It must have gotten bumped while on my desk or something and turned itself on.  This is extremely irritating as I usually notice it's dead when I'm not near a computer to plug it in and where I was depending on the device to provide some entertainment.  A hold button that locks the device in "off" mode would solve this issue easily.  -The only way you can charge it, without buying an adapter, is through your USB port.  This normally wouldn't be an issue for me, but right now I'm moving between houses and don't have my computer set up, so this has been a big drag.  Because of this, I had planned to use this device mostly with my work computer, but that has caused issues that are explained below.  -I wish the shuffle feature stayed within a folder, instead of choosing songs from random folders.  To me, the whole point of organizing the music into folders it to divide up genres so you can listen to what you are in the mood for.  And with a device with a small amount of memory, you are mostly going to listen on shuffle mode so you don't get bored.  I like to listen to loud, fast music for certain activities, and softer stuff for others.  It sucks that when you put the device on shuffle you may go from one extreme to another.  I wish there was a toggle to either let the shuffle mode roam over all the folders, or stay inside the one you are in.  -My biggest issue with this device, and the reason I knocked it down a star is that it will not work at all on my computer at the office.  The device shows up in My Computer, but when you click on it, windows hangs.  I'm using XP Service Pack 2.  The stone also comes up in the device manager, and I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it several times, installed the optional driver/software from Zen, and read all the support documentation on Creative's website and cannot find any suggestions that get this device to work on this computer.  I have plugged it into three other computers and it has worked fine.  I am pretty savvy when it comes to computers and have used all kinds of different USB devices on my office computer w/no problem.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why it refuses to work on this computer.  Even just having it plugged in to charge will cause the OS to randomly lock up and sometimes crash so I have to reboot.  And if I reboot with the device plugged in, windows won't even load, like there's a new master disk plugged in.  It is really annoying, and frankly disappointing, because I purchased the device solely to use with this computer.    Overall though, it's a good little player and I don't regret the purchase.  There are just a few things that I think could be smoother.  But for the price it's a great deal.  With the exception of my isolated computer issue with it, it's extremely simple to use.  A lot of these smaller flash mp3 players are ridiculously too complicated to use - it's like they are trying to make up for not being an iPod by having all these different "features" and "modes".  But really you just want to click play and get going.  Creative did a good job with the design and ease of use, they just need to work out a few kinks.

<Title>Great for running
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zen Stone to use while running and it's been perfect.   -Armband: Definitely get the armband and skin when you order the player; I waited (just in case it would work with another armband I had), but the Stone needs its specific skin.   -Indicator Light: I had read other reviews complaining that the skin blocks the indicator light, which it does, so I used a hole punch to modify mine (because I'll probably never take it out of the skin) and that worked just fine.   -Sound, size, etc: The sound is great, it's easy to use, and it's tiny. It doesn't weigh much at all, so I barely notice it on my arm. 1gb is enough music to get me through any length of run. I just plug it back onto the USB charger at night, so I know I won't have any problems.   -Shuffle: The shuffle mode does tend to play several tracks in a row by the same artist, but I've yet to run across a player without that problem.   -Waterproof-ness: I tend to sweat a lot when I run, and so far that hasn't effected the player. Yesterday I ran while it was raining, and that didn't cause it to short out either (another complaint I read in reviews).   Overall, I highly recommend the the Zen Stone. Two days after mine arrived, my husband ordered one  to listen to on the train and he likes it as much as I do. He did mention that he wished it held more music. If you're not using it to work out with, maybe the 2gb model would be better.

<Title>The Way MP3 Player Should be at
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, I am the kind of person who thinks that MP3 player should be small, easy to carry because it doesn't need to become big as CD or Cassette to hold, yet it only need to have memory card to store files as a music format which is called MP3. The small, the better, you know. Therefore, what all MP3 player I have been looking for is required is to play music with low cost and be small. I have been looking at Ipod shuffle and Zen stone, and now I am happy with my decision. Pros: 1. Small, it's about same size as iPod shuffle. light weight. 2. Nice design 3. Easy interface as well as iPod shuffle. However, it has 1 more interface than iPod shuffle which is able to skip the folder, it's like you can make book mark and you don't have to skip whole lot of tracks to find what you want to listen. Once you get used to this, you will love this interface. 4. Easy to transfer files. You can use Zen stone just like regular flash memory cards, you have no regulation doing this work unlike iPod which have so many regulations that hackers had to crack iTune for freely transfer music files. In Zen stone, you don't have to worry about this issue. It's all your own and you can transfer any type of files to anywhere you want. You don't even need to use a software to transfer. With copy and paste, you can do all you want. However, it would be much easier if you use a software Creative provides on their website. It's easy and has a tool for ripping CD which is my favorite.  Cons: Only downside is it would be much better if it has a clip just like iPod shuffle. I had to buy an arm-band. Extra cost.

<Title>Could have been four stars.
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked one of these up after losing my shuffle due to it's unacceptably weak clip.  The Good  It is half the price of the shuffle.  It is very light and small although a bit bigger than the shuffle.  It looks pretty good.  You can drag and drop folders and files to the player directly from explorer.  Folder support is great so you can create folders for different moods, genres, etc.  I did not understand why the shuffle required syncing when it forced you to dump everything in one folder anyway.  The Bad  I liked that the headphones were long enough that I could keep the player in my pocket.  Unfortunately, they are the type where the right earbud is supposed to loop around the back of the head.  I prefer the earbud cords to be even length.  It does not matter though, since the headphones literally started falling apart within days.  The rubber on the buds kept falling off and you were left with piece of metal covered with tacky glue to shove in your ear.  Not fun.  I was willing to forgive the headphones though.  The major problem is despite the recessed play button and the fact that you have to hold said button in for several seconds to turn it on, I found that it repeatedly ends up turning itself on in my pocket.  So of course the battery is drained when I want to use it on the way home since it has playing music for no one all day while I work.  I would have returned it but already tossed the POS headphones.  Other issues are minor, the slow startup time and the LED flashing every few seconds while playing.  Overall, though I wanted to like this player, I can not recommend it.  Maybe if I could find a pair of headphones that allowed me to wear it as a pendant, I could use it.  Assuming the powering on is happening due to movement in my pocket(with my wallet, nothing else bouncing around)and it is not just turning on completely on its own.  My nano used to do that occasionally, even when sitting unmolested on my desk.

<Title>Good, but....
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zen stone definitely competes with the Ipod shuffle, but there are a few quirks.  Pros: -Size/Weight:  At first I was bothered by how light the stone was, made it feel sorta cheap, but the fact that I can actually have it dangle from the headphones (especially if you get the lanyard style) makes it sort of a plus.  Unfortunately, you can totally tell this thing cost creative like 5 bucks to manufacture. -COMPLETE TACTILE USAGE! This is where you pay the extra money. While the materials are cheap, the R&D department at Creative definitely thought the controls through.  You can control every part of the Zen stone without ever taking it out of your pocket.  Not sure how to explain it, but you know exactly what to press where and there is no confusion.  It even has a folder skip feature which I find really handy as I can seperate my music into folders by "mood" (gym, bus, home, etc). I just wish it would let you have more options for the repeat feature such as a single track, folder, or all songs. -Sound Quality - No EQ settings here, but I've never had any problems with distortion or lackluster sound. -That LED light, it just amazes me how much information a two tone LED light can tell you, from battery power to song transfers, to charge status, etc. -Drag n Drop - you can easily load songs and even files for transfer.  Uses a standard mini-USB plug, so if you lose the one it comes with, a replacement isnt too big a deal (I have at least 4 products that use that plug).  Good thing Creative didnt go all propriety on us.  CONS: -The repeat button (read above) -The material - the plastic scratches very easily, kinda annoying. Not that theres a screen to look at. -The Skins- my most major issue.  I have no clue what creative was thinking. Do you honestly think someone frugal enough to buy such a cheap mp3 player is gonna dish out 1/4th the price for a belt clip? c'mon Creative, we're not fools.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, but primarily cuz I got it open box at a good discount.  I would never consider this my main MP3 player, I do however, recommend it for the gym as it is excellent when you only want a handful of songs to listen to while you work out. The belt clip isnt too much an issue since its so light and would actually fit into the small "key pocket" most pocketless sport shorts have.

<Content>I bought this to listen to audio books downloaded for Windows Media Player and Overdrive through the local library  because their program does not work with i-pods.   The Creative Zen Stone player is difficult to determine what chapter you are listening to and you have no visual.   There may be several chapters located in the same folder and you can spend a lot of time trying to determine your "bookmark."  The music quality is good, just not good for audio books which was my only purpose for purchasing it.  It would be nice if Apple products could be used with the library downloadable programs.

<Content>I've had my mp3 player for a couple months now and no problems have occured. The Zen is easy to use and works great, along with sounding great. The one downside with the Zen is the battery life. They market the battery as lasting upwards of ten hours. In reality it only last about half the expected time. For the price and quality I would recommend anyone to get the Creative Zen Stone 1GB MP3 player.  
<Overall>4
