<Title>disappointing
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I tried two of these, and took both back.  Maybe BestBuy just had a bad batch, but both were defective.  It would get stuck, sound like a broken record, and I couldn't advance or go back.

<Title>Nice for what it does
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I already had a 20GB player and needed a small player that I could go running with.  It's small design makes it easy to jog with.  It can fit easily in your pocket or even around your neck.  Because it's a flash drive, it can bounce around without damaging the player.  While it doesn't hold as many songs as my other player (a little over 100 songs compared to almost 5000), it works perfect for what I wanted it to do.

<Title>AWESOME!!! BLOWN AWAY!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hi This is my first MP3 player. I decided on this unit because it allows you to record from any source via the line in jack. I bypassed using my PC and filled the T30 with Classic Rock from my CD collection. True I was not able to fit as many tracks on my player ( files not compressed) I am still very happy with it. I was able to get 53 tracks including some 9 and 10 minute cuts. I bought the Sennheiser PX 100 headphones (also 5 stars) and man I can't stop listening! The only regret is not getting the 1GB T30 but hey that is what my wish list is for! get it you will not regret it. Ps the unit require Windows XP and WMP 10

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought this tonight.  On my XP system, works great. Don't install their "software"; just plug in to a USB port and use MS Explorer (MyComputer) to transfer files.  Sound is very good. Good ergonomics on the buttons: a lock switch to prevent accidentally pressing buttons. Remembers where you where when turn back on. Voice recorder.  Runs on one AAA battery--good if you don't want to hassle with a recharger. I have no idea how long these last, tho.  I'm upgrading from a CD-based MP3 player, and I use this primarily to listen to voice files, so my expectations/ demands are not great. But all said, this is a good buy.  One thing, MS Explorer doesn't do complete file management; for instance you cannot check "disk" for errors, size, fragmentation, etc. SO this bodes for possible problems down the line if/when file errors develop on the chip.  All n' all, glad I bought it.

<Title>Doesn't work with Macs and Linux
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this gadget as a gift and been using it for couple of month now.  It works well, very light, and has a long battery life. There is only one problem - it only works with Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10. iRiver doesn't make drivers for Windows 2000, OS X, or Linux. So unless you have XP, I suggest you stay away from it.

<Title>Great sound, with several drawbacks
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On the whole, this is a very affordable, very versatile MP3 player.    There are downsides however.  For one, the US and EU versions require that you use file-transfer software to load music, and do not allow you to drag-and-drop music onto the device.  That means you generally have to use the super-clumsy Windows Media Player synchronization interface or the super-duper-unstable WinAmp portable media interface.  So, if you can, find a player that allows drag and drop media transfer.  The only other drawback I can see is the somewhat clumsy control scheme (which may just be symptomatic of smallish mp3 players).  There are 2 rows of buttons on opposite sides of the screen, and since the thing is almost completely symmetrical, it is very easy to confuse the two rows of buttons.  And even if you do manage to find the right button, they are sometimes rather difficult to press (at least for a clumsy-fingered person like myself).    Otherwise this is a wonderful little MP3 player with great sound and a very reliable (if somewhat clumsy) firmware.

<Title>I thought the iRiver T10 was great, this is amazing!!
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow, this mp3 player is amazing!! If you managed to get one during the christmas deal at Best Buy like me, you got a great deal! They gave you a 50$ gift card to Best Buy for buying it. It only costs 80$, and is a 512 MB mp3 player! It may not have FM radio function, but you bought this for mp3's not radio. You use Windows Media Player 10 to manage this. It has great design and it looks awesome! If you want an inexpensive mp3 player, that is great, and gives you a coupon for a month of free downloads at Napster To-Go, then you have to buy this one. Forget the iRiver T10, this is great!

<Title>iriver feature cutbacks
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before this one I had an iriver 899, which had lots of customizing features, allowing the user to change recording bit rate, turn the back light off, etc.  I bought this, thinking thta it may be comparable.  I am disappointed. 1.  Even though the specs page in the manual says that the recording time can go up to 18 hrs (at 32 kbps), there is NO WAY to get the recording bit rate lower than 96 kpbs.  There are just 3 settings for recording bit rate and the lowest is 96kbps.  The 899 had many different sampling rate and bit rates for recording.  Plus, on the t30 you can only record in stereo.  The result: large files which are inconvenient to email, etc. 2.  You would think they would let you turn the dang backlight OFF if you want, but you can only get it down to 3 seconds.  That wastes a lot of battery life if you don't need it on.  battery companies must be wining and dining iriver or something. 3.  There are other things on the t30 that iriver has started to cheapen, and for this reason I give the device a low rating.

<Title>A really nice player for the price!
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this little player several months ago and was a little worried about a few of the reviews I read here.  While its true it eats batteries like crazy and doesn't hold as much music as stated, it still holds quite a bit! and the convienience of having so much music easily at hand in such a small package (for me anyway) makes up for the batteries I have to keep around.  The sound is really good for the price, and I didn't have any problems figuring out how it worked or in reading the player's screen.  All in all it is definately well worth the price.

<Title>great little device
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i purchased this device about 6 months ago for one thing:  recording.  you can plug any music source into the jack and record for up to 3 hours at 320k.  i dabble in DJing and i can take an RCA to Stereo mini Y-plug directly from the mixer into the T30, bypass the computer, bypass any other interference and it sounds great.  Once the recording is finished, plug in the USB and use the explorer to drag-n-drop the files onto the computer.   i can also delte files from the player using explorer.  nothing could be easier.   the only problem i have is that it sucks the life out of batteries very quickly.  i highly recommend rechargeables.    as for the other stuff, i wouldnt use it as my regular MP3 player because it is very small, the buttons are not that intuitive, and 512 MB is really nothing to get excited about.  spend a few more dollars and get more storage.

<Title>Adorable but basic little player
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just purchased this player because the Centon that I got for Christmas turned out to be a disappointment.  But this player is light, easy to download, has good sound quality, and understandable controls.    If you want a basic MP3 player and don't need more than about 120 songs, this one is for you.  I used it to get some songs off a music website, and the rest were my favorite songs transferred from my extensive CD colletion to the player.  This makes workouts a lot more fun with only my favorite songs playing.  If, however, you want more extensive memory and do a lot recording, it would be best for you to keep looking.

<Title>Don't bother with this MP3 player!
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I consider myself a well-versed computer user and have used a few mp3 players in my time, including my current 30GB Creative Zen vision M. I purchased (2) iRiver T30 players for my daughters Christmas presents in 2006. Both Napster and iRiver expressed that these players were compatible with the Napster To Go service. I made the choice to purchase based on their compatibility and price, but I forgot the old saying, "You get what you pay for!"  I have not succeed with downloading any music into either of these players as of yet. Both have very old firmware installed and for whatever reason, will not accept the new updated firmware. And yes, I know about having to run XP with service pack 2...that is exactly what my computer is running. After contacting both iRiver 3 times and the seller 4 times, I still have not reached a satisfactory agreement for replacement. I would feel differently if only one player had issues, but both are unusable and I would never recommend this product to anyone. I would, however, recommend Creative Zen products. They are high quality, sturdy and the company stands behind everything they sell, not like other companies that hide when problems occur.

<Title>Good player for Linux �fter a lot of setup
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got �is device over �e internet. Ich now realize why �is device w�s so cheap. �e device would not upgrade to �e latest firmware advertised, would not play any of �e OGG Vorbis files ��t Ich h�d, despite it advertising �e ability, �nd w�s only available wi�e Media Transfer Protocol, instead of �e easier �nd more universal USB Mass Storage protocol. �is means using Windows Media Player 10 or greater to control �e player, which limits its ability to be used wiLinux or a Mac. Tried calling support �nd could not get a live person despite spending half a day on �e phone. �e iriver NorAmerica website's Need Help button w�s �lso not working, sending me to a 404 not found page. Makes me wonder if �ey are still in business! ** Update ** �fter spending hours on �e internet looking at solutions, Ich managed to update �e firmware by finding a Windows machine (ugh!) �nd running �e firmware updater. Instead of selecting America, which gave me a corrupted firmware, Ich selected Europe. ��at allowed me to update to �e latest MTP firmware. �fter ��t, Ich w�s able to �en use �e same firmware updater program to convert to USB Mass Storage (UMS) by selecting a new button in �e program �nd installing �e new firmware. �is allowed me to �en use �e device in Linux, �nd, �s a bonus, �e OGG Vorbis media files now worked. �erefore Ich am updating my rating to 3 STARS from one star.

<Title>wonderful player
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player refubished and it was wonderfull! It was my first mp3 player but i didn't have any problems. It arrived MUCH earlier than expected, with every thing I needed. The songs were very easy to load. All I needed to do was dowload windows media player 10 (which they provided)!The menu was very helpful and easy to acess. The player was very durable (I dropped it more than I can count) it even spent a night in the snow which put it out of commision for about a month ,but it came right back after drying out! The only things that would make this player better would be: an armband or case(it comes with a neck band), being able to make a playlist from the player ,and a radio! I am considering geting the 1GB after mine finally gave up the ghost two years later. I defintly recomend this player!
