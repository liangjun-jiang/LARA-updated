<Content>Good idea and price, if it did all the things that it promises. Mine never worked out of the box. I have heard bad reviews from others. I was forced to return it, but received a full refund. Thanks Amazon :)  cheaply made

<Content>the installation disc is 80mm so if you have a slot loading computer it wont work. Also, the websites reviewing it says it works with mac os X but I have yet to figure out how, because I went to another computer with the disc, and it only has windows drivers. But hey what did I expect for 40$. And the startup language is chinese. I like the radio feature though
