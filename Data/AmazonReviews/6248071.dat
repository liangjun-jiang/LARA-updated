<Title>Great 20GB player hampered by poor sftware and documentation
<Date>Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like many others, when my Rio Karma died and replacements were not available, I ended up shopping around and getting this player. Overall, I am very pleased with the device. It looks great, is easy to use overall, sounds great, and the pictures add to the cool factor. My only two complaints about the device itself would be that you cannot delete tracks directly from the player (you have to use software through your PC) and that scrolling through music only displays title information (not artist/album, like on the Karma). Neither of those are deal killers, but I do miss the features.   My main gripes are with the software support and documentation. The documentation is weak to start with, and not translated well into English. Some of it is indecipherable. Read it through once to get necessary tidbits, then put it aside and play with the device to figure the rest out. As for the software support, I don't like the fact that they bundled it with Napster Lite rather than either something proprietary (that worked better) or better integration with Windows Media Player 10 (WMP10). It is fairly well supported through WMP10, but it's not comprehensive. For example, it synchronizes the software well but doesn't copy or synchronize playlists -- you'll need the Napster software for that (argh!).   I did have one little problem. When I first loaded my library to the device (about 1200 songs), many of them (about 25%?) didn't load with the right genre. That is, the genre in the ID3 tag might be "Reggae" but the device would display it as "(16)." Some would load fine, others wouldn't. This was a problem with both Napster and WMP10, so I don't think it was the player directly. I tried re-entering the genre through WMP10, but it still didn't work. When I used Moosic Organizer to re-write the tags, it worked! I simply re-synced the player with WMP10 after re-entering the tag info and they all loaded just fine.   The photo album is cute, but not terribly useful. The display is large, by mobile device standards, but still small compared to your monitor, or paper pictures. Still, it's fun to have some pictures on the device to share and the display is very good, despite the size.   The device works great as an external hard drive to your PC. You need a special cable to connect the device to a PC (it's not a normal USB cable on the device end), but it functions very well and allows you to use that storage for something other than pictures and music.   Finally, the USB host feature should be very handy for people who have compatible cameras. I haven't gotten my favorite digital camera (a Sony) to work yet, but others seem just fine. I'm sure more support with come down the road.   Overall, a great little device with some nice features. Use WMP10 instead of Napster and you'll be happier. I just hope it holds up better than my Rio Karma did!

<Title>Not A Bad MP3 Player....But Could Use Some Enhancements
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I felt compelled to write a review on this MP3 player because it's just getting trashed by the public. I like most people own a Samsung cell phone & think the company produces very good products. I have an iPod & decided to get this MP3 Player because I was getting bored of my iPod. Samsung MP3 Players have been getting the worst reviews on Amazon.Com for its horrible software. Yes! It's true the software provided is horrible only for 1 reason. It's a great program except that once you rip your music from your CD's that it just doesn't transfer over to the player properly (Actually doesn't transfer at all). The program just won't recognize the Samsung player & so in return won't transfer what you just ripped from the CD. I called Samsung at the 1800 number & they said that it's been known to happen with this player that the software just won't recognize the player & that they will contact me in the future when they find a way to fix the bug. So the only way for you to transfer songs over is to use WMP (Windows Media Player). WMP is fine but it does take a tad bit long for the transfer completion & a bit tricky. I feel the Napster software provided is for COMPUTER experts & not for someone like me who just uses the computer to go AOL to chat & check emails. All in all it's not a horrible player, but would be GREAT if the software provided actually works. You can only use the program to RIP music & keep it on your computer as a Jukebox player. I give it 4 stars. I guess I'm being generous.

<Title>Great player, could be better
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great player for a decent price.  Excellent sound quality (and quite loud), great build quality, 8 hour battery life isn't bad, but could be much better.  Navigating the device is fairly straight forward, but unfortunately there are no dedicated buttons for volume adjustment.  The player has a few problems correctly displaying and reading ID3 tag information, and rarely is able to sort an album by track number.  Sometimes tracks are listed alphabetically by title, sometimes by track number, and sometimes it seems randomly listed, perhaps by filename.  The player's database also incorrectly reads the Genre field of the ID3 tags, and usually displays duplicate genres such as one being "Rap" and another being "Rap (15)" - which I could understand, if the tracks were tagged using different software, but I had this happen within one album that somehow got split between the two genres.  Also, be aware that since tracks are stored in a single folder on the device, having a track such as "01 - Artist - Intro.mp3" will prevent a song on a different album, with the same track number and title from the same artist, from transferring to the device at all.   USB host function worked flawlessly with my Canon S230 digital camera (when set from "Normal Transfer" to "P2P/Pictbridge Transfer").  Fairly large 3MP photos that were transferred, loaded quickly into the photo viewer and displayed at a "fit-to-screen" size.  I was, however, very disappointed by the "Album Cover" feature - album cover art cannot be displayed from the "Now Playing" screen, like the Toshiba Gigabeat F-Series & iPod Photo, but instead must be assembled into a slide-show using the provided software, that links the album cover with existing MP3s on the device.  The finished slide-show album is then accessible only from the Photo/Slide-show section of the device, which therefore removes the functionality of sorting albums and skipping tracks within an album.  This feature could have been implemented much better, with tighter integration into the normal audio section of the device, and roughly 50% of the slide-show albums I made wouldn't even play at all.  However, regular photo viewing worked extremely well and photos resized with the provided software looked fairly decent on the small screen.  Other features, such as the EQ worked rather well, but sound quality was better (and louder) with the EQ turned off.  I have not used the MIC and Line-In MP3 encoder, or A-B repeat yet, but it seems that this function might be nice for students that wish to record a lecture, and later transcribe it.  Although the package is clearly labeled "XP Only", the device worked just fine on Windows 2000 Pro (SP4).  The suggested method of song transfer is the included Napster software, which worked just fine once I upgraded to their newest version.  Overall, Napster is a bulky music management solution that is very slow at transferring songs, and requires that you create a free account with the company and be online anytime you wish to use it.  I quickly uninstalled Napster, and now use the non-U.S. version of Samsung's "Music Studio" (not included) which is similar, but more streamlined and works somewhat like Winamp.  Windows Media Player is also suggested for transferring songs, though my 9 series insisted on converting existing MP3s into WMVs before transferring to the device.  The WMVs did play just fine, and I'm assuming XP's 10 series would handle MP3s much better.  Hopefully, once the U.S. 1.0 firmware is released, they may or may not have addressed some of the issues in the devices functionality.  Also, be sure to note, that no carrying case is provided, and currently only Noreve makes a case (though somewhat expensive) that properly fits this particular model.  So while this device is extremely capable of being an excellent DAP, time will tell, if Samsung's upcoming firmware will make use of its potential.  I'd also like to suggest comparing this player to Toshiba's Gigabeat F20 and F21, Samsung's upcoming YH-J70, and Mobiblu's VMP3 DVH-100 (if they are ever released for sale in the United States).

<Title>Don't Do It! You Will Waste Your Money
<Date>Sat May 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product is simply not ready for prime time.  It's an expensive piece hardware that delivers little for the money other than sheer frustration!  The reasons are as follows:  -  In order to transfer music to it you have to sign up with Napster.  What a complete MESS!  Samsung has every right to use proprietary software, but they have a duty to make it workable without requiring a sign up over the Internet with a propritary  seller of songs.  I would NEVER have bought this had I known the extent of the interconnection required to operate basic player features.    -  There are far better players, at far less cost, that simply let you drag and drop your music from the hard drive of your computer to the player without all the excessive work of this Samsung model.  Napster software constantly reported that it needed to stop Windows Media Player when WMP was not running!  I even downloaded the latest version of Napster software - that only made it worse!  When I finally gave up, I did a registry clean-up and there where over 100 corrupt registry entries from Napster and Samsung software.  -  The mass storage device software is very poor.  I have other removeable mass storage devices, from various makers, and they work just fine right out of the box!  This one is more than useless.  It's also slow, slow, slow, slow.  It often takes up to a minute for the system to recognize it, if at all (that happened several times); a system with plenty of memory to spare (over 512 meg of memory), and in excess of 2g speed.  -  The device is so "touchy" that it lost it's file system at least four times and I had to use the provided repair utility to get it to work again.  It took me several times to get the repair utility to work.  -  I have over 2 decades experience with computer hardware and software.  I spent well over 15 hours trying to get this to work properly.  It is not plug-and-play by ANY means.   This device suffers badly from very poor proprietary software that simply fights with the Windows operating system at every step.  Samsung puts out some good products, but this one goes to the very bottom of the pile.

<Title>Napster not required to transfer music
<Date>Tue May 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this player for just over two weeks now and have found it easy to use. Unlike what some other reviewers have said, the Napster software is not a must if you want to transfer music to this player. Windows Media Player 10 works just fine. The product manual from Samsung seems to be the cause of the confusion, since it does not do a good job of explaining this. Although the manual gives detailed instructions on how to sign up and use Napster to transfer music, it does not provide any details on how to use WMP 10. You can import your music into WMP 10 and use the Sync feature to upload music into this player - it works just fine.   The player supports Secure WMA and the line-in recording feature is useful to have, if you want to digitize music from your tape and LP collection. I have not yet attempted to import Playlists into the player via WMP 10, though but I have read at least one other review on this site that states that you need the Napster software to import playlists. Assuming this to be a limitation of the product (and not of WMP 10), it still deserves 4 stars, as the sound is excellent and overall, the product appears to be easy to use.

<Title>Samsung Takes On Ipod
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>About a month ago I bought the ipod 60gig photo with all the accessories; this set me back over five hundred bucks. I bought it because everyone told me it was the best on the market. I must congratulate Apple on making a piece of garbage! Plain and simple. Couple with iTunes and I rest my case. Today I bought the Samsung YH-925GS. I Love it. Clear crisp sound, no distortion at high levels, SRS and WOW capabilities, all of which Apple have omitted from their gadget. Don't believe what the manual that came with the Samsung about having to use Napster to transfer music, you can use Windows Media 10 and Musicmatch, the latter being the simplest! One criticsm. I use, or am trying to use Napster to Go. But right now the unit does not support it and Napster are waiting for a firmware update. Nothing on the box to indicate this, nothing on the website. Apart from that....flawless...buy one!

<Title>Great player for the money
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought the player about a month ago, and am satisfied so far.   Some of my main points are: - Works fine with WMP10. You DO NOT have to use Napster to use this player, although the documentation that comes with it makes it appear that you do. I have had no issues, other than playlists, using media player to manage my music. - Only music db issue are tags with my music. It will display track name, artist and album fine, but for some reason, genre is a mess. No matter what I try, I can't get a clean genre list. - Sounds is fantastic, buttons well laid out, and have a clean slick look to it. - Searching through your music is easy, and shuffle seems fine so far. My only complaint there is that is will not remember what has already been played if you shut the player off and come back later, but that is a fairly minor complaint. - It is sturdy. Have already dropped it six feet onto concrete, and other than a nasty ding on a corner, it functions perfectly. - Interfaces flawlessly with my Nikon D70, but you can only download one picture at a time - which sucks if I need to empty my 1gig card, but nobody else does it better from what i have read. - Battery life is definitely not the advertised 10 hours. I would guess more like 6.  My bottom line: Needing Windows XP, the lack of drag and drop and the mess with id tags are the reasons I give it a 4 instead of 5. But, for $100 less than a comparable mp3 player, I can live with that.

<Title>It gets the job done
<Date>Sun Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchase one of these Samsung digital audio players for use on frequent airplane trips.  It has both strong and weak points, the greatest strength being excellent sound, the weakest being the questionable relationship with Napster.  I would concur the those reviewers which made the following observations:  - USB adapter connexion to the cord is a bit tricky, make certain the cord end has been pushed in firmly. - Napster software is quite annoying, and there is no need if you have WMP 10, just synchronize "all music" and you are done. - Napster software requires a continuous internet connexion while in use, which I view as a distasteful personal intrusion. - Playlists are quite a disappointment given none of the WMP playlists may be transferred, thereby leaving only the "mobile playlist" as the sole list. - The sound is superb when used in conjunction with reasonable headphones (I happen to be fortunate enough to have Bose ANR units)  Having researched any number of digital audio players, I would say the Samsung YH-925GS is an excellent one and does not require a PhD to use (once you figure out to avoid Napster and go directly to Windows Media Player).  It DOES have its bothersome quirks, but don't they all.

<Title>Super-great ideas, but ironic quirks aren't worth it
<Date>Sun Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this model for its unique features, but will be returning it to the store today.  Samsung had some good ideas. > USB hosting > crisp mic recording > Line-in that doesn't require a cradle.  Then they decided to implement a Napster interface. Not intuitive, guys.  You can use Window Media Player 10 instead... but that sucks too. Neither of them make it easy to change track, album, artist, or genre information... THEY WONT EVEN SHOW THE RECORDINGS YOU MADE WITH THE YEPP.  RealPlayer lets you see your recordings, but you can't play them (yet), nor can you modify track info.  To alter track info, you have to export the files to your computer, modify (e.g., right click in My Computer, "Properties"), then send them back to your player via WMP10/Naps***.  Bull$#*^.  The USB hosting only works for a dozen digital cameras (3 or 4 brands), and my Sony cameras aren't on the list. It doesn't seem to work with any other type of USB device either, such as USB flash drives. I understand that if your camera will sinc, you can only download one picture at a time. I want more flexibility than that.  Just think... you're on a trip w/o a laptop, you need to download your pictures to take more... but you can only do it one at a time.  WTF.  After you install a driver, Yepp does work well as an external hard drive.  It provides good volume.  Some distortion was noticed when using equilizer options. Without EQ, quality is just fine.  You can record audio from any source with the Line-In.  All you need is a headphone jack to plug into.  I've recorded comedy stand-up shows from TV and music tracks from movies (you can adjust the incoming volume to whatever you want, thereby undoing the muting they have on DVD's).  It allowed me to pause the recordings so as to get rid of commercial segments.    The mic works very well. You can be on the other side of the room and it will pick up the audio distinctly, even if faint.  It picks up high- and low- range sounds.  I'm impressed. But again, renaming the files is a task.  When you delete the old files, they will continue to show up in your player's listings. You'll end up with a hundred entries of "Voice 00## removed" in your library. It becomes very annoying.  Almost as annoying as it's cumbersome power/USB cord.   This Yepp COULD have been a great product, but the quirks just drive you nuts.  With sadness, I'll now return it to the store.

<Title>Craptastic
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought this as inexpensive alternative to Ipod Photo.  Now wishing I had just paid the extra bucks upfront, as I will likely end up paying MORE in the long run). First, (for anyone considering this over Ipod Photo, like I did), the LCD screen isn't very good for picture viewing due to low resolution.  The average cheapo digicam LCD is much better than this.  This LCD is more on par with a mediocre color cell-phone display.  The Ipod photo screen is sharper and obviously superior.  Despite the screen quality difference, I still decided to go with this player because it was roughly $80 cheaper after rebates and savings. Sound quality is actually pretty good, and the included earbuds aren't bad.  Sound is loud and crisp, as long as you leave it alone.  Any tweaking of the included EQ introduces too much noticeable distortion.  Barely a month after purchase, the hard drive gave out.  It wouldn't recognize anything over 3GB.  Called Samsung, received a repair authorization and sent it to a repair facility in Jersey (shipping was our responsibility).  Turnaround time was about a week or so and they replaced the hard drive.  After receiving the unit back, we noticed during the FIRST use that the battery dropped to about half of its normal capacity (gave out after three or so hours of continuous play).  Called Samsung again, got another repair authorization, and was again advised that shipping would be OUR responsibility.  however.... I'm strongly considering using the product replacement plan that I (THANKFULLY!) purchased with the unit and just getting something more reliable.  I might have gotten a lemon, but I have to call it based on my experience which, as you see, isn't even worth the one star I was forced to give it.

<Title>Despite compatability issues and poor battery life, excellent
<Date>Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Alright, it's the 21st century now. It's getting to the point where portable CD players are nice...but are so 20th century. I decided I needed a less-bulky and nicer portable audio device. Searching around Best Buy, I came across this. Let me tell you, the iPod is probably the most overrated portable electronics device ever.  Okay, first off by reading the 1-star or 2-star amazon.com reviews, many of them are either unfair or haven't given it a chance/didn't read directions.  Okay, I've heard A LOT about Napster software. For starters, which is a dissappointment, If you don't have Windows XP, go back to the search engine, because it's only compatable with XP. Macs don't count. Maybe, not guarrantee this, but maybe it will work on Windows ME. Not 100% sure, but all stores have a money-back guarantee...right? Also, it's not JUST compatable with Napster. Just because it says Napster on the box and player, does that mean ONLY Napster? No. It's also compatable with Windows Media Player 10, and I've also heard some people got it to work well with RealPlayer. Napster isn't the ONLY software compatable with this player.  For features, it has way more features than the standard, or even photo iPod. First off, yes, it has a built-in digital camera. The pictures aren't crystal clear, but I have a digital camera to do this for me. The pictures are fair to good, but don't get this just for the camera.  What you should get this for is for the wondeful MP3 player/organizer, radio, and MP3 recorder (both line-out and microphone). First off, the menus and organizing is unbelieveable. The menu has a few options, then those options have options, and so on. Example, if you click Music, you have artist, album, genre, song. Then, one you get into the organizer, if you click on a song, it will show up in "Now Playing". It would be better if it had a button to go back to the main menu, but it's only a minor problem. The FM tuner was better than expected and actually better than most portable radios out there. The microphone was also a great feature, and recorded voice very clearly. There is also a line-out to hook up the player to a set of speakers. If you need a car adapter, a lot of electronics stores sell cassette adapters for only about $10. The line-out also lets you record to another audio device. (Example: You can connect the TV to the MP3 player and the player will record the TV.)  The MP3 player holds around 5,000 songs on the MP3 format at around 192 kb/s. Personally, I use 128, so I have about a hundred extra. It depends on how much quality you want out of your tunes. If you want so-so sounding, you'll get more than 5,000, and if you want high quality, it will likely be less. And, it also supports WMA files, so then you'll have far more than 5,000 songs.  The sound quality is excellent. The player features presets for the equalizer, similar to the one in WMP, without the distortation. It also features a 3D equalizer, which many companys (Samsung, Panasonic, RCA) have been doing with their audio products as well. The MP3 player will power most, and about all headphones.  The LCD is in fact proven to be colored, and it is very sharp. It is 1.8 inches, which is equivalent or bigger to the size of an iPod screen. Some players like the Rio Karma have gigantic screens; though, the look is very unappealing. The player also allows you to view your own photos, or the album art. Or, you can look at the headphones, which to me gets hilarious after a few looks.  The biggest dissappointment is battery life. Ten ohurs may seem long, but in reality, not really. Most MP3 players have around 15-20 hours of battery. Though, this isn't much of a gripe for the non-travelers.  Also, the USB 2.0 was nice of Samsung; giving us the best cable link from the MP3 player to the computer.  Overall, unless you don't have Windows XP, and aren't a serious traveler, the YH925GS kicks the iPod in the trash. Well, you would throw away an iPod, right?

<Title>Cool but Quirky
<Date>Thu Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Hardware look and feel is very polished, cooler than ipod, nice form factor and audio recording features not found on ipod.  But software is quirky.  Out of the box had to do a firmware upgrade over the net, and I mistakenly unplugged USB at the wrong time and hosed the drive and had to start over again, though had a similar experience with ipod too.  One major annoyance is though it looks like a drive to Windows when you plug it in to the USB port, if you drag and drop MP3 folders over to it, they are stored but will not be recognized by the player, and wont play.  Only files transferred with the sync from WMP or Napster will play.  This is very annoying if you already have a large collection of MP3 folders and arent too interested in purchasing online right away.  Another annoyance is it will only sync to one PC, if you sync it on a different PC, it may delete all the files!! This kind of fascist copy protection scheme is going too far, imho.  Another major annoyance is the Napster signup, the default is to bill you 9.95 a month!  It wasnt clear to me I had signed up for automatic billing till I got the bill.  Sneaky!  Napster has an 'all-you-can-eat' option for downloading given a fixed monthly subscription, but the fine print says if you ever stop subscribing then all the files you downloaded become unplayable!!  What an amazing 'innovation' that is!! Is this progress?  I think not.  As far as the WMP interface, it works pretty good, though if I edit track genre info on WMP doesnt get updated to device, have to format hard drive and reload all songs apparently, to update new WMP genre changes.   Overall the quirkiness is marginally acceptable, a little more than what I would expect for the third generation or so of this technology, e.g. it still reminds me of the early generation PDA quirks.

<Title>The Perfect Derivative; the Perfect Successor
<Date>Wed Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In concurrence with the previous opinion given by the reviewer from Tuscon, I'd also have to assert that a great deal of the negative reports on the Samsung's quality are products of poor use or sheer dissemblance to the iPod. Make no mistake: the Samsung could still use a bit of improvement in the ease-of-use (mostly with the device itself rather than its music transfer capabilities) and compatablity departments, but it blows iPod out of the water so far as versatility, display quality, and overall attractiveness are concerned.   In terms of display, the Samsung offers a sizeable display along with brilliant color to more-than-accomodate it. However, whether one would find the color display of the Samsung or the color display of the new fourth-generation iPods is - I'd have to say - largely a matter of personal taste (as I own both devices): on the one hand, while the Samsung indeed offers a colorful and playful display, the iPod's new display - while less flashy - is...well, less flashy. In other words, if attractive simplicity is what you'd prefer, then perhaps the iPod is your ticket, but the Samsung still offers more than simply its impressive artwork, or even the per se attractiveness of the actual device.  The photo album/slideshow feature is also innovative and equally attractive, and uploading them in a cinch. In fact, uploading in general - contrary to some reports - is a cinch, though the same can't really be said for managing the device in other respects. The playlists can be somewhat intransigent at times in terms of their organisation.   Of course, one of the greatest stigma for those who find themselves considering whether it is safe to jump off the iPod bandwagon to switch to a PC-grounded or alternative player is the issue of not being able to take advantage of the myriad of accesories that now exist in the market for the iPod and don't yet exist on such a scale for even the most popular of alternative devices. Now if you're looking for an mp3 player that will serve more as portable stereo of sorts or a room-studio hub, then, again, perhaps the iPod is indeed your ticket. But if you're looking for an mp3 player that serves its purpose best as...an mp3 player, than you've found a superior one in the Samsung YH-925.

<Content>I am a bit baffles by some of the negative reviews (Especially the one that said the digital camera in the device sucked. It doesn't have one!). The only negative that I can say about this device is that it is slow to boot up when you turn it on, and slow to shut down. The display is vibrant, intensely colorful, and clear. Volume is easy to adjust and the menu system couldn't be much simpler. I had figured out all the operations and menu system 5 minutes after it came out of the box (without using the manual). Sound quality is sharp and clear, and volume leels are excellent. Transferring songs and photos is a breeze. The unit is sleek and feels good in the hand. The satin aluminum case surrounds a solidly-built device. Overall, I am very pleased with the player.

<Content>I've read all the reviews about how inconvenient it is to load music to this player using WMP and Napster. You don't have to go this route though.  This player will function as a drag and drop if you do two simple things. 1: Change the windows settings to show hidden files. Then click on the device and open the music folder in the device. You'll see all the songs you have loaded in there. From there just drag and drop all your new songs right in the folder.  2: After this is done use the utility suite that came with the player to 'rebuild your library'. In doing so, the software will have your device recognize all the music you just dragged and dropped into the player. It's a little easier than syncing.  As for the 4 stars rather than 5, well....as far as I can tell the napster program is the only way to create playlists for the player. This coupled with the lack of accessories and all the searchability issues when you begin to compile quite a bit of music on the player are far from ideal. However, I've owned one since about 3 weeks after it was released and I am very satisfied with it. Never had any problems at all.  Hopefully when they release a general firmware update to it they take some of these issues into consideration.  Also, apparently (though I've never checked it out myself) the Samsung Music Studio program works wonders with this player as well. If anyone has access to this software, I'd love to hear your take on it.

<Title>Battery life shocker!
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After only having this mp3 player for a year, I'm ready to throw it in the bin. I could not even sell this piece of junk second hand, as it would be unfair to whoever was suckered into the purchase.  Looks-wise, sound quality and features, this is a top-class mp3 player, but the battery life is the worst I've ever experienced in any item of electronic equipment. Even after carefully nursing the battery to make sure that it was usually charged from completely flat, the player will now only work for about 90 minutes before switching itself off with a low battery warning. Even worse is that it immediately displays the warning and shuts down if you press any off the buttons while the unit is playing under battery power. The only way to make any use of the thing whatsoever, is to leave it permanently set to shuffle all tracks, thereby avoiding touching any of the buttons.  I'm incredibly disappointed in what I had always thought to be a solid, reliable brand. I don't think I'll be buying any other Samsung products in a hurry.

<Content>It is beautiful mp3 player.  Looks special and different from a typical Ipod.   Tons of memory; smaller than 20 GB Ipod.  Easy controls, colorful display, cool USB host feature. Con: bad battery life.    Great price!

<Title>CRAPPY!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Initially I loved this item. But as time went on the love faded, really fast. After a few months the battery life became less and less. I initially purchsed this to record my lectures, and it did a fantastic job, for a while. Then after a year of having it the internal flash stopped working. This made it completely inoperable because I wasn't able to access the various functions. I called Samsung customer service and they were not helpful at all. This is the last Samsung item I will ever buy. I didn't want to give this thing one star, if I could I would give it negative stars for wasting my time and hard earned money.
