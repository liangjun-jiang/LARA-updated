<Content>This player has major defects in it. Don't Buy this !  PROS: Nice Looking, Neck Strap, 7 LED Colors, Graphic Options, 5 Gig Storage, In line recordings.  CONS: Very Hard Navigation, USB charging, Software Gliches, Corruts all music files after few plays, Skips while it plays, 8 hours battery life (creative says its 16), very hard to reset, takes 4 hours to recharge to full battery, only 60 days tech support...after that you pay $25 for repair even under 1yr product warranty, and unhelpful tech people.  Save yourself and don't buy this.......  I bought it and wasted my money.

<Content>This is a great little mp3 player if you want to save yourself some money over the ipod or zune.  It holds more than you would ever need and the battery lasts forever.  Its a little hard to navigate at times but has a full fm radio and voice recorder.  I use it every day for a little over and hour on my way to and home from work.  I only need to charge it once a month at that rate of usage.    The creative software is also very useful and has some great tools for keeping your music library sorted.  The only down side in my opinion is it is confusing to navigate when you first get it and sometimes can take a while to charge to full (hour or so).   But if you want to save yourself a buck and only need an mp3 player for working out or driving this is the way to go.
