<Title>Flakey piece of junk

<Content>I picked up this player because I found it for a great price.  I should have known that there was a reason it was so cheap.   The rocker on the bottom is really flimsey and feels very cheap.  When using it to fast forward an audio file it will often stop fast forwarding and skip to the next track.  I typically listen to podcasts on the player, many of them are 30 to 60 minutes long so it's important to be able to fast forward reliably for those times that...  It reboots when it's powered on and makes contact with nearly anything metal.  If I'm listening to something and the case bumps something metal (sometimes plastic will do it too) the player reboots.  Typically this happens when I'm in a grocery store and the player bumps the cart.  I thought I'd solve the problem by droping the player into my shirt (it comes with a necklace-headphone-dangely-thingy).  Unfortunately it will reboot if it makes contact through my shirt too.  I have to assume this has something to do with static discharge.  Twice now it has caused my computer to crash.  I will plug in the USB cable and the instant it makes contact with the  MP3 player my laptop immediately turns off.  Makes me nervous to plug it in to add content.  Also, it only supports a single level of directories.  That means if you have your music arranged in album folders under your artist folders you will have to move all your songs into the artist folder or copy each individual album over to the player.  By default Windows Media Player copies it over as Artist\Album so the player can't read any of the songs.  Combine that with the 99 files per directory limitation and it's a fatal flaw.
