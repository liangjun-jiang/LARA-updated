<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is not a review, just a heads up to let everyone know a new 2GB Shuffle is coming out near Mid-March of 2008, at a cost of about $70.  You will get 1GB extra for only $20 more.

<Title>Small mp3 big sound and clarity
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have avoided buying ipod's because of the price associated.  But now that I have broken down and purchased one I am pleased to say I was impressed.  This shuffle has powerful sound, without becoming distorted.  The battery lasts for mine about 4 1/2 hours and charges like a snap.  The mp3 player keeps where you left off if you suddenly have to turn it off, the player goes into pause if the headphones are unplugged, and the clip is extremely strong.  I ran on a track with this clipped to the end of my sleeve and it did not even move.  The only down side is that the headphone are not ear buds or wrap arounds, but that is just personal preference.  Even at this price I would recommend buying it, there is just not another mp3 that is better than a shuffle in this small of a package that does not have any design or software problems.

<Title>It's stupid but I LOVE it
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok, when Apple offered an ipod with no screen, where the songs are offered to you randomly, I thought - this is so DUMB.  Then I tried it.  Now my Nano and Classic 80 just sit gathering dust.  This device is so small and light and sounds great, and hey I just use iTunes to keep my current play-list on it.  If I don't feel like listening to a particular song, I just hit "skip".  IMPORTANT:  The sound can be a little lightweight unless you use earphones that have substantial bass.  I upgraded to earphones by Westone.  Awesome match with the Shuffle.

<Title>functional once u get past the setup
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So I buy the shuffle because it is wicked small, figure it will have the same simple drag and drop setup that the ipod has. Well, i come to find that loading music is pretty annoying, and slow. Music has to link up to the music loaded on you iTunes library which is annoying if i move some of the music around. when I want to delete music from the device agian, its easier to write down what songs you want to delete because doing it one by one will take far too long.  The device works fine, as would be expected from an apple product, but in comparison to what I'm already used to (iPod) the loading and unloading process is slower and as a result annoying. Other than that, once its good to go, its great for working out, small, practically weight less, unobtrusive. If there was another procut out there that was just as small , i would probably not get the ipod, but given that there isnt one as small, ill have to stick to this one for now.

<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first iPod and I am enjoying the heck out of it!  It's easy - easy - easy.   Next purchase will be to upgrade the ear buds for a bit more comfort.  Sound is very good.  Having a soundtrack for daily life...priceless.

<Title>Great
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great for what it is. No screen, so you have to arrange things the way you want them before you upload. It bookmarks tracks where you left off, which is perfect for listening to podcasts or books on tape, which is what I use it for. Great gadget for the price.

<Title>Listen to audio books, too
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this little guy - I listen to music only sparingly, mostly I listen to audio books - I had no problem downloading from Audible - one thing to be aware of, though - it is cheaper to purchase books through Audible than ITunes. Audible has directions on their site that tell you how to purchase from them and still download through ITunes.

<Content>This product has been a great buy for me.  I use it for long distance running.  It's tiny, it clips on to anything (and doesn't fall off), it's got great sound quality and it's easy to use.  So far I've had absolutely no problems with it.

<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Quit working after only 4 months!  While it comes with a 1-year warranty, you have to pay $30 shipping to get a replacement.  Four months is a pathetically short lifespan!

<Title>Satisfied though wish for better earbuds
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for use at the gym. I clip it on my collar, and it's fine, stays there, does what it should. This is my big leap into the 21st century, so I'm still adjusting. I haven't timed it, but I don't know if the battery stays charged for as long as it claims. It's still good. My only beef is with the earbuds. They're of good sound quality, maybe too much bass, but that's a small quibble. I just wish they stayed in place while I'm running. I find myself adjusting them a lot, and when I sweat, they just pop right out. I wound up  buying some other clip-ons this week. Still, worth it to me.

<Title>More bang for your buck
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I was hesitant to buy the shuffle, am I selling myself short, Will I miss the video feature of a full-size iPod? The only thing I have been disappointed about this product is the fact that I bought the silver one just two months before the purple one came out. This ipod is great for working-out and traveling, the other ipods are too bulky for these activities. I take it everywhere with me.  I LOVE IT! Now if they can just stick more memory into that tiny little body.

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - A steep price for a starter MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The third generation of the iPod Shuffle is similar to the second.  It's a great MP3 player for working out or running, especially if you are a die-hard Apple fan.  However, the steep price means you had better review all your options before you choose this.  Pros - Small size - Nice case design - Many color options - Highly durable player - Apple reputation  Cons - High price point - Less durable shell - Proprietary dock for syncing - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability - iTunes software with limited formats (MP3, AAC) - Competing products offer more capacity for less $$  The Form Factor  This little guy is small!  The body has a spring loaded clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt without any extra case.  Apple added a few extra color options, including the popular purple.  It comes in a composite case. The 2nd generation's case seemed a little bit more durable.  The basic controls remain the same (fast forward, rewind, pause, and play) to access your music collection.  There is a headphone jack which you also use to mount this on the sync dock.  A standard USB B port would have been preferable to this as well.  Storage Capacity  Apple made it available only in 1GB sizes, same as the 2nd generation.  It would have made more sense to bump it up to at least 2GB.  The competing Zen Stone Plus by Creative offers 2GB (twice the songs), an FM tuner and the ability to see song titles for less money.  Sandisk also has some lower capacity Sansa models at similar price points.

Even with the new player composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse.  Software  When you only have 1GB to fill, having to use iTunes software to do it seems excessive.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $65.  Sandisk Sansa has similarly priced models.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.  Overall this is a good player at a price that could be less.  Weigh your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Enjoy!!!
