<Title>Great for audio books too
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I listen to digital audio books when I'm traveling and my old Pocket PC was painfully slow to load new book files.  The iPod photo USB 2.0 file tranfer rates are fantastic, the sound quality is great and the interface better than my pocket PC.  Getting the iPod to work with Audible.com was no problem.  Since I have a Windows PC I use iTunes (free) for automatically moving my audio files, copying my CD music collection (fast!) and family photos to the iPod.  The color and fonts on the iPod photo are better for my aging eyes.  No extra software is needed - read the manual.  I love the iPod photo and use it every day.

<Title>Look at the alternatives
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife bought me one of these for Christmas. Even though I count two Macs among my computer collection, I had her return it, unopened.  Yes, the iPod has a great UI. Yes, it's cute looking. But it has several flaws that, combined with its premium price, make it unacceptable in my opinion:  1. The battery is not user-replaceable. Li-ion batteries have a notoriously short cycle-life. Why pay for a new unit or an expensive repair when so many other portable digital music players use cheap, generic, user-replaceable AA and AAA batteries?  2. The iPod does not support my preferred audio format: Ogg Vorbis. I consider it unacceptable to lock myself into a proprietary, patent-encumbered format like AAC that no one else but Apple supports when a free and completely open alternative exists that is either just as good or even better.   Sure, a few people have reportedly managed to hack the iPod to handle Ogg Vorbis, but why bother when again there are competitive products on the market that already do what you want? As a consumer, the only way you can possibly influence a company's direction is to take your business elsewhere. Why send Apple the wrong message?  If Apple adds Ogg Vorbis support to the iPod, I might buy one even if the battery still isn't user-replaceable. Until then, I'll continue to use my iRiver IFP-390T flash player. Sure, it can't hold much, but it's much smaller, lighter and cheaper than an iPod, runs on a single AA battery, and I can quickly load it with several hours of Ogg Vorbis-format music from my laptop.

<Title>More applause for Apple's iPod Photo
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife and I share our MP3 players and this one now brings us up to 4 or 5 we've been through.  This one is by far the best, and that includes experience with an iPod Mini just last year (which is still going strong).  Interestingly, we didn't buy it for the photo features. I bought it because we were frustrated waiting for our local dealers to get the 40GB iPod back in stock.  We decided to upgrade from the mini back before Christmas because we were tired of swapping music off and on it's puny (ha, can't believe a year ago I thought it was huge) 4GB hard drive.  It's a champ and we're still debating if we should actually sell it now....but onto the iPod Photo.  The two negative themes I have read over and over again about this unit is the pricing and the poor integration of the photo capabilities in the iTunes software.  Well the integration is poor.  You do need another piece of software to organize your photos and then the key piece for loading it is buried as an option in iTunes.  Tonight however, I did try loading some of my photos and it worked very smoothly.  And despite the potential software integration issues I had a couple hundred photos on it loaded on it withing about 5 minutes.  Within the next 5 minutes I had it plugged into my TV dazzling my family with a slideshow and one of my daughters favorite playlists as background music playing through the TV as well.  Slick!  It will be interesting to see how much I and my family actually use this feature.  I have been concerned with what I should do with all of my family's digital pictures, the photo albums seem...well...so yesterday.  And have you tried printing a stack of 20 photos on your home printer?  I've got better things to do...  As for music, it does that too with typical iPod style and grace, but even better.  The click wheel seems to operate even more smoothly and navigating the menus is faster.  A big plus is the vibrant and crisp display.  The bigger and higher resolution screen is much easier to read (especially for those of us wading into bifocal territory).  The battery also gets a boost with a runtime north of 15 hours.  Of course the 40GB disk is very nice to have.  I look forward to moving even more of my music collection onto it.  For the same money you can also get one of the new Personal Media Centers by Creative Labs or Archos (and I'm sure many others).  Those may be highly worthwhile depending on your needs (I would have loved one when I used to commute via train), but you need to factor in the cost of your time to record and load the media.  I have spent some time this past year also playing with PC based TV tuners and capturing digital video.  It hasn't quite evolved to be the simple and smooth experience the iPod and iTunes have become.  My wife and kids aren't as enthusiastic nor as patient as I am.  After my experiences with other digital media I was pretty confident a portable media center would collect dust in my house.  To wrap this up, I highly recommend the iPod Photo as an MP3 player--despite the $500 price--and the fact that it displays photos is just icing on the cake.

<Title>To photo or not to photo - worth the extra $100?  DEPENDS!
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The big question with the 40 gb iPod photo is whether to get it or the regular b&w 40gb iPod.  The price difference, around $100, requires justification.  Is the color screen and whirligig pizazz worth the cost?  Well, it isn't just the color screen, improved battery life, or ability to view pictures that you're getting with that $100.  The iPod photo comes with hardware extras that you don't get with the regular iPod.  These include:   - Case with belt clip  - Docking station  - Firewire *AND* USB cables  - Cable to hook up the iPod photo to your TV  When you can spend up to $20 for a USB cable in a store, having one right in the box is convenient.  And if you add in the dock and the case, you've already found out where a chunk of that $100 is going.  The color screen has nice brightness and the pics add a niftiness factor; the new generations of iPods will all have color screens, so if you get a b&w now you may regret it later when your iPod starts looking "old".  "Grandma, why is your iPod gray?"  In the end, I decided the upgrade to the iPod photo was worth the price, considering how much I was already going to pay for a regular iPod.  It's like choosing a Lexus over a Camry.  If you can afford to splurge, why not go for the better model?  Also, despite what another reviewer said, you don't need a special program like Adobe Elements to import photos.  In iTunes you can import them straight from a folder.  The programs mentioned in the other reviews make it arguably easier to sync a photo collection or create "albums", but they aren't necessary.  My iPod works just fine without them.

<Title>Here is the latest news about iPod photo
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>**** LATEST update to iPod family **** - iPod & iPod photo lines merged; no more iPod photo 30 GB - iPod comes in two capacities - 20 GB ($299), 60 GB ($399) with color screen & photo support - U2 iPod (20 GB) down to $329 from $349 - with color screen & photo support - iPod shuffle 1 GB down to $129 from $149 - iPod 60 GB down to $399 from $449 - new version of iTunes (4.9) that support podcasts *************************************** Today (23 Feb 2005), Apple announced a major change in its iPod lineup and here is how it affects iPod photo models: > iPod 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 30 GB (new product) replaces the 40 GB iPod photo and the regular iPod 40 GB  > iPod photo 60 GB now costs $150 less -- $449 instead of $599  > iPod photo 30 GB costs $349 ($150 less than iPod photo 40 GB and $50 less than regular iPod 40 GB)  > iPod dock ($39), AV cable ($19), carrying case ($29), and firewire cable ($19) do not ship with iPod photo (you may not really need them)  > Now we get three things with iPod photo: earphones, USB (not firewire) based AC adapter, USB 2.0 cable > In additon to the above, a firewire cable continues to ship with iPod 20 GB & iPod U2 edition > iPod photo Camera Connector is introduced - this can be used for connecting your digital camera directly to the iPod  As this product has been discontinued, you should be looking at iPod photo 30 GB from now on!  Since I have iPod 40 GB as well as iPod photo 60 GB, I strongly recommend iPod photo for those who are looking beyond the iPod 20 GB. The color screen has much better resolution and it also has a scrolling feature for long texts.

<Title>Get the 40GB iPod Photo while it lasts
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This review is based solely on the value of this 40GB iPod Photo that was recently discontinued versus the 2nd generation 30GB iPod Photo.  With the price drop on the 40GB iPod photo to clear out the stock, you get a tremenedous value.    This product comes with - a carrying case with belt clip - a connector to connect your iPod to your Television set to play slideshows (with music) on your tv - Firewire connector in addition to the USB 2.0 connector - Dock Connector.  The new 30GB and 60GB products do not come with any of these accesories anymore.  While it is good that Apple allows the consumer to pick and choose what you want and dramatically drop the starting point cost for the product.  Given the reduced price for this 40GB model, you are getting a lot more value for the money not to mention an additional 10GB of memory.  The only drawback to the 40GB iPod Photo versus the 30GB from what I can tell is the 30GB version is a little lighter and thinner.  I have long appreciated the iPod and think the general product is excellent and am very happy with this product.  But I will defer to some other excellent reviews here in regards to technical information about this version.

<Title>Hidden Costs of iPod iPhoto 30GB
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Boy! Capitalism rears it's ugly head again! I owned a 40GB iPod last November and returned it because the new iPhoto was coming out. I just bought the iPhoto for 349.00 and realized how much MORE money I have to spend to get the same use/functionality out of the iPhoto version...  1. NO docking station included in this version. (39.99)!! 2. NO firewire cable included (25.00)!!! 3. Power adapter is USB only!!!! 4. Only get USB 2.0 cable!!!!  What bothers me about it is:  1. You can't charge your iPod using the provided 2.0 USB cable when the iPod is connected to the computer. (I have a 15" PowerBook that HAS 2 High-speed USB plugs)  2. You can't use the iPod as a "PDA" to sync dates and address book unless you're using the firewire cable.  3. IF I were to buy the firewire cable...I would THEN need to BUY the power adapter that plugs into the wall....MORE MONEY....  In the end...for this 30GB iPhoto to be as functional as the 40GB iPod would cost 400+ (an extra 40 dollars).  Don't get me wrong the iPod is great, and color makes it better...but c'mon hiding costs is a horrible way to do business.   I hope this enlightens anyone considering dumping the 40gb for the 30gb iPod iPhoto.

<Title>Buy it now before it's too late
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased this ipod model based on the soon-to-be released photo / camera connector from Apple.  I take a lot of digital pics and the upload functionality would be a great use for me.  If you're thinking about an ipod photo this is currently the best one to buy because:  1. It's only $30 more than the 30 GB photo. 2. You get 10 more gigs, dock, av cables, and fire wire.    You would spend way more getting these "accessories" seperately. None of the 4G second version photo comes with the extras. Stop thinking and buy now.

<Title>Very Dissapointing Amazon

<Content>I ordered this iPod Photo 40GB on March 20th. Didn't care about reviewing the order receipt because Amazon has NEVER dissapointed me about their delivery estimates, NEVER, in 5 years I've been a regular customer. 3 or so days later, I go checked my order and realized that the "estimate" shipping date was and still is MAY 24TH!!!!! I wrote and then called customer service, and they confirmed that was correct!!! They said that "sometimes the product information page doesn't get updated" And still, in the product page they keep claiming that it "Usually ships within 2 or 3 days"????? HOW DARE YOU???? This a 2 or 3 MONTHS shipping estimate instead!!!!  Or..... I wonder if it has to do with the fact that I used a $45 gift coupon???? Mmmmhh???  They claim their "distributor" is going to refill their stock on those dates... HOW are they going to accomplish that if the WHOLE WORLD knows this model has been discontinued by Apple more than a month ago??? I'm very mad and dissapointed at Amazon...

<Title>Perfect---With Minor Flaws 
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent machine. It's compatible with Windows, easy to install, quick to upload, and just generally great. You can check out all the other reviews here for the details on how good it is. The photo screen is nice, but I really didn't find it all that necessary.  There are some minor problems that need to be taken care of when you purchase this:  1) BUY A CASE- The case that comes with this is not very good because the screen can get scratched easily. This is necessary.  2) BUY A WARRANTY- The internal battery will probably die within a year, so it's necessary to get a good warranty.  3) CONVERT YOUR WMA FILES- The most annoying thing about this is that it doesn't take Windows Media files. Convert all of your WMA files to the ipod-compatible format. If you have protected files, re-upload them in the iTunes format.  Enjoy your ipod!

<Title>Pros and Cons
<Date>Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros:  If you buy the 40 gig right now, you get an AV Cable, a dock and some other stuff that don't come with the new 30 gig or 60 gig, so for just a few bucks more than the 30 gig, you get a bunch of extra pricey stuff.  Great looking screen, easy interface, easy to download and arrange songs.  Cons: Can't figure out how to get/display album art for the CD's I've been ripping to my ipod. I've got a ton of discs I wanted to consolodate and put away. I'm disappointed that the album art is apparently not displayable.  Software didn't come with necessary version if iphoto, Apple's website helpfully (?) suggests I buy iLife '05, (which is also rather pricey.) I've managed to buy a copy of iLife '04, which I hope will solve my problem, but why not give me all the software I need to run the device as designed?  I'm going to like my iPod, but no one ever likes a "bait and switch."  Addendum: OK, so I figured out how to get the album art on my iPod, but why doesn't cddb automatically download it? I have to search for it myself on Google and drag and drop it to iTunes. Dumb.  Another Addendum:  I'd like to add to some of the "Why do you need this much storage space" reviewers--I have now uploaded my ENTIRE cd collection to my ipod and stored them all in the attic. (Whew! Took a while!) Using the cradle (that was included with this 40 gig photo ipod, but not with others, apparently) I listen to all of them through my home stereo. Pop it in, listen through speakers, take it out and on the road. It's super. (Thanks for asking!)  So now I've basically got 30 gig worth of music loaded into a tiny little jukebox. I put away my 100 cd changer and all my cds. Yay!

<Title>the ipod
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple Ipod photo is something that after you use it for a time it becomes something that you cannot leave the house with. As a person who spends about 8 hrs a day with the stereo on this is something that is used a lot during the day, and needs to be of high quality. This product is that high quality needed. The Ipod is something that you can use almost anywhere, the car, the home, and at work.   	Currently my Ipod has taken over my CD collection in my car. The pure convenience of having over 5000 songs with me in the car is something that after having the Ipod I could not go back to CD's. Currently I have the Ipod ran in with a Line In cord into the back of my stereo for people who have a line on your stereo this is the way to go. The FM transmitters are something that works, but not well and any audiophile will frown upon. If this is the route your looking into the best way to run this is the 1/8'' to composite cable with the SIK line out adapter. The SIK plugs into the Ipod and then the SIK's 1/8'' runs into the stereo. This provides the best quality connection to the car.   	At my house my Ipod has become my new CD changer. Again having over 5000 songs on one stereo component is something that becomes so convenient, you can't go back. The Dock that came with the Ipod is something that is very convenient and provides a great place to place the Ipod to avoid scratches. The dock provides a Line out port so it is easy to hook up to a stereo and provides a great sound quality. Also the dock can be used on the computer to sync the Ipod with your Itunes music library or used just as a charging base.   	At work my Ipod is just hooked up to a pair of computer speakers. With all my music right there next to my computer typing all those boring reports and fixing computers (I'm a computer tech. at a hospital) goes a little bit faster. Also sharing music at work becomes a little easier because of the Ipod's easy interface anyone can figure out how to play a song.   	Overall the Apple Ipod is a great product that can be used anywhere. Though pricy the quality really makes it worth it. I've had other MP3 players and none of them just feel as good as this one does in the hand. Ipod is a great tool for anyone who loves music or someone just looking for a good way to carry a few tunes around with them.

<Content>I bought this for $10 more than the new 30gig model, and I'm pleased to say I got my money's worth.  It comes with photo dock, firewire cable, and av cable, which are worth more than $10, not to mention the extra 10 gigs(keep in mind these accesories dont come with the the new 30 or 60 gig versions. I broke my old 20gig ipod by dropping it from two feet, i recomend you buy an iskin because the case that comes with this ipod offers zero protection as i found. Despite what other reviews say you do NOT need any other software with this package, you can add photos and album art if you know how to use itunes. The color screen is very nice with good resolution.  My only problem with the ipod photo is that it's like a cell phone screen which means you have to be in  a well lit place in order to read the screen without the backlight, which wastes battery. The battery really does last longer on these models than on regular ipods.  Great product, Good deal.

<Content>Warning: attempting to get an iPod through a "no cost offer" is hazardous to your email inbox!  Think about it for a moment: how can somebody give away a $300+ item? It's obvious that it's impossible.  Anybody familiar with marketing bounties knows that companies like AOL only pay, at most, a few dollars for a new customer. Can you guess how the "free" people make up the difference?  Answer: flooding you with junk email, telemarketing calls, and junk faxes.  I love my 40Gb iPod Photo. Apple, as usual, has designed a great product. Too bad a bunch of bad apples-pun intended-are using iPods as bait.

<Content>This is my dream mp3 player/photo album.  I love the color LCD screen, it looks great!

<Title>(Quite) A Few Quibbles
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, let me start by saying that this is a very good product. But it is FAR from perfect. I have many complaints, often quite petty (after all, this is my first iPod), but for the $400 or so price tag I expect CLOSE to perfect...   Quibbles:  1. You can't load pictures directly from the camera/memory card onto the iPod. Or, rather, you can't view photos loaded directly. In order to view photos, they must be moved to your computer and loaded through the iPhoto software. This is a MAJOR dissapointment for anyone travelling with their iPod and camera.   2. The (necessary) iTunes software is not compatible with Windows 98 or ME. Devastating to those of us with older computers full of MP3s.   3. The iTunes software is constantly redirecting me to their store. Very obnoxious.   4. I firmly believe that any product that costs me over a week's salary should come with all the necessary accessories. Noticably absent: a carrying case (if you dont want it severely scratched), flash card reader, fire wire, decent headphones, etc. etc. All told, be ready to sink another hundred (or three...) on "fun add-ons".   5. Could they not add some better games?? My cell phone has way better games than this. My TI-83 calculator (yeah, I was a bit of a nerd in high school) had better games than this. What a waste of a color screen...   Complaints aside, the iPod still rocks. The sound quality and design are unsurpassed; the software and database style song sorting are strong - there are clear reasons why the iPod is becoming a cultural icon of the digital age. But, given the price and potential for improvement, I wish I'd waited for a better version.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The player sticks regularly and then jumps several songs ahead when it finally recovers.  The charging is inconsistent, it will say it is charged when plugged in and then the battery indicator does not reflect a full charge... is it charged or not?  The controls are clumsy, especially to turn the IPOD off.  Currently, my "Hold" button will not disengage so all buttons are inoperable.  I called Apple support and all they would talk to me about is buying an extended warranty (my 1 year is not over yet).  I need to send the IPOD back to Apple at my own expense.  It does work ok as an external hard drive.   This really isn't a very good product especially for the price.  I'm back to using my old RIO.

<Title>you *MIGHT* love this iPod -- guide 2 upgrading to iPod_foto
<Date>Mon Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Yes, unlike other reviewers, I do own a 40gig iPod Photo (as of 10/04)... and yes I do also own a regular 3G 15gig iPod (plus I'm not pushing IP Address harvesting scams like the "free iPod" reviews)... so this was quite an expensive UPGRADE decision for me...so this review is geared towards those struggling with an upgrade decision (for those who own a smaller/lighter 10-20gig music iPod)...I own both PC and Mac formats.   1) BOTTOM LINE: Although \very, very\ cool, I do not believe the trade-offs between the large size/weight and photo capability & extra battery life... are worth the enormous price (which includes a software purchase). Yes my 4 star rating is entirely based on how much incremental "stuff" you get versus what you have to fork over. But if money is not an object and you already own the larger/heavier 40gig variety, this becomes a "NO-BRAINER" upgrade - the `wow' factor is huge. If you travel quite a bit for business like I do, this is also a good addition to keep you company during trips.   2) PHOTO QUALITY: Good to "pretty good".. but not excellent... I do realize the size of the screen is only 2 inches, but photos tend to be slightly pixilated, even the full resolution ones that are over 2mb (though you stop noticing after a minute) and color reproduction is not all that great on skin tones and deep reds, but very good w/ greens&blues... which make pics of landscapes quite nice!   3) PHOTOS ON MY TV: Now this is where this thing shines... this is a really cool feature... the iPod includes a mini-plug-to-RCA-out (headphone to 3 pronged yellow/white/red) that produces cool results when you plug it into your TV.. you can scroll through your photos on your big (or at least bigger than your computer screen) TV screen. However, having only 2800+ photos on my iPod (that's more than avg), I got tired of flipping through & showing off my albums in about 2 days...   4) MUSIC: Besides not being able to see the screen as well w/out the backlight, it's the same as any click-wheel, 4G iPod.   5) SIZE/WEIGHT: If you already own a 40gig variety, you won't have much to complain about... but if you have a 10-20gig iPod, you will add more size and weight to your pocket (or bag). Moving from a 3G 15gig, this difference \to me\ is significant, as my iPod usually resides in my jacket pocket.   6) COSMETIC CHANGES: None on the outside, still scratches as easily as the rest, but has a color screen w/ a new font and screen looks very dark w/out the backlight.   7) BATTERY LIFE: Conditional based on the user... i never trust battery reviews on websites, as they vary DRASTICALLY when I employ my personal uses to the device. However, so far it seems to run near spec during mixed use... and much longer than my 3G iPod.   == SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX==   A) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE: In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing albums automatically, etc..., you need to purchase or own iLife (iPhoto specifically) 4.03 or better (if you are the rare few that bought your computer in the last few months w/ 4.0, you still have to download an upgrade to 4.03) ... Now I bought my iMac from the Apple website last Christmas and it still shipped w/ iLife 2.0... so I had to purchase iLife 4.0 (according to several company reps, there is no free upgrade from the jump from 2.0 to 4.0)...which took me an additional day to figure out... Yes, you can assign folders and such to sync to your photos to your iPod, BUT having an album editor enables full control of changes and what changes I'm making, to the entire process. Oh Yeah, you need a high version of iTunes as well; my pod came w/ ver. 4.7... IMHO, you \need\ the iPhoto upgrade to enjoy this purchase.   B) TRANSITIONS: Only the "wipe" from right-to-left is included, maybe more will be avail in the future, but you are not given a choice.   C) SLIDESHOWS: You cannot assign multiple music lists in iTunes to specific albums in iPhoto... as of 10/04, you can only assign a SINGLE music list to ALL photo albums when you enable the slideshow feature. Yes, you can change this music list, but need to go back to the menu to do so.  Also, you can only display-to-TV in slideshow mode; you can't just flip through your albums in browse mode through your TV.  D) COLOR SCREEN: When not backlit, the screen during regular music playback turns \VERY\ dark, much more so than regular B&W iPods... you need a light source reflecting off of the screen in order to see the letters... typeface has changed too, more like "Arial" and slightly smaller.  Oh yeah, with the backlight off, the screen still displays in color.   TECHNICAL DETAILS:   A) You cannot adjust the color quality, size, cropping or transitions of the photos when detached from your computer, so don't bother asking a apple representative on the phone or at the store- they don't make enough money to actually buy one themselves. I've tried two different stores the NY area.   B) Both the 40/60gig packages come w/ an iPod dock (if you don't have one already), but like the old ones, do not allow for use w/ thick iPod skins and covers.   C) Comes with an iPod dock WITH a S-Video output (new) and a solo USB 2.0 cord (finally!).  D) Yes, this is thicker and heavier than your 10-15gig, traditional music iPod.   E) If you never upgrade your iTunes due to the hacks you can employ on earlier versions, then you cannot use the photo feature (yes I tried).  [...]

<Title>Too expensive
<Date>Fri Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>For $500(or $600 for the 60GB edition) you can get a computer. I think its a little to expensive for what you get. The battery life is better, which is a plus but other than that there is no significant improvement on the 4G iPod, except for the color screen/photo viewing which in my opinion is not worth 100 extra dollars. There are much better color screen and photo viewing mp3 player alternatives out there, at a much lower cost. Check out the Archos Gmini 400(can play videos also and its the same size as the iPod), iRiver iHP-320(bundled with FM Radio, In-line recording, voice recording), or Cowon iAudio M5(same as iRiver IHP-320 only smaller).

<Title>I love my new iPod Photo 40GB
<Date>Tue Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first iPod... I had just ordered a 4G 40GB and the next day this was announced so I jumped.  I've never been an early adopter before but I am very impressed.  I'm a professional musician and I don't actually listen to much music on the go -- too much of a pain to switch CDs for that one song I want to hear over and over again.  But the iPod is terrific and I have not been disconnected from it for five days.  But the photos... well, I've been able to go to venues and show promotional photos for the bookers on demand so I can get their interest and that's been a big help and time saver.  Also, being able to create a slideshow has been terrific.  I agree the quality isn't "print" but I do think the photos are beautiful on that sweet screen.  I do wish for lots of improvments but I'm still loving it.

<Title>The iPod actually got better!
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recently caved and forked over $500 for this little number and I can tell you that, provided you can afford the price tag, the iPod photo will not disappoint.   Having migrated from a 15GB 3rd Gen. iPod, I can tell you that 40GB is more than enough for the average music afficionado. I've got just under 3500 songs (a combination of MP3 & AAC files) loaded on it and I still have 20 1/2 GB left to play with. Not bad at all. Being able to see the album art for each song is a nice touch too. The core features that have made the iPod such a big hit haven't changed. Most people know what the iPod does already so I'll focus this review on what makes the iPod photo such a leap from its predecessors.  The interface has been reworked (new Apple font, blue highlight over a white backgound) and it benefits greatly from a color screen. The backlight illuminates the 2" screen nicely and it works great if you're only glancing at it to find what you're looking for (i.e. using it hooked up to your car stereo). The games are now in full color too, making Solitaire actually playable.  Now for the photos.   First, I've heard complaints that photo syncing through iTunes is rather clunky but I've experienced quite the opposite. It's no harder than changing any of iTunes' preferences. What I do is have both iPhoto & iTunes open, start with iPhoto and remember the albums I want to copy over, then Command+Tab to iTunes and check off the albums I want. Simple as that. It takes a bit to sync up (especially if you have over a few hundred photos, I have over a thousand) but luckily it's not processor-intensive so you can surf the net, answer email on your computer while iTunes is working.   As for the photos themselves, sure the quality isn't like looking at an actual photo print but for the screen size the pictures look great, and navigating through them is remarkably easy. You can either go backwards & forwards by pressing Next or Previous on the scroll wheel OR by using the scroll wheel itself to cycle through them. Looking through albums is as easy as picking a playlist and the screen accommodates 25 thumbnails at a time, making finding the photo you want a snap.   Finally, the incidentals. The battery life has been increased substantially to accommodate for the color screen; I have yet to run the battery down completely once. This also adds to the size of the device itself, making it a bit thicker and a tad heavier but it's by no means anything to get worked up over.  So Apple managed to do it. They took a device that was without argument the best in its class and made it better. If you're looking to carry around a lot of photos and your music, look no further. It's worth every penny.

<Title>DO NOT BUY
<Date>Sat Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>For the love of G_d. DO NOT BUY THIS. 1. You are being Ripped off. 2. For the same amount of money, you can buy an Archos AV340 which...         1.Plays music AND videos/movies        2.works on windows AND mac        3.Can view Hi-rez photos (And there is a Camera attachment that lets you take pictures, and another which lets you load pictures on with your seperate camera)        4.The camera attachment also doubles as a CAMCORDER  3.All the photo iPod does is...         1.play music        2.view phosos        3. guzzle your battery in 4hrs        4. YOU HAVE TO LOAD THE PHOTOS ON YOURSELF, AFTER THEY ARE ON YOUR PC/MAC    So.... the obvious choice is.... Archos. I switched over, and now I can't imagine life w/o it. (I just lost my charger... *Sob* so i am stuck burning CDs)

<Title>Wonderful upgrade path for your current iPod
<Date>Sat Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recently bought the 40GB iPod Photo.  Prior to that I have owned both a 20GB 3G iPod and a 40GB 4G iPod (I use it with a windows XP laptop).  I must say that for iPod owners the iPod photo is is very nice upgrade, altough it introduces a $100 premium over similar capacity regular iPods.  The $100 can be somehow easily explained by the hi-res color screen and the Picture browsing and display capabilities but for some people might not be worth the premium.  I guess it depends on your particular usage models.  Nice attributes of the iPod Photo: * The hi-res color screen displays song names and the other regular IPod info (battery left, the progression bar, etc.) in a very pleasant a simple, elegant way.  The text is easier to read and is definitively far more readable in backlit mode than the regular iPod in backlit. * The color screen also shows a small window with the artwork of the album which is playing in a given moment. * The battery lasts 15 hours and it is really a killer feature for people that take long flights regularly (like yours truly). * The picture browsing mode is nice and intuitive.  Even if you don't own the extra software mentioned in other reviews, you can synch your Windows folders straight from your windows folders in to the iPod. * The picture browsing mode is nice and the iPod interface is pretty intuitive. The screen is a bit small, but again, if you travel a lot, it allows you to look at your loved ones' pictures easily while listening to your music (I don't know why one reviewer said that this was not possible, since its not only possible but also very easy to do). * The cables to browse on TV are very nice and enable you to do your own slideshows with music for your family or friends.  A RCA cable is included.  It can get signal out of the headphone jack and provides Video and stereo feed into your TV set.  It also has an S-Video output on the cradle. Cool!.  Cons: * The screen resolution, despite being a big improvement vs the B&W screen is below the resolution available on most cameras.  For the premium a higher resultion display should be added. * Thickness, the iPod Phote is a bit thicker than the regular iPod. This can be an issue for some cases and some docking stations (e.g. JBL onstage speakers). * Battery charge.  Maybe not a big issue if you came from a 3G iPod, but certanly much slower to charge than the regular 4G iPod (5 hrs vs 2 hrs).  NEWS ON IPOD PHOTO (AS OF 3/1/05):  * This week Apple announced the new iPod Photo models and they are reducing significantly the Premium over the regular iPod. * The IPod photo now comes in two presentations: a 30GB model for $349 and a 60 GB model for $449.  This is a great deal vs the former price of $499 for the 40GB and $599 for the 60GB model. * The new models lack the cradle and the nice three-way cable to get Video and Stereo signal out of the miniplug jack.  The cradle and the cable are now optional accessories.  * Overall a great move to make the iPod photo a more accesible player to a broader audience.  In summary a great and very welcome member of the iPod family and specially recommended for roadwarriors, especially those that take long flights.  Enjoy.

<Title>Unbelievable
<Date>Thu Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is one of the greatest pieces of technology I have ever owned.  I am somewhat of an "early adopter", so take this with a grain of salt, but I will try to give a balanced opinion.  I should also note that I have a relatively new PowerBook G4, so the integration with my computer is absolutely seamless.  I have had my iPod Photo 40GB for about a week.  During that time, the photo options have come in very handy.  We just had a Christmas party from work, and I took a bunch of pictures with my digital camera.  The next day, I was able to bring those pictures in and show them to anyone who wanted to see them without lugging my laptop around.  I also hooked up to the TV in the lounge with the INCLUDED cable, and showed a slide show with music.  My coworkers loved every minute of it.    All of the other reviewers' comments are noted, and I believe they have some truth to them.  The one feature I would want is the option to zoom in & out, and pan around the pictures to see details a little better on the small screen.  It seems this would be relatively easy to implement, since the controls are already in place.  I disagree with the reviewer who said the thumbnail view is inadequate.  I can see enough detail in them to choose the picture I want without a problem.  As a music player, the iPod can't be beat.  I am still loading music on it, and I have plenty of space left.  After all, my high-end laptop only has 80 GB of storage, and has to hold a lot more than music and pictures.  The on-the-go playlist is great, and the shuffle works very well without duplicates.  The click wheel is extremely cool, and makes getting around very easy.  Over all, I would say that the iPod Photo is worth every penny, if you you are going to USE all the features.  If not, get a plain iPod, or even an iPod mini if you think it will suit your needs.  Or your wants.  After all, this is a great toy, not a necessity.

<Title>Overpriced, Overhyped
<Date>Thu Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Apple is a terrible company indeed. On one hand, they put on the fa�ade of being a grassroots, independent-thinking, and compassionate corporate citizen; and when the public looks away, Job and his cohort engage in predatory business practice that puts big bad M to shame. Take their successful iPod for example. According to Creative, one of the first makers of harddisk-based MP3 players, "Apple bought a ton of the 1.8-inch drives and locked up the supply...the smaller drives gave Apple the advantage of being able to produce its first-generation iPods with a more compact profile than the competition." The iTune's recent dealing with Real has demonstrated Apple's trend of voracious business behavior. For these reasons alone, I would have qualms about pouring my hard earned cash down in to the pipeline of such a ruthless company.   Now let's turn to the actual iPod. I must disclaim that I DO NOT OWN an iPod Photo - I own a 4G 20GB iPod and have played with an iPod Photo. In any case, I feel that iPod really has reached its peak, functionally and aesthetically, at their 4G models. Since the 4G model, Apple has been facing an increasingly creative army of competitions. The latest gimmicks from Apple, namely the iPod Photo in question (or the ridiculously looking iPod U2 model), are indications of Apple's innovations being exhausted. The iPod Photo's slight improvement over its 4G predecessors is not very impressive at all, compared to the recently new players from other companies (Creative, Archos, Rio, JetAudio etc. etc. which, in many cases, offers VIDEO and audio playback capability and open support of codec types for similar, and often lower, prices).   So what's the straight dope on the new PHOTO hoopla? Let's take a look. First thing first, you NEED TO BUY ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE to access some of the photo features(!) You've got to be kidding me! FIVE HUNDREAD BIG ONES (the price of a new desktop system), and I need to shell out more for some crappy photo software?! The color screen is an improvement over the 4G (keep in mind competitors have gone color a long time ago), but unless you have the backlight on all the time, the color screen is dark and fuzzy. Speaking of backlight, the reason Apples recommends a stingy approach to battery use is because there's still no improvement with the battery. In a year or two, battery will be dead and that's another 100 for replacement.   Bottom line, unless you're a follower Mac cult, do consider the options before committing half of your Christmas bonus on this thing. There are many alternatives out there.   p.s. I don't work for any of Mac's competitors.

<Content>YES!!! the rave about IPOD's is true...I bought the 40GB photo IPOD and it is amazing. The color and clarity is truely worth the extra money. Also this has a calendar, alarm and the date time, etc.... This also has games to play and I really love the touch screen - this is the first I have seen any system do something like this. It is worth the money for all these extra's you get.
