<Title>Can't Complain...

<Content>The best thing about this player is the four way navigation buttons.  If you find wheels and touch-sensitive strips irritating, this is the mp3 player for you.  Simply press the ^ and v buttons to scroll, > to skip or select, &lt; to go back, play to start or stop, menu to change the settings, and mode to switch the browser between artist, album, genre, etc..  The whole thing is very intuitive after just a few minuets of use.      The display is very clear and informative, the exception being that the battery display has only three sections, making it not that usefull.    The whole thing is rock solid yet very light, and the on/off switch is so flat and sunken it will NEVER be turned on by accident.  One time I dropped it and it just hung on the end of the cord without hitting the floor it's so light.    The earbuds that come with it are strangely shaped and hurt my ears so I dont use them.  The so called 'carrying case' is just a felt cover to prevent scratches, not padded or anything(but still nice to have).    The sonicstage software is a bit sluggish, but if you just want to transfer files and use a different program for listening, I think it's fine.    I am confident this thing is going to last a long time beacause i got my sony cd player about five years ago and after much hard usage it still works great.    Also, this thing can playback and charge at the same time so you can plug it in when it gets low on power without skipping a beat.    One of the best things is that if you set playback to random you can shuffle all songs, one artist, one album, one genre, etc. just by selecting it.     Also don't listen to the guy who complained about the scroll speed.  First of all, there is no comprehensive list of individual songs, so there could not even be 3000 items to scroll through.  Secondly, even if there was, the menu is wrap-around so it would only take half that long.  Due to the multiple categories to organize tracks by, it could only take about 30 sec. tops to find the song you want.    Overall the only three petty complaints I have are these: the AC/DC power adapter partially covers the on/off switch, so you can't turn on or off without taking the plug out(a minor annoyance), artists are organized alphabeticly even if they start with 'the', which I know is silly but it gets on my nerves, and thirdly, the shuffle algorithim is a little sketchy and seems to play some songs more than others. But belive me, if you can find a seller, buy it.   P.S. The battery is user-replacable, and you can probably find a new one at Batteries Plus.

<Title>Great Player, Sonicstage is awful...
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First, all those people that say it takes for ever to scroll through the music are just wrong.  I have nearly 10k songs on the device and it scrolls through the music faster than an IPOD, which I also own. It is better functionally than the IPOD, although it lacks in add-ons (except for the remote which is far better than anything by Apple). Now the downside.  Sonicstage is just awful.  It is glitchy, the major one being that for no reason it can stop working and nobody at Sony can figure out how to fix it.  The program is very cumbersome, you can configure your music, but it is a royal pain.  Although I am not a big fan of I-Tunes, it is far superior to Sonicstage.  I would buy it over an IPOD for the device is better, but be very leary of the Sony software, it sucks. I think the industry is missing the boat on forcing you to use there interfaces rather than a third party's (i.e. Microsoft's).

<Title>A Great Alternative ToThe Overrated iPod!
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A few days ago I finally got my first ever real, full-featured portable music player, a beautiful red Network Walkman and I love it. The thing I like the most is that it ISN'T an iPod (which is for ultra-chic, wannabee-cool-people, music loving lemmings) and it does a good job at what it's supposed to do! Here's a quick bullet-point review:  + Great battery life! + Beautiful red design...neat "sideways" format + Simple and easy to use + Sonic Stage tranfers files fast, does a good quick & dirty job  - No WMA support - Atrac3 encoding necessary for quick transfer of music to player - Compilation CDs have messed up track orders in SS & on the Walkman - Recharging / USB connection is messy and overly complicated - Included Earbuds kill your ears (hard plastic!...ouch!)   Overall, I think this is a B+ product. I gave it five stars because as a music player, it does a great job at that. I see many places for improvement---but since no current music player does everything I want right now, I'll be happy with my Walkman for the next couple years. It's a good 20gb backup drive as well and shopping through [...] (even amid all the controversy of Sony rootkit files, etc.) is very easy, very fast and practically painless.

<Title>The player feels and looks great...
<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>But the software sonic stage made this by far the worst mp3 player I have ever owned.  I suggest you try iaudio.  I've had 3 of them (sold one, gave the other one away, and kept one for myself).  Easy to upload music, and no headaches like sonicstage.  With Iaudio it took me minutes to upload music.  With sonicstage it took me 3 entire days (with the computer running) to upload the 4,000 songs.  Pathetic.

<Title>buy something else.
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love Sony, i really do. So when i went looking for a mp3, i started with Sony.  In 2005 i bought my hd3 and quickly found it to be lacking. I can't believe in the list of the features it has, "comes with an ac adapter" and "you can connect to your PC".  Why, because for this type of dmp(digital music player) these features should be synonymous.  The problem is there is nothing else.  The one thing I thought would have been included was the ability to make a play-list.   And with out a play-list the "incredible battery life" is about of that when you're changing to a different artist, or albums because you turn on the back-light every time you touch the thing.  I know u can turn it off, but I don't only listen to music when it bright and sunny.  And I'm not going to change it back and forth. My friends have mp3's with Swappable rechargeable lithium-ion battery, multiple play lists, Built-in voice recording and FM tuner with FM recording capability.  Anyway get something else and do some research if your going to spend this much money.

<Title>NW-HD5
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Sony NW-HD5 - about two years ago, because is had 20GB and a rechargable/replaceable battery,  it worked fine for about two years, the the battery failed, for $50 I bought another one, which would't hold a charge, I sent that one back for yet another now it appears that the player failed, because the second battery will not hold a charge.  The player only works now on AC-power.  I replaced it with an Archos 604 with WIFI
