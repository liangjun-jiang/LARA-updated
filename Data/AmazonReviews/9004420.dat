<Title>WOW! THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO MUSIC!
<Date>Sun Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!

<Title>The first MP3 Handheld available on the Consumer market
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I had high hopes for the Diamond Rio and it certainly lived up 2 the hype. Lightweight and excellent quality with some good connecting software. My only gripe can be with memory. You definately need another 32Mb to store  your music. If you want one, my advice is to wait for the new upgraded  version with 64Mb and a graphic equaliser!

<Title>Next Millenium Consumer Electronics
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<p>Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3). This makes  its use and performance comparable with other CD-quality playing devices  while putting the power of the internet into the palm of your hand. If you  want to make a statement of &quot;being digital&quot;, the RIO is a must!

<Title>Brilliant!
<Date>Tue Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Remember when the Walkman hit the market years ago?  At first it was fad, then it became a craze before finally becoming as ubiquitous as taxi cabs in Manhattan.  The Diamond Rio is the first product with the potential to  eventually REPLACE the Walkman.  Think about it - portable music that  sounds as clear as a compact disc from a device that looks and feels like a  pager.  Unshockable, no matter how much you jump around or how bumpy the  bus ride.  This is the perfect gift for your favorite &quot;gadget  junkie&quot;, as long as they have a PC to download from.  Pssst...here's a  secret:  you can record your own CD's into MP3 format and download the  songs into your RIO - it isn't just for internet music!!  Great product.

<Title>Do your self a favor and get a portable mini disc player.
<Date>Mon Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Only a half an hour of &quot;near&quot; quality music makes this format seriously flawed. To change music you eventually have to upload new music, i.e. a huge inconveneince when a computer is available. Mini disc is also  shock proof, recordable, near cd quality but in addition you can change  music with out the inconvenience of uploading music from a computer.

<Title>there are better deals on mp3 players than this one
<Date>Thu Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've had my Rio for about 4 months.  The other day I went to download some songs to it, and now it says that it only has 16mb of memory.  I don't know what happened to it.<p>Also, the 32mb of memory is not enough if you're like me and use the player all day.  If I bought another mp3 player to replace this broken one, it would have to have at least 64 mb of memory.  I could fit a maximum of 8 songs on the Rio.

<Content>I originally bought this a year ago. The first one i had just quit working. They sent me a new one right away but it was refurbished and the memory was messed up. So i call their tech support and they charged me $19.95 for the call and couldnt even send me a new one or atleast tell me what's wrong. Im sad to say that i was completely dissatisfied with this product and the company.<p>The prices are really coming down on these things so just pick up a cheap one with 64mb memory because trust me 32mb aint enough.

<Title>Rio excellent player
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I got the Special edition 64 mb's RAM and a 32 MB flash card for 96 MB's of RAM.  Very nice, and skip free so when I work I don't have to worry about skipping like I did on my CD player.  Very compact, easy to fit in a pocket or even better it's got a clip if you don't have pockets.  Some people complain about batteries but I get the same performance out of a single battery in the Rio than 2 in a CD player.  It's not an issue to me anyway since I use rehargable batteries, but some complain anyway.  Download speeds to the Rio are pretty good, would like a faster download time though.  Anyone think of Firewire or USB?  As far as durability I accedentally dropped it on concrete and it still works perfectly.  Overall a fine product, I'd pick it up again after my experience with it.

<Title>Great little device for short duration play
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I got my Rio PMP 300 from my employer as a gift.  It was my first exposure to MP3, as up to that point I had been dismissing it as a fad.  Having the device, and about 150 CD's, I figured why not give it a shot.<p>The installation of the software went smooth.  I found an update, and installed that as well with no problems.  Then I started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable.  I was running on Windows NT, which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer, but with some caveats.  I would start ripping and the software would crash.  I would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash.  I would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didn't actually make it.  Bottom line - the connectivity for this device was pathetic.<p>But speaking for the device itself - I loved it.  The music played cleanly, without interruption, regardless of how much I shook the device.  The buttons on the front are well placed, well labeled, and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access, but you don't have to worry about them protruding.  It has all the features you might want including random and repeat.  The display let's me know how much memory I have, what track number is playing, and the time of the song.  There are also various other indicators that are helpfull (battery, etc.).<p>The memory on this device is small - 32Mb.  And the manufacturer says it will only support up to 64Mb total with an expansion card.  That expansion card can hold it's own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory.  However, vendor chose the odd memory type of 3.3V for the external memory versus typical CompactFlash.  <p>There's a convenient &quot;lock&quot; switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering.  This can be good in two ways: it won't get turned on accidentally and burn battery, and you won't accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening.  The belt clip is handy, and detachable, and the battery life (one AA) is quite respectable.<p>In all, I really love my Rio PMP 300.  It's perfect for a trip to the gym, a jog around the neighborhood, or even for a short plane flight.  If all you need is an hour (30 mins on internal memory alone at a 128 sample rate) to pass the time, then you really don't need to spend more - this is the perfect device.

<Title>Great...while it lasts.
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I've had my player for just over a year.  No problems!  No skipping, doesn't have a mind of its own.  In otherwords, the play options (random...) never switch on me without my promt.  It functions very well.  Battery uses quickly.  It's only just very recently that it's beginning to die on me.  It plays, then won't.  It's something to do with the battery and the connection.  Also, the screen is fading from the top down.  This may be to slight rain sprinkles, or its visit to a sandy beach in the Turks (this occured in February though).  I am getting another!

<Title>Don't waste your money.
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This seemed like such a great idea: music that won't skip; I can record what I want. Then I got it.<p>The software is far more complicated than it needs to be, and it's unbearably time-consuming to put everything you want on the machine.<p>Then it there's not enough memory to record all you'll need for a long enough stretch.<p>I could go on for pages but won't waste your time with it. My last straw, however, was when, after I'd purchsed some additional memory, the lid to hold the battery in won't close. So the little, grandly over-priced toy is a total waste. <p>Stick to your CD player. Maybe it's not all the up-to-date, i.e., the hi-tech industry has replaced it with this little thing. But you'll enjoy it more.

<Content>After about a year of service, the link between my machine and the computer stopped working.  I attempted to get te problem fixed by calling &quot;customer service&quot; and was put on hold for a ridiculous length of time.  Then I was told to download a useless interface.  The end result is that I am going to get a new MP3 player that isn't made by this manufacturer.

<Title>wait for the next version
<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>while this is truly great product which I enjoy. The limited playback time hinders the Rio. If your going to have mp3's on your computer it's more convient to use winamp for free then spend 170 for a portable version. It's  easier just to hook your audio output to your stereo and make mix tapes,  yes tapes then waste your time with the Rio. I suggest waiting for the next  portable player with at least 60 min. of playback otherwise, keep to the  tapes.

<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I was given a Rio as a gift, and I really thought I wouldn't use it, but it's been incrediably handy.  I now take it with me whenever I go jogging, because, unlike a c.d. player, it never skips. You can also easily move  between and within songs, unlike a cassette Walkman.  My only problems with  it is it takes longer than I thought it would to download songs to the Rio  from my computer.  Also, it's pretty hard to find free, *good* downloadable  MP3s on the Web (you'll get lots of porn sites when you try).  But to make  a mix from your c.d.s to take on the road with you is great.  The battery  doesn't last a super long time (about 12 hours I think), but it only takes  one.  I've recommended the Rio to friends, and I really enjoy mine.

<Title>Not bad, but far away from best
<Date>Tue Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Weve seen it so many times. Companies make a product that lookspretty cool, give it a name that most people will remember, andadvertise a lot.  Then it WILL sell, dosent matter how good the product actually is. RIO is a good example of that. And it was easy to do such a thing becourse the other portable mp3-players on the market are pretty anonymous. They dont advertise that much. Probably cuz they want to focus on doing a great player. Like the first portable mp3-player, MPMan. Its out in a new version that is far better than the RIO-player. It has flash memorycards, is easy to deal with and does even support other fileformats for storing. The main problem with mp3-players is the amount of space for storing music. To get near cd-quality you got to have 128kbps or more(156 recommended). The best solution to this right now i think is a player with a harddisk or cd-rom built in. Then you can store many hours and hours of music. But it makes a little bigger and more expensive player. So i think the next step from that is flash memory cards. They are small and can store pretty much and best of all they are replaceble. So, summary: Dont buy the RIO-player if not your only demand is to get a small player. Check out the other cool players instead.

<Title>Whaddya mean 30 minutes?
<Date>Wed Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I like the rio a lot, my big problem with it is the lack of storage space.  The parallel connection is VERY slow for downloading, maybe next gen will have 64MB and a USB connection.  The thing I like the most about my rio is  the fact that I don't have to carry my valuable CD collection around in my  car where they can easily be damaged by sunlight, mishandling or worse yet,  stolen.  With a cheap adapter I can plug my rio straight into my car  casette deck and I only have to worry about the rio getting stolen, not  $100's worth of CD's.  <p>I think the music industry is less worried about  the MP3 market stealing music as it is the Rio market stealing sales for  replacement CD's that are easily damaged or stolen.  Now the CD's I buy  stay locked up safely in my house.

<Title>Good, but wait for IBM's Microdrive
<Date>Fri Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Now don't get me wrong, I'm a big advocate of mp3, but I think that even with additional (and expensive) flash cards, Rio doesn't haven't have as much memory as I need. I really don't like listen to music at 64kbps,  although that rate is perfect for talking. 128kps is good enough for most  songs, but Rio only can take 30 minutes of music at that rate. I do  congradulate Diamond for the size and design of the Rio, however. There  already is a newer version that has double the space, but it looks like an  iMac. (Boo!)<p>One thing to watch out for is a tiny little hard drive  called Microdrive from IBM. It holds 340 Mb, which is good four about 6  hours of music at 128kps, and 12 hours at 64k. Expect that around  Christmas.

All I need is a cassette adapter to plug  into the earphone jack.
