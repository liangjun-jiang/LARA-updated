<Title>Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best.

<Title>Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player:  - Incredibly small, thin, and very light. - Well designed, fit on your palm, pocket, or pencil case. - High resolution colour screen, shows albumart, photos, and games in colors. - Superb sound. - Click wheel; easy navigation as the original iPod. - New features:   > World Clock   > Stopwatch   > Screen Lock - now with iTunes 5, it's easy to sync AddressBook, Calendar, etc between Ms Outlook and iPod nano. - with flash memory, the nano is 100% skip free; a true sport companion. - headphone jack at the bottom, making it easier to read the screen (without rotating it first) when we take the nano out from our jeans pocket.  Although it comes with lots of advantages, yet:  - 4 GB is the maximum capacity possible. - USB connection only. - No charger adapter, you should use the USB connection to recharge the battery. It means the computer or laptop should be around you. Make sure you bring your laptop on your vacation. - Only two colors available, black or white. No more pink, blue, green, etc.  Accessories that you may like: - The lanyard. With this earphone, you can wear your iPod nano as necklace. No more tangle and you can change the music right away without reaching your pocket. - The silicon case. This silicon case comes in colors and will change the look of your iPod nano. It will also protect your iPod from scratches and prevents it from sliding on a tilted table or slipped out of your pocket when you're sitting.   Overall this is a really great product! Before deciding to buy this MP3 player, make sure you have USB 2.0 on you computer or laptop. Some people had bought this nano and having USB 1 connection on their PC, making the song transfer a painful and time consuming process. It will takes hours to fill up your iPod nano with USB 1. Therefore, the existance of USB 2.0 on your PC is crucial. Also, if you are frequent traveller, it is a good idea to buy another accessory for recharging the battery og your iPod without connecting it to PC. Otherwise, you will have to bring your laptop with you or look for PCs on your vacation to recharge your nano.

<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>Awesome device!
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing rocks! I received it as a present and really love it. This is my first iPod of any kind, so here goes.  The Good: 1) Size & Design - Need I say more? It is very small and looks stunning. Apple have done it again!  2) Easy-to-use Software - You use iTunes to organize your files and import them to the player. It can also be automatically synchronized to add or delete files to your player as needed. 3) Good Sound Quality - The quality from the earphones is wonderful. Bass, mids, treble: all there!  The Bad: 1) Picture Import - Pictures can only be imported by folder, so if you want to put just ONE picture into the device, you have to create a separate folder for it and then import that. 2) Scratches - Nanos, especially the black ones, get scratched VERY easily. Note this before you put it to use and perhaps purchase the necessary bag/film/other protector to keep it looking new. 3) Battery Replacements - I'm actually not sure about this, but this thing looks like it's solidly closed. Will there be a way to change the internal battery when it expires? I don't know.  This is a super player! You will love it! Buy it! :)

<Title>I'm glad I slept on the iPod mini
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After being an ipod owner for the last two years, I was in the market for a second iPod. I slept on the iPod mini and I'm glad because now there's the iPod mini. I love it. I was worried that it'd be a total drag to set up but it was perfectly compatible with all my previous iTunes stuff. I didn't have to even load the included CD all I did was downlaod the latest verisons of the iPod updater and I made sure that I had the latest upgrade of iTunes.  The nano works with all my previous cables for my 3rd generation iPod. So after I removed it from the package I plugged it in my previous iPod's AC adapter. The one draw back is the nano does not include an AC adapter but you can still charge it with the usb cable. I was able to get a full charge in about an hour with the AC adapter. With that said, I highly reccomend this amazing mp3 player. It exceeded my expectations. The ease of use, the design, everything is wonderful. Now you may think...why spend money on an mp3 player that only holds 500 songs? Well, how many people do you know that have time to listen to 5000 songs everyday? I can manage my playlists. I control what's being fed into my iPod and I like that. This is a great 2nd iPod for current iPod owners and a treat to first time buyers.

<Title>A good product, as old as it is.
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's probably been about 2 years since a review was writting for this iPod, but hey; I'm bored, and it's 3:35 AM. Anyway, I originally bought this thing a couple of years ago. It's still functioning properly and I've never had that many problems with it, and you can't imagine how many times this thing's been beaten around! The battery life has been pretty exceptional, though I can tell it has been getting a lot worse for the couple of years I've had it. I really thought I would have to replace the battery, but that was unnecessery.   To this day, I have been using this iPod with no problems (other than some click wheel problems, but that was easily fixed), and if you don't want to spend so much on the newer ones, this one's for you. I honestly can't compare this Nano with the other two generations, but all I know is that this one is durable, reliable, and easy to use. I may be getting the latest generation of the Nano by tomorrow (Dec. 17, 2007. The new nano with video capabilites) and I'll see if I can do a quick comparison between the two when I get it. I'll post the comparison on the Nano: Black product.

<Title>Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges is very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This 2-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 500 songs. For $50 more, you can buy the 4-gigabyte, which olds approximately 1000 songs. If you think the higher capacity could be useful to you, the $50, for an extra 2-gigabytes is a good value. However, if you're on a budget, or are not so concerned with capacity, this 2-gigabyte model will get the job done. 500 songs is a lot of music, so you will rarely find yourself in a situation, where you need more than that.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Color - White is the traditional iPod color.  This white iPod Nano will match your iMac, iBook, or other Apple products.  Furthermore, the white is less likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  It is a good idea to protect your iPod Nano, if you're concerned about its appearance.  The chrome finish, on the back, is particularly prone to scratches.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies.  I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>You've gotta hold it to believe it
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 90% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. So for the storage reason alone, I can't chuck my 20GB model just yet. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.   ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $100, you can upgrade to a Photo that has ten times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is-it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.   Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their demure size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 2-4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>best balance of usability and portability among all iPods
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my 4gb black iPod nano yesterday.  I got one because my 4G 20gb iPod was having intermittent dropouts when used with a tape-deck adapter or certain pairs of non-Apple earphones.  A few websites surmise that it's a problem with gold-plated jacks.  I'm happy to report that no such dropouts occur with the nano, even after purposely twisting and wiggling the jack.    My first day with the iPod nano has been an awesome experience.  When not in use, I walked around the whole day with it in my pocket and forgot it was there most of the time.  The screen is very bright and easy to read.  The click wheel is more sensitive than the one on my 4G iPod, but I got used to it.  Amazingly, it continued to work even when a thick clear plastic film separated the wheel from my finger.  I guess I should qualify that I'm really not sure whether the wheel is more sensitve or the GUI is just more responsive.  Synching on iPod nano over USB 2.0 seems just as fast as my 4G over Firewire 400.  For those worried about the durability of the tiny nano, please read the Ars Technica review.  They threw one out of a moving car then ran over it with the car, and it still played.

<Title>What else would you expect from Apple?
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Forgive me for coming off like an Apple fanboy, but to be honest after buying my first iBook there was no way I could go back to the PC world and the same can be said for the iPod.   As an owner of a 15GB, 512MB Shuffle, and previous mini owner I can honestly say that I like iPods, and when the nano was introduced it was hard for me not to get one. After taking it home and opening up the box (always a little more fun with Apple's more dressed up packaging) I couldn't believe my eyes. This black 2GB nano was TINY. I was a little skeptical about the size at first because it might be too small, but even as a 5'9" person with normal sized hands it was still easy to use.  The color screen is just an added bonus. I never saw the point of having a color screen for a music player but after using this  it's hard to go back to the black and white. Although the screen is small, the photos and album art look nice and vibrant thanks to the surprisingly high resolution screen.  One major reason the iPod has sold so well is because of its seamless integration with iTunes and there is no surprise here. Just plug it into the USB 2 and it's pretty much set up.  So to sum things up here's what I thought about the nano:  Positives - Looks fabulous, especially the black - Has the 30 pin dock connector like the full size iPods, meaning that it is compatible with practically all the accesories out there, which is a lot -Click wheel, although smaller, is still easy to use - The sound on iPods are underrated compared to other music players, and the nano sounds just fine especially with the right set of headphones  Negatives (although only a couple, to me they are HUGE) - Battery life, although considered average at 14 hours, could've been a LOT better considering it's a flash player. But then again not all flash players have a color screen - Apple should've known by now, but the material they use for the face of the iPod is just too fragile. Yes it makes it sleek and what-not but this thing just scuffs up too easily and considering how I payed a lot of money (especially that i'm a college student) I don't want this thing to be scratched from light use. - This is in conjunction with the previous gripe, but it's nice to see that Apple is making their own case (nano tubes), but they should've had these available the same day as the nano, because right now there are a lot of users that are already disappointed with the durability of the face of the nano.

<Content>The minute I saw it, I had to have it.  Once it arrived, I was not disappointed, far from it: it is smaller and more elegant in reality than it appears in photos.  And it sounds good, and the screen is very, very sharp.  Finally, it works with standard iPod accessories, like my Griffin Technologies Tune Juice.  If you travel extensively, the larger hard drive based iPod is probably better, but if you stay close to home, and can rotate the music on your iPod Nano, this is the ideal option.  The flash memory based Nano is quieter, and has better battery life.

<Content>I've received 2GB iPod nano today.  I tried to upload 290 songs to my iPod nano using iTunes 5 in Windows environment. It took more than twenty five minutes to sync all songs. I don't know why. I used latest notebook from Samsung (same as Dell's ODM model). Also browsing speed is some kind of bulky. I'd like to use Firewire to transfer songs, but iPod nano doesn't support Firewire data transfer. I've read other reviews that transfer speed is far more better than mine. What's wrong with my iPod nano? :-(

<Title>Everything awesome except for cheap scratchable plastic face
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sure, it looks and works wonderful. But putting this thing into a pocket scratches the finish. The plastic is softer than a CD. They (APPLE) want you to buy colorful cases (thirtybucks) to protect it. why would I put a pink plastic case over a nice shiny black ipod nano? Well the thing does scratch easily but I refuse to that much for a set of ugly cases. So just expect scratches with even cotton pockets on your levis. Now for the good part. The thing is really small and so high tech that it could have come off the starship enterprise. The thing works great and the music sounds great. The screen is brighter than the regular ipod photo (I have the 30gig model). So other than the cheap plastic front, the rest of it is really awesome.

<Content>The day I was planning to buy an iPod mimi, was the day that iPod nano was announced. I have decided to get the nano and I am happy that I did. It is very impressive. I have transfered many songs and pictures to my nano. It is very small. I still didn't take off the plastic from the front part of the nano, I don't want it to get scratched up. I wish they had a clear case avalable at the market. I bought a black nano and don't want to use a different color case. Overall, it is nice. Only negative part is that as soon as you touch the nano, shades of your fingerprints gets traced to the nano and if you try to erase the traces with the cloth, the surface gets messy. Hopefully the battery will last a long time. [...]

<Content>This thing holds 2 GB of data. This equals about 250 songs. "What only 250? There are way better mp3 players with way more memory!" Let's face it. Who listens to 250 songs a day, even a week? If you want to hear new stuff, how long does it take to add and delete songs? I have over 4,000 songs on my computer, and this thing works just fine. I don't think anyone needs more than 2 GB of data. Yeah, changing songs every day can be a hassle, but there's no need to go any higher. The only thing that I see as a problem is the price. You could buy the 20GB Photo for only a hundred more dollars. The math for the prices is not linear. The 20GB should cost 10 times that of the Nano since its hard drive is 10 times bigger, or better yet the Nano should cost a tenth of the 20GB, making it about $30. Just a thought, Apple.

<Title>Compelled to review
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't write a lot of reviews, but feel obligated when there is a product, book or something that i really enjoy. While the Nano certainly doesn't need any additional support with all the positive reviews I see, I didn't feel right about enjoying it so much without sharing my experience. I was torn between the 2 and 4 gb models, and almost went to 4 for only $50, but I then equated that to spending an extra $0.25 at the movies for the extra large coke - you just don't need it! 500 songs should be plenty, especially since you can erase and replace whenever you want!  besides, if you've read the tipping point by malcolm gladwell (not a plug, but I'll be reviewing that next!), you know that after 150 songs you probably have too many songs to be familiar with anyway!!! What can I say, the ipod experience is awesome, and the size of this new unit makes it even better than I imagined. Buy one.

<Title>Apple admits to Nano duds
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Macworld magazine quoted Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, late Tuesday having said that the broken screens were due to a "vendor quality issue". Apple finally admits it.   So to everyone who called those with broken/scratched Nanos idiots and liars, I say call yourself lucky that your's isn't one of the duds, and ask that you apologize to those you flamed.   To those stuck with the broken units, get back with Apple and demand a replacement of your DEFECTIVE unit.   I still would give this thing 0 stars if it were an option

<Title>Beautiful Nano has a few Weak Spots
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The nano is beautifully engineered hardware & software; However, there are some flaws:  ** Cheap Earbuds - the included earbuds sound lousy - not even close to my old Sony MDR-E838's that I got years ago with a minidisc portable.    ** Has only canned equalizer settings to choose from.  Haven't found a way to use the custom EQ settings from iTunes.    ** Weight is over spec - advertised as 1.5 oz (42.5 g), actual is 1.75 oz (49.5 g) - not including earbuds.  Otherwise it's fantastic - integrates perfectly with iTunes.  No problems here with scratches or cracks so far.

<Title>Running with tunes again
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the 4th Generation 40GB iPod for ~1 year and love it.  It holds a fair amount of my music collection and entertains me more than I can imagine. Along comes the iPod Nano and oh my word!  I've been running with the 40GB version and I'd been contemplating picking up a Shuffle.  Then Steve Jobs has to go and show me this...  I tried to order one as soon as I could find it.  Finally tracked down a 2GB black version and I use it every single day.  It has helped get me through more long runs and training than I ever imagined.  It goes with me everywhere. My only complaint is that the face & back can get scratched fairly easily.  I don't have the time to sit and baby the Nano every time I go running, so I've decided to just live with it.  It is more for function than for beauty in my case anyways. If you pick one up you won't regret it!

<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was in the market for an iPod for a while now and had my heart set on the U2 photo edition.... until I saw the Nano. It's unbelievably small, yet packs the same features as the traditional iPods (only thing lacking was the space). I mainly use mine in the car so it's not a porblem to change around the songs when I feel like.... but that combined with the Belkin FM transmitter makes it a dream !!

<Title>Flashy, but can't work too well... 3 1/2 stars
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I saw this iPod nano and LOVED it.  It was small, flashy, and had everything you would need in an mp3 player.  BUT, when I was just dreaming about having a nano (I have a blue mini and even though the nano outshines it, I still LOVE it) a girl with a locker next to me had hers in her hand.  I asked her if I could hold it and she yes.  After fantazing about how that could be MY nano, she exclaimed that it would turn off. (you have to press the play button for it to turn off.) I see it and the battery is full, so I try to turn it off for her... it wouldnt work.  So, her had to keep her nano turned on for the rest of the school day until she could reset it.  It ended up with a dead battery... The nano has faults... people who have the iPod nano notice these faults even though they put 5 STARS ***** sometimes it would freeze on them, it won't play, they notice these mistakes but are so entrapped into the nano that they don't want to admit it. Even though i have 3 stars, I would reccommend the nano to people who just love flashy and OKAY working mp3 players.  The people who would buy this iPod need to be patient. It would definely freeze on them.  But, I admit, I would love to get an iPod nano, because I'm one of those people... but just warning those impatient people out there!!! =]

<Content>I've had an i-Pod Nano for over a year, and I'm still just amazed!  What a great invention.  Wish Elvis could see them. No more taking CD's (or tapes--yes I can even remember "records") to have music. I have the 500-song capacity nano, but it's just amazing!  I can't compare it to any other mp3's or anything--I just think how great these little gadgets are! I have had NO problems with the Nano.  I do have it in a clear case so it isn't scratched. Do I need to even bother checking "I am over the age of 13"? (My next "amazing invention" is going to be a GPS.  I can't wait!)

<Title>Blaaaaa
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned a black 1st gen 2GB iPod for about a year, and I'm not happy.  I had very few problems with it until recently, the buttons on it stopped working and doing apples recommended "5 r's" did not help.  I called apples technical service line and guess what...THEY WOULD NOT EVEN TALK TO ME...unless your ipod is still under the 1 year warranty, they will not give any help, at all, none. They did however refer me to their online forums...what a joy...here I find 20 other people with he same problem I'm having, with still no answers.  I found no "authorized ipod technician" on these forums, just a bunch of frustrated customers with unanswered questions.  Apple refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem and don't seem too keen on fixing it.  If you do still plan on buying this product (and I don't recommend it) at least buy an extended service plan like I did.  When I got mine Bestbuy offered a 2 year "Product Replacement Plan" basically you can send your ipod in any time within 2 years for any problem and they will send you a voucher which is in-store credit for the cost of the ipod when you bought it + any tax, A great deal in my opinion, I think it only cost an extra $30

<Content>I got the first generation nano 2GB as a xmas present back in 2005. I thought it was great,until March 2006. I was using it one day when it just froze. It came back about 24 hours later. It froze about every 2 months after that. I am now fed up with Apple and thank god, I lost my iPod the other day. I was glad! I later went to buy.com and ordered a Zune 30GB for about $100. What a deal that is! I am trying to make a promise to myself not to buy an Apple product again. Steve Jobs can go take his iPod and iPhone and stick it up his a$$!

<Title>I should have gotten the 4gb!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My brother got me the ipod shuffle for my birthday- but luckily the nano was released within 30 days of my return by date!!!! so i got the white nano- there were 2 guys at the apple store returning the black ones because the screen was all scratched up. they ended up going with the white because it's harder to see scratches.  knock on wood- i have not experienced any defects with the nano casing or lcd screen. (in reference to the numerous lawsuits being filed)  the color screen is amazingly clear. i wear super tight ultra low rise jeans and the nano easily slips into my front pocket!   i've never owned, touched, or used an ipod previous to this gift-  but i use mac. being able to use my "magic bone" (yeah i'm one of those nerds who name inanimate objects) for ical, contacts, and notes is simply fabulous! currently i'm running jaguar so i had to use isync to synchronize my files- but it's really not a big hassle... though i may change my mind when i upgrade to tiger later on this week. i kept reading info saying you HAD to have 10.4--- NOT TRUE! you just have to do one extra step- click the options button on itunes.  if you're going to get a nano- get the 4GB!!!! I'm probably going to give my 2GB to a friend and buy the 4GB... 500 songs is really not enough... plus- i had to delete the entire song directory just so i could download some applications from a friends computer. if you plan on using the nano for data storage and music- get the 4GB!!!!  SENUTI- google it- i didn't realize til last week that you couldn't transfer music FROM the ipod nano TO your computer. This program is freeware- and works perfectly for transfering music files. using the nano with Tiger is just one step easier for syncing your ical and contacts- but i still don't think its necessary to run tiger with your nano.

<Title>Another reason to love Apple
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple is like a a bad marriage. The husband beats the wife but the wife sticks around to take in the name of love. Thats what being an Ipod owner is. Take a product that is "popular amoung the masses" and make it one of the worst products ever to be manufactured, wrap it in white and silver and bam, commercial sussess! Why is it about this liitel Ipod that makes people spend their savings. Not only do ALL Ipods have terrible battery life, but now there are reports surfacing that the screens are some crap and that it fades or becomes almost to hard to read after like two weeks. It seems that one must handle this new Nano like a paper crane, when its supposed to be something that is easy to transport.   All in all the Nano proves that Apple is sacrificing workmanship in exchanges for trendiness. Its sad when Americans waste 200.00 for a product that will essentially do nothing but let them down. Apple shouldnt release such a defective product until it can come up with the technology to make it durable. The idea is there, but the workmanship isnt.  So if your one of those urban-wannabe-chic-metrosexual-look at me and my liitle Nano type of people, do your self a favor. Save your money and buy a Walkman cassette player.   Long live 8-Trac!

<Title>Just fascinating over and over again
<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Every time I  look at the little black nano I am surprised about its size, its feel and its capabilities...the menus work well, the wheel responds fast (er than my 30 GB iPOd photo) and updating it via USB isnt as much of a pain inthe brain as I initially feared it might be...   downsides are:   its either PC or Mac compatibility , NOT both...(and I thought i could use it as a convenient way to transfer files)  and....its princesslike behavior towards anything that touches it...the little jeanpocket Steve put it in? hm. nothing in it...but it has scratches when i took it out...a cloth to polish sunglasses (the high quality super-technical stuff that comes with Ray Bans)..scratches it too...  But this lead to the development of our nano leather sleeves...so bad things have a good outcome sometimes, you can find it by searching for a "nano sleeve" here on amazon.   Buy a nano, be happy and remember: WRAP WHAT YOU LOVE!

<Title>Killer Gadget BUT a case is a MUST!!!!
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, I received my custom engraved 2GB white iPod nano yesterday and had about 4 hours playing with it and these are my ideas about it...(already have a 1 GB shuffle) 1. Packing (might not be a whole lot but it means something): Very simple yet elegant packing, box and Apple sign look so classy on it. Once you open it, the iPod is safely embedded in hard card board where it fits snuggly. Now on the back of the iPod is a *small* piece of plastic with 5 lines (yes 5 lines) that gives you the how to instructions...Now I'd like ANY of the mp3 manufacturers out there who claim to be 'iPod killers' to show me the instructions on how to use their mp3 players...please give me a break...the manual for the nano is like 10 folded pages...very simple and to the point!  2. Look and feel:  Not much to say here, everyone has seen this thing and yes it is VERY VERY small, you might think it's delicate however it's very hard and sturdy. As for the feel...this thing feels solid...not like some cheap mp3 player out there.  3. Scratchability and finger print-catchability: Personally, I have NOT removed the plastic film all along the front because from the glossiness and shine of the surface it's clear that even tiny dust particles will scratch the surface if you try and wipe it off with anything even  with your fingers or a soft cloth. Now the thing that everyone's been kinda ignoring it is the finger prints on the back, I had prepared myself by washing my hands before handling it (sounds crazy but I did it after I saw the shinyness of the back), after charging the iPod and putting some pictures on it, I held it in my hand for a little - about 30 minutes or so-(hey you know I've been patient for 3 charging hours, now's the time to play) I basically played a few songs, a few podcasts, then I was brave enough to flip the iPod over and look at the 'shiny' glossy back and oh my god, I was shocked at the amount of finger prints all over the back. This thing is a finger print MAGNET...now to clean the back I had to use a piece of cloth that came with Oakley glasses...it took me roughly 15 minutes to clean the back 'cautiously' such that the glossy back doesn't scratch while I'm cleaning the finger prints.  4. Charging: 1 hour and the battery sign was full, but since this was a first charge I left it 3 hours just to charge the battery completely.  5. Usability: For being the first iPod I have with a screen it took me roughly 2 minutes to figure out how to navigate the menus back and forth and to play songs and to view the pictures...very simple and very straight forward.  Conclusion: Great gadget but having a case for it is a MUST if you want to save the great looks, otherwise don't regret losing the looks and ending up with just the great performance. I'm personally thinking of buying the double layer iSkin Duo for the iPod nano..and till then my iPod nano is going to be wrapped in the plastic it came in in the box, I don't want to spoil the looks of my cute iPod.

<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought my nano today and i have to say, it is simply amazing. the sound quality is great, it sounds just like the speakers i use for my comp. the interface is incredibly simple, and i like the wheel feature, you just have to run your finger over it and it will move. However, the only complaint i have with the nano is that the back gets scratched up easily. BY THE WAY FOR EVERYONE WHO SAYS NANO SCRATCHES EASY NANO IS MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE ORIGINAL IPOD. the back is soooo nice, but once u get fingerprints on it, it looks old. I'd recommend buying a scratch-removing cream from walmart, or any other store like that. you can also get them on ebay for about 7 bucks a tube. This is my first ipod and i simply love it!

<Content>I actually bought my Nano used (only 6 mo. old) from my brother-in-law upgrading to the iPod 80 gig. It holds all my songs but I've had to reformat as the songs began messing up - Never thought an audio file could run at higher speed. Think 45 rpm sped up to 78 rpm. Weird. I hated the iPod buds as they wouldn't stay in my ears. Wish I could delete songs direct from my iPod or at least when connected to my PC. Otherwise it helps alot with my dreary commute by train.

<Title>Needs to hold more songs and how do you put photos on it!
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ipod nano is OK but is not great it can hold some more song and is a huge pain to put photos on it because the camera adapter does not work with the ipod nano.If you want to get an ipod nano get the new one which can hold up to 500 songs,1,000 songsor 2,000 songs and comes in 6 colors and the colors are Blue,Pink,Black,Green,Silver and Red.(Red is only sold on [...]).

<Title>My Favorite New Toy
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Commuting to work I often wondered how this teeny-tiny gadget that I see other commuters have "plugged" in their ears work and just what was the "craze".  When I finally gotten up the nerve and purchased my iPod, after very easy registering and downloading, I now have my answer as to what everyone have "plugged" in their ears.  The sound is incredible and it is now a pleasure to know I never have to carry around a CD player with a gazillion CD's!  I'm elated that I've made it to the 21st Century -- it is a wonderful investment, especially for someone who is not savvy in computer-downloading.

<Content>you guys should really consider on getting on getting this ipod ano. It is really great. Im not a huge fan of the 2nd generation ipod nanos so i got this one because of its style and look. Also apple doesn't make this kind of ipod nano anymore so maybe in a few years it will be worth alot of money like the 3rd gen and 1st gen ipods. The sound quality is really great. also the way of findong and picking out your own song is really easy. I suggest on getting this ipod nano. This ipod nano is the 1st generation by the way. deffinetly get the 1st generation ipod it is just great

<Title>DECEPTIVE
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item for my boss--it was a group gift. The price was excellent. However, when it arrived, the receipt indicated that it was not new, but a refurbished item. I was appalled as the description never indicated that.  My only recourse was to call Ritz Camera immediately. The representative informed me that all their ipods on amazon are refurbished. When I told her that it was not marked as such, she reiterated that they should be advertised that way and that it was Amazon's mistake. I was told that Ritz would send me an authorization form to make the return...plus the 25 dollar shipping I paid to expedite the item. I am still waiting for the form and it's been almost a month. I e mailed Amazon about the problem but never heard back from them. I also had to send back a sport sleeve accessory that I had purchased on Amazon as well...and also paid shipping. I again e mailed Amazon asking to be able to be credited for the shipping due to this debacle. Never heard back again. I would hesitate to do any buying from Amazon again. There is no recourse and no one to talk to if there is a problem.Buyer beware !!

<Title>Thing of Genius!
<Date>Sun Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Words can't describe how amazing this new product is. IPOD NANO! You might think that I am someone that has bought this product yesterday and don't know how garbage this is. Wrong! I bought it on the first day when it came out and it never lost my approval. Firstly, people say that it is so small that it can break easily. This is the most durable music product that I have ever owned. I dropped it from my head to the floor and from the shelf twice. It still works and looks beautiful. People get angry when this thing is scratched. What can you expect, it is to be portable, and the back is reflectant.  What I dissaprove is the lacking of a charger. You could charge it on the usb port which I do. So i leave the computer on for around four hours lol. The size is amazing. It is so portable that I can listen to it all day, which I do. The screen is crisp and clear, comparing to my cell phone with the same size. I'm suprised that it has a six lines of text on it and photo playback! The click wheel is a thing of genius. It is like two diffent sets of buttons in one. The headphones are great but get a bit tistorted while playing loud. I have 350 songs on it at this moment, but I would recommend getting the 4 gb. I am returning mine for the 4 gb. The orignal ipod cost the same much with 20gb but I'm sticking with the Nano.   Pros: Ultra Small Fast downloading (half a sec per song) shiny back lol Crisp screen clickwheel  Cons: No charger (USB PORT) Scratches easily (not a problem) Too much attention  Beware! This gathers too much attention, it could get stolen easily.  All in all, this is my best investment, and I highly recommend you getting this. 10 Stars!

<Title>Scratches way to easily
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have joined a class action lawsuit against Apple because of how easily the Nano scratches.  For those of you who think this lawsuit is stupid, worthless and for those who think the iPod nano is made exactly the same as previous iPods, you're wrong. I suggest to those who believe this to read the filing that these two law firms filed. It suggests that Apple knowingly made these iPods with thinner materials, making them easier to scratch, to lower manufacturing cost. This is why this lawsuit is not stupid or "bull". A company who makes a bad product knowingly should be held accountable!  I have five iPods; iPod mini, a 20GB iPod, an iPod shuffle, an iPod U2 Edition, & iPod nano. All of them have gone into my hoodie pocket that contains nothing else (no keys, no pens, paper, etc.). All of them are scratch free except the iPod nano. I bought the iPod nano September 15, 2005 at Best Buy and took it home where I laid the box on my desk. It stayed there until Monday morning where I took it out of the box (for the first time) and loaded all the music I wanted onto it. I was leaving for vacation that day by the way. I put the Nano in my hoodie pocket, with nothing else in there, and left for the bus. A few moments into my trip and I took the Nano out of my soft cotton made hoodie pocket and it was scratched badly enough already that it is hard to see what is on the screen.  I feel I, and everyone else who has a scratched iPod nano, am entitled to a new iPod nano from Apple, however, all I really want Apple to do is admit that they have a bad product out there and I want them to fix it for future iPod nanos (which I have no doubt they've already done). Maybe before you commit on a case such as this, you should get off your lazy ass and actually do some reading and research. Not all lawsuits are frivolous!

<Title>Worthless Software
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll start off by saying that I am biased against apple.  I bought this thing for my mom because she wanted something small and thought this looked cool.  The software for this is some of the worst I have ever used in my life.  I thought that the creative labs MediaScource was bad but I was wrong.  One thing that I could never figure out is why USB devices are so annoying to install.  You can't plug it in prior to installing the software and if you do you're SOL.  After installing and uninstalling every bit of the drivers that came with this thing I still cannot get iTunes to recognize the iPod even though Windows does.  And of course it will not function without iTunes.  Even during the installation when it tries to format the iPod it just stalls out (much to my dismay the progress bar is just on a set loop; so it does not actually show any progress).    I am not a fan of any of the MP3 player software; I personally would like to see it function like a removable storage device.  Just move whatever files you want over and it will play anything that's a supported file type (just like an MP3 CD you put in your car).  But it is especially annoying when the software you need won't recognize your device even though everything else does.

<Title>I have lotsa toys, but the Ipod Nano is awesome!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a lot of audio equipment.  My main system headphone amp is worth $1000 by itself.  I love music.  Mainly classical.  I am also a geek, and love portable audio. I have had cassettes, and have minidisc.  I have had hard drive players by Creative, Rio, Archos, eDigital, iRiver, going back to the Creative Jukebox 1.  I wanted an iPod Mini, but they are discontinued.  So I got a iPod Nano 2gb.  Had it for about a week.  IT IS AWESOME.  The best portable player I  have tried.  Interface, sound, size, screen.  Just great!  The software (iTunes) is ok.  It is not perfect, but does the job well.  Creative has a good software package, and the iRiver makes you use Windows Media Player or the like...it comes with no software.  The iPod comes with two nice bonus features.  1) Podcasts.  Sound files from sources all over the net, that can be added and updated to your iPod automatically when you connect it to PC. 2) [...].  Audible Manager does not work with the iPod, but you CAN play files you legally download with Audible Manager to your computer!  There is also online music purchasing from iTunes website.  I don't use that though.  Too bad iPod can't work with Rhapsody, my current online service.  Proponents of other brands say the fact that the iPod batteries cannot be user changed is bbbbbaaaaddddd.  I thought that.  Now I don't mind.  Apples battery service is only $60 (check their website for details).  A battery for other brands is usually $50. Little difference.  Not many accessories out for Nano yet.  I ordered a case for it online from eBay (no, don't get your ipod from eBay).  Downsides: I wish I had gotten the 4gb! You can only charge Nano with USB cable connected to your PC (cable supplied).  An optional charger from Apple is $30! There are cheaper substitutes out there, but buyer beware! The Nano scratches easily.  But I got it to listen to music with, not visually adore, though I do....  I gave the iPod Nano five stars.  It's worth it. Too me, it's only main competitor is Creative Zen Micro.  I have one of these too.  Yeah, Geek.  But the Zen will not play protected files [...] (I think it will with the update of firmware, but I did not like this update).  If you decide to purchase a player, make sure you have a good return policy.  One comment..the itunes software is strange in some functions.  Like it does not use the word "delete".  To delete something, you use "Clear".  Weird.  As usual, provided help files leave a bit to be desired.

<Title>So easy to scratch you wished it was an itch!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I saw it.  I loved it.  I wanted it.  I paid $250 for it.  It ordered it engraved.  I finally got it.  I loved it even more.  It looked good.  It sounded good.  It was exactly as advertised.  Until.  Until the second day.  It was scratched so badly you would think some cat had a fever.  If you have to have one, get a sleeve for it first.  Don't open the box until you get a sleeve!  Then be sure you use the softest cloth possible to put it in its sleeve.  Then never, ever take it out of its sleeve.  In a sleeve, it may not look as cool as the product you bought but it won't have any scratches on it.  Well at least not as many.  At least then you'll be able to see the screen.  Apple is usually a pretty good manufacturer but I haven't a clue how this product got by their quality control department.

Once i bought it i couldn't believe how wonderful is this player, no comments about ITunes.  As everything pretty you have to take care of it so it can continue looking pretty, as the same as a car or everything else.  I didn't take off the cover from the face so it's all good, i'll get the silicone cover later, anyway is not a matter of showing it to everybody, it's a listening to music thing.

This product was purchased under the "used" category but the seller, true to their comments about it being either a return or store display item seemed accurate. The IPOD seemed brand new and there have been no problems with it. The seller said all features had been tested. I think they must have been very diligent in their assessments. Again, we've had no problems with it and our daughter was so excited about getting an IPOD for Christmas. We could not have afforded one in any other way.

<Content>I LOVE the iPod nano! Sure, there's the 4GB version but I see no need in spending more money when I can get this less expensive one that holds 500 songs.  I love the style and yes, be careful that it doesn't get scratched. For this, I recommend getting a iPod case.   The iPod 2GB nano is very small and handy. The navigation is super easy. I love that unlike other mp3 players, you can organize your songs. You don't have to click 6,000 times just to get to one song!  If you want a nice trendy mp3 player that can store a decent amount of songs AND that isn't as expensive as the recent iPods, then this is the one for you. :)

<Title>Love My Nano! Better Than I Expected!
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Upon asking for any mp3 player for my birthday, my husband went above and beyond and got me the White 2 GB iPod Nano. I've been overly impressed with its performance and durability thus far! I don't have a huge music library so the 2 GB is more than enough for my needs and I don't ever see myself using it for all of its capabilities - since I mainly wanted an mp3 player for the gym. But for the more experienced, all-inclusive iPod user this little guy does it all, and with ease! Transfer speed is faster than I would have expected, and installation was a cinch as long as you follow the directions they give you EXACTLY! If you plug in your iPod before installing iTunes you ARE going to have trouble with iTunes recognizing it.  The 4-star rating is more in relation to my issues with the iTunes software, which I found a little less than user-friendly. Simple things like right-clicking on the name of the track to rename it isn't possible (you have to click once, pause and click again). I think the design is a little overly simplistic, which leaves a need for general-use explanation. Other than little things here and there iTunes is nicely automated to sync with all of your music and picture folders.  One bone I have to pick with Apple is this...you release a great product and practically NO accessories??? This product has been out for over a month now, and the only thing available (thank goodness) is the armband. You'd think at the very least they would have also released the protective sleeves...but apple.com and even Amazon don't show it's availability for another 2 weeks or so. I can't wait for the accessories to come out since I'd love to get something to play this in my car.  Overall - great product, maybe a little pricey given the other varieties that are out there. But I think you're paying a premium for the size (or lack thereof), and flashiness of it all. I personally was glad I received the Nano as opposed to a full-sized iPod. I held my friends a few days after I got my Nano and I couldn't imagine using it at the gym with how heavy it was. I think the newest generation iPods (with video) are slightly smaller and lighter than the old ones, though.

<Title>Once again amazed by Apple
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The ipod Nano is (in my opinion) the best ipod that Apple has ever made. It is also one of the smallest MP3 players so it's easy to hold. Also if you have an ipod mini, this is a good upgrade. Here's some stuff you should know before buying one.  The size: Impossibly small. Thats all there is to it. And the only way you'll truly understand is if you hold one.   The screen: Perfected but very small. But what can you expect, the ipod itself is small. Besides, a 2-inch screen is fine for music, a little too small for pictures, but at least its in color. Everything looks better on a color screen!   The sound: Awesome sound! (if it didn't have good sound I probably would have rated it 3 stars) Along with the screen, the sound is also perfected. No static, no skips. Nothing to mess up your songs. Its simple, you press play and you hear music, not static. Clean, sweet, music.  The games: A great, fun, waste of time. I especially like music trivia, where they play part of one of your songs and you have to try to guess what song it is. The other games are Brick (similar to pong), solitaire (you know, the card game), and parachute. All of the games are really fun ways to occupy your time, great for when your stuck in a terminal waiting for a plane.  The photos: The photo storage is one of the main reasons I bought this ipod. The 20 GB ipod photo may store more photos, but the Nano is smaller and less expensive. It holds enough pictures for any photography geek to be satisfied with. I also enjoy the slideshows with music feature, it's fun to mess around with. I'd say, this is the second best way to occupy your time (the games are a clear first place).  The headphones: No. I do not like the headphones at all. They have a weird shape that isn't that comfortable. I use the headphones from my old MP3 player because I simply do not like them.  Downloading music: Itunes is very easy and fast. The only problem with it is, if you are one who likes hundreds of songs, you'll end up spending enough money to buy an 60 GB ipod with video, and that wouldn't be very good, would it. If this is you, limewire is only fifty bucks away.  Here's a list of accessories you might want to consider buying. 1.) Some sort of ipod Nano armband for those of you who run. It isn't fun having to carry an MP3 player when your trying to run. Trust me. 2.) An ipod Nano dock so you can connect to a computer and get songs and photos easier and faster. It won't kill your bank account, only about $30. 3.) Any earphones or headphones from Bose are great, but if Bose isn't in your budget, still buy new headphones because like I said, the ipod headphones stink. 4.) An itrip FM transmitter to listen to the radio on your ipod. They dont have their own radios like most other MP3 players do.  Overall, the ipod Nano is Apple's best MP3 player with a great screen, great sound, and a great size. This MP3 player is for anyone, kids, adults, grandparents, makes a great gift and is somewhat affordable. I hope you take my advise and buy the Ipod Nano because you will be as amazed and satisfied as I am.

<Title>It's good...yet bad
<Date>Sat Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This ipod is pretty much a shrunk down version of the ipod photo. It does all the same things including playing music and slide shows. There of course are a few problems. For one the ipod scratches like no other. If you barley even touch you will see a mark on the body. Just a minor touch to the screen makes a mark that is easily visible. Another problem wiht the ipod is that it cracks in half easily. My friend sat down with it in his pocket and it cracked in half rigth down the middle. All in all I have to say that I just don't like this ipod. I do know that you can buy a case for it but it costs almost 30 dollers to buy a case that isn't that good. I would highly recomend buying the new ipod that can play videos.

<Content>So I got the iPod nano, 2GB in white for my sweet 16. I LOVE IT. Only my second mp3 player, but my first flash player. It looks so small in the commercial, but is TINY in your hands. I got fingerprints on the back too easily, and there is some mark on the front already, but other than that its ok. I've heard it scratches easily. It comes with some games, like solitaire, blocks, parachute, and a music game. You can sync your calendar and contacts with it, whether you use a Mac or PC. The sound is great. The earphones that come with it don't fit in my ears, so I use my own. The click wheel is fun. Kind of strange if its your first iPod, but its easy to get into. Also, you can customize the main menu, if you dont want to go through multiple menus to get to "repeat" you can just put it on the main menu. It doesn't come with an adapter, you have to plug it in to the computer to charge it, or buy an adapter. I think that kind of sucks, but when am I without my computer? Overall, its great. Everything I wanted and more.

<Title>Small But Perfectly Formed !!
<Date>Thu Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok... This might be the first iPod that I've owned but I've been an admirier of Apple's work for some time. I have several friends with various generations of the original iPod and always loved the combination of art and technology that goes into them.  I had been the owner of a Sony mp3 player for about 2 years and until this summer had no reason to think about replacing it. 256meg of memory seemed enough for me and it was small too. What more did I need really ?? However, over the summer my trusty sony got washed and so it was time to look for something to replace it.   In the run up to my birthday Apple launched the Nano and I instantly fell in love with it. I have no real need for 60 gigabytes of storage but knew that 256 meg was limiting the amount of music I could carry around with me. Even the 2gig version which held 500 songs would be fine for me. I added a Nano to my birthday wish list and waited !!  Last Friday I opened up the sleek box to feast my eyes on my Nano for the first time. Even though I'd read pages of reviews about the player, I was still amazed at the size (or lack of size) of this unit. It's just tiny !! Not so small that you'd lose it but small enough that when It's in your pocket you can forget its there. The screen is so bright and clear and the sound !!.... WOW. For such a small player, it certainly packs quite a punch in the volume department. Full volume would certainly lead to hearing damage after a short time.  The iTunes software that comes with it is easy to install and easy to use. I was soon burning my CD's onto my PC with ease. A 10-12 track CD takes around 2-3 minutes to load onto the PC but uploading those same songs onto the iPod takes a fraction of that time. Infact on day 1 I loaded about 450 songs onto my player and it can't have taken more than 5 or 6 minutes. The product specs say that the 2gig version will hold 500 songs. Well I've got about 560 on mine at the moment and there is still about 250 meg free. I'm sure that the actual storage capabilities depend on the length of the songs you're loading.  I'd read lots about the problems with early versions of the Nano with regard to failing screens and scratches etc. but guess what ??... stuff gets scratched and damaged, thats just how it is. if you;re silly enough to think that anything will stay as pristine as the day it was bought, then you're bound to be dissappointed. I will be buying a case for mine (probably an Agent18 hard case) because I want to keep it in the best shape possible. I'd reccommend others do the same, not because it will fall apart if you don't but because when you're spending $200 on something, you want to look after it !!  I'm not going to tell anyone that the iPod Nano is the best value mp3 player on the market. There are plenty of others that have it beat hands down in terms of storage and price. However, I am willing to say that It's probably the sexiest mp3 player around and has the competition beat when it comes to looks. Add to that the fact that 500+ songs is probably more than enough for most users, that the quality of the sound is excellent and that (sor far) battery life has been up there with most of the others on the market, this really is an awesome piece of kit and well worth considering if you don't need the ability to carry around 25,000 songs !!  Bottom line... if you want a great looking player that is very capable and also has some neat additional functions that most of the others don't have then get out there and get yourself a Nano. If you want something thats gonna hold thousands and thousands of songs and withstand you throwing it around all the time, look elsewhere !!  I love mine  Mark

<Title>Overall a very good mp3 player

<Content>I just bought my ipod nano today and I love it. It's truly an incredible device. Despite the negativness about scratches and the screen flaws, I took my precautions in advance and I'm able to enjoy this great mp3 player. I carry in an elegant silicon case which I bought from ebay at a very reasonable price.  Pros: Excellent and ergonomic design Very small size thus very protable Excellent screen Functional buttons (the wheel works fine even though I haven't removed the plastic tape and I carry it in a silicone case) Satisfactory sound quality Cool extra features  Cons: The headphones that come with the nano need replacment, the sound quality comes out very poor No extra accesories in the box, apart from the bad headphones, the useless for most people dock adapter and the USB cable iTunes is necessary or it won't load The expensive accesories It scratches easily   Overall its a great mp3 player, that you can really enjoy if you have some things in mind: You should first buy protective case against scratces You should first buy a good pair of headphones You should treat the device with care because it's more fragile compared to other versions of ipod

<Title>BAD DESIGN
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This IPOD is just not worth it.  After trading in my older IPOD for the nano, I was shocked at how scratched this one gets.  Then, after putting it in my pocket--as advertised--the screen cracked under very, very little pressure.  This is a design flaw that is becoming well known and will lead to this product's demise.

<Title>Flimsy junk
<Date>Mon Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I left the plastic film on to protect the front from getting scratched, but it still broke after two months.  No sound, picture or power - what gives? Don't pay just for the Apple name - buy a better mp3 player for half the price and double the build quality
