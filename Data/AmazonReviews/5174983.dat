<Title>Great drive/player combo

<Content>This item is very well though out. If your looking for something a little more than just a thumb drive this is one you should consider. It lacks any display but the touch sensitive buttons just plain WORK and there is a lockout feature so it can be stuffed into a pocket without changing settings. It's simple yes, but it's sleek, rugged, and holds a charge well. Even without any equalizer, the sound quality is worth adding a better set of headphones.   
<Overall>5
