<Content>What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks.

<Title>My second iPod shuffle.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Wll, they are small, so I misplaced my first one (I 512k).  Found it later.  But I figure that it will wear out anyway (even if switches go on forever, batteries WILL eventually die) given the heavy use I put it to.  I really like the fact that it does no need an external cord like the newer ones, which is why I bought it even though it was the same price as the newer one.  I also use it mostly in the car, since I do not tend to like headphones.  Also, the iTunes has gotten better as a program, but I have not bought anything better from the service.  I had a CD collection before I got the iPod, and feeding in my older CDs has gotten me to reacquaint myself with a good many CDs.   Now, about that vinyl...

<Title>Big on Hype - Small on Performance
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money.  Don't buy this one.. keep looking.  This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player.  This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music.  Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music.  This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.  My iPod Shuffle irreparably died after one year and one month - just one month after the warranty ended.  I've heard similar horror stories so I know that I'm not the only one to have experienced this.  Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like "hold" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.  Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year.

<Content>I received my shuffle promptly, but unfortunately have had problems with it.  It downloads properly, but won't shuffle the songs (they play in the same order all the time), and some songs have never played at all. My daughter ordered one at the same time, and hers works perfectly, so maybe it's just my particular product, but I have been very disappointed.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This little device works really well. The battery life is as advertised. There is no skip what so ever unlike the iPod, so this is ideal for running. It is small and light and easy to take with you cycling or running and great for skiing and snowboarding. Another great feature some may overlook is the storage factor. This product also serves as a thumb drive so instead of buying a 512 thumb drive and using it for storage if your a college student like i am, you can buy a 512 shuffle and alot as much memory as you want to storage and to music for only $20 more...good deal. Ive read some reviews that say there is no "hold" feature and this is false. If you hold down the play button for a few seconds it will "hold."

<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is going to make my weight lifting MUCH easier  If you thought that the iPod was small, then you're gonna LOVE this thing! it's smaller than most packs of gum!  Some people have been knocking this player's sound quality, but I have found its sound quality to be superb! ---- the player is solidly constructed, very small, and very lite - the perfect exercise companion  Unless you love flipping through playlists, then this is all you really need, in any music player - having an LCD would be nice, but you won't miss it - the price makes this thing a TOTAL steal  and lastly, I'm very impressed by the disk use capabilities - I have already used my 1 gig as a USB drive for some files - I'm very pleased with its versatility - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

<Content>The iPod Shuffle (IPs) is great for working out. Pros -No moving parts, no chance to skip -Easy navigation, don't need to "look" to skip tracks or adjust volume -Headphones sound as good as previous iPods -Price is right Cons -Headphone a *little* long when working out, can get "in the way" when exercizing; your miliage may vary. -Cannot manually sync with more than one computer without erasing the music content  each time you connect to another computer (unlike earlier iPods) -No "repeat" function  Overall, a really well designed product and fun to use. I'd recommend it to parents for youngsters who aren't ready for the responsibility of a "regular" iPod, but want a portable digital music player.

<Title>Got it, returning it
<Date>Mon Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this because I needed instant gratification and everyone was sold out of the 20GB iPod (except for the U2 version, but who wants that?!)  I apparently don't have a USB2.0, so it never got more than 3 files copies over at a time before crashing.  My computer is 2 years old and has been upgraded with RAM, but apparently no amount of RAM is enough to run iTunes on a Windows XP machine.  This was supposed to help in relaxation and reduce stress through music ... not happening. I'm going back to breaking stuff.

<Title>Pros and Cons are silly 
<Date>Tue Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love all the reviews of the iPod Shuffle that list the "Pros" and "Cons", as if you would then look up some other MP3 player and compare its pros and cons to this one.  Is anyone really doing that?    The reason to own this gadget is that it is the current "it" gadget to own.  If you don't get it, i.e., "why no screen?", "why so expensive?", "why does the battery only last 12 hours?", "why is it different?", well, then don't buy it.  You don't get it.  The reason to buy and own this is because once you saw one, once you held one in your hand and marveled at its design/weight/simplicity/smoothness/color and all the rest, you had to have one.  You don't buy the iPod Shuffle because it's "exactly what I need in an mp3 player."  No it isn't.  It's not "exactly" what anyone needs.  But it is the coolest gadget you'll buy this year.  Addendum: Here's a weird thing I've noticed with my shuffle: When in "shuffle" (random) mode, I seem to hear the same songs  more often than one would expect if it were truly random. OR, maybe this is just a trick of the mind associated with all true randomness: we expect random to mean that once we've heard a song, the liklihood that we'll hear it again is really low, when in fact, the liklihood that we'll hear it again is as high as the liklihood that we'll hear ANY of the songs on the player. I guess it depends on how they wrote the "random play" program as well (like, did they include something in the algorithm to exclude the same song being heard twice in a row, even though in true ramdomness, that should be possible).

<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just made a trip to the United Arab Emirates and back (12+ hour flight each way) and although I packed my 20 gig 2G ipod, it never left it's case. I wore the shuffle around my next with headsets in my pocket and they never set up the myriad of security alarms and the batteries lasted forever!  On the return trip I discovered I hadn't shut if off, charged it from my laptop and still managed to use it 99% (watched a movies the other 1%) of the flight and there was still battery left for the additional 3 hours to get home from JFK.  I let Itunes pick the songs and then eyeballed the ones it selected and changed the ones I knew I didn't want.  Did I miss the screen no, did I enjoy the randomness, YES...actually heard songs I'd forgotten I owned.

<Title>Cool gadget...with a flaw
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is a fantastic little device created by the genius designers at Apple.  They know how to make things work. The user interface is very easy  on the Shuffle.  The flashing green and orange dots mean different things, but they don't take long to learn.  The sound is excellent. I was very surprised by how it handles every song and seems to strike the perfect balance in pitch, tone, bass and treble.  The only draw back is that it charges through your USB port.  If you have USB 2.0, it charges fast. However, your computer has to be on for it to get power. If you own a laptop (I own an iBook), your computer has to stay on - you can't charge the USB if the laptop is in sleep mode.  This usually means I am using the laptop's valuable power source to charge the Shuffle and I dont usually keep the laptop on for 4 hours (Apples recommended charge time).  I highly recommend you buy the USB power charger from Apple.  Other than that, the iPod Shuffle is a perfect device for work, studying and just listening to music.  I haven't taken it off in days...

<Title>BLAND
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is disappointing.  Buyer beware, if you plan on using it mainly for a thumb drive that it cannot go in at a certain angle, especially into certain Dell USB ports.  I bought this specifically for a thumb drive use and to listen to mp3s while I walk to class.  I got to class today, tried to plug it in, it would not recognize it through the front port.  Just beware if you are planning on buying it strictly for a thumb drive.  Other than that it is ok.

<Title>Horrible value, a piece of garbage
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my first iPod Shuffle about a year ago (8/05).  It lasted til the following May, and then started to act weird.  The lights would flash, and it would crash my computer, but wouldn't play music.  Took it to the Apple store, they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty.  The new unit lasted a few months, and then it also bit the dust, in the exact same fashion as the first one.  I'm gentle on my iPod, never dropped it, left in the hot car, etc...and yet they both have died on me.    I'd recommend the Creative Zen Nano.  It's cheaper, much easier to add songs to (no iTunes required), and has a small screen that makes it more navigable, not to mention an integrated voice recorder and FM tuner.

<Title>Unreliable.  Cute Design.  Bad Engineering.  Poor Quality Control
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the "Genius" bar. At that appointment, the "genius" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple "genius" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The 'genius" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.  Perhaps it should be retitled the "idiot bar."

<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod shuffle is small and compact, and easy to use. Plus, now that the new version is coming out, this type will be a lot cheaper. I love the shuffle versus other players, because it gives me a chance to listen to all my music, whereas if I could see the song I was listening to, I'd be more apt to go straight to my favorite songs and never listen to all the other great songs I have. I'm a college student, and the shuffle is perfect for me: cheap, small, and durable. **EDIT** Haha, yes the person who commented was right. Itunes has an option that converts songs to 128kbps so that you can fit more songs on your Ipod. I now have 163 songs on it and it is only about half full. This is a great mp3 player for the price. Sorry about the confusion before! Bottom line: If you want a cheap iPod, the shuffle is the way to go.

<Content>I bought my IPOD Shuffle a year ago and a half ago and it crashed on me in 9 months. The Apple store here in India, replaced the same under warranty with another and that one crashed on me again in nine months.  However, in the process, I have become an ardent fan of the extremely user friendly design that I am looking forward to the new and yet to be released 'METAL' version of the same. I just hope this product lasts a lot longer than the warranty period.  I have learnt from experience with Apple products, that if Apple wants a product to last they can make it last and vice-versa.

<Content>The iPod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other iPods. I've had one break on me, and my new one doesn't work on the "shuffle" setting when listening to podcasts -- what I use my shuffle for.  On the other hand, the full-sized iPods don't do the things I need a shuffle for -- mainly, be really, really small and pretty indestructable. However, I haven't tried out any of the new generation of iPods, so they may solve one or both of these difficulties.

Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle. Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere!  On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol!  Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go.  So if you are a fast paced, mobile and not a control freak, then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it!

It almost feels fragile and I'm wondering how long it will hold up in use (for me to use when I run).  The on/off switch is somewhat difficult to move without feeling like I'm squeezing the thing to death.  It seems if Apple had just put a finger nail slot in the slide switch it would have been much easier to use.

<Content>The Ipod Shuffle is an amazing music player. I just got it, and I LOVE it. It never skips (due to the flash player) and is so light, I forget it's in my pocket. It's the easiest thing in the world to hook up to your computer, it charges fast, and it saves you money. If your the type of person who has millions of songs (literally) but doesnt have the time or the enrgy to make playlists, or to shuffle through a million songs on a big ipod, then get this one. It's easy, it's light, and it's really amazing how small it is.

<Title>Don't Buy This
<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is useless and expensive. I don't like ipods in general because they have an internal battery that only lasts 8-12rs new. Which means after a few months of usage, the battery life starts to shorten. Before you know it, you need a new battery which Apple charges a hefty $99 to replace as stated on their website. The ipod shuffle is the worst of ipods.  Here's why:  1. No LCD screen so if you have the 1GB shuffle with 200+ songs on it, have fun pressing next until you get to the song you want.  2. Battery life is horrible. Only 8-12 hours so about 10hrs of realistic battery life. The Sony NW series (NW-E75, NW-E95, NW-E99) have 70hrs of battery life on 1 AAA battery. I have a Sony myself and they're not lying when they say 70hrs.  3. Ipods hold less than half the amount of songs as a Sony with the same storage capacity. The 1GB shuffle holds 240 songs as advertised. The Sony 1GB NW-E99 holds 640 songs. Why? Because Sony has better compression software while delivering the same sound quality.

<Title>Love it! 
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this for about a week and I absolutely love it.  I have never written a review for anything, so I have to say that I am pretty impressed with this. Also, I don't own any other ipod products - this is my first intro. to the ipod world.  I've been reluctant because of how expensive the other gadgets are, and also because I did not want to fuss with setting up docking stations, syncing software, etc. I really like computer stuff to be like a TV - plug it in, turn the power on, and it should WORK the FIRST TIME.  That is exactly what I got with the IPOD shuffle (finally something that works without aggravation).  The iTune software is easy to use to compile and store all your music.  The ipod shuffle really does work like a regular USB.  Sound is incredible (however, I use my own noise-cancelling headphones instead of the in-the-ear headset that I just can't get used to).  Battery life is as stated - about 12 hours off of one charge.  It couldn't be any lighter, doesn't skip, and the buttons are intuitive.  The one GIG version holds a serious amount of music.  While you can't carry around your entire CD collection, you can carry around your very favorite songs from your collection, which is how I've been using it. The cons: The buttons seem so sensitive that I'm a little concerned about durability.  Also, its too bad that this device doesn't include radio.    Overall, I think that it is an excellent MP3 player and it really is worth every cent. I highly recommend it to people who want something very easy to use, don't need to have their entire music collection at their fingertips and for those that are new to MP3 players.  Also, great for those who use public transportation (I don't think this thing plugs into a car stereo like the other ipods).

<Title>ipod shuffle versus creative muvo tx fm
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>hopefully someone will find this helpfull if torn between the two. I have both the muvo and the shuffle. The muvo since Christmas and the Shuffle for week. The muvo is a 256k and the shuffle is the 1g. In comparing the two they both have strong point and week ones. Cost the muvo 97.00 the shuffle was 145.00. Size is comparable. Weight goes to the shuffle. Display to the muvo, although I rarely look at it other than to remember a song title. Feel to the muvo for hefty solid to the shuffle for elegance. Sound quality a draw. The muvo has an equalizer which can be adjusted to suit your needs. The shuffle sounds good all the time. The sound in the shuffle maybe a little truer to the source. Battery life is yet to be determined. The muvo will eat the battery fast if you use the display alot or change settings. The shuffle is still on its first charge after a week. Headphones to the shuffle. They seem to fit better in the ear without jamming them in somewhere. They stay in the ear better and don't fall out.Attachments a draw. The muvo has a nice plastic slip case with a clip for the belt or pocket like a cell phone. The case has a hole for a lanyard of your choice. The shuffle has a lanyard only.Software to the shuffle. The itunes is alot easier to look at and more fun to use. The creative media source is utilitarian, but works fine. I use these items for walking and yoga and find them both to be great products. My biggest concern with the shuffle is the fact of the replacement of the rechargeable batteries. My hope is in time when I need to do that there will be a less expensive alternative. Also, consider the fact of buying batteries over the same time period for the muvo. You could get rechargeables and see how that works. The shuffle does have a battery pack attachment which will add life and make it weigh a little more than the muvo. If you go that route the shuffle would go on and on but with battery power. I hope this helps someone with their purchase. The reviews I read were helpfull to me. You can't go wrong with either choice. I use both and would not hesitate to recommend either.

<Title>iPod suffle - Pros vs. Cons
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: Good price for flash MP3 player Slick looking  Cons: Where are all the goodies for MP3? (No LCD, No EQ, No changable battery - would it cost another $100 dollar as other iPods?, etc.) No lyric supports. (Yes, I said lyric support. Some places you can download the lyric with music so when you play the music the lyric shows on your LCD. Thanks to no LCD technology.) No voice recording, FM options, etc.  (The SanDisk makes MP3 players at same cost with LCD/VR/FM/EQ/ etc.)  Well I think this iPod Suffle for following people: who just want to listen 100-200 songs in random without any options. (Why don't you just listen on FM radio?)

<Title>What the shuffle is, what it isn't
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My shuffles got delivered last weekend. I ordered a 1GB for myself, and a 512MB for my wife. Since the 512MB version is for my wife's B-Day, I had to keep them hidden through the weekend. I set up both, and I will discuss the 1GB since it's the one I've spent time with.  Packaging: True to form, this is another example of excellent Apple packaging. The green box is distinctive, and obviously will be the color of choice for all shuffle related packaging. One interesting note is the package has a "loop" plastic closure tab, so these things are meant to be hanging on a display rack. I imagine we will eventually see these things for sale everywhere. Opening the box revealed a simple set-up... laynard, earbuds, and the shuffle. Beneath the contents was a small CD folder containg iTunes and instructions. I actually haven't read the instructions yet, but intend to once I don't have to keep the thing hidden from my wife.  Shuffle: Man, this thing is light. Almost disturbing at first, it just doesn't feel like anything. However, I got past this once it was in my pocket. It's great because you don't know it's there... ie there when you want it, not in the way when you aren't using it. The slider switch for Off, Playlist, Shuffle was stiff at first, but after moving it a few times it became easier. (Of note, this was hard to operate when my hands were cold, so be aware of this). The navigation ring is very simple and obvious. Play/Pause, Forward, Back, Vol Up, Vol Down. That's it. The battery button is cool, I would like to see some times for how much juice is left when it is amber, but otherwise cool idea.  Setup: Taking the cap off of the USB connector, you see either 1GB or 512MB printed on the connector. I have an older mac, so I only have USB 1.1. This wasn't a big deal. The mac recognized the player, asked me to name and register it, and we were ready to go. iTunes has a new window for the Shuffle, giving choices on Auto-Fill or Manual, Source for autofill, and a few other settings. Hitting the iPod button gives more advanced settings such as auto-conversion to 128kbs AAC from other formats, and setting aside memory allocation to use as a data storage device.  I set mine up for 256MB data storate, 744 MB of music. I chose a specially designed playlist as my source, and hit Auto Fill. iTunes picked approx 190 songs from this list randomly, and started to transfer. USB 1.1 transfer time was approx 15 minutes (glacially slow compared to firewire), but really, this was OK since I'm going to use USB to charge the thing anyway, which takes 4 hours.  Use: I got to use it for the first time yesterday on my walk to work. I use my 40GB iPod in shuffle mode while walking anyway, so this was no different. Sound quality is excellent. It fits in any pocket, and while I haven't used the lanyard yet, it does look like a great solution for occasions where you don't have pockets. I'm sure it will look a little dorky at first, but I have a sneaky feeling that everyone will be wearing these things like jewelry very soon.  As a flash-memory key, it is formated in FAT-32 (windows) format, which is handy.  You can use it effortlessly between mac and windows, transfering files, pictures, etc.  Very useful, and it is plug and play ready for this purpose.  Two thing that I really appreciate: 1. Weight. It's so light, as discussed earlier. Just perfect for walking / biking / working out. 2. Navigation ring. Far superior to scroll wheel for use while in my pocket. Very easy to get to by feel through my coat, pants or shirt. Easy to change volume, fast forward, pause, etc. Just brilliant, simple engineering.  iPod -vs- Shuffle: The shuffle isn't for everyone. The lack of a screen makes it a tough primary player unless your only use is for working out / walking around. Not usefull at all as a source of listening for a home stereo, maybe usefull in the future in the car. However, I doubt I'll every use my 4th gen, 40GB iPod as a portable device again. I think it's found its permanent place in my home stereo, as a complete substitution for CDs. The shuffle is perfect for my mobile needs... I'm not just saying this as an Apple fan... it is PERFECT as a mobile MP3 player. Just music, long battery life, low cost, and seemless integration with iTunes. Even USB 1.1 transfer times are tolerable since you have to charge the thing anyway.  I was hesitant when the shuffle was announced, but now I see the light. I can't wait to give my wife hers, I'm sure she will absolutely love it. It looks like her mini is going to find a permanent home in the car.

<Title>Great for what it is: A simple flash based player
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Simple and elegant. This is what makes the ipod line great. I have owned a 20gb ipod for just over 2 years. It just happens to be the biggest ipod ever made as it is a second generation machine. I have used it long and hard enough that I have replaced the battery. With Etymotic Research ER-6 earbuds, the sound is phenomenal. So, why a shuffle?  I commute about 2 hour a day using buses, trains and subways. As a female, I don't always have pockets or belts to attach my ipod. It is usually in my bag. As I get jostled around, I don't know how many times that either the earbuds are pulled out of the ipod or out of my ears (ouch).  At first I wouldn't even consider the shuffle, but as I thought about it, I realized it would be great for the commute for the following reaons:   1. I can listen to all the songs that I have purchased through iTunes. 2. I can listen to audiobooks downloaded from Audible. 3. The ipod is light and hangs around my neck so there is no trying to find a place for it in my bad and/or losing the song as the earbuds get ripped out of the ipod or my ears. 4. As I tend to lose stuff, I am not going to be as upset to lose a $150 shuffle as opposed to the 20GB ipod that I paid a premium for as an early adopter. 5. I tend to listen to the same 200 or so songs out of the 1900 I have on my ipod.  So, what do I think now that I have it in hand? I like it. I like it a lot. The sound quality is surprisingly the same as with the ipod. With $100-$150 earphones there seems to be no difference. It is light and works great for the commute. I'm not hung up on the fact that it does not have a screen I did put a few favorite songs on twice so it would be more likely to show up. Also, if I want, I can set it to play in order and those songs will come up. Rating songs in iTunes is very helpful for this. All in all it makes a great supplement to my regular ipod.  One of the things that did upset me though is this: It is supposed to work with all macs; however, there is a caveat. You *may* need an adaptor or better yet the ipod shuffle dock if the shuffle doesn't fit "some computers" (sarcasm mine). I blithely assumed it would be some Windows box. Come to find out that it is too big for the recessed usb ports on the eMac. I was livid. I felt that two Apple made items should be compatible. I borrowed a male to female usb cable and it worked fine, and I also have a Powerbook that I can charge it with, but it was an unpleasant surprise.   The shuffle is not for everyone as it lacks the features of its more expensive brothers and sisters as mentioned in previous reviews. However, I believe it is perfect for what it is, and it exceeded my expectations as a device (compatibility issues aside).   *Note (2/10/05) I just found out I can fast forward, rewind and set bookmarks in audiobooks with the Shuffle. That bumps the rating to 5 stars! I just can not change it on the scale section. kmm

<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nice little gadget to have around in:  a. The Office: you can use it as a USB memory to transfer files from/to any computer. I personally own a PowerBook from Mac, and have no problem at all transfering files from my Mac to any Windows laptop or desktop. Just plug it in - It's great!  b. The Gym: I own a larger iPod, but always prefer to take my Shuffle to the gym. It's so small and lightweight. I've dropped it many times and it is increadibly resistent also.  c. Home: I use it everytime pluged in to my Stereo via the AUX input. I just use a cheap 3.5mm to 3.5mm that I got from RadioShack.  d. Car: I use it either with a FM transmit adapter or sometimes with a Cassette Adapter I got from Walmart (both).  The only thing I don't like from the Shuffle is the fact that it doesn't have a display to see which song is playing.

I bought just when it was released because I dont like the regular ipod, its too heavy and expensive toy to go jogging with.   Pros: Easy to use. Fill and listen with excellent iTunes integration. Cons: Got rusty in a few months. I live near the ocean and now Im having problems connecting it to the computer.  Botton line.. Now with ipod Nano, I dont know if I would buy...

<Title>Great alternative to spending a lot on a standard iPod
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I left my "real" iPod on a plane one day and replaced it with the Shuffle. I figured since I nearly always listened to my music on shuffle mode anyway and because it fit a few hundred songs--well more than I can hear in a given train commute for a week--it would be acceptable. It's odd not knowing what is playing, but overall I like it most because it slips into any pocket without bulging or scratching. And if I lose it I am out less than $100 vs. $300 for the real deal.

<Title>Same connection problems as every other ipod & mandatory itunes
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a 3rd generation 20GB ipod that stopped working after about a year. Instead of buying another one, I got the 1 GB shuffle as a present.   However, no matter what ipod I've used I've always had horrendous problems connecting them to any Windows machines. With the 20GB ipod I managed to get it working on 1 of 4 machines I tried. Unfortunately this wasn't the PC where I had my mp3s, cue lots of annoying copying. Even connecting to this computer became hit and miss later, but by then the ipod died anyway.  I haven't been able to connect the shuffle I was given to either of my home pcs, no matter what I try. I'm about ready to ebay or stamp on it (would make me feel better).  Additionally, apple forces you to use iTunes, which I personally really dislike, and you can't transfer mp3s from your ipod to another computer... etc. etc.  Although the actual hardware design is nice (probably why they're so popular) unless you want to be constricted in what you can do with an mp3 and be forced to use iTunes AND spend hours searching internet forums trying to find out how to just get the bloody thing to connect, stay away from ipods and buy a less trendy but less hassle mp3 player from someone else (you'll get more for your money anyway)

<Title>This is a great iPod!
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> I love my iPod shuffle! I got mine last year for my Birthday in September and it still works like it did when I got it! I have dropped it a huge amount of times on surfaces like concrete, asphault, carpet, laminate floors and a ton more. I've even accidentally stepped on it a couple times! It's lack of screen can either be a good or bad thing depending on your outlook on life:). It's good because no screen=no cracking and scratching. But sometimes you wish you had a screen like when you have lots of songs and want to listen to a certain song but can't find it. To over come this problem, I placed all my songs in alphabetical order and memorized their positions. I don't carry it around with me when I go jogging or anything else, so I just use it in my home on my speakers. Overall, this is a great iPod for those who a)Don't or can't afford an iPod nano or iPod video (Like me), b)Clumbsy (also like me), or c) those who a afraid of getting a cracked or scratched screen. Thanks for reading my review!

<Title>Good for what it's meant to be.
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is not your photo/video iPod. So you can't compare it with them. It's the most basic version of iPod. It's meant to be loaded with songs & listen to them in the order you loaded them or in random order (shuffle).  It doesn't have the lovely controls of an regular iPod, but has only the basic. There's a play/pause button in the centre surrounded by volume up/down & next/previous track all around it in a circle. They work very well.  It has a USB connector on one end which you use with your computer. This unit also works like any other USB drives, to store data. When used with iTunes, you can control how much music/data you want stored on it.  However, when you transfer 2 different playlists on it, you won't be able to switch between them, they'll be one on your shuffle.  The shuffle, on/off controls are in the back. So is the battery charge indicator.  The sound quality is not as good as your regular iPod, but is very impressive for a player of it's size. It comes with the same earbuds that accompany all other iPods.  I use it in the gym, or when I'm running. I think, that would be the typical use. It's inexpensive, so if you lose it, or crush it by dropping weight on it in the gym, it won't break your heart.  If you are looking for a pretty simple, non-bulky, inexpensive mp3 player, this is the one to get.

<Title>My vote for Product of the Year, maybe Century
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my shuffle for a month now and i don't think i can live without it. I use it on my commute to work, at the gym, at the grocery store, when I take out the garbage. It's like having your own soundtrack. I have 3 other regular ipods but they were a little too bulky and fragile to bring everywhere. I like listening to my 6,000 songs randomly which the shuffle does a perfect job of, itunes is so easy to use compared to music match and all the other stuff out there. the battery life is amazing. Get the white sony fontopia earbuds, they go awesome with the shuffle.  At this point, I think I would rather give up my TV and laptop before the shuffle, never thought I would say that. I listen to Bright Eyes, Mozart, Joni Mitchell, Billie Holiday, Supertramp, etc randomly, I know it sounds weird but I really enjoy the mix. I don;t know why people complain about the lack of a screen, after all you are putting in your own music, if you don't like it dont put it in!  Hate to gush about any product like this, but it has really made my life that much more pleasurable, so I am hoping that you will give it a chance.

<Title>Either you get it or you don't . . .
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, no more bickering about a product that you don't actually have.  What I am telling you about this product is a fact.  And honestly, I don't like apple as a company, but this product after much debate is a product that I considered worth buying.  The lack of a screen is not a negative, that is what it is.  Don't buy this product and then complain about the fact that you don't know what is playing next.  You put songs on there, and you can choose exactly what songs go on there, and choose what order you would like, if this "shuffle" idea is just to scary for you.  This item is small, there is no other MP3 play that is as small, or really even close, the rechargable battery is why it can be so small.  Yes this battery will eventually be no good, especially if you charge it to frequently.  But the money you would have spent after 2 years of continuious regular use would add up to be more then the price of the unit.  So it is worth the "disposability."  This is not an MP3 player for someone who wants to have only one MP3 player.  I have a 30 gig Creative MP3 player that was less then 1/2 the cost to me to buy new, then a 20 gig Ipod, and it is a way better unit (better sound quality, comes with leather belt holder, and it has an easily user replacable rechargable battery) But for someone like me who won't bring his hard drive based MP3 player to the gym (I don't need to explain why, it is clear to everyone.)  This unit fits the bill.  It is small enough to not get in the way whilst doing my workout.  That is the main reason I bought it.  I have sweat rolling down my face, I couldn't see the screen if there was one, and while I am benching, I don't think I should be looking down at my MP3 player to see what I am listening.  And if you remember from before, I did choose that song anyways, so it should not even come close to a suprise for me that this song is playing, or what it is.  So for those who think it is a waste of money (you'll love this)  You're right!  If you need all of those other features, then this is a big waste of money.  For those of you like me, who need something small as an "expendable" form of music for your activity.  Here ya go, it is worth it. . .   Oh yeah, and did I mention that I really don't like Apple and I tried everything in my power to find a better unit for my needs, and I failed.  So either you get it or you don't . . .

Amazon.com didn't show a ship time but said I would be put on the list.  Three days later I received this device MUCH to my surprise.  The size is fantastic, so small it fits in the shirt pocket or the hand so easy.  I've run this thing for close to 10 hours and it keeps going, no problems.  Weight is nothing.  Using it as a USB flash disk works good too.  The only things that annoy me about this are as follows:  -Transfering music to it in iTunes is slow. -I can't play the music on the device when it's connect to another computer's USB port (playing off the device, not copying to the hard drive).

<Title>problem with some MP3 songs
<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got 1 GB Shuffle last week, but I found that it is not playing some of my MP3 tracks. It jumps within the song. While other tracks played Okay. Those particular songs played perfect in iTunes, Music match, Real Player, Portable CD player, iRiver Flash Player etc.   So it seems that Shuffle is very particular / strict about MP3 encoding and omits a portion of song when things are not according to its own specs. Or it is designed to favor iTunes encoded songs and AAC.   I tried everything possible like resetting, restoring etc but no luck. I couldn't try encoding those tracks again with iTunes as I don't have original CDs.  At the end, a visit to an Apple Store, there they tried on their system and finally concluded that although those tracks are technically Okay, Shuffle just can't play those tracks.  I was offered a full refund but I upgraded to iPod Mini and it is playing those very tracks without any problem (Please note this).  So if you have lots of MP3 tracks encoded with different software (non iTunes),you might face similar problem.  Shuffle is beautiful, no doubts. I really wanted this product to work.  Hope this helps.

<Title>An Excellent Player.
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent product that I would recommend to anyone wanting a hassle-free way to take music on the go. I'm not going to write a full account of how the thing works. You will find all you need to know in the product blurb above.  But there are a few issues that need to be addressed.  The first issue I would like to address is the lack of a screen. Many people have criticised the iPod Shuffle for lacking a screen. In my experience this is not such a big deal. The displays on players of this size tend to be as useful as those on portable CD players: that is to say not very useful at all. Apple has decided to make the Shuffle as simple as possible: load it up with music and go - that's it. No fiddling about with playlists and selections, just go. While you can play songs in a predetermined order, in practice the Shuffle feature is actually a lot more fun. It is essentially like a radio station tuned to your own taste and without the annoying DJs or advertising. The controls are the simplest and most efficient of any player of similar capacity.   Other companies decided to make a digital version of the Walkman/Discman with similar interface conventions and expectations. Apple did not. In my view Apple understands that the rules have changed for digital music and that this means a whole new kind of portable player, not some smaller version of a discman. Apple has realized that, for a player that will transport only a fraction of your music library with you, the management aspects are best offloaded to the software you use to transfer the music to the player. That is where you really need the organizing features, not in the player itself. As I'll point out in a minute, in this aspect of use Apple is currently unbeaten.  The sound quality is surprisingly good for a portable device - in fact that's faint praise - it's great. Note that it is worth encoding from your CDs in the iTunes (default) AAC format rather than mp3 as AAC files just sound a whole lot better. If you don't know what this means, don't worry. iTunes is already set to do this when you first install it. However, you can change it any time you like.  The supplied earbuds are very very good, but like most portables you can obviously get better sound quality if you upgrade to a more expensive set of headphones.   The build quality is robust, although you might wish to buy one of the sport cases or skins to protect it from scratches. The thing looks pretty cool too. I have had people stop me in the street to ask what it is.  The price is excellent for what you get, which is both surprising and pleasing given that it is sold by Apple.  But now for the most important feature: it's the software, stupid.   A digital music player is next to useless unless the software that organizes and transfers the music to your player is simple to use and actually works. Other companies have produced fine players, but their worth is marred by the fact that the software they supply for music management is outrageously bad, and in many cases simply too difficult for ordinary users to operate and troubleshoot. I know many people who have bought or been given digital music players who have simply put them in a draw because they could not get the software to work (Sony is the worst offender in this regard).  Apple's iTunes is still the best music management app available for the regular user. As its fans are so fond of pointing out, it just works. Filling the IPod Shuffle from iTunes works exactly as advertised, and iTunes is simple and easy to learn in a few minutes. The best strategy for the Shuffle is to use the "Smart Playlists" feature to automatically select music in various groups that you might like (e.g. dance for "Workout"; mellow for "Walk in the park"; and Pink Floyd for "Quiet Desperation on the Subway"). You can make five or six smart playlists like this in a couple of minutes. Then plug the Shuffle in, select the particular list you want and press "Autofill". In a few minutes it is done and you can leave.   If you are thinking about trying the iPod Shuffle, you can download iTunes for free from Apple to see if you like it. Technophiles sometimes complain that iTunes lacks some features that they (and only they) want, but is irrelevant to the ordinary user: iTunes is simple, anyone can use it, and it works. End of story.  If you want a simple solution to carry a reasonable subset of your music with you during any activity, it is hard to beat the iPod Shuffle. I'm really enjoying mine.

<Title>wonderful product
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I would recommend this to anyone who already owns an ipod. Easy to use, easy to carry, and makes the ipod experience that much more exciting. Ignore the reviews that talk of the pros and cons of owning this ipod... bottom line, Apple always makes a wonderful product, and the fact that it doesn't have a display isn't worth criticizing... its a beautiful design and if you want a display screen fork out the extra money for a larger ipod...

<Title>Inexpensive, High Quality Player
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is a great mp3 player for what it's meant to do. It isn't meant to store your entire music collection, but rather would you want to listen to more frequently, or a random selection of music that fits in a device smaller than a pack of gum.  As with all devices, there are pros and cons, and I'll try and go through those.  Pro - Inexpensive. Even though Apple is known for having very high pricing, this device competes even in the price category against other players, and often beats out other players in the price category.  Pro - Size. This thing will fit into your pocket, or almost anywhere, and it weighs in at just under an ounce. Bring it quite literally anywhere.  Pro - Simplicity. This device is very easy to use, very self explanatory on how to use it, and to understand the LED lights, Apple gives you a small little card with the iPod shuffle.  Pro - USB Flash Drive. You can easily set aside a certain amount of storage space on your iPod shuffle to use as a USB Flash Drive.  Pro/Con - No screen. Not having a screen can be seen as a pro or a con. On one hand, it gives the device a clean, simple look, but on the other hand, you can't navigate songs, or if you can't recognze a song, you can't look it up.  Overall, it is a very solid device that I would highly recomend to anyone who just wants some music in a very small device, easy to access, and use. If they want their entire music collection in one device, this isn't it, that's what the regular iPod is for.

<Title>Excellent value; Very Useful

<Content>This is my first MP3 player/iPod purchase. I couldn't be more satisfied with the 1G Shuffle. I am so tired of having to lug my cd player, carrying case and a selection of cds to the gym everyday. I have only had my shuffle for 3 days and have put 47 songs on it, which is over 3 hours of music and the memory is not even 20% full! I can't wait for the sport case to come in stock. For what I need it for the Shuffle is perfect. I would recommend this product to anyone.

<Title>Survived the washing machine!
<Date>Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After owning my 1 GB Shuffle for a year and loving it the whole time, I was distraught when I lost it for a couple days - and devastated when my wife found it... sitting in the washing machine after a load finished.  It wouldn't turn on, so I sadly started price-checking a replacement, and researching the Nano.  I was happy to learn that Apple offers a discount off a new iPod if you turn in an old iPod for recycling, which pleased me greatly.   After a couple days though, I figured "What the heck..." and plugged it in to my PC.  Darned if the charging light didn't come on, and iTunes fired right up and recognized the Shuffle!   The tunes had been wiped and the battery was flatlined, but I let it charge up and reloaded my tunes and I was back in business!!  I love my Shuffle.  I hate reading reviews complaining that "It doesn't have a screen!" Get it straight -  the Shuffle doesn't have a screen on purpose! This player is made to be the lightest, most minimal player out there, for use by runners and gym-rats.  It's not meant to be a music library, so a screen is of no value - just one more thing to break and add weight.  If you want a multi-gigabyte hard-drive loaded with music, look elsewhere.  If you want the best MP3 player for your workout or run, a player that you'll hardly know is there, this is it.  And I challenge any of the players with a screen to survive a trip through the washing machine. : )

<Title>Sotware problems
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great device but it does appear to be having problems which may be related to Apple's latest software. My device, for no apparent reason started blinking orange and green and would not play. Apple recommends resetting and or updating to restore.  Go to Google and see for yourself the growing number of complaints of cases where the latest iPod Updater will not restore the Shuffle, and although the device will charge, it fails to mount. I strongly recommend checking the return policy before purchasing.

<Title>MY IPOD ALSO SURVIVED THE WASHING MACHINE
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>MY IPOD ALSO SURVIVED THE WASHING MACHINE!!!  I love my iPod, but between my wife and I, we don't always check our pockets very well, prior to doing a load of wash.  We have lost many important items, papers, rings, and other expensive electronic gear because of this bad habit.  We use our iPod shuffle daily, and are constantly using iTunes to re-shuffle the music on it.  It was a great buy, and it adds more than we imagined to the enjoyment of our music, and our daily lives.  The fact that it survived the wash is just the icing on the cake.  It took a day or so for it to completely dry out and return to 100% normal, and I chose to get a different set of headphones (which also went through the wash, but only returned to about 75% of their original sound quality.)  The output on the iPod itself was unaffected, and the new headphones sound great.   I don't think battery life was affected, but it did take a couple of complete charges and dis-charges before it got back into its normal swing.

<Title>Bear with me...
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am not exactly the most technologically savvy person.  I am good with computers and such however, I know next to nothing concerning mp3 players, palm pilots, cell phones, etc.  Up until now, cd players were fine with me.  However, this Christmas I recieved a 512 MB for Christmas.  I traded it in for a 1 GB because I wanted more space obviously.  So here I am with my new ipod and am estatic.  I felt pretty technogically savvy.  I am a college student and pile classes on two days (so I am at school the entire day).  After my first week of getitng my ipod and using at school, I fell in love with it.   I didn't know that it didn't have this or didn't have that.  I was content in plugging my earbuds into my ipod and turning it on to my favorite songs in between classes.  It was like I found the Holy Grail.  I don't want to spend $300 on a ipod that all I will want to do is listen to music on.  Video ipods.  Sure, video.  Neat.  But why?  Ahh, games on a ipod and a calender.  I can bring a gameboy with me and buy a wall calender.    To a simple average Joe like me who has no idea what's up with the newst gadgets, the shuffle was like finding you got the Noble Peace Prize, having your first baby, your marriage ceremony all over again, and getting your pay check all in one filling.  The shuffle, while may not have a LCD screen, games, videos, phone service capabilties, wi-fi connections, calenders, can shave your beard, fix your toilet, etc.  It is just enough for someone to want to sit down and listen to thier music.

<Content>I just bought a Shuffle for my wife and I am extremely jealous that she has one and I don't.  I almost bought the 20GB iPod, but decided that for what she needs, the Shuffle is much better.  This is the perfect device to use if you are an active person...it is extremely small and lightweight and unlike the regular iPod, it does not skip.  I am extremely impressed with the design and frankly think it is one of the coolest looking devices out there.  Not only is this thing unbelievably practical, but it is also extremely hip (I was amazed at the irrepressible urge I had to dance around like the dude in the commercial when I first used the Shuffle). My feeling is that there are other flash devices out there, but none even approaching the Shuffle's level of cool.

<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My husband got a 1GB shuffle this past weekend and I will be getting my own very soon.    There's not much to love about this audio player.  It's small (about the size of a thick stick of gum), it has great quality, and it look super-cool.  You can listen to songs in the playlist order or have the shuffle mix them up for you.  You can fast forward and rewind a song.  You can skip forward & backward to a new song.  Yes - there is no display, but it doesn't need one.  If it's your shuffle, you know what music you have and with iTunes you can choose what songs to put on your shuffle.  I really think that if you want ALL of your music with you - buy and ipod mini.  But, how many times do you really need that much music with you?  The ipod shuffle is great for errnads, exercising, working around the house and sitting in your room, and it costs about 1/2 of what a mini costs.  Three cheers (again) for Apple.  They truly are an innovator!

<Title>Best MP3 Player.  Period.
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was a bit skeptical about the shuffle at first, but I decided to go buy the 1GB version and just try it out.  I immediately fell in love with how small it is, which is a huge selling point for me because I only use it for when I'm walking around campus or when I'm at the gym.  The iPod MINI is still too heavy for me-- I don't want it weighing down my pants (I'd put it in my pocket) when I'm at the gym, and I just don't want to deal with the belt-clips.  The Shuffle doesn't weigh anything-- you could even just let it hang from the headphones if you wanted.  I don't need to listen to every single song that I have, so the 1GB gives me more than enough room for my favorite 130+ songs.  I've had it for just over two weeks and I'm still not tired of the songs on it.  You could also use the random-sync mode in iTunes to add songs at random to the player so that you get a surprise you turn it on.  Also, what's really incredible is that other than transferring the music to the device initially (it got a slight charge on the first day), the battery light still reads as "green."  It's supposed to go "green, amber, red" to let you know how the battery is holding up.  This thing has an incredible battery life, since I have been using it every day since I bought it for several hours a day.  The specs say 12 hours (I think) until the battery goes dead, but I'm sure I've been listening to it for way more than that.  My best friend bought one the same day (also the 1GB) and his battery has lasted a long time too.  We love the shuffle.  The only complaint that I have is that you have to use iTunes to get the music onto the device.  I'm not sure if there is any 3rd party software out there that will let you get around this, but I hate iTunes and so that's my only complaint.  The way I see it though, I'm only going to sync it every once in a while, and it's something that I'm happy to put up with in order to use this awesome MP3 player.  My other complaint is about the white iPod headphones that come with the Shuffle.  How can I put it nicely-- THEY SUCK.  They have absolutely NO bass response and they flatten out the tone of almost every song.  At first I was disappointed with the sound quality of the MP3s through the shuffle, but I switched to my good Sony headphones and there was a tremendous difference.  The songs sound so much better, and I felt relieved that it wasn't something wrong with the player itself (because there is no equalizer on the shuffle, but it's not needed).  Despite the fact that the iPod earphones look good and they have a short cord that doesn't get all tangled up all the time, I think that they are uncomfortable and don't sound good at all.  I've been looking for a great MP3 player for years, and this one definitely wins me over.  If you are in the market for an MP3 player, and you want something for the gym or something active, or if you just want to be discreet and not have some clunky player attached to your waist, this is definitely the way to go!

<Title>Practically Perfect...from a new iPod nut
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the 1gb iPod for a little over a week now, and this little thing has definitely changed the way I listen to music.  Not only is the design nifty, but it's INCREDIBLY easy to use, even without looking at it. The quality of the music is absolutely superb. I accidentally uploaded a sound check track from my home theatre system into it, and when I listened to the guys voice through the ear buds, it was *LITERALLY* 3-D sound. It raised the hairs on my neck! It's small and I wear it around my neck at the office (I'm a graphic designer...on the computer all day). The best use that I get out of my shuffle is at the gym. I can run on the track and use the eliptical with no problem, and then when I'm on the free weights and weight machines I can still listen to my music. Before, my jog-proof CD player was too cumbersome to keep up with when lifting. Right now I've got 260 songs, over 14 hours of music stored in here, and it's pretty much maxed out. I think there are 8mb left. So...maybe one more song. Ha ha.  As much as I'm in love with my new little toy, it's not without downfalls. My biggest concern is with the software and compatibility. I have Windows XP on my computer at home, and iTunes is CONSTANTLY bombing my system. I've read a few hints, tips and suggestions from others that have this problem, but it's still *very* tempermental. The only time it crashed is during transfers or iPod updates. The best tip I've learned is to uncheck the "connect to the internet if needed" box, but even with that, it's only at about 50% of what it should be. Something else that's not so much a complaint as it is a mystery...is that you're unable to fast forward through some songs. For example, I'm able to fast forward through all of the songs from RENT, but when I get to John Mayer...nada. I don't know if it's the way that the songs are coded, but it's an enigma nontheless. To some, the fact that it doesn't have a display is discouraging. I thought so too, until I was able to play with it. Even with 250 songs in mine, they're all alphabetical, and it's easy to locate them by toggling through them with the wheel. So, I can jump from Avenue Q to Jason Mraz with no problem. I rarely use it in the shuffle mode.  So, that's my honest review in a nutshell. Not without dissapointments on my end, but once the music is loaded, I'm in music wonderland.

<Title>The "Pet Rock" of mp3 Players
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a stunning example of marketing creating irrationally strong demand for poorly designed product. Despite the obvious visual design flair of the shuffle form factor for which Apple is famous, this is also an example of form over function. The lack of visual feedback (screen)is a stunningly poor ergonomic design choice...and one that is completely unnecessary. Potential buyers need to be aware that there are superior light weight flash memory mp3 players with screens, tactile buttons, and other features. And they are from mature companies who started making such players before the iPod was a gleam in Apple's eye. Somebody needs to say it. Despite Apple's legendary marketing hype, this is a very poor showing for their first generation flash memory player. Next they'll be touting the "zen" computer that is only a thin alabaster cord of finest imported synthetic polymers that plugs into nothingness. Hey, but it weighs almost nothing! Caveat emptor.

<Title>It seems that some people don't grasp the concept.
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, those of you who do not own the shuffle should not be writing reviews on the product. I've come across many reviews stating assumptions on the Shuffle's abilities/features. Just to clarify, the Shuffle does not have to play in Shuffle mode only! The idea of the Shuffle is to provide a cheap, effective flash drive media player and in this Apple has succeeded. Because the objective was to make it cheaper than other flash drive models, features were cut. There is no LCD and there is no EQ but do we really need to know the name of the song we're listening to? Despite the fact that the Shuffle lacks an EQ, the sound quality is superb. The beauty of the Shuffle lies in its simplicity. One of my roommates has an MP3 player by another manufacturer for which he paid more than I did and got 1/4 the song capacity of my Shuffle. The only difference between my Shuffle and his MP3 player; he has an LCD with 256 MB whereas I do not have an LCD but I do have 1 GB song capacity and paid 49 dollars less for my Shuffle. Decide for yourself if the LCD means that much to you.   I've had my Shuffle for a little over two weeks and the only foreseeable problem thus far is the USB guard (a small piece of hard plastic covering the USB) may become lost as it is not actually attached to the Shuffle itself; my roommate has already lost his and as the Shuffle hasn't been out for very long, Apple has yet to monopolize on the sale of extra guards. As for the Shuffle not being able to play some MP3's, the solution is simple; in the iPod options window make sure that it converts all other format songs to 128kbps AAC and all songs will play. Perhaps one other problem with the Shuffle (and I'm sure Apple will fix this with the next generation) is the play selector (shuffle or continuous) because it is flush with the rest of the Shuffle is kind of difficult to select the play style if your hands are wet or cold. Other than that the Shuffle is a great product in my opinion, but decide for yourselves.

<Title>iTunes for the road, at the right price.
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Shuffle is a great product not only because it is a great music player (the sound quality is fantastic), but because it greatly reduces the mobile price point for users of the best music service around - iTunes.  For $99, you can now export your iTunes library for listening. At that price you can buy one for you, your spouse, and each of your kids.  The unit works great. One thing which is mentioned in other reviews and worth repeating is that you do not need to play your songs in random order. Just add the songs you want to an iTunes play list and select that play list to fill your Shuffle. You can now play your Playlist in the order it appears in iTunes, or, if you prefer, in random order.  Either way, the Shuffle is a great product at a great price point. So far I can fit more songs than advertised, and the battery life looks like closer to 14 hours per full charge.   This is a great product which substantially reduces the affordability price point for iTunes, and I highly recommend it.

<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My friends campaigned me for several years to get an iPod. I was not a fan until I switched to the iBook and got iTunes, which helped organize my music tremendously. I saw this player the other day and decided to purchase it. While it holds around 240 songs, it's perfect for vacation or jogging. FYI, this is not the iPod you want to hold your entire library. For that, I'd suggest the iPod mini or 40GB.  It's great for jogging or commuting on the subway. While there's no display, the weight(or lack thereof) makes up for it. Plus, at $150, it's a great value and you can partition it to store data files. So essentially, you have a 1GB flash drive with music player, definitely a great accessory for work or travel. I guess I've officially switched to Mac!

<Title>Wonderful little piece of little plastic :)
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After weeks of waiting, I finally got my hands on an Ipod Shuffle. And I adore it. No LCD screen? Who cares.  1) If you haven't been living under a rock, you must know beforehand that the shuffle has no screen, so no need to complain when you look down and see nothing but white shining back at you! Most people put songs they know/like onto their playlist, so the lack of LCD isn't such a big deal. If you're looking for something with a screen, I don't know why you'd even consider buying the shuffle.  2) For those who bypass the worry of not having a screen: Apple sells the "Life is random" deal hard, but maybe you all don't enjoy constant randomness. I find the "nonshuffle" and "shuffle" to be fantastic at wiggling around to a set of songs I'd like to hear at the moment. (Beware: may take some patience, but out of 250 songs, which is enough for me, it only takes a couple of clicks.) When initially setting up my Shuffle playlist, I placed my songs in alphabetical order by author and grouped them all together. Simple enough. So when you put them onto the ipod, you know that songs by the same artist are together. (Note: if you typically like one song from each of your favorite artists, my method doesn't work. Sorry) Once that is done, say you're shuffling and feel like listening to only (insert band here). Find one of their songs, switch off shuffle mode and enjoy (insert band here) heaven. I said you have to be patient, but when dealing with fine things, patience is a must.  3) Who can resist the sleek look? Tell me! I couldn't. Call me a sucker but I have a weak spot for those beautiful Ipods.  So... yes you can find a similar product cheaper, I'm not going to lie. 1GB, that's nothing you might say, but I can't even name 10,000 songs, so 1GB is just enough for me, and maybe for you too. I've heard that the shuffle is great for people who exercise. I wouldn't know, you can ask someone who exercises. The shuffle also functions as a USB storage thing (you know what I'm talking about) that can hold files. Most laptops don't have A:/ drives anymore and a lot of people go out and buy those USB storage things to save or back-up files for around $50, give or take.   Function over form? Point is, the shuffle works and looks great. Sound quality is as good as a regular ipod and it just slides into your pocket. Say that the Ipod is "over-priced"? Buy a CD player then.   *Edit: woah, I just saw the guy's review above me. Apple really screwed over people who just bought an ipod recently. Good going Jobs... Anyway, I guess the mini is now only $50 more, not bad.

<Title>Great for what it is!
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my ipod shuffle for about 8 months now and I think it's just great. I usually use it at the gym and just put the songs on that will really get me going. Also, I will occasionally hook it up to an old set of computer speakers I have, and listen to it while I'm cooking dinner or in the bathtub. The sound out of the ipod itself is better then that of any walkman I have ever had.  The headphones they give you with it are flimsy and fall out of your ear easy (sound quality is just ok with them as well). I STRONGLY recommend you spring an extra 10 bucks on a pair of Sony headsets (the best in the industry in my opinion). I have had many many headsets in my day, and I can tell you that these last forever and the sound quality is outstanding (especially the bud-style ones); you will really get the most out of your ipod if you switch headsets. As mentioned by other people, there is no visible display for you to scroll through, but I don't mind this because I don't keep very many songs on it. For some reason, I have noticed that sometimes after you put new songs on it, unless you play those songs off the ipod while it is still plugged into the computer, sometimes the ipod will skip over the whole new sector of music as if you never put them on, looping back to the beginning. Some people seem to mind that it only holds a gigs worth of music, but I have yet to find the need to carry my entire music collection around my neck. I also highly recommend getting the battery life extender with this (its not very expensive, and 1 AAA battery extends the life of this thing by about 15-20 hours-great if you are a power runner)  But for what this thing is, its actually rather incredible. Its only 100 bucks (saves you about $250-$350), its very portable, and holds a gig of music (I have about 87 songs on mine at the moment and it's not even half way full). Bottom line: If your not looking to run a disco and just want something with some excellent sound quality to it while you are at the gym, walking to class, etc., this is a great buy.

<Title>Perfect for the ride to work
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I use my shuffle mainly to listen to podcasts on the ride to work and back.  Radio broadcasts in my area are little... well boring.  The shuffle ends up working out perfectly.    Since I only carry about 5 podcasts at a time (each typically being a little over an hour long) I really don't miss having an interactive screen ala the 1G Nano.  I know what's on there and in what order so I save the extra $30 and bought a nice case (red Griffin metal case also sold on Amazon and its WONDERFUL!).    My only complaint would be that the slider on the back for the Off/On/Shuffle modes is a little too easily shifted into the wrong position but I'm really nit-picking here.  All in all a great product and worth it for those who don't need an interface or have a desire to store a ton of podcasts/songs.

<Content>I love the Shuffle.  It's easy to download and use.  It's lightweight so I can take it everywhere without feeling weighed down.  However, I was sent the wrong software, so it was an exercise in frustration getting started.  I had to IM Apple to receive the correct software.  It makes me want to get one with more memory.

<Title>How i see it
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been reading some reviews on this and it seems some are knocking off points for things that are not included on it. It's like buying a base model car and then giving it a poor review because it didn't happen to have power windows or heated mirrors.  The Apple Shuffle is a very simplistic, well thought out and great sounding device. It does not have a display window, an equalizer, folder options or an FM Tuner and microphone.I have a Creative Zen Micro that is nice, but this has better bass and a louder volume and is infinitely easier to use while I'm outside working or hanging out .I bought the Micro because I didn't want to be one of those ipod people but this thing is just perfect for  what it is . When I put it around my neck I forget it is there it is so light , and when I need to use the fuctions, I press the buttons over my shirt without having to look . People don't like the shuffle function? Well, load your songs up in the order you wish it to be in through your your Itunes and don't turn on the shuffle option on the player.It's only an option, not a conspiracy to keep you wondering what is coming up next . I have a dual layer silicone skin with it and i can bounce it off a wall, have it land in a puddle of water and wipe it off, turn it on and it will still play. I love this thing for what it is and you can keep your bells and whistles and love what you have ... but leave this one alone . It rocks.

<Title>Vastly inferior to the Creative Zen Nano
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At the same $99 price point, the Creative Zen Nano has twice as much storage; a display screen; the ability to record via built-in microphone; the ability to play protected WMA files without converting to Apple's crappy AAC format, the ability to load MP3s directly into the machine without having to install Itunes, and the ability to tune in to FM broadcasts. Buy that product instead! The only reason to buy the iPod is if you want to be trendy and look cool by having the apple "name brand" item instead of a competitor.  (And if you're that hard up to look cool,  my sympathies.)

<Title>Beware the Blinking Lights of Death
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I fully enjoyed this product. I'd even go so far as to say I loved the shuffle. Up until the day it stopped working...  13 months of bliss only to reside in a landfill. There appears to be a defect with this product that Apple doesn't seem to acknowledge. Basically it stops playing music, computers refuse to recognize the USB device, and any button pressed on the shuffle results in blinking green/amber lights. For more information on the problem see: discussions.apple.com/forum.jspa?forumID=823. 400+ complaints of broken shuffles.  Luckily I had an extended warrenty on the device and replaced it with a 1G nano.  It was quite the utilitarian product. Loved the USB drive + music player idea; however, this is pretty much a buyer beware product.

<Title>The latest news about iPod family
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>**** LATEST update to iPod family **** - iPod & iPod photo lines merged; no more iPod photo 30 GB - iPod comes in two capacities - 20 GB ($299), 60 GB ($399) with color screen & photo support - U2 iPod (20 GB) down to $329 from $349 - with color screen & photo support - iPod shuffle 1 GB down to $129 from $149 - iPod 60 GB down to $399 from $449 - new version of iTunes (4.9) that support podcasts *************************************** This is not a review of iPod shuffle as such - great reviews are available already.  Here is some information that might help in deciding which iPod to go for.  Apple announced a major upgrade to the iPod lineup today (23 Feb 2005).  The biggest advantage is the reduction in price ($ per GB) and improvement in battery life. Another significant change is that USB 2.0 is being emphasized although FireWire continues to be supported. AC adapter is USB based instead of FireWIre and the FireWire based AC adapter still sells as a separate product.   The impact on iPod mini:  > A new model, iPod mini 6 GB is introduced for $249  > iPod mini 4 GB now priced at $199 ($50 down from earlier price)  > Change in colors - now mini is available in new shades of Silver, Blue, Pink, and Green (the Gold color is discontinued)  > Major improvement in battery life - up to 18 hours (was 8 hours earlier)  > AC adapter ($29) and firewire cable ($19) no longer shipped with mini (you may not need them really)  > iPod mini 4 GB and 6 GB now ship with only three things: earphones, belt clip, and USB 2.0 cable > The indicators on the click wheel now match the color of the iPod mini  The impact on bigger iPods:  > iPod 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 30 GB (new product) replaces the 40 GB iPod photo and the regular iPod 40 GB  > iPod photo 60 GB now costs $150 less -- $449 instead of $599  > iPod photo 30 GB costs $349 ($150 less than iPod photo 40 GB and $50 less than regular iPod 40 GB)  > iPod dock ($39), AV cable ($19), carrying case ($29), and firewire cable ($19) do not ship with iPod photo (you may not really need them)  > Now we get three things with iPod photo: earphones, USB based AC adapter, USB 2.0 cable > In additon to the above, a firewire cable continues to ship with iPod 20 GB & iPod U2 edition > iPod photo Camera Connector is introduced - this can be used for connecting your digital camera directly to the iPod   With these changes, there is an interesting $50 gap between:  > iPod 20 GB and iPod photo 30 GB  > iPod mini 6 GB and iPod 20 GB (as earlier)  > iPod mini 4 GB and iPod mini 6 GB  > iPod shuffle 1 GB and iPod mini 4 GB  > iPod shuffle 512 MB and iPod shuffle 1 GB (as earlier)   Price, size, weight, and ease of use are major considerations while buying an iPod shuffle.  If price is the only factor, iPod mini could be a better choice over shuffle.  I have all the models of iPod (shuffle, mini, regular 40 GB, and photo 60 GB) and I find myself sticking to the iPod photo 60 GB since it carries all my music and has a better, color-based user interface.

<Content>The 1 GB ipod Shuffle is my first MP3 player.  What attracted me most was the small size and the reputation of Apple.  I absolutely love this thing!  The sound is great and i tunes is very easy to use.  Loaded software fine.  It rips CD's quick and no problems using this with XP.  I did not want something complex and bulky.  I have a long commute and have no problems with battery or the capacity.  I would suggest the 1 GB unit.  I also purchased the docking station and case for using the unit when skiing - which this thing was absolutely made for.  Buy one if you can find one!!!!

<Title>AAC Misconception
<Date>Fri Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just recently recieved my iPod shuffle and am very pleased with it.  Once again, Apple's attention to detail is readily apparent.    One thing I have noticed in some of the reviews is the misunderstanding of the AAC format which is the prefered format to use on the shuffle (although MP3 and other formats will also play).  AAC in a nutshell is the next generation MP3 format.  You could almost call it MP4.  AAC stands for "Advanced Audio Codec" which just means it has higher audio fidelity with the same size files as MP3.  Apple did not invent AAC as explained in the following quote from their website: "AAC was developed by the MPEG group that includes Dolby, Fraunhofer (FhG), AT&T, Sony, and Nokia-companies that have also been involved in the development of audio codecs such as MP3 and AC3 (also known as Dolby Digital)." [...]    What Apple did add is AAC with digital rights management, which is for songs bought on iTunes. It prevents excessive copying of the files to prevent pirating.  Pretty much all online music stores use some type of digital rights management.  The shuffle will play AAC with DRM, basically iTunes purchased songs, in addition to many formats for non DRM songs.     As for the person who had problems playing MP3's on their shuffle, I would suggest converting all their MP3's to AAC format which can be easily done in iTunes.  Remember to set the import encoder in Preferences to AAC not MP3, and the select in the Advanced menu, Convert to AAC. Of course Apple should and probably will fix this problem with a software update for the iPod.  These software updates are free and load into the iPod from iTunes.  Sometimes Apple will even add features to existing products with software updates.  I hope this was helpful.  Still loving my Shuffle.

<Title>Good choice for my needs
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have read several reviews of this player before purchasing. Some gave bad reviews for lack of LCD screen or FM player. It is obvious that they do not own this player, and are just giving bad reviews because of the absence of these features. Reviews should only be provided by people who actually have purchased and used the device.  I currently own an Apple iPod 20 gb 3rd generation, and I love it. I was going on a medical mission trip to Honduras, and I just didn't want to take my harddrive based player. I also wanted something to take to the gym from time-to-time. I purchased the iPod 1 gb Shuffle player. I have just returned from my mission trip, and I must say thet it met my needs as expected.   - Works flawlessly with iTunes and did not cause any problems on the computer where I have iTunes installed for my iPod 20 gb. I can just transfer the songs in my current library that I want to listen to manually, or it can chose songs for me automatically at random.   - Does not have a FM tuner, but so what. Not much FM music I wanted to listen to in Honduras or on an airplane.   - No LCD screen to see what I am listening to. So what, I am trying to relax on the airplane, in my room, or working out. Also, I should know generally what songs are in my library. I shouldn't have to look to see what I am listening to, and I wouldn't want to interrupt whatever I am doing just to check out the name of a song or the artist, etc. I can do that later if I want.   - It is very light.   - Controls are simple and easy to use.   - Battery life is very good, 11-12 hours of continuous playing. Recharges in about 4 hours.  Recommendations:  - If you own an Apple iPod, and want something light to take to the gym or commuting, than I would recommend the iPod Shuffle. Works flawlessly with iTunes and your current library.   - If you don't own an Apple iPod, and/or you want a flash-based player with an LCD and FM tuner, then go buy something else. Just don't provide bad reviews on something you have never tested yourself.

<Title>this little thing rocks my world
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my iPod Shuffle after spending a week debating between it and an iPod mini.  I'm an Mac-user, and I used iTunes long before I thought about buying the Shuffle, so there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to buy an iPod of some type, because I feel from my experience that Apple products are very high quality.  Luckily I had two friends: One with a iPod Mini and one with an iPod Shuffle, both of whom were very satisfied with their respective products.  I didn't buy the iPod mini because I felt the Shuffle was exactly what I was looking for and the iPod mini was a bit too much for what I wanted, but the Mini's are very cool.  However, I have not for one second regretted buying my Shuffle.     For a simple, cool little Mp3 player, the value of a Shuffle can't be beat.  First of all, the value of using it as a flash drive is almost alone worth the price.  1GB is a huge amount of storage for something this small.  It weighs next to nothing, and if you don't watch, you'll leave it in your jacket pocket and lose it.  However, good things come in small packages and the sound quality is just plain awesome.      With their "Life is Random" slogon, it is amazing that Apple has launched such a great advertising campaign based upon what many see as a flaw: the lack of a screen.  I feel that this actually benefits from the lack of a screen.  It wouldn't be as light and the battery life wouldn't be as long if it had a back-lit LCD screen, and in my opinion the screen on most flash Mp3 players (telling you only the name of the song that is playing) is kind of useless and pointless.  I've had my Shuffle for a month, and I've never felt that I once desired a screen.  Sometimes I let the iTunes software fill it up with autofill and it's cool to listen to it on shuffle mode and get surprised with what comes up.  iTunes will also let you set up a playlist in order which you can play straight through.    Other flash players in this price range do not have this much storage.  I'd honestly take the extra space over a un-necessary screen anyday.  All of my friends with non-Shuffle flash-based Mp3 players are jealous of my Shuffle.    Some people sometimes complain that the only way to charge the Shuffle is through a USB port unless you buy an adaptor from Apple.  To be honest, there are computers everywhere today, and almost any one around will be able to charge the Shuffle.  The battery life is really 12 hours like they say it is.  The fact that the USB port is right on the Shuffle is much nicer than a real iPod if you want to use it as a flash drive.  If you want to use a real iPod to transfer data, you need to carry a USB cable with you.  The shuffle is much more convenient because it plugs right in.  The connection may or may not be as fast as firewire, but if you've got USB 2.0 ports on your computer, it's plenty fast enough.         The only downside to any iPod is that while the earphones sound great, they're not the most comfortable earphones.  Some people I know complain that they always fall out.  I don't have this problem, but I find that they feel uncomfortable after a couple hours of being in my ears.  It's not enough to make me buy a different set, but it's sometimes a bit annoying.  Still, if you factor in an extra $20 for the cost of different set of earphones, it's still well-worth the price.  This is a great Mp3 player if you want something to run with, fit in your pocket at work, listen to on the subway, or use also as a quality flash drive to store data on.  This is NOT for people who want to put all of their music on it with 70 different playlists to choose from and keep a calendar and everyone's addresses on it.  Get a real iPod if that's what you want.  If you want an ultra-portible, great-sounding, good-value-for-your-money music player that is easy to use, doubles as a convenient flash drive, has good software, and has good battery life, by all means go for the Shuffle and you'll love it.

<Title>Does Exactly What Apple Says
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is ideally suited for sports and uses where you just press play and go. If you really need a music player with a display then buy one with a display, do not show your ignorance by faulting a system for not doing something it was not designed to do.  People do not accuse the Porche 911 of not being an off-road vehicle or a boat, so why would you expect a music player designed around not having a screen, to have a screen.

<Title>Had initial compatability issues with Windows
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Out of the box this was very difficult to get working on a modern windowsXP machine - this for someone with a masters degree in computer science who's had absolutely no trouble using a variety of USB devices (including music players) with this computer.  I won't go through all the gory details but in my case getting the latest copy of the "Apple ipod updater" put me on the path to success.  It's hard to believe they did any serious windows testing, especially based on all the Windows people with similar problems on the Apple shuffle message board.  Now that it's finally working I've liked it, has good sound quality, very easy to operate and especially easy to fill it up with music.  Press one button and it will fill it with music from your itunes library or any playlist you want.  I like that it charges itself from the USB port as well.  Windows users, especially novices, might want to wait a bit for them to update the software that ships with the players - on my configuration there was absolutely no way to make it work using what shipped on the installation CD.

<Title>It's so very wee!!!
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a 20 gig iPod, and I often worry about messing it up by accidentally dropping it or something. I go running regularly, and it occurred to me that if I dropped the iPod while I was running It would be a goner for sure. With its moving parts and harddrive, it was way too vulnerable. I saw the iPod shuffle, which is a flash memory player, and I knew that I had to have it. It is not invincible, but it does not have the moving parts that my 20 gig has. Also it is half the price of the other, and it is so very portable. It is fantastic. Some skeptics commented to me about the lack of a screen, but when I am doing something, I usually don't have time to check the screen every time a new song comes on to see what it is. Also, wouldn't you know what songs you have? THis player holds around 200 songs and that may seem like a lot, but it is not. You should know what songs you have, it is not as if there are thousands like on a regular iPod. SO in conclusion, this mp3 player is totally awesome.

<Title>It's very coooool, it's very cute, BUT...
<Date>Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player for myself this past Christmas. I looked at the iPod Shuffle because it was very cool looking, very light, very elegant, very small, about the thickness of 2 sticks of chewing gum. I rate this 2 stars just because of the coolness and cuteness factor.  Then I dug deeper, looked at the Apple iPod site and started to think. - What if I don't want to hang it around my neck? I probably will need some kind of case to protect it. They seem to sell cases only in 3 packs, costing $25 - $30. And the cases seem to come only in cutesy colors like bubblegum pink, lime green, grape purple. Or I could spend that same $25 - $30 on an armband / beltclip type of case. - What if I'm on the road and cannot get to my computer to charge up? No problemo, I could fork over another $25 - $30 for a standalone charger. Or I could buy a twin AAA battery pack for another $25 - $30. But with that twin AAA battery pack, the iPod shuffle would be just like any other MP3 player, except it doesn't have a screen. But adding a battery 2-pack kinda defeats the main selling points. It would no longer be ultra-small, ultra-thin, ultra-light and ultra-cool. - What if I want to listen to a certain tune? Without a screen, would I have to blindly fast forward through all my 240 tunes to find the one I want to listen to? - The biggest problem was that internal battery. Eventually, you will no longer be able to charge it. And you will need to replace your iPod Shuffle. For me, that was the deal-breaker.  The owners have these comments in general. - Some people don't get the 12 hours of battery life that is promised in the ad. And everytime the battery runs down, they'll be without their Shuffle because it's recharging. And recharging takes 4 hours. And they'll be tying up one of their USB ports. - Some people are not too happy about being forced to buy a new Shuffle when (NOT IF) the battery can no longer be charged. The battery replacement fee is about the same as the cost of a new iPod Shuffle. - Some people write that a screen is not necessary, that if you didn't like the tune, you shouldn't have loaded it and that they aren't looking at the screen anyway. I agree with everything. However, some of us have a life. When I work out, I want to listen to my high adrenaline tunes. At the end of a workday, I want to unwind with my mellow tunes. When I'm concentrating, I like to listen to classical music at a very low volume. And my MP3 player has all my favourite high adrenaline, mellow and classical stuff in separate folder (playlists). But I still need a screen to fast forward to the type of tunes I want to hear depending on what I'm doing. - Some people have a hard time setting up, getting iTunes to work properly with their iPod Shuffle. - Some people think the cost of those extra iAccessories is outrageous.  Random may be the New Order, but hey, LIFE IS ABOUT CHOICE!!! To quote Shania Twain, "That Don't Impress Me Much".  So, if you're an iCult member, and you need a cool, cute, light, small, trendy, elegant MP3 player which will hold about 240 tunes and you don't mind the "I'm-stuck-with-iTunes-my-iAccessories-are-expensive-I-need-to-replace-this-in-3-years" concept, this is the perfect device for you.  I bought the SanDisk 1G Silver MP3 player. It's not as "in", not as small, not as elegant, not as hip, not as cute, not as fashionable, not as thin, not as cool, not as light, not as trendy as the iPod Shuffle. On the bright side, I won't have to replace it every 3 years. It takes good ol' standard 1.5V AAA batteries so I'll never have to wait for it to recharge, never worry about being out of power. I always carry a spare battery or 2, I just pop in a rechargeable battery (which takes about 3 seconds). I can be running my MP3 player non stop. And no matter where in the world I go, I can always find some AAA batteries. It has a screen so I can easily find the tune I really want to listen to at any time. It also has a radio which I can listen to for a change of pace and to get the news. And I can record with the built in voice recorder. Oh yeah, and the SanDisk 1G Silver MP3 player costs less too! :) And That Do Impress Me Much!!!

<Title>IPod shuffle over hyped product
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>iPod shuffle has a major flaws. If you are updating your music and you accidentally remove your ipod out of the USB, iPod will be damage.In short you cannot anymore use your iPod. Secondly, if you have multiple computer at home, say desktop and laptop, you can not use your iPod to both computer. It is only dedicated to one computer only. If ever you choose to go ahead and try to use the other computer, which was not the initial computer you use your iPod, you end up over writing your current iPod music. This royally suck. My advise not to buy any product from iPod. Best choice is SANDISK product.

<Title>Good Product
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The apple ipod shuffle is a good device to have if you want something that is small and protable but can also hold a sufficient amount of music.  1GB gives you enough music without having a very large device.  The major downfall to the ipod shuffle is you cannot select music.  You have to scan through the music if you are looking for a specific song.  This is a good product and I would recommend it strongly.

<Title>Perfect for the gym
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Working out in the gym with my 40gb Ipod became dangerous. I dropped the thing more often than I personally cared to. I even went and bought a metal titanium case for it and I continued dropping it so frequently that the case is now dented and scratched.  I bought the shuffle for the following reasons. I wanted something small and something I wouldn't freak out about if I dropped it. The shuffle met both of those criteria.   For me it holds 13 hours of music, which is more than enough for the gym and it comes with a lanyard so I can wear it around my neck. Yeah, you look a little dorky with the thing around your neck, but it's great for cardio and for weight training. The headphone cord never gets into the way when I'm lifting. I also use it when I'm boxing and hitting the heavy bag. Again, it doesn't get in the way. There are armbands available for it as well, but I'd give the lanyard a try before spending the money and see if you like it.   I'm not at all bothered by the fact I can't see what track is playing on a screen mostly because I'm using it at the gym and I rarely looked down at the screen of my 40gb ipod when I worked out with it. It's simple to use and it connects through my laptop's usb port when I want to change the music on it and charge it. The battery lasts a long time. If I charge it once a week (and I'm using it every day) it's a lot.   If you need something with a screen spend the money and get a nano. If you don't care about that and just want your music portable this is great. I do think it's better for people who are going to the gym or running or doing any activity with it. It seems perfectly suited for that. I don't see people being happy with this as their primary MP3 player.

<Title>Great for people who just want music without the fuss or price.
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Shuffle is great!  I am the type of person who really doesn't care what music comes on my MP3 player (This is because I loaded the music in it).  So seeing the title and the artist really doesn't matter.  I creat the playlist in iTunes and update my Shuffle with the appropriate Playlist for what I am doing.  1 GB is plenty for your everyday activities.  Who needs to carry 5 GB (who listens to that much music running or bike-ridding?)  I am training for a 26.2 mile ruck-march and my Shuffle carries more than enough music to keep me going.  Battery time is more than adequate.  The size is also another great feature.  I can attach it to my arm-band or just stuff it in my pocket.  Overall, a great buy for those who preffer to just listen to their music, not watch it.

<Content>The review below is very complete, but it neglects to include my personal favorite thing about my iPod shuffle.  My shuffle has accidentally been both run through the wash in my pocket and run over by my car.  It still works perfectly, and bears only a few pockmarks on the corner.  When I got the shuffle, I was debating between upgrading to nano or not, but now I'm glad I didn't, because I doubt the nano could have taken such punishment.

<Title>A good buy for first time MP3 Player buyers
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my IPod Shuffle for about week now.  The price is extremely decent if you're not looking to spend $300 on an MP3 player (I know I wasn't).  I know there's a lot of rumors going around that you HAVE to play your music in random order, that is totally a myth.  You have option to pick what goes on your IPod and whether you want it to play straight through or shuffled.  Another cool feature is that you can have ITunes randomly fill your IPod with music from your library, but it's not necessary.  The 1 GB size is plenty if you don't have too much music that you want to carry around with you, I don't think I've even manually filled up my IPod yet, but then again I don't have much music.  As for the issue of not having a display screen, I can see how that would bother some people, but so far, it hasn't been an issue with me at all.  If you're new to the MP3 player world, I would recommend the Shuffle as a starter, the price is right, and there is still lots of room for music.

<Title>SHUFFLE ROCKS
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Finally, an MP3 player that fits the "pocket". The iPOD Shuffle weighs only 20 grams, costs only 149.00 USD (1 GB), plays great music and doubles up as a USB (2.0) storage device.   Controls - Intuitive: ------------------- Front:  A circular control handles the Volume Up, Volume Down, Skip, Repeat. At the center is the Play/Pause button. All accessible at the touch of the thumb.   Back:  A sleek slider control for power off, play shuffle mode and play continuous mode, ensures that you don't accidentally switch the player on/off. Also at the back is the battery status button.   Uploading Music - A breeze: --------------------------- Uploading songs to your iPOD Shuffle is a breeze with the bundled iTUNES, an award-winning digital-jukebox software.   iTUNES:   - Library, a great music organizer. Add songs individually or by the folder.  - Drag and Drop the songs from your iTUNES Library into your iPOD Shuffle - that simple.  - Search songs in Browse mode by Genre, Artist and Album. The quick search filters the song list as you type which is very fast and effective.  - Import/Convert Audio CD into pristine-quality AAC file format.  - Burn custom playlists to CDs and MP3 CDs.  - Party Shuffle, which keeps a queue of songs at the ready that you can rearrange.  - Radio, more than 250 free Internet radio stations.  - Also nifty playlists being "My Top Rated", "Recently Added", "Recently Played", "Top 25 Most Played".   Charging and Battery Life: -------------------------- Plug it into the computer USB port or alternatively via the iPOD Shuffle Battery back (sold separately) and you are ready for up to 12 hours of pure music.   Headphones: ------------ The signature white earbud headphones deliver a sharp sound quality.   I was looking for a simple yet sleek, light, inexpensive mp3 player that plays good music and the iPOD Shuffle delivers just that. Not having an LCD screen on the iPOD Shuffle does not bother me a zilch. I have been using the iPOD Shuffle every single day since my purchase (well almost) and not once has it jumped a song.   Simple is beautiful and Apple proved it once again.

<Title>This player is awesome!!
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>And not just as an "entry level MP3 player"  If your looking for a player that you don't have to worry about damaging in hostile environments and takes up nothing for space, this is the one. The controls on this player are actually very conducive to being used while working with gloves on, mountain biking, skateboarding, etc. The control wheel is so simple; you can operate it through your pant leg while it's in your pocket. The battery has lasted me well over a 10-hour day.  I see complaints of NO DISPLAY here, why?   Why do you need a display? You don't know what songs you've loaded? You can't hear the volume level? It has a button and an LED light on the back that checks the battery level. It has an LED light that alternates colors/patterns based on what the player is doing.  WHAT A STUPID COMPLAINT!!  A display would only further tax battery recourses. I suppose you want it backlit too??  I'm not sure if the play list mimics the order shown in Itunes, but mine, when in non shuffle mode, plays in order based on artist, I know what I loaded in the player so I know how many times to push the FWD button to get to the song I want, HOW SIMPLE IS THAT?? There is NO need for a POWER DRAINING DISPLAY!! I use this player during all manner of work including construction (with only one ear bud in for safety) and only a few times has moving and leaning against framing or a ladder caused the buttons to be pushed unintentionally. The player is so light it can hang from the headphones and not come unplugged, it' so small and thin you don't even notice it in your pocket when your climbing a ladder or crawling through things. I bought a RCA Kazoo when they first came out and it only held 64MB WITH an expansion card, to get any decent number of songs on it you had to compress the songs into oblivion with MP3PRO and they sounded like poo. It HAD a DISPLAY and ran on 2 AAA batteries and they didn't even last a WHOLE DAY. The controls were such that you had to pull it out of your pocket and look at it to navigate. This Ipod Shuffle ROCKS!! You can wear it on an amusement park ride and the buttons are so easy to use, you can hit play right before or sometimes even while seated on the ride to start the music.  I rip all my CD's at 192kb and I use this Ipod for my car stereo now, it works great. In my truck I have a system with a crossover, 2 amps, 2 sets of mids and tweets and 2 10" subs, I took the AM/FM/CD deck out completely, and bought 2 cords from radio shack with RCA's on one end and a mini jack on the other, one for the car and one for my home stereo, the Shuffle plays perfectly in both environments.   Itunes on the other hand is not all that. I've been using Windows Media Player to manage my digital music files and Version 9 or 10 both flat smoke Itunes. Updating songs in Itunes is hit or miss, sometimes they show up, sometimes they don't, the spreadsheet style of sorting being the only option blows. The folder/tree style of Media Player is light years better and better emulate a computer's file handling style. I got no warning deleting a song from my library in Itunes, that it would also delete it from the physical disk. Media Player asks when you delete a file, "From the library only, or from the physical disk also"   The most annoying thing I found with my Shuffle experience is, during the installation of the Ipod software I noticed the Ipod becomes available as a "removable disk", so I thought COOL!! I can just tag the songs I want and drag them to the removable drive, what could be simpler than that?!?! Nope. Once Itunes loads it removes the "removable disk" icon from "My Computer", that's weak. I even tried to go around it and install the drivers and not Itunes, I can load the songs on the Ipod but they wont play, and I had to reformat the Ipod to remove them.  All in all, this is a great player if you're looking for a true pocket sized device that holds a lot of music, you have to think to yourself, self, remember when I owned a CD case and CD Walkman? Well, with this player, I can carry about 15 CDs and the Walkman in my pocket, and still work, or run or whatever. Once you get play lists worked out that you can load to suit your needs it's even better.   I would give the player 5 stars and the Itunes 1 star if that was an option.  I am running windows XP with all the current patches and transferring songs in Itunes works without issue. I had to get a USB 2.0 Card because my notebook only has USB 1.0, the Ipod works great on the USB 1.0 port, it's just slower.

<Title>Just Got My 1Gb Shuffle
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just got my 1Gb Shuffle and what can I say that has not already been said. This little iPod is beautifully designed, easy to use, sounds great and seems to run forever on a charge. I've run mine on the studio sound system all day long (14 hours) and it's still going strong! The documentation only claimed 12 hours per charge, but I'm guessing that I'll leave before this thing runs out of juice. It sounds great too, perhaps better than my Mini. Is there a negative? Not really, but if I were to grouse a bit it would be about how long it took me to get mine. I ordered it 6 weeks ago! As for the shuffle itself-the feature that converts high res mp3s to 128mb AACs took a longer than I thought it would-almost 1.5 hours. However the non-conversion auto fill ran acceptably fast (7 minutes). My hat's off to Apple-you guys make great things!

<Title>True Genius
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple combines three brilliances in one: superb industrial design, excellent engineering, and perhaps most impressively, marketing that targets (and helps foster) consumer desire/need like almost no other high-tech company.  One the design front, Apple has reduced the already intuitive iPod interface to a level of simplicity that's just a half step short of a one-button mouse. The slider switch on the Shuffle's rear provides two modes: shuffle or linear play. The buttons on the front give you the sort of controls every tape deck or CD player makes familiar: play/pause, next track/fast-forward, previous track/fast-rewind, volume up, volume down. That's it - that's the entire Shuffle interface.  Deskside, the iTunes software is also very simple to use, and the linkage between iTunes and the Shuffle is effortless. You can create a specific list of songs for the Shuffle by dragging and dropping from your library (which you can populate by ripping your own CDs or seamlessly downloading from the iTunes store), or even better, you can let iTunes fill the Shuffle with a random selection of songs from your library.  The marketing brilliance is two-fold: on the hand, Apple has realized that many of us who own traditional iPods typically listen to them in shuffle mode. I rarely listen to albums on my 20GB iPod, and I rarely use playlists. Given that, and given that I've selected all the music on my iPod, I don't really need a display. I rarely want to look for a specific song, and I never need to be told what's playing.  Second, 1GB = 240 or so songs, which is more than enough for a cross-country flight (or an international flight, really, given that you don't listen to your iPod every minute), or a good day's roadtrip. I typically travel with a laptop that holds hundreds of CDs worth of material from which I can refill the Shuffle every day. If you're listening at the gym for an hour or two, you wouldn't even need to reshuffle your Shuffle more than every few days.  These marketing innovations - no display, and no moving disk - greatly lessen the load on the Shuffle's battery. That allowed Apple engineers to get enough of a play charge out of a small, very light battery. The result is that the Shuffle almost ceases to exist when carried on its lanyard or in a pocket. I now find it impossible to "lug" around my regular iPod.  Apple's entry price for the 512MB makes for flashy ads, but it's worth opting for the pricier 1GB model. As delivered, they're both usable, but most users will find charging the Shuffle off a computer's USB port to be onerous and slow; thus a $29 charger is needed. Those buying a Shuffle for use while running will also need to invest in an armband. Each of the increments is small, but before you know it, the flashy entry price point has more than doubled. Is it worth the final price? Absolutely.

<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just picked one up for my son's birthday, being he's turning nine I figured I'd make sure I could figure out how it worked.  It took me a minute to get everything firing on all cylinders, but I think that was mostly due to the fact that I've been rejecting Windows updates...once I updated windows things got easy.  Obviously, this is all of the good things that you already know: Portable, durable, affordable and really decent amount of storage for the price.  Don't be put off by 'only' 1/2 a gig in the $99 model or 1 full gig in the $149...there are mp3s on the market upwards of 40 gigs, but you don't need all of that.  I got the small one, put about 6 hours of music on there and it was half full..it's plenty.  This is my first mp3 player, but I really like it and plan on going and getting myself one tomorrow morning.

<Title>well designed and fills in some of the gaps that ipod leaves
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had an ipod that died shortly after 1 year of use.  The hard drive died.  That was a big bummer for me as I thought the initial investment of $470.00 was worth it.  Now I know better, albeit a week out of warranty.  So, vowing never to purchase another ipod, I find myself with one.  My original ipod was well taken care of and was never dropped or even removed from it's case.  The thing is that I run and walk alot.  I walk at least 3 miles a day and run for 45 minutes.  The hard drive on a regular ipod has movable parts and can skip.  I didn't know this when I bought it.  I thought, when I bought it, that I would be listening to all my CDS and needed to fit them in my pocket.  What I found out was that I neither wanted to listen to the bulk of my collection nor wanted to wade through screens to get to what I wanted.  Also, the battery life was dismal, I always had to connect to a computer anyway, and usually when I did I would just make my new playlists on there, as opposed to the ipod itself.   Since all my music was encoded in AAc format, I knew I had to get a player that would play my files.  So, after looking at several other flash-based players, I did choose the ipod shuffle, begrugingly.   Really, a flash player was what I needed all along, I just didn't know it.  What I like about the shuffle is that it has the one-handed, in your pocket convenience instead of a touch pad (I had the 30 GIG model).  It is now much easier to move along to the song I want.  The sound was really, really crappy when I used my $100 Sennheiser headphones with it (sounded like mono spilt to stereo signal), but it sounds FABULOUS with Apple's earbuds, which happen to be too big for my small female ears.  I've developed a callous on my ear from trying to shove it back in a million times while I run.  Which brings me to: if it's meant for people who are active, wouldn't you provide more secure earbuds, like the ones that clip on to your ear????    There is no perfect product out there, but assessing what you essentially need a product for will help determine whether an ipod shuffle will fit the bill or another player.  If I wasn't Mac-based, I would consider other flash players that use rechargeable batteries that you can replace without sending it in to Apple.  Addendum:  After just a few months of use, the shuffle will not mount on my G5.  Apparently there is a hardware error that prevents it from mounting.   It shows up on the system log.  Of course, there is virtually nothing on Apple's site that goes into this problem, but on other sites it is well documented. The shuffle works fine, but I cannot add anything.  So, it's going back to Apple, where others in my situation have been told that it's a "hardware" error.  Basically, the operating system doesn't want to recognize or mount the FAT drive. Wish me luck!

<Title>Ok, everybody think of its actual purpose.
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Will this thing play your songs out of the box? No, you have to use iTunes to set it up. But isn't that true about every iPod? Or for that matter every MP3 player. That's always hit me as the "weak link but not quite" in the MP3 player realm. If you can set it up beforehand on the computer then what's the point, as the capacity of MP3 players gets smaller, of setting up the MP3 player through the unit itself? I can see the need on high capacity MP3 players, but there's only so much you can set up on smaller capacity players that the setup options tend to get in the way since there aren't that many songs on it anyway.  How I think about this is this is like a portable radio with one station tuned in. Your own. And when you think about it, since you already know the names of the songs anyway you really don't need to know what's playing to enjoy it. You don't have, on traditional radios, anything more than the dial to show you what station you're on.  And again, there are a select few songs downloaded to this player to begin with. It's not meant to hold your entire library. It can't. Physically it can't.  The iPod Shuffle is for quick runs around the park, trips to the grocers, errands that don't take that much time, work that doesn't last more than 8-10 hours. that kind of stuff. It's certainly not for road trips, long plane flights or extended listening (over a week or more).  It has a very specific use that the original iPod is just overkill for.  And man is it tough. I must have dropped it more than 4 times in the time I've had it and it plays as well as it did when I first loaded it up. It's scratched a little, but I don't mind. I'm just handling it more gently now and I'm going to buy a "skin" for it. But despite it being scratched a little it still looks cool.  The sound is extraordinary! I found that the earbuds that it comes with are the best for it. My big earphones barely pick anything up. And my other various earbuds from other devices also barely pick anything up unless I turn the volume way up. Nice bass, nice tone.  The interface is logically possitioned.  The one gripe. The lanyard. It plugs into the USB plug. Not to the player itself. So if anybody comes along and snatches it it's pretty easy to do.  And if you want, get the "dock". It's not really a dock except in physical design. It's more of an extension cord. And I've used many other devices through it and they work just fine. It turns out to have a practical purpose beyond the designers' intention.  I just wish people had a better understanding of the differences between MP3 players and what dirty tricks other companies use to fit the claimed amount of songs on a 256MB player.  Just be aware that other companies are using dishonest marketing tactics to fool the public as Apple comes out with these products and services and gobbles up more of the marketshare than the rest are comfortable with. Last I heard it was 92% of the market.
