<Title>I love it!!
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first mp3 player I have and I love it! It looks great. Very easy to transfer music from CD or computer to player. Even for a technologically- challenged like me. Also, the charging time is pretty fast. All in all, this is a great product, perfect for working out, jogging, and traveling.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone 1GB - Nice starter or spare MP3
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone 1GB is a nice value in starter MP3 players.  It has the same capacity as the iPod Shuffle at $40.  For $20 more, you can get the 2GB Stone Plus which also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + simple design with more color options  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - below-average battery life of 10 hours or less - software issues - Creative software is buggy - DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable from 1GB (no SD card slot) - no FM tuner or voice recording - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles - for just $20 more you get the 2GB Stone Plus with added features  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  The 1GB Zen Stone is decent but not perfect.  It suffers from quality issues and is really ideal for specific uses.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0531518-6269244">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express nor as cool as an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations.  The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This burns out faster than the old battery operated unit, but is more convenient.  The sound is nice, and it comes through in stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds, which most people replace.  The Zen Stone Plus is the only larger option at 2GB. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0531518-6269244">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0531518-6269244">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0531518-6269244">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0531518-6269244">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0531518-6269244">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0531518-6269244">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0531518-6269244">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Creative has fixed some of the software issues.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Well worth it!
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought this for our son because he kept taking my Ipod.  It is very easy to use and he loves it. The charge is held for a long time and he seems to use it a lot.  I liked it so much I bought one for my mom to take to the gym.

<Title>I love this little player!
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I justed needed something for the gym, but I got a whole lot more.  All I had to do was connect it to my computer (with the USB cord that came with it), then drag and drop the files I wanted. So easy! No additional software required. Additionally, it charges by being plugged into the computer (my old prehistoric iriver was battery powered).   It's small enough that I keep it in my school pencil bag or, when not at the gym, it fits into my pocket for listening on the go.

<Title>will not play music
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>What a piece of junk.  It will not play any downloaded music purchased legally.  The first one I ordered did the same thing and I just thought it was a malfunction, but the second one does it to.  I can add downloaded songs through Windows Media and it will play, but if I do it that way I can't set up folders for my music.  If I go through Creative Media Lite I can set up folders, but it won't play music.  Should have never switched from my sansa.
