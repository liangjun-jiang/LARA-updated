<Title>So many positive comments so I bought one - again!
<Date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My older version (1GB) of this Coby player went out on me suddenly while trying to download a lot of music.  I was disgusted. It was only 10 months old - and I hadn't been downloading alot previously - though I had handled the little tyke roughly and used it on a regular basis (radio).  I searched online reviews of other players and came back to Coby for this newer model.  Maybe holds 1-2 less songs -  but still the best deal for it's price/sound/utility.  If you get one, DO HANDLE WITH CARE.  Also, I discovered that Energizer's long-lasting LITHIUM AAA batteries are oversized for the Coby battery holder.  You have to squeeze them in.  Probably not a good idea - but for the long life, what are you gonna do?? Multiple memory cards are great - just load and switch them out.  Have more music for your buck.  And this is so much CUTER than IPOD! ;>

<Title>It's a good affordable mp3 player
<Date>Sat May 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Coby mp3 player because I like to listen to the tuner sometimes to hear what's new in the world of music and the reception is decent.  The controls are easy to handle and a hold switch in the back to keep from accidentally turning it on because the battery runs out quick if it's not alkaline.  The AAA battery is not a whole lot of power so I get a few days worth or 5 hours of play on an alkaline battery.  I may save more power if I don't use the light display and have the volume at a decent level.    The sound quality is okay, not great.  The best is at Rock setting to hear some bass though an additional super bass or a 5 band EQ would be neat.  Mostly I bought this player because I have a  Mac computer.  Hard to find mp3s that works with Macs.  I like the Ipods but at this time there prices are out of my range for what I want.  I had a problem when I dragged and dropped  the music from my Mac to the Coby mp3.  I found out the files were mpeg4 so the mp3 player could not file them.  With kind help from an Apple assistant I imported the same cds on my computer  with the music converted to mp3.  I was able to drag and drop the music again and was delighted to play them back from the Coby player. The headphones were a bit clumsy for my ears so I use the sony bass headphones for a better sound and fit.  I will revise this when I find how much music I can load on the internal flash.  At the moment I have about 63 industrial/pop/french/classic songs in sub folders at mp3 setting with 140mb of free space left.

<Title>Nice player with nice features
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this player last week from J&R Music World after having owned the MyMusix PD-205 for five months because the MPC-751 had more features such as an FM tuner and voice recorder, plus 512MB of internal memory and virtually unlimited expansion with SD cards. I have a thing for  SD mp3 players because if the MP3 player breaks or malfunctions, at least you still have salvageable memory instead of having thrown all your money down the drain.  Anyway, from owning the player for two days here are some pros and cons:  PROS: -Nice and small. I can hold it comfortably in my hand and it doesn't look like an unsightly bulge when it's in my pocket. -Light. I barely even know I'm holding it. -Nice design. I like the black finish. It gives it a nice look, although it smudges easily (see cons). -Really nice features. The FM tuner has great sound, and the FM recorder and voice recorder are the main reasons I went for this player. -Resume feature. This was my biggest complaint for my other MyMusix player. Although firmware upgrades enabled it to start on the same track when restarted, it started from the beginning. On this player, there is an option to start from the track time, which of course I enabled. Now I can finally listen to my Audiobooks! -Great sound quality. The included earbuds are excellent. I'm in music heaven when I turn on my player  CONS: -Not-so-good build quality. It feels pretty cheap, so I wouldn't abuse it too much if I were you. This doesn't really bother me though, it just means I have to take extra care of it. -Scratches and smudges easily. Just like my old player, I still have to keep plastic over it to protect it. -Voice recordings are pretty low. Even on the highest setting, I practically have to turn the volume all the way up to hear my recordings. -USB 1.1. This wasn't advertized on the box, so I assumed it was 2.0. The transfers are pretty slow, but I can deal. -Does not resume with songs played on SD card. This was a real bummer for me, especially since the resume feature was the main reason I bought this player. However, I solved this by putting songs that I didn't like so much on the card so I wouldn't mind when they didn't resume.  And that's it. Other than a few minor disadvantages, this player is the way to go! I would give it a 4.5 but that's not an option so I'll give it a 4.   ****UPDATE: The menu button on the player broke under normal use on July 26, less than a month after I purchased the player. This sort of lowered my high opinion of the player, and I had to send it back. Although everything else was functioning, there was no use in the player if I couldn't access the menu. I guess the cheap build quality WAS something to worry about, after all. It's been two weeks since I've sent it back, so we'll see how that goes.  ****2ND UPDATE: I got the player back about a month ago on 8/15, and it came in a crushed box from UPS. Thankfully, though, the player wasn't harmed. Everything's been fine, so far, but I haven't used it much since I purchased a much better player with a color screen and everything from Campus111.

<Content>I've had my Coby Mp-C751 for 1 one day and ive found the few little problems about:  1. Certain songs will not play if they are protected. 2. The exterior feels kinda cheap. 3. You can't drag and drop. 4. Is not reconized by windows XP 03.  The good parts: 1. Great FM tuner. 2. The earphones are off the chain. 3. It's small and sleek.  In other words, besides the few problems, It's a wonderful player.

<Title>Difficult to operate
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this because of the form factor and so that my husband could record something he was studying for.  Granted, he is not a puter whiz but he had a hard time getting the record function to work.  Usually, I can show him something and it will work fine for him thereafter.  He kept coming back asking me whether he was recording or not.  Not a good sign.  It is pretty cute, but the toggle buttons are very hard to operate, especially for my husband that has larger fingers.  Basic tasks like moving thru menus are a little hard to navigate with the tiny toggle.  And we often found ourselves entering a function we did not want because of that.  The sound is decent and it was easy to setup and transfer files to.

<Content>well, it took a long time to figure out how to work it exactly, the directions weren't very specific, but that's not the fault of the people who shipped it.  it got here really fast, and was still in the packaging and everything, so that was great.  it was just the product that wasnt what i expected.

<Title>Crackpot
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I shopped long and hard for this, a bit put off by the negative comments by some customers, but encouraged by one who gave photos of the parts he fixed himself.  I've been using this daily for a month, and I love it (still). I plug in a 2 GB SD card to expand the music options.  This works great if you'll be listening for a long time, but it can be tedious to find your place again if you stop.  "Pause" lasts only a short time before powering down, then you have to "go fish" to find where in the card you were.  On the other hand, the 512 MB onboard memory holds its last power-down position for you - a needed feature for listening to mp3 downloads of radio shows or recorded books, but real nice for music also - this just requires more frequent upload maintenance on your part, so you don't get sick of the tunes stored there.  I was pleasantly surprised by the recording quality through the inboard mic.  I have a good portable recorder, and this was supposed to be the "el cheapo" for listening only.  But this unit recorded live music far better than expected.  Battery life with rechargeables is fairly short, but batteries are small and I usually don't need more than one battery per day - I can't wear my headphones all day anyway. As others have stated the interface takes some patience, but for the price, I'm not complaining.  I also like the fact that it is very small and lightweight.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a couple of these mp3 players along with a couple fm transmitters for a few friends of mine as gifts. They are simple, easy to use, light weight, and can take a couple falls (Don't feel as bad as if you dropped a Sansa or Ipod), They offer good sound quality but the FM reciever may not be powerfull enought to pick up all the radio staions in your range, but I'm sure you're not buying this to listen to the radio. It does have an SD expansion slot so you can have more music than an Ipod shuffle, pay less money and still get the screen. What more can you ask for?
