<Content>I was very disappointed with this item.    First of all, the software came with it was not compatable with the operating system (Win XP) on my laptop. I finally got it installed but could never get it to work.  After getting 3 "core dumped" I decided to call a quit.  Another thing, I could not turn the unit off. I held the buttom until it goes off. As sooon as I released the buttom the unit came back on again.    In my opinion, this product has a long way to go before it is ready for market!

<Content>The one I bought only turned on for a week (though it would not let me upload any file). Then it never turned on again. I would suggest spending more money in a better brand than buying a product like this one. Cheap things can be very expensive. Wasted money!!
