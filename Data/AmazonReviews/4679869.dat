<Title>great mp3 player, highly recommend it.

<Content>Introduction: As a consumer, it is important to know the fine prints and features of a product you are purchasing. I will briefly state two things about Ipods. When you buy an ipod, you will be stuck to itunes store because they don't support WMA format which is used by every other music vendors. Most importantly you will NOT be able to transfer back your music collection from your Ipod-player-to-PC should anything happen to your PC.   Then of course the price of ipods, absurd proprietary control over Apple product/software, less features, fragile build quality are some of the things why I myself avoid Apple products and recommend everyone to do so. I will now focus on MP020 and compare it to Apple ipod shuffle since they fit the same category. I am avoiding comparing MP020 to hard-drive players.    The Panasonic MP020:  Memory: I like flash based players. All of my digital music players are flash based. Flash memory is more expensive than hard-drive disk space. The problem with hard drive players is they are very fragile. I would rather take something rigorous, less space. Both MP020 and "shuffle" use flash memory.  Shape+Size: Think of two cubes that are about an inch long joined together. Voila, you have MP020. Alternatively think of a fancy compartment for your AA battery. The figures are: L-2.25 inch, W-about an inch, H-about an inch. This shape is very good because it fits easily and comfortably in your palm. Ultra thin players using rechargeable batteries (NOT good, read on) "rests" (or lays) in your palm, they can't be "hold" or "grabbed".  Ipod "shuffle" is much longer, thinner because of the built-in battery (NOT good, read on.)  Build Quality: Over 95% of digital audio players are made of plastic. So is MP020. However it does not have the "cheap" feel like many others. You can hold it and actually feel it. The ipod "shuffle" is made of cheap plasic, and it feels cheap as well.   The look : MP020 looks very stylish with curvy design, padded buttons instead of physical buttons making it flat. It also comes in two colors - blue and white.   Weight: It is the perfect companion for people always on the run, whether you are chasing pretty girls on the street, or exercising. It is extremely transportable due to its weight. Most of the weight will actually come from the AA battery. "shuffle" is also light.  Battery: MP020 uses AA battery whereas "shuffle" has built-in rechargeable battery. As you know they die out after certain times of charging-recharging process. That's why I like cheap, something diseposeable. AA batteries are just that. They are found anywhere there is civilization. I don't need to have a computer to recharge Apple "shuffle". Then the battery life is also of no comparison. Even after several years now, all the ipod battery lives are below standard. All other manufacturers have gained/increased battery lives on their prodcuts while Apple remained unchanged. Now the actual numbers. MP020 lasts about 80 hours in one single AA battery. Let me repeat, EIGHTY HOURS on a single AA battery! Compare that to "shuffles" 8/9 hours life. And not to mention, after several months of use, it won't even last that long.   Control : I'm a total control freak. So I like to be in control. I don't want my gadget to control me. The MP020 has a padded side where all the control buttons lie. You don't have to take it out from your pocket to control it. YOu can play, stop, go forward, go backward, change volume with your eyes closed. This is generally not true for hard-drive players. Majority of them will require you to look at them when controlling. Ipod "shuffle" is the only apple player that is controllable without looking at it.  Features: This is where "shuffle" is of no comparison. It lacks a display, avanced control and much more.   On a relevant note, lets elaborate the idea of "shuffle". As you know its a randomized list. This feature existed long before any mp3 players evolved, long before Apple ipods were born. It shocks me to see people think Ipods are the only players that shuffles music! This is a common feature in every mp3 player that don't need highlighting. You know nobody paid attention to this feature until Apple produced their "shuffle" line of ipods. Its quite amusing and irritating at the same time when everyone goes "oooohhh how cool of  ipods to shuffle" or when Apple embeds YEARS OLD technonlogies in their products.   The MP020 of course shuffles music. It offers normal (goes in alphabetical order), repeat-1, repeat-all, and obviously shuffle mode to play your songs. Apple "shuffle" has one mode only. And it should be noted, if the shuffle algorithm is not mathematically random enough, you will end up listening to same songs more often than a random song.   Here's a list of features Apple ipod "shuffle" lacks but built-in to MP020: - Display : Bright orange with black texts. You can adjust the contrast, backlight. The display shows equaliser mode, Surround mode, remaster mode, battery life, track number, track lenght and it scrolls the ID3 tag every few minutes.  - Sound Control : MP020 has very advanced sound control settings. You can adjust bass, preset equalisers, or make your own, SURROUND mode, and something called "remastered".  - Play mode : I like when I'm given choice instead of relying on the mercy of the gadget. MP020 lets me choose what mode I want to play unlike the Apple "shuffle".   - Transferability : As mentioned earlier, MP020 will let you transfer MP020-to-PC or PC-to-MP020. Apple products don't allow doing that unless you circumvent their security measures. This is done so that Apple has more control over what you do. Imagine you not being able to transfer back your music collection from your mp3 player to your PC. What happens when your PC crashes? What happpens when you buy a new PC?   - Music Formats : I do prefer MP3 format over WMA format but I will not buy any player that does not support WMA. Why? Because WMA is the format all other music vendors use except Apple. This translates, either you pirate (illegal download) or buy music from Itunes store and itunes only bcause your ipods won't play WMA format. MP020 supports MP3 and WMA.   Another relevant note. When Apple bundles softwares to Mac OS, its not a problem at all. When Apple practically forces you to buy music for your ipods from them, hardwares from Apple its still not a problem. However its irksome when everyone starts scratching their rears when Microsoft only bundles softwares with Windows OS. Its not like Microsoft are preventing people from using alternatives or forcing to buy from Microsoft only. So I think Apple should be sued first instead of Microsoft.   To sum it up, avoid proprietary products. Always go with generic, easily available, disposeable products. I refuse to be controlled by Apple, I refuse to be an ipod-zombie like others. Its just beyond my comprehension why people like being ripped off by Apple again and again when there are much bettter products available for cheap.  Buy MP020. Its a great product. With my boring and detailed review, hopefully you will now know why people should avoid Apple.

<Title>This is a great mp3 player
<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great sounding easy to use mp3 player. The battery lasts so long it is hard to remember when you put a fresh battery in. Sturdy, small scratch resistant unit. I read the manual but you can figure most things out in just a few minutes of use. Very easy to create play lists and move files to and from the unit.  You can create up to 299 subfolders for different play lists and song types. You can stream songs directly into the unit if you care to.  When plugged in its just a another drive on your computer. Every time I've plugged it in, it has been recognized in Windows XP. It will easily hold 30 hours of mp3's and even more wma's. When you copy files to the unit, it creates the play list in the order you copied them, not in alphabetical order. So it is easy to play the songs in the order you want to play them. Forget the ipods.......expensive batteries. Many ipods will be thoroughly scratched after one days use. The sound and volume levels are top notch. I haven't had any crashes or problems at all with this unit. Highly recommended for someone who wants a good basic mp3 player that cranks out great sound. Plus you can use the player as a usb drive to use for any type of file storage.

<Title>Beyond PERFORMANCE
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently got this mp3 player and i have to say that it is one of the best ones out there.  I don't know why CNET does not have detailed review on this thing.  I also dont like the fact that CNET does not consider internal battery as a minus.  Pros: 1) First one has to be battery, is this OSOM OR WHAT  80 HOURS!!!.  I THINK PPL WHO BUY IPODS OR ANY MP3 PLAYER THE FIRST THING TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER THE BATTERY IS REPALCEBLE OR NOT ($$ also).  I hate ppl who say that by the time the product's internal battery dies, they will get another one.  WELL GO GET ANOTHER ONE AND DONATE THE EXISTING PLAYER.  When you spend 100$ or so on mp3 player, they should better last for a long time.  I have said this also on the sony nws200 series because i just cant stand the fact that it can get junk just after couple years  (what is the point???????).  Almost all the big manufacturers are guilty of this, including COWON, SONY, CREATIVE, SAMSUNG, AND MOST OF ALL APPLE WHO STARTED ALL THIS NONSENSE.  Panasonic will also follow on this track, i have seen some japanese player on ebay. If this true in near future then i have to say i am disappointed.  2)  Anyways, getting back on the point, the sound is no doubt amazing (Dsound).  its hard to believe it comes out of this little guy.  If you owned sw967 cd/mp3 player, you will know what i am talking about.  3)  Very simple drag and drop through windows media center.  Very intuitive controls, none of that nonsense wheel stuff (so annoying).  4)  Very well built, it feel durable and if you are like me, i already have dropped the player couple times in few days, get this.  Cons-- 1)  No case, not even a pouch, come on panasonic dont be so cheap.  No accesories at this point. 2)  headpones are as usual cheap, certainly awful when it gets noisy.  get sennheiser, they are cheap and have very positive reviews. 3)  The blue color is just plain ugly, lot of ppl say that white one is good looking.  I dont care that much though.  Bottom Line.  It does the things it says very well.  If you are a budget minded person and dont want huge amount of space, dont think twice. Otherwise, definetly consider this as your secondary.  If you want black in color, Iriver T10 2gb is also a very good player (also has AA battery with 45 hours!!)  but more expensive.

<Title>packs a wallop!!
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently brought this MP3 player to replace my Creative Muvo 5GB HDD. I accidentally dropped it after taking good care of it for a year!. Like all hard drive players, it was very fragile. Any ways, back to this Panasonic 2 GB flash-based player.  PROS:  MEMORY-- I learned my lesson the hard way. I've always liked Flash based players--no skips,lighter, smaller,and more versatile when you are on the go like jogging or working out at the gym. My first MP3 player was flash,but back then the max memory was only 1 GB.   MEMORY SPACE-- 2 Gb is just enough to cram in my music collection. I now just rip them with WMA at 64 bit rate to fit them all in .Doesn't this compromise the sound quality? suprisingly...NO.  SOUND-- This is where I fell in love with this player. The sound is just awesome! It has options for "Surround" and something new and great they call "Remaster". It just makes the overall sound so crisp and distinct, even if I ripped the music at a low bitrate.You don't have to crank up the volume to appreciate the quality. It also has a programmable equalizer. BTW I use my old panasonic earphones, nothing special. It's all in the player.  SIZE-- Small, but not as small like the new Ipod Shuffle. It is lightweight but looks and feels very sturdy. I have to confess, I've already dropped it once and it landed on wood tiles, but no dents /scratches or marks!  It still keeps on playing like nothing happened. Whew!  PRICE-- I got it at a local Walmart for $99. I bought and tried the Creative Muvo V100 which is comparable to the Panasonic but cheaper at about $80 at Fry's. But after trying them both out, Panasonic gets my nod. I will also write a review for the Creative Muvo V100.  WARRANTY-- 1 year for both labor and Parts. This is great compared to Creative and others who only has 90 days warranty for parts and/ or labor.   PLAYLISTS/FILES/FOLDERS-- This is hard to come by especially in the era of the IPOd shuffle. You can actually separate your music files  according to artists and albums. This is a big plus for me.  BATTERY: Uses the ol' AA. Use rechargeables if you wish. pretty economical and practical. I have not used it long enough yet to see if it actually will last 80 hours as advertised. the battery is heavier than the player FYI. Connectivity: Uses USB cord. File transfers are quick considering my computer does not have a USB 2.0 port.  CONS: No FM stereo: If you like this option. I never used it on my past players so it was no big loss  for me.  No Line In: I used this a lot on my old Zen Nano to incorporate my old cassette tapes.  No Armband Belt Clip larnyard or carrying case: Too bad. If it has any of these, I would have probably rated this player 5 stars. It is light and small enough to put it in your pocket though.  Overall, This is a decent little player with suprisingly good sound. I recommend it highly to people looking for a good flash player without all the needless perks.

<Title>For the hardcore music lover
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you want serious durability, long battery life and the generous capability to store multiple artists' entire collections, then this is the MP3 player for you. Simplicity itself, without confusing controls. The sync capability with almost any music manager is impressive. I can place music on the player using various means. It just works great, looks excellent and, best of all, it is easy to navigate through the menus to select music to play. Panasonic, please keep this series of MP3 players around!

<Title>very close, but not quite there
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A good, basic player... Pros:  - Has a good "resume" function which is mandatory for listening to audio books - AA battery with long life. I hate those Li-ion rechargeable batteries.  This way I can use *any* AA - alkaline or NiMH - and they last a LONG time. - 2 GB memory is very useful Cons: - Navigating through folders is awkward and cumbersome.  Once you start playing a track you can't navigate from where you are back up and over to another folder; you have to start all over at the top of the folder structure again. - Can't exactly use the flash memory as a jump drive because you can't rename files/folders once they're created and it doesn't support Properties well.  The best way to use this is to stage everything you want to store on the player in a local folder and then copy the entire folder at once. - No FM receiver - Difficult to open the battery access lid. - Doesn't support 56 kbps bit rate with 22050 khz sampling rate (maybe others, too, but that is what I had used to record a bunch of audio books).  It took over 2 days to convert to 56 kbps/44100 khz (which does work) using Goldwave
