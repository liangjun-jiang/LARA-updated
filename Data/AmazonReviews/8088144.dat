<Title>Aw, come on
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Look, this thing isn't perfect but there is absolutely nothing else like it out there. Yes, I had to call customer service but they were exceedingly helpful and got me up and running tout suite. Space is limited but fine for typical uses. Sound quality is very good and portability is terrific. I have an iPod but there are times when I just don't want to wear the earpods. And you can plug your iPod into this thing for mini-boombox sound. Give it a try.

<Title>Oh My Gosh! 
<Date>Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing got sooooo annoying. It took literally hours to figure out the stupid thing even with reading and rereading the instructions included with each one. It doesn't help if you have done it before or not. I got mine months ago and wanted to update to newer songs and everytime I tried I just get frustrated and want to throw it out the window. It will not download different songs or let me even get to the step that you can actually manage what songs are on it and which ones aren't. The library is hard to figure out and it doesn't work at all with window media player, making it very difficult to get the songs I want on the device. I am usally farely patient and I just cannot stand this thing!!!The alarm clock freezes up a lot and I have almost been late for school. How it functions really has no rhyme or reason. One day it works and the next, it just doesn't. It doesn't hold enough songs, the radio doesn't come in clear, you can't just slip it into your pocket, the alarm doesn't always work, it takes for ever to get to your music once you actually get the thing turned on, you can't rewind or fastforward songs, and I've spent hours upon hours trying to get the songs I want on it. I think tha tI'm just going to get a small cheaper mp3 player with more space for songs and one that works better with windows software. Anymore it just sits on my dresser and does nothing because it's all old songs and the alarm isn't reliable.~~~It is not worth it!

<Title>PLEASE DO NO BUY THIS PRODUCT!
<Date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player and I couldn't get it to work. The battery would not charge up.I called Phillips and the representative said I should push the reset button. I did and it still didn't work. I called Phillips five times for the same problem over a four week period. Finally the representative said they would give me a refurbished player. Of course, I am upset because I have never used the item and I don't believe I should have to received a refurished one. If you are thinking about purchasing this item, please think twice. If you have a problem, Phillips WILL NOT help you. I read the negative feedback and I didn't believe them. If you have bought one and it is working, you are very lucky. I would hate to see someone go through what I have been through. They do not care about their consumers. I would give this item 0 stars

<Title>A unique product
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for a memory based sound system for long time and really glad to have found this product. I don't mind paying more for larger storage size (like 1 or 2 G), but 512MB is what Philips' offering.  I had no problem getting started, music was up and playing within  1 hour of opening the box. (I had previous experience with other philips MP3 so that helped)  The main use of this player is to play lullabies and other children songs for my 15 months old and it works really well. My kid loves the unit, pointing at it when she wants music, and often just carries it around happily when the music plays. I couldn't have done it with other mp3 players (needs headphones) or an Ipod with a dock.(not protable) The unit did lock up once (blank and no signs of life even plugged in) that resulted in a customer service call, reseting the box resovled the issue.  All in all, I am very pleased this product exist. I just can't find another product like this - portable MP3 player with speakers  Even this product works well in my case, it's not perfect and here is why it only gets 3 stars: - USB 1.1 is slow, takes a long time to load music - Must use music match to synch music, not very easy to use - Sound quality is similar to alarm clock radio, no mid-range and bass, and treble isn't particularly clear either. But then, what can you expect from these tiny speakers.

<Title>Great Covenient Player
<Date>Tue Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a mom ... that being said I do not need to hear every instrument during my very hetic day.  This provides the music I (& the kids) love to get us moving.  The first one I purchased, which was a 250 MB, did not power up at all. One call to Philips to trouble shoot, no luck, so they had me send it back, on my dime.  However, they replaced it, about 6 weeks later, with an upgraded 512 MB unit.  No trouble whatsoever with the 512.  I did reset it once with ease, did not loose anything.  Battery life is quite long, and built-in rechargeable.  Downloading is so simple, or transfer your CD music, easy enough, I am not one to fiddle with instructions.  The volume is loud enough, can also use with headphones.  No need to carry CD's for the car now.  Have used as portable speakers for the kids DVD player, as an alarm clock, auto shut-down, etc. Play music by artist, type, shuffle, repeat.  Holds plenty of music.  Built in radio.  Very portable, took on vacation for the cabin.  Obviously not for the pocket.  Wonderful idea, very satisfied.

<Title>Nightmare -- Don't Buy This Thing
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a really cute looking device -- too bad it doesn't work at all.  The firmware and software combo is horrible.  You cannot simply drag and drop songs to the device.  You MUST use their Philips branded version of MusicMatch Jukebox to transfer songs and it DOES NOT work.  Two phone calls to Philips didn't help either.  They were polite and all but otherwise useless.  I've owned and used MP3 players since they were first introduced and this is by far the most time I have wasted trying to get something to work.  I never did succeed.

<Title>Love the Shoqbox
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Revolutionary product - The only negative is the software.  Although you won't use Windows Media Player to install the music, you must not have WMP version 11 (you can have v.10) on your computer to download music into the Shoqbox.  Versatility and sound is 5 star.

<Title>Cannot load songs
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I spent 3 days trying to get some songs into this MP3 player and I finally gave up. Every time MusicMatch Jukebox starts coming up, it will give an error "MusicMatch Jukebox has experienced an error and must close". I can see the PSS120 as a USB hard drive and can copy files to it using Windows Explorer, but I cannot listen to them on the device. Unless you get the songs downloaded thru MusicMatch, the PSS120 serves only as a storage device. I emailed Philips customer service and described the issue in detail. Their email answer was to read the FAQ. What kind of answer is that? I then called Philips. The customer service rep asked me to uninstall everything and reinstall it. She would not stay on the phone. She said to call back when I have done that and still have a problem. I told her that I have already done that several times on multiple computers and still get the same problem. She said to "try it again".  Needless to say, I got the same error and decided not to call Philips again.  I am very dissappointed in the product and even more dissappointed in Philips customer service. I was considering buying a Philips large screen TV, but after this experience I will not consider a Philips product again.

<Title>This is a great little gaget
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have two of these the first I bought for $150 more than two years ago and the most recent I got for $60. I have had very little trouble with using the features or transfering files. Don't use Music match though.   With XP windows, media player works fine for tranfers.   But there is a neat piece of free software called Shoqbox Buddy which is excellent - for transfers and creating playlists.  Shoqbox Buddy works fine with Vista.  Cons:  There is no way to expand memory - wish it had a SD card slot.   Also I occasionally have to reset the unit to get it to start - using a pencil to press on the reset button at the back of the player.

<Title>Very annoying! Don't buy it!
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'll keep it short.  (The review is for the 256MB version).  One word - Annoying.  The fact that Philips FORCED you to use the musicmatch software to load songs is very very annoying.  Difficult to use.  And as another reviewed said, it doesn't resume.  Once stopped, it goes back to the first song.  That't annoying too.  You'll be better off with just buying a cheap MP3 player and a separate powered mini speaker.  Doesn't look as nice but at least it works fine! Really regret buying the Philips!!

<Title>Shoq-ingly good!
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for a small, personal MP3 player to use while traveling that could be used without headphones and I stumbled across the ShoqBox 512MB while surfing.  I took a chance and am quite satisfied with the product.  The sound from this little box is outstanding for its size.  Perfect for the cabin on my cruise or a hotel room or the beach.  It's also a clock and radio, but certainly sounds a lot better than a clock-radio!  It has a detachable antenna for the FM radio, which seems to work well if stationary.    There are two big drawbacks: 1. Memory is not expandable  (but it will play from a line in from another MP3 player or laptop) 2. It takes longer than average to download songs from the PC using their required (and included) Musicmatch Jukebox software.    All in all, this is a nice portable speaker system and I give it two thumbs up!

I wake up to my other alarm(since i dont trust this one yet) and i look over and its frozen.. hard frozen, have to reboot it..  none of the buttons work, nothing..  I have the updated firmware..  This thing is NOT ready for prime time, if you want this for an alarm clock PLEASE HEED the other reviews!!  I thought "they must of just gotten a bad one"  NO,, all of them are bad, it is a design flaw.

<Title>Not Microsoft Friendly
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I liked the concept for this device and actually purchased one for my son for Christmas.  However, like another reviewer, I found this device not only NOT windows media player and Microsoft friendly but it "locked up" multiple times.  And the proprietary music download interface (Musicmatch/Philips) would not load properly (something about an ISScript problem)on my Windows 2000 Advanced Server.  I agree that this device is NOT ready for prime time.  And why embed only 512 Mb?  How about a compact flash slot in this "big" baby???

<Title>Philips ShoqBox PSS115-120 falls short
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned four MP3 players and I have some knowledge about good and bad MP3 players. This player is one of the worst. I'll cover the positive and negative in this review.  First, the positive: it sounds good for its size, well built, waking to your music or FM station using its internal clock, and ID tag display does provide additional info.  The negatives are the biggies here: 1. Philips must have assumed the owner would play only music tracks, which are generally short. What about those of us who play lecture files, eBooks, etc. These are generally long and generally not completed in one sitting. There is not a resume play from the point you left off. You are taken back to first file on your list of files when the unit is switched on. The fast forward or rewind is in four second increments, which is far too slow to find where you left off. 2. The file handling system is controlled by MusicMatch. You cannot merely add mp3s to the player via USB connection. You must use MusicMatch, which puts too much control in their hands hoping you will purchase and download music files to your computer. 3. Internal flash RAM is too small for serious users. 4. The entire unit must be shipped in to replace the internal battery when it goes bad.  The negatives far out weigh the positives and I cannot recommend this player.

<Content>I wanted an mp3 "boom box" quickly.  The reviews by other buyers are not very good.  "not ready for prime time" etc. I felt lucky as I had had a poor experience with a Rio Nitrus mp3 player, what were the chances?  So, the Shoqbox arrives, due to overnight shipping, and the unit will not power on, period.  Four hours charge time... nothing.  New products.. you take your chances.

<Title>Didn't work
<Date>Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As in one of the other reviews, I received this item and it would not power on.  I exchanged it for another one, same thing.  Amazon exchanged it again (they do have good customer service) and now, on my third different Shoqbox it will NOT power on.  So it's useless.  Not sure if this is just Amazon stock or what, but I have now been through 3 of these and not 1 would turn on.  Can't comment on it's features since I couldn't use it, but it is a good concept, but maybe replaceable batteries would have been a good idea.  (and of course expandable memory).

<Title>A Great Idea That Needs to be Refined
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted one of these from the first time that I walked into a busy warehouse shopping center and heard the incredible sound coming from this little box about the size of a ballpark hot dog and bun.  I wanted one so much that I went to inane lengths to get one that works.  That's the problem; and that's why I only give this little gizmo 3 stars.    Several months ago I bought one of the 256k models.  With great anticipation I plugged it in and waited . . . and waited . . . and waited. This Shoqbox would neither charge nor power up.  I exchanged it for another one.  Same thing. I talk to two Philips representatives, neither of whom could help resurrect either of these dead units.  Upon returning Shoqbox #2, a warehouse employee tried Shoqbox #3 in the store. Same thing.  You plug it it.  It's supposed to show a charging icon within 15 minutes.  It shows nothing and does nothing, even if you leave it charging for 36 hours straight (according to the product manual it should fully charge in 4 hours).  Three strikes and you're out.  I left the store that day with my money but no Shoqbox.  I searched in vain for a comparable MP3 player that was this small with built-in speakers that could deliver sound of David versus Goliath proportions.  None could be found.     Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  Fool me four times . . . I tried my fourth unit, ordering this 512k refurbished Shoqbox through Amazon.  (Hey, I really wanted one of these!)  It arrived in a timely manner.  I plugged it in and once again nothing!  I couldn't believe it.  I left the thing plugged in for two days, unplugged it, and decided to package it up for the Amazon's return department a few days after that. I thought I'd try plugging it in one last time. Viola! The Shoqbox came to life and I jumped up and down, celebrating like a 12 year old who just found out that school was canceled!  I have no idea what I did.  But if you buy one of these and have the same problem I would suggest that you charge it for one day.  Unplug it and leave it alone for a day or two.  Plug it back in and try it again.  Positives?  It's truly one of a kind.  It delivers incredible sound and more than respectable volume for its size.  The twin drivers refuse to distort at even the highest volume setting.  The Shoqbox gets an "A" for fit and finish. It sort of looks like a white I-POD on steroids.  The sound that comes through a set of ear phones (you'll have to supply your own) is equal to an I-POD or I-River costing twice as much.  Plus, the Shoqbox has a built-in FM transmitter with 10 station presets.  The onscreen menu and included software is easy to use.  The Shoqbox also doubles as a clock radio.  The Philips website offers firmware upgrades.  Negatives?  Trying to find one that works for starters.  The built-in memory is rather minuscule in comparison to other MP3 players.  I'm glad I payed out the extra dough for the harder to find 512k unit.  Even with that, the kid next door carrying 30 meg in his shirt pocket will laugh at you.  From what I can tell, you have to use the Windows-based "Musicmatch Jukebox" software to download music and to manage files on the Shoqbox.  Also, I would really have appreciated a bookmark feature for listening to lectures.    Other comments?  It's not an I-POD or an I-River.  You can't keep appointments on it or view photographs, color or otherwise.  FM reception requires using earphones or the included wire FM antenna.  A side port would have been nice for this, rather than having to open up the back compartment for access.  The open speaker grills invite little fingers or a stray object in a book bag, purse, or pocket to impale a driver (the included carrying case gives much needed protection).  Work out some of these bugs, Philips, expand the memory capability, add a few more features and you will have a 5-star product.

<Title>worth the price
<Date>Thu Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you want to enjoy this product, which by the way you can get at sams club for only 50 bucks, there are a couple of things I would recomend, so that you don't run into the same problems most of the people here did.  First off, do not plug the thing untill you have installed the software and read the manual which is also on the disc. Connect the device direclty to a usb to the computer, DO NOT USE USB HUBS!!!! Before you unplug the device use SAFELY REMOVE HARDWARE, on the botton right hand side of you monitor skipping this very simple step could result in the device freezing, and you would probably have to use the reset button on the back and would have to use the Device manager that is specifically for this product and you may end up resetting the device to original factory settings or updating the firmware alltogether. If you download the latest firmware be aware that when you press to the next track it skips a little, which can be annoying. Although the latest firmware allows you to use windows media player, I could not load up a playlist I was able only to load up music. Besides music match is not that bad. So there it is, I am enjoying very much this product, which by the way I got a one year extended warranty for only five bucks more, do not be concerned by the freaked out reviews posted here  I'd bet that all of them could have been resolved easyly. Now is there room for improvement? definately, expandable memory  ogg vorbis for example, but com'on fifty follars I think is reasonable for what you get.  Last but not least, although this device has built in alarm clock  is mostly a digital audio player as advertised on the original packaging, you can get an alarm clock at the 99 cent store which by the way work much better. Did I mentioned that this device's volume can fill a room with decent bass, I've showed it to many people and they can believe how loud it is. You can hear a very minimal distortion at the highest volume, almost perfect.  Enjoy.

<Title>Power problems now solved
<Date>Mon Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Like some of the other reviewers, I had trouble with units that would not power on.  I sent one back, and got another with the same problem.  Being a bit stubborn, I was determined to try everything I could to get it working.  None of the troubleshooting material that came with it helped.  I finally wrote to Philips, and they sent me a link to the FAQ page below (which I hadn't found on their site before).  It seems that if the battery gets too depleted, they won't work properly even when charged.  However, you can solve this by pressing the Reset button on the back with a straightened paperclip.  You have to press pretty hard -- I thought maybe I had broken mine until I saw the unit's display light up for the very first time.  Once you get it working, this unit is great.  Big sound from a small package.  Enjoy!  Here's the link to the Philips FAQ: http://www3.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/dcbint/cpindex.pl?scy=US&slg=ENG&cat=MP3_PLAYERS_CA&sct=FLASH_AUDIO_PLAYERS_SU&grp=PORTABLE_ENTERTAINMENT_GR&ctn=PSS120/37&mid=Link_FAQs&hlt=Link_FAQs&session=20060415161551_170.65.128.6#
