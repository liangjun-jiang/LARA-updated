<Title>SAY YOUR PRAYERS, IPOD.
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing does everything the nano does(and things it doesn't like FM tuning and voice and radio recording)for less money.  The only reason to choose an ipod is if you want to be a trendy hipster(god knows there are plenty where I live).  The battery life is great and the shell is pretty scratch resistant.  Even the screen seems pretty sturdy. I found a compatible case logic armband for it at Sears for ten bucks-good luck finding an IPOD armband for less than thirty.  I haven't tried the video feature so maybe the last guy is right about that, I don't know.  But as far as music and photos this thing is great-Sandisc has a new loyal customer.

<Title>Much Better Than the Ipod Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Longer battery life, looks alot better, cheaper, has video capability, easy navigation, radio-need I say more? Ipod nano on the other hand.....has more assessories.  That's it.  Get the e250 instead of the nano.  You won't regret it.

<Title>A great MP3/WMA player
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>UPDATE: In August SanDisk released a firmware upgrade. Now there's a Custom EQ capability and best of all: syncing to subscription based music (URGE in my case) is WAAAAY FASTER. It's almost as fast as if you're adding your own local files. Previously this was the achilles heel, now it's fixed.  SanDisk actually made a good product better. :-) ______________________________________________________________  I just bought this for $150, a great bargain!  I have mostly WMA's and therefore have no need for an iPod. This player is terrific and it works with subscription services. The interface is easy, the screen is sharp and did I mention it's a great deal?   Oh and another reviewer said these things:  "The scroll wheel is a very loose, flimsy, plastic ring. It's also difficult to turn. Often, I need to use both thumbs to turn the wheel."  and  "Video playback is very buggy: A movie is arbitrarily broken into tiny video files, which the player displays and treats separately. It also adds 5-seconds gaps between them!"   I found neither of these to be true --I suspect the reviewer recieved a faulty device. The video playback is PERFECT and the wheel certainly doesn't require "both thumbs" to turn ...?!  And yet another "reviewer" stated this: "Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player" as their review heading. With minimal PRODUCT RESEARCH one discovers that this device charges via USB. Basically that reviewer is asking for something that this product is not advertised to do --and whose problem is that? What's next, being upset that his/her 2GB model doesn't hold 8GB worth of songs?  Helps to read the product description. ...

<Title>Beats any mp3 in it's category, especially the Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it for the ability to play music and it's great. It is far superior to the Nano in everything except the availability of accessories but it's slowing changing. In fact, I had bought a Nano and sold it because this is better.  For instance, 1. longer battery life 2. FM radio 3. recording capability (including from the radio) 4. scratch resistant 5. user changeable battery 6. ability to expand memory by using mini sd cards 7. better price.  Outstanding mp3 player.

<Title>SanDisk has done it again!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since I like to read reviews before buying stuff, I've never been attracted to iPod, becuase there have always been better alternatives at a better price. Since SanDisk announced the E200 series  I decided it was gonna be my next digital audio player. well, I got it and it's a great little device. everyone can notice the great quality of this player just looking at it. its metal back and solid apperance shows it's very durable. I like the wheel control, it works great and once you get used to the buttons layout, you'll find it convenient too.  pros. -Eye-catching design, silver and glossy-black look really sexy. -Great quality built (metal frame, liquidmetal back and hard glossy front) -Easy to copy your songs, either by using Windows Media Player or drag and drop. -Gorgeous screen display, easily visible even under direct sunlight. -Great Battery life -User replaceable battery. -Decent earbuds provided. -The right size and weight. -Hard to scratch. -Plays videos, FM radio with good reception, shows pics and records voice and radio. -Easy menu, with practically no hidden or hard-to-reach pages. -Dedicated voice recording button. -Great audio quality.  cons. -No custom EQ, you have to use the provided ones only. The normal  (flat EQ) sounds great, though. -Catches all your fingerprints even if your hands are clean. -It should show more details about the playing song (Bitrate, format, etc.) -It has a clock, but once you start playing a song, you never see it again. -It's been storing some stuff under the screen, it doesn't look like dust, it's like some white crumbs that maybe come from the interior and not from the outside. if it gets nasty I'll take the unit apart and clean it up, I just hope it's easy to do so.  This is a nice player and SanDisk offers feature packed, great quality players at a very affordable price, get it if you can. Sorry iPod, maybe next time...

<Title>iPod Nano Killer
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I start, I do agree that this is a iPod Nano rip off. But this player adds so much more and has value for the buck.  I just bought this player after a lot of research about this product. Read video reviews on gizmodo and engadget before I got this. I'm extremely impressed by all the things that this player can do namely 1. Music 2. Video (1.8" screen) 3. FM  4. FM recording 5. Photos 6. Voice recording  I got this for $150 and it is surely worth every penny. The mechanical dial can look and feel little ugly but once you get used to it, it is not that bad.   Also this player has same length & breadth of Nano but is almost twice as thick as the Nano. It is also heavier than the Nano but somehow this feels more sturdy than the Nano. It comes with a lanyard and I wear this all day without any problems with weight.  The screen is very bright and the interface is very very intuitive.   The software (Media converter) that comes along with player is simple and easy to use. It converts videos to .mov format to be played. Music can be transferred by just dragging and dropping mp3s. Sandisk also provides firmware upgrades on their website which worked fine. FM recording was great though the FM receiver isnt really good. It also has a micro SD card slot that can be used to add more memory to the player.   Overall, if you are looking for something that can do way more than the iPod Nano and costs $50 less, you SHOULD buy this player. If you want to follow the crowd and cant think out of the box, then you should buy the iPod Nano.

<Title>I already despised the nano, and this is the nail in the coffin
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>NOTE: If you want to be a clone, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER! GO GET A NANO LIKE THE 8 TRILLION OTHER CLONES IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAVE ONE.   Otherwise, this player is the flyest thing I've seen in a minute. I was actually waiting for the e250 to be released b/c in doing research on it, it essentially had everything I wanted. MP3s, photos, fm radio, recording, fm radio recording, and even video! All this in a small but STURDY package. The obvious competitior is the iPod nano, which doesn't even compare to the e250 on any level. The nano would probably snap in half in my pocket if I sat down wrong. The drag and drop the e250 has is so simple my dog could do it (no, really). The only thing that I recommend is looking up the user guide from sandisk.com which has way more detail than the included instructions. Otherwise, buy this! I wouldn't steer you wrong.

<Title>It's great!!!! The best mp3 player i have ever bought!!!BMO
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best mp3 player I have ever bought. I you ever need to buy a mp3 player TRUST ME!! Get this one. I was just a normal person looking for a for a mp3 player. I got it at best buy about one week after it was on the market. I have not had one single problem with it once. I had and i-pod before this. But it broke in the washer, and the sansa could probably be ran over with a car and not break(liquidmetal). It Plays video but you need quick time player 6.5 or more. Save it to that and you're good. The only thing i have a problem with is the music store. Rhapsody is horrible, but windows media player works perfectly. But if you want a music store choose something else. So, an overall preview on it, is,it can store up to 400 songs, plays video, fm tuner and recorder, can store info and pictures, and is great. It also can scroll down very fast. In the box comes a starting disk and manual. Trust me get this mp3 player. It beats the nano by far!!!!!!

<Content>I use an MP3 player to listen to audio books on a long commute, and I purchased this when the last MP3 player I had died after 4 months (with a 3 month warrantee) - Avoid Coby!.  Used that experience to look much more closely at what I wanted - a replaceable battery, easy to use controls, easy to read display, reasonable power consumption.  This has met my expectations and more.  A very solid, well performing player.

<Title>DO NOT BUY, DEFECTIVE
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently got this MP3 player and was very excited. The first thing I did was start charging it. Then I turned it on. The first thing it did was say "Key Locked, System Shutdown". I thought it might have just been one of those random things that happen so I tried turning it on again. Same thing happened. I tried one final time, and IT DID NOT TURN ON AT ALL AND NEVER EVER DID FOR THE REST OF THE TIME I HAD IT. I returned it and in 1 day already had a new one, thinking this one would work fine and the last one just had a defect. It worked great for about 1 week, and then one day I tried to listen to music and it said "synchronize to continue your music subscription" and would not let me listen to any songs. My sister has the same MP3 player as me and had the same thing happen to her and all she had to do was plug it in to the computer and then it worked fine, except for she could not have it on shuffle and she also could not skip songs so she had to listen through songs to hear one that she wanted to listen to. If she had it on shuffle or skipped songs it would give her that message I talked about earlier and would not play the songs. So, I plugged my MP3 player into the computer, hoping it would fix the problem, and it would not turn on at all, and still won't. Also, some of the songs on my sister's MP3 player will still not play. I have gone through two of these MP3 players and both did not work properly, and my sister's MP3 player is defected and will probably stop working just like mine did. Both me and my sister are very dissapointed and are both returning our MP3 players. I am not going to get this one again and neither is my sister. It would also be wise for you to take the same path as us. Do not ever buy this MP3 player!

<Title>WILL NOT PLAY SONGS
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this MP3 player at the end of May, and was very happy about it. I immediately synchronized songs onto it, and it worked very well. The sound quality is very good.   HOWEVER, after a couple weeks of owning this product, something very strange occurred. It was playing completely normally, and all of a sudden when it was going to the next song, it would NOT play and a message came up reading "Synchronize to continue your music subscription". I was very confused; I had obviously synchronized the songs onto the player.  It would not let me listen to any of the songs for the rest of the day. Finally I got home and plugged it into the USB port, hoping that this would solve the problem.  I unplugged it, turned it on, and it seemed to be working fine.  But then, the very next time I used it, the exact same problem occurred.  I found that if I don't have the Music Options set on "shuffle" and don't skip forward, it USUALLY will play just fine. Otherwise, it won't let me play any songs and keeps giving me that annoying message.  Even when I don't use shuffle, however, it still will occassionally not allow me to listen to certain songs.    In the end, I am returning this MP3 player and am not going to buy another one of the same brand.  There are lots of good reviews for this product, but maybe that is just because those reviewers have not yet experienced this problem.  It seems to be defective.  Everyone should save their money and time, and avoid this product at all costs!!!!!!!!

<Title>BETTER THAN NANO!
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>***The person who's title is "DO NOT BUY,DEFECTIVE" is a total idiot. I had the exact same thing happen to me! Guess what I did! I unlocked the hold switch and PRESTO! It magically started working!***  Anyway...this is BETTER THAN THE IPOD NANO. Both of my sisters have a Nano and after I got this and played with it for a while, I looked at my sisters nano and laughed at it! It wasn't near as good! The E250's screen is probably twice the size of the nano, and the bright color screen is mouth dropping. AND YOU CAN HAVE VIDEO! YES VIDEO! It can't hold A WHOLE LOT, but it can still have videos. I am more than satified with this product. Some more awesome features are FM Radio and Voice Recordings. I'm not sure if this is mentioned in the description already but YOU CAN RECORD A SONG STRAIGHT FROM THE RADIO SO YOU CAN HEAR THAT EXACT SAME SONG ANYTIME!!!And you can still listen to that song while you're recording it. Also the Voice Recorder, doesn't sound like a big deal, but mannn is it fun to toy with! haha! Another neat little feature is you can "see into the future". You press a the middle button once or twice and it tells you what song is next! Here, let me break it down for you!...   THE GOOD...  ~BRIGHT & COLORED BACKLIGHT MAKE IT MORE THAN EASY TO READ SONG TITLES,ETC... ~SCROLL WHEEL IS VERY EASY TO CONTROL AND VERY ATTRACTIVE ~THE OVERALL LOOK IS VERY ATTRACTIVE ~SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT ~MORE THAN ENOUGH FEATURES (MUSIC,VIDEO,PICS,RADIO,RADIO RECORDER,VOICE RECORDER) ~VERY LARGE SCREEN ~NICE PICTURE QUALITY! ~THE 2GB CAN ACTUALLY HOLD 1000 SONGS IF FORMATTED TO WMA. ~AND MORE!  THE BAD...  ~SOMETIME YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PRESS BUTTONS TWICE ~CAN SMUDGE EASILY ~HAS TO CHARGE BY A COMPUTER ~UPLOADS MUSIC IN A "WEIRD WAY" BUT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM ~AND THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF!!! (SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YA?)   OVERALL : GREAT PRODUCT - I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!

<Content>I've had my Sansa for about two weeks now, and love it.  The positive reviews here are spot on.  You definitely have to download the full product manual at sandisk.com, or you'll be a little frustrated trying to figure all the features out.  There are also a couple of good discussion forums out there if you search for them. Earphones are crap, but then most every review of MP3 players say that.  Overall, I'm impressed, and glad I bought this vs. the Nano.

<Content>This player is definately worth the money, but there is one flaw that annoys me. The media converter for video (pictures work fine). The video function for me plays well, but without audio. I am still trying to find a way to correct this. If I can get this function to work, I would change my rating to five stars. The screen, music playback, and pic viewer are all great. Technically, the video playback is also clear, just without audio.

<Title>Think Twice Before Buying
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player thinking I would be able to use it to listen to my music and the radio on my daily commute.  The radio worked fine.  The MP3 player worked, but I could not load music on either of my computers.  I have a Macintosh desktop at home. The Mac would recharge the device, but did not recognize it.  The other computer I have is an HP laptop with an XP operating system.  It would not recognize the player at all, I kept getting an error message.  Once, during the two hours I messed with it, it froze and had to be rebooted.  I called tech support and found out that the Sandisk Sansa 250e will not work with a Mac at all.  His other suggestion was that the device needed Microsoft Media Player version 10 or 11 or it would not work.  I checked my laptop and it had version 11.  I sent it back and got my money back.  I bought an Ipod clone that works great on either system.

<Title>Better than the iPod nano, even better with Rockbox
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had limited experience with mp3 players, but have found this one to work very well for me. I had used the iPod nano and the sansa m240 before purchasing this mp3 player.  This player is better than the iPod nano because:  *You don't need iTunes. You can sync files from other music ompanies. *You have a very handy voice recorder built in *You can watch video once you have encoded it to play on the sansa (free software included) *You can (sometimes) get halfway decent radio. (But hey, the nano has nothing so what do you have to lose?)  I purchased this player over the sansa m240 because I wanted to be able to play video. (something the m240 can't do.)  The format of the Sansa is decently pleasing to look at, and I was able to begin loading music within minutes of opening it up. I have always used Windows Media Player to sync my music, but you may be able to do a direct drag-and-drop sync with this player. (Locate the player in the My Computer folder, find the Music folder, and copy your music files right there)   My MAJOR complaint was the EXTREMLY annoying scroll wheel light. It glows blue when turned on and remains on while the player is in use. (Even after the screen light goes off) After using a nano, this light seemed blinding!! This is a huge drawback unless...  You install Rockbox! This free software available at rockbox.com removed the sansa software in the player and replaces it. The main reason I installed it was so I could turn the scroll-wheel light off. But rockbox offers so many more options, I probably would have installed it even if the wheel light was not always off.  You can: *change the font   *change the color of your screen *create your own folders (or use their database)  *flip the screen upside-down  *play games (none come on the original sansa) *and lots more!  I am really happy with this combination of the e250 and Rockbox. Once I loaded the software I was able to sync my music from two different computers. Basically, the computer reads the player as a UBS device, and lets me add and delete music on different computers. I have begun building my own "database" for my music by creating folders and organizing my music. Playing video was a little tricky, as the rockboxed-player will only play mpeg video. I downloaded some free converting software, and once I figured it out it wasn't too hard.    I have only had this player for a few weeks, so I am still playing with all the features. The player would probably be fine with the original software if Sansa would include a wheel-light off setting. The wheel problem is the reason I only gave this product a 4 star. Otherwise a great player, cheaper than the iPod nano, and a good starter player if you are looking for video and pictures on your mp3. If you are interested in Rockbox, visit their website www.rockbox.com and look at their free software. You can load software for other players besides the Sansa e250. Google it and see what you can find!

<Title>Exactly what I wanted in an MP3 player
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one in the first week they came out, but just now am getting around to reviewing it. Why? I've been using my iPod touch, my iPod shuffle, and a few other odds and ends for music, but the Sansa e series does exactly what I want it to do and doesn't get in its own way. Its easy to use, battery life is amazing (about a week at 3 hours a day or radio and MP3) and so far  even after I've abused it leaving in the bottom of my gym bag it's still alive and doing fine. For the commute and they gym, it's my MP3 player of choice. Oh, and I'm a sucker for the cool blue light on the dial. What can I say?

<Title>Affordable, Expandable, Small: MP3 Player to Buy in 2008
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product to pick up right now, in early 2008, as prices drop. The Sansa e250 should be a Nano-killer, and it's a great buy for anyone who wants an inexpensive flash mp3 player for exercising, walking, or general use. I've owned a bunch of mp3 players, including iPods and one Nano, and here are the selling points for this little Sansa e250:  * Expandable memory through SD Flash. Buy a 2GB and by next fall, you can upgrade it very affordably to some mega size (16 GB? flash memory prices are falling). You'll have a cheap flash player larger as big as some iPods.  * Good sound quality. Via headphones, this is indistinguishable from any of the top mp3/iPods I've listened to. Don't know how it sounds in an audio system, but I don't recommend that for any iPod or flash player, just my tastes.  * Affordability, affordable, cheap, well-priced ... This thing is $69 online and at Best Buy. A few players, like the also excellent Sansa Click, are $49, but they are not expandable. For $20, that's a great option.  * One more note on affordability: Flash players and iPods sometimes get crushed, lost, stepped on, or dropped in rivers (did I mention I've owned a few?). That's their nature, or rather, our nature as clutzes. It sure feels better to hear your front left tire crush a $69 player, as opposed to a $149 one. Trust me.  * FM Radio. It's a great option, available on the e250. Works great.  * Usability. Compared to some of the uber-small players out now, you get a more readable screen. The interface is minimal but easy to use - what you want on a flash player.  *  Good size/form factor. It's not the Click, which is perhaps optimal in size, but it's small enough to attach to your clothes while running. I hold mine, which is plenty easy.  * Free 60-day Best Buy Digital Music Store trial (aka Rhapsody). I have gotten this with two of my past mp3 purchases. Have never signed up for the subscription service, i.e., never paid, but I love the 60-day free trial period. It's a great way to learn about new artists.  * Integration with Audible - pretty standard these days, but well done on the e250.  Negatives? There is not as wide a range of formats as you can play on a big old iPod or larger digital music player like the big Sansas or iRivers. But hey, this is your flash drive, for working out - for your selected collection, not the whole thing. And if you're strictly playing .wma or .mp3 files, you can in fact get the whole thing on there, using an SD flash card.  Bottom line: Probably the best deal out there now in the combination of features (FM, expandable), affordability (just $20 more than the cheapos), form factor/usability, and the not-to-be-overlooked sound quality.

<Title>Nice MP3 player for those on a budget!
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This Sansa MP3 player is a nice, rugged piece at a great price!  Pros: Solid metal case feels substantial, long battery life, nice screen size, cool blue backlight, plays videos, lots of accessories available, great volume Cons: Controls difficult to use for someone with big hands/fingers, no ac charger included(charger included works off of PC USB port)  All in all, this is a very nice Ipod-like MP3 player. Make sure you buy a case and AC charger with it!

<Content>Once I figured out how to convert videos, it was simple and easy!  You have to download the software for it b/c it doesn't come with it.  I contacted the company on a sunday and it was very quick and painless.  They were very helpful.  The videos are VERY clear and the music is a cinch to add.  Also gotta love the expandable memory. One way to save money up front on buying a larger memory MP3 player.

<Title>Excellent value for money; potential i-pod killer
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have used 2 ipods (a mini and a nano) and now I tried Sansa e250. Apart from the "click-wheel" navigation, i-pod nano faces serious competition from the Sansa e250. The reasons: 1. A bunch of features at comparable price points (a 2GB Sansa vs. a 2 GB nano) 2. Excellent look and feel (i accept the fact that ipods have the best form factor) 3. Value added features: non-scratchable display, excellent video quality, more rugged than ipods, FM Radio, Voice recorder, Battery that can be changed 4. The best: does not tie you down to i-tunes, can use industry standard mp3 version of songs, can create collection faster and cheaper (at abt 17p vs. 99p per song in itunes) The only weakness: Navigation for people with large hands! Buttons around "wheel" are a bit small for comfort  Suggestion for Sansa: 1. With excellent video and image qualities, a new version could be introduced with a camera. If form factor is a constraint some features like the radio and sound recorder could be done away with in the new version.

<Content>I've had this player for 4 hours, in that time I've had to remove the back of the device in as many times to remove the battery in order to reset the player.  The device locks up with no display, no sound no nothing but a constantly lit navigation ring.  Device BIOS is same as on SanDisk's website.  Direction in user manual state to "press and hold the menu button for 15 seconds to reset the system" BZZZZZTTT Thanks for playing!  That doens't work either.  Too bad, I really like the overall look, feel and features for the price.

<Title>great little machine
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have only owned one other mp3 player in my life, and that was 128k flash player by iaudio.  it was one of the first to come out, so it obviously pales in comparison to the players today.  I have messed around with ipods and others before, but never owned one, so my background on these players is limited.  however, i do know that the ipods are overhyped and over priced.  in my opinion, there is no comparison between this player and the nano.  this blows it away with all the added features, and it's cheaper.  i have had it now for about 2 weeks and so far it's awesome.  the only negative, and it is very small, is that the front is a fingerprint magnet, but let's get real here folks, if that really bothers you a lot you have got some serious issues.  other than that, it has great sound, and it's simple and intuitive.  it's also the perfect size.  there defintely is such a thing as too small, especially if you are a big guy with big hands, but this machince fits nicely in the hand and is easy to operate one handed.  the buttons really arent that hard to push, depsite what some other reviewers say.  i got used to them in about 5 minutes.  the program that comes with it to upload videos and photos is also very simple.  it's just a drag and drop system, just like you would do if you were using windows explorer.    bottom line is that it looks great, sounds great, it's easy to use, it has a replacable battery, and it has a lot of features that no other player in this price and memory size range do.  you won't be disappointed.

<Title>Quality MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I spent about 7 months researching MP3 players, looking for one with the most features at the most reasonable price.  Hands down, this player fits that description.  Here are some of the qualities that I love about this player:  1) Video capability:  although the screen is small, the short videos that you can load onto this player are fun to watch.  It actually comes with a short clip from, I believe, Star Wars.  The sound/picture quality to this short clip is amazing.  2)  Ability to increase music storage:  I purchased the 2 GB, but I have the capability to increase the storage by purchasing a memory card.  3)  FM radio:  If I get bored with the music I have, I can switch over to FM radio and listen to my favorite radio stations.  4)  Size:  I plan on using this when I run long distance, so I wanted a very lightweight player.  This thing is very small, and extremely lightweight.  5)  Music/Video/Picture Transfer from PC to player:  Before this player, I had a small Samsung player that I purchased back in 2002.  Although it has held up great, I dislike using the software to transfer songs from my computer to the player.  This SanDisk Sansa is compatible with Windows Media Player, making the transfer process quick and smooth.    There is one drawback to this player.  There are hardly any accessories to choose from such as armbands, fm transmitters, etc.  I have yet to workout with this player because I can't seem to find an armband that is compatible.  But other than that, this player has lived up to my expectations.  Definitely consider this player when doing your research on purchasing a quality MP3 player.

<Title>Not a disposable electronic device
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This puppy is one of the few portable electronic devices I've ever bout which I'm happy with even after a month from purchase. It does have idiosyncrasies though.  But I'm happy I made the right decision in not buying an ipod. Apple has a history of sticking to their own software packages (remember MAC-OS) in order to gain maximum profit from their customers by making sure they're stuck with them.  Microsoft's "PlaysforSure" format is going to prevail, because it has been standardized and there are a large number of online stores (even Walmart) selling music in that format already. These companies are going to be in competition with each other, which will keep their prices down. Not only that, there are many brands to choose compatible players from. People buying ipods and downloading music from itunes are officially enslaving themselves to Apple. Say their ipod gets lost or something. They'll have to get another ipod in order to listen to the backup of the music they've bought. But if I loose my Sansa I can chose from a wide range of brands for my new player, while still being able to listen to my music backups. Once Apple notices that they have a sufficiently large set of "loyal" customers, they'll start to crank up the prices on their players and music (already Itunes=.99c, while Walmart=.88c).   In the end Apple will include "PlaysforSure" on their Ipods, and will come up with a catchy commercial saying "up until now Playsforsure could only be played on dull little mp3 players, now they can be played on Ipods, IMAGIN THE POSSIBILITIES".  In addition ipods have the famous battery problem too. I don't like the idea of buying a disposable electronic device. Sansa-e200 has four screws I can open easily.

<Title>Buggy, but has potential
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off as one of the other reviewers noted this unit does tend to lock up.  I've noticed it doing this mainly when its power is getting low or when I gave the menu button a less than firm press when turning the unit on.  When this happens the scroll wheel will stay lit with blue LEDs and you either wait for it to compleatly drain the battery or remove the battery to reset it.  To get into the unit you will need a "00" size phillips screwdriver which is a size smaller than many commonly available percision sets sell, so be sure to check for that size.  You WILL need it if you keep this unit.  I decided to leave the screws out and let a snug action jacket hold the battery compartment in place, thereby allowing me to pop it open whenever with fussing with screws. The audio and video quality of this unit are good. The battery will last for the lion's share of a day if fully charged. The fast forward is slow which is bad for people who listen to podcasts or audio books.  If you turn the unit off without pausing a presentation it will not return to that point when it is turned back on. It will not play the video format, or allow the conversion of, a couple of popular vidcasts I enjoy. There is no function to delete audio I'm through with without syncing it to my computer. Audio tracks sometimes disappear or have a "ghost" presence on the menu even though no data is present. File management in general is messy. The difficulties with this player will hopefully improve with time, but like so many Mp3 players it leaves a lot to be desired. Update: the left audio channel on this thing went out after about 9 months of use, fortunally I got the extended warrenty at Best Buy so they replaced it.  I use the hell out of these things, sad to say it's not the first to meet an early doom.

<Title>A Solid Feel, A Good MP3 Player With Minor Problems
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a nice little MP3 player which has a solid feel to it. It has a lot of neat features but it also has a few "issues". The main problem is that it does not always "sync-up" with a computer quickly when you are tryng to load files. Several times, I've had to play with the USB cable connection to get the E250 to be recognized by the computer. But once you have made connection, you are golden! From there it is easy to drag and drop MP3 music into the Music folder on the Sansa player.  Loading photos and video clips is a little more complicated. You have to use the special Sansa converter software which Sansa provides, to change the various video files into a .mov format. It is an extra step but it has worked well for me. Photos are the same way.  The tiny 1.8 inch screen is viewable but it is indeed small. It takes a bit of playing with to get the picture to display properly.  One of the other "issues" I ran into is that some of the folders seem to   disappear when loading files onto the player. But with a couple of clicks of the browser, by going to TOOLS, to OPTIONS, to VIEW, you'll find a place to click on Hidden Files. The folders will return.   The final thing I ran into was using an external micro SD card to expand the memory. I found out that the Sansa e250 sees the music and photos that you have placed on the SD memory but not video clips. So the final solution was to put all the video stuff on the internal 2gb RAM and put the music on the external SD chip.  With all these quirks, the Sansa e250 is still a nice little MP3 player. I like the FM Radio and recorder and it works well. So with the falling prices, this is still a nice choice.

<Title>My First MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this MP3 player thinking I was going to get just an MP3 player but I got so much more. It has a built in voice recorder which comes in handy in college during important lectures and moments I feel smart and need to say some thing and don't have enough time to write it down. This MP3 player also carries your photos and movies. It came with this compact disk you put in your computer, which makes it easy to up load movies into your player and T.V shows too; which is cool because I got to watch Gridiron Gang and smallville on it lol. It really comes in handy in situations were you're board too ha, ha. The great thing is I got it for $59.99; I dropped it tons of times and it still works. I also bought the clear case for it, it makes it a whole lot better and safer too. the MP3 player it self plus with the clear case is way lighter than an ipod. It also comes with a usb drive to connect and charge to your Personal computer :) pluse theres a wall charger sold for it too; just search it and your bound to find it :) I hope this helps some body :)

<Title>This is garbage--DON'T BUY IT
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought this mp3 player for our 10 year old daughter for Christmas. Let me preface this by saying that I manage high level computer programming projects for a living--I'm VERY comfortable with technology. The Sansa requires that you either update the library using Windows Media Player or as a USB external hard drive. It took me three days to make the WMP interface work, and when it did, it was complicated and annoying. So then I just used the USB drive option, and while that worked, it's not something that an "ordinary" computer user would be comfortable with. I loaded it up with music for her, and for the first couple of weeks, it worked just fine. But then one day, she came and told me that she couldn't play one of the songs that she'd been able to play before, and then the next day, that none of the songs would play. I plugged it into the computer, and all of the files on the player were corrupted. Furthermore, there was no standard way to clean or reformat the disk. To make matters worse, SanDisk doesn't provide a copy of the OS that you can download, or on the CD that's included in the package. It's 30 days past purchase, and now all I have is a useless, dead mp3 player. I should've gotten the I pod. Incidentally, if you're buying this for a child or teenager, I recommend the Apple product not only because it's more reliable, but because you don't have to be a computer geek to use it. I have an I pod for myself and my wife, and all you have to do is plug it in and it works--my daughter can manage her own music without my help. That's a plus, and in my opinion, worth the extra money. But please, don't waste your money on this product. It's worthless. And the support from the manufacturer is even worse.

<Title>Designed to Anger Audiobook/Podcast Listeners
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you use your MP3 player for music only, my one star review is very harsh. For the money, it is a decent player if you never listen to anything over five minutes long. However, if you listen to audiobooks or podcasts, do not buy this player. I have used about a dozen different players over the past few years and I have never ever seen one so ill suited for playing lengthy files. There is no bookmarking feature and the fast forward is so slow that it is completely useless. You cannot start and the end of a track and rewind back to your spot either. Worse yet, it seems like the designers almost were determined to make it impossible for someone to maintain their spot on a long track. The record button has a hair trigger and is very difficult not to accidentally touch, and you had better manage to listen to that audiobook on one batter charge, because recharging will also cause you to loose your spot.

<Title>Sansa E250
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned the Sansa c140, Sansa e130, and now the Sansa e250.  First, I like the fact that it is done by SanDisk.  I have evaluated Creative's and RCA's and find them all lacking.  I picked the SanDisk for quality in memory products.    I was in a rush for a trip overseas and was looking for an MP3 player, I did not have time to order one in, so I researched products at local vendors.  I picked the c140 even though is did not have all of the features I was looking for, it was the best available within my timetable.  I got rid of the c140 because it did not have expansion capabilities.  Which when travelling the world, a limited playlists (granted 100+ songs) gets old.  Though it functioned superbly with absolutely no problems.  I went on an 11 day trip over seas and replaced the batteries twice, not bad for the amount of use it got.  But expandibility was my top requirement.  So I got the e130.  I know less memory up front but expandible with easy to find SD cards.  I ended up giving this one to my neice, because I had promised her one and the e130 was no longer available.  Now I have the e250.  This is great, video, pictures, music, recording, and radio.  Nice form, size is nice, weight is great, and it is rechargible, something the other two models did not have.  However, since buying it, I have had it lock up three times and now the left ear has gone out (not the headphones).  Amazon is exchanging it.  The micro SD cards are harder to find and all of my other devices need the SD/microSD adapter for microSD.  The navigation controls is the clumsiest of the three models of the e250.  My favorite features: - I like the controls best on the c140.  It is simple to use and navigate. - Layout of the c140 makes it comfortable and easy to use controls without having to look at it. - standard SD card expansion of the e130. - rechargibility of the e250. - Size, weight of the e250.  I looked hard for a product that was expandible with memory cards and that was light and portable.  The style of the SanDisk products fit the bill.  Of the three different models I have had, the e130 was my favorite.  Too bad it is out of production.  The e250 is an acceptable replacement.

The most significant issue is the computer software interface is very, very poor.  It is difficult to use, hard to manage the sound library on either the computer or device, and downright clumsy. This is a significant negative. 2.  The earphones are tolerable, but uncomfortable.  How much could it cost to upgrade them?    3.  While it has radio, it does not receive am.  4.

<Content>I LOVE this thing... I got it for $149 at BestBuy, and if buying again, would get the 6gig model.  My college kid's iPod died after 1 year (hard drive crash), will be replaced with a Sansa next xmas.  I use it for dog-walking and for long plane trips, have owned it about 3 months, using with Rhapsody for now.  Pros:   easy to use - acts like an ipod FM radio more rugged than ipod, better scratch resistance very cool blue wheel good looking screen, even in the sun expandable SD good (not great) earphones included better price than ipod  Cons: none yet

<Title>Sansa e250 - A Great MP3 for the Money
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little unit does what I need it to do.  I wanted something that could hold enough songs and battery charge to use while traveling.  Although I manage computer hardware, I didn't want this to be a technological nightmare.  Out of the box, it requires no software other than the standard Media Player and Windows Explorer; so ease of use is 5 stars.  Navigation through the menus is fairly intuitive as well.  I really like the combination of the buttons and the wheel.  The buttons are a little small but certainly no worse than any others on the market.  I haven't loaded any pictures or videos yet, so I can't speak to that.  The only issue I have is that the earbuds supplied don't fit my ears.  That's the most common complaint with MP3s so I wasn't surprised.  The other units that I considered were the Creative Zen MicroPhoto and the Samsung YP-Z5.  The Creative unit is a microdrive type and I didn't think it would hold up to the travel abuse.  It was also heavier than the Sansa.  The Samsung was more expensive and the screen did not seem as clear.  Some of the other reviews (including the s/n ratio specs) have indicated that the sound on the Samsung is better, but I couldn't tell the difference.  All-in-all I have been pleased with the ease of use, the size, the sound and the price.

Sweet! -excellent voice recording! -photos too! -nice sized screen! -SHARP looking! -EASY to control with blue wheel! -excellent music quality! -easy to transfer files! -20 hours of battery life! -micro SD card slot for extra memory! -I bought my player for only $144!  I've had this player for 3 days and can't put it down!   I feel bad for those who own the i-pod nano.   The only bad thing I can think of is it collects fingerprints quickly.   Awesome mp3 player!

<Title>Beats the competition
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my wife as a replacement for her old MP3 player.  It was getting old (4 years) and she wanted one that would store pictures and play video as well as play music.  I researched all the players I could find for under $200 ($150 target price) and this unit was the only one for the price that did all three - and it does it very well.  We figured 2GB was plenty of space for pictures, music and one full lenghth DVD and in the end, it was, but just barely (see complaint #2). We managed to put 600 songs (96 kbps - space was more important than quality), 250 pictures and one movie on it before filling it up - we'll get a memory card later to add more songs.  While I was setting it up (breeze to set up, ripping CDs and converting video took most of the time), I only had two complaints, and really in the grand scheme of things - they are pretty minor.    1. I didn't like how it sync'd with Music Match - it was just too cumbersome to load everything into Music Match and sort through the songs - then again, I'm not from the iPod generation - I like to manually organize all my files on the computer to review them and not let some other program do that for me.  Dragging and dropping worked a lot better for me.  2.  Sansa Media Converter - what a pain!  Of course, it should have been expected that a company primarily known for its memory cards would make this converter a memory hog.  The video conversion process took forever and was very frustrating.  First, to save space, I down-converted a DVD into a 160mb .wmv file (same program I use for my Windows Smartphone for videos) - then ran the program through the Media Converter to load onto the player.  I figured it would keep the same size file when it transferred, but guess what?  It blew the file up into a 880mb file!  After some research on the web, I found some cheats to make the file smaller, but the quality wasn't that great - something my wife had to live with.  If you are planning on playing videos - get the 4GB model - it's well worth the extra money and something we should have done, but I'm too stubborn.  I was going to make this work one way or another.  Oh yeah, one last thing on the Media Converter - convert the video into a .wmv file first, otherwise the converter will run almost through the entire video and then pop up telling you the conversion failed.  Before I found the cheats, I converted the video into all types of formats, including Quick Time (mjpeg B) to see if Media Converter would convert the video into a smaller file.  No luck yet, but I'll keep scouring the web for more cheats.  All-in-all, a great product - once I figured out these little tricks, everything worked smoothly and my wife really likes it.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great MP3 player for under $200 (and get the 4GB model)!

<Title>Good but could be Better
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received mine today.  Complaints so far... - Only chargeable by USB cable, does not charge when PC is in sleep mode. - While USB is connected the device is inoperable. - I've already had to reset my device once, it hung up on me. - The buttons are really tricky with the silicone skin on.  Compliments so far... - The price - The screen is very nice - user serviceable battery(take that iPod). ************** FOLLOW UP - Returning my unit.  1. The screen keeps going out and have to reset unit to bring back display.  2. While using in car noticed a thump noise in between songs - not very pleasant.  Also the buttons are hard enough to get at, but damn tricky with the silicon skin on. Hate to say it but may give in to the darkside and go with the iPod.

<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this for my young daughter, but also used by my wife when she is working out at the gym. We just needed a small mp3 player with a nice interface. We have lots of mp3's and wma's, and no aac's. So we didn't need an iPod. This player works well, is small, light and easy to use. Granted, it doesn't have the touch controls like the iPod, but what it does have works well.

<Title>Good hardware, bad software...
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The looks of the Sansa e250 is very nice.    Pros: Certainly have the looks that would make an ipod owner jealous.  Very solidly built, but very prone to scratches.  You can probably shop around and you can get it refurbished for less than $50.  Another nice thing about this player is that you can replace the battery easily.  Music quality is pretty good.  Batteries are available in ebay or thru their website.  Transfer of music is very easy and there's no need to install propritary software like itunes.  You can transfer music using windows explorer or Windows Media player.  You can also listen to fm music and record with a built in mic (you can also record fm music also.)  This is ideal for recording lectures and copy the lecture files to your pc.  Cons: FM reception is pretty weak.  You can't just drag and drop videos and pictures to the mp3 player.  You have to use the Sansa Media Converter to convert them to fit onto the player.  You have to go to every picture to rotate and best fit them.  As for the videos, it is very difficult to convert and even if you did, the quality won't be that good.  You cannot change the theme unless you use something like rockbox.  Perhaps if they improve in the software department this would be a perfect mp3 player that makes ipods look bad.

My son finally took his off because of this. I guess if the material wasn't so rubbery it would be better.  I would still buy it again, I just wish he would leave it on.

<Content>Product is an excellent alternative for some of the more sought after brands. It actually does a lot more than some of the more expensive MP3 players out there and the radio feature give it the edge but since the antenna is apparently built into the earphones, the signal could be a little better. The player interfaces well with the computer and uploading songs was a simple straight forward task. Although some feel that the player has limited storage (I think 2GB is more than enough for the average user) the expansion slot provides may possibilities. The size of the player is just right and controls are easy to use. All in all an excellent item. My teenage daughter absolutely loves it.

<Title>So Flexible Even I Can Use It
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought Sansa MP3 Player (2GB) last month so that I could listen to lectures on my way to and from New York.  It cost me around $100.  Although I didn't install the software that came with it on my PC, I was still able to operate it through the USB port.  I loaded the lectures as well as some of my music from the CDs I have without any problem.  With the software that comes with it, you can get better control of what you store where and how you organize it.  I guess you could also buy music online.  It was still very useful without the software.  One of these days I'm gonna bite the bullet and actually install that thing.  Another feature that I find great about this MP3 player is that it's also a recorder.  It does work better when you speak directly into it, but my friend was still able to record speakers at a conference - about 2 hours worth of speeches that are relatively clear when you listen to them.  The speeches were done over the microphone and loudspeakers.  I haven't used any of its photo and video features - although, I guess, if I had a reason to I would.  I like the product for what I am using it for and the amount of money I paid for it.

<Content>I bought this for my daughter, and I have to say it was a great hit. We were going to buy the ipod and I stumbled upon this in a review and the review really gave it high marks. Well with the difference in price being a good amount I decided to give it a try. My daughter absolutely loves it!! She takes that thing everywhere. Two things that really win it over for her (she is 13) the first is everyone has an ipod and so hers is different and unique. The 2nd is that the Sansa actually plays the radio something the ipod does not do. So I would recommend this to anyone out there wanting an mp3, video player, and a walkman!! It is well worth the money!

<Title>Video clips?  Not really.
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will not disagree about the music capabilities others have reported.  However, the video clip capability is TERRIBLE.  They list a variety of supported clip formats.  THEY ARE NOT NATIVE to this device.  Everything must be convertged.  This player can only understand an apparently proprietary setting for Quicktime files.  Only .mov format....and only with unknown settings.  Do not attempt to copy a .mov file directly.  It will not work.  You must convert ALL video and photos using the Sansa Converter, written by the terrible software company ArcSoft.  1.  You are supposed to be able to import VOBs.  WRONG.  It will import about 30 seconds of a VOB, say everything is OK, and when you go to play it back everything outside of the short 30 seconds is gone.  There is no way around this bug.  2.  You have absolutely no control over compression settings.  If you use the converter with an .mp4 file that is lower in bit rate than it wants, it upconverts to a higher bit rate.  The device can handle one, and only one, format and depends on all other formats to be converted using this flawed utility.  3.  If you import a somewhat lengthy video, the program divides the video into 114 megabyte segments...it stops for about 10 seconds between these.  There is no way to avoid this.  If you try to join the files, they will not play.  4.  The compression is about 65%...therefore expect 1 gig to take 325+ or so megs of space.  5.  The Sansa/ArchSoft converter software gives an 'unknown failure' abort when converting any .mpgs produced by Nero or Movie Factory.  This is really a nifty player.    However, tech support is useless, they have no concern about flaws or providing for the issue of battery charging support, replacement batteries and cables in the future.  You cannot get a cable or battery...anywhere, including from SanDisk.  If you lose the cable you are out of luck and must discard the unit.  I suggest this is a flawed implementation of a good idea.  July 11 2006  One individual reports that Sandisk will supply a replacement USB.  I have found no source for the hyped battery replacement.

<Title>FABULOUS!
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Needed to replace my functional, but very clunky first generation Dell Jukebox. Read all the reviews and decided to check this one out. OH MY! What a beauty! And VERY intuitive.   I'm no techie, working off my old Music Match library and this baby was a snap to load/play. The sound is full (I use an old pair of Sony headband earbuds and it sounds great; also have played it off my home stereo setup).   My only complaint is with myself: wish I'd bought the 4G. Thrilled tho' that I can zip in a micro 1G card to expand capacity.   Only issue: limited protectors (as in there's one) so far. I bought a leather credit card case and it fits nicely.   I have no problem with charging via the USB. Travelers might. I just visit friends who have computers if I need a charge on the road ;-) Or, you can buy an IPOD car charger and use the SanDisk USB instead of the IPOD's.   I REALLY love this mp3 player. Only giving up the Dell as it's too big to haul around. Still use it at home, so this was no mercy buy!

<Title>Very Good.... but not perfect. 
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must admit, you get ALOT for your money when  you buy this mp3 player. I have several videos already loaded on which were very easy thanks to the media converter (included cd) screen is excellent- bright and large. Video and sound quality is excellent, although when a song starts off quietly, you can hear a rattling and electrical sounding in the backround which you can't hear when the song gets louder. very sleek and thin design, yet not too fragile like the nano. Scratch resistance is EXCELLENT- a major problem in the nanos.  the problems i have had with mine: when i press the right arrow to go to the next song, sometimes it takes 2 or more seconds to show what song is playing and can freeze up. mine has frozen up 3 times. in whicih i have responded by updating the firmware. the firmware is nice because it doesn't make you delete all the songs off your player.  ONE BIG PROBLEM I HAD- one time i went to the music menu to select a song from the "songs"section when i had chosen my song, it COMPLETELY FROZE UP. i could not press any buttons, not even the power switch. I tried connecting the usb to my computer but nothing worked. the player didnot turn off until the battery died. (overnight) the next day i charged it up and it worked fine- no problems since. the chargeable battery is good. it is easy to charge it- just connect the usb and leave it alone for a good hour and a half.    it is a good choice to buy this player, but, DO NOT BUY unless you buy a warranty. you will end up losing alot of money.  i have a 2 year unconditional unlimited warranty, and i will be returning this product for the SAME thing. i think mine might be defected. but i will remainloyal to sandisk as I have in the past. (this is my 5th sandisk mp3player)  good luck and i hope you have great success with this great product!! :)

<Title>Refurbished
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got a refurbished e250 for my girlfriend and a e260 for me. Tey did not include a case or a lanyard, only included the unit, the sync cable, CD and earphones. both of them work great, really!. I was also surprised that in the back of the unit the word REFURB is engraved in both units.  Overall, seems to be better than the ipod nano.  I really like this MP3 player. Buy it!!!!!!  Just be warned about what you will get if you get it refurbished.

<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Love the features offered on the E250. Radio option is perfect for those times where the same old songs won't do. Compared to I-pods the Sansa is much more compatible for various download formats (audio books, music, etc.) even lets me upload free stuff from the library or other sites. Pictures look great and the option to load up a data-card gives almost unlimited storage capability. The Sansa is easy to use and set-up. I love the E250 and would pick it over the I-pod any day.

<Title>First one was defective, but....
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The first e250 I purchased from Amazon was defective.  The output jack wasn't secure and the slightest movement would cause the sound to crackle and cut out.  Confirmed it was the e250 and not the earbuds by testing with a known good earbud set.  Amazon replaced the defective unit with no hassles (5 stars to Amazon.com and their customer service).  The new one works as it should.  It's simple to use, holds a lot of files (especially with the expansion slot) and is an all around good performer.  The only downside I can think of (beyond the first defective unit) is the blue scroll ring.  It's stiff and doesn't turn too well-could be better designed.  If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 stars.  Overall I'm very pleased with the unit and would recommend it.

<Title>Best MP3 Player I've Found 99.9% Awesome
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great buy for your money!  Not only do you get an easy to use and classic looking MP3 player but headphones,USB Cable, Lanyard, and a protective case are also included.  Loading music, pictures, and videos is super easy just click and drag.  The screen clarity is wonderful and I would compare it with HiDef picture. In addition you can record voice as well as songs on the radio FM tuner!  Pair all that with the fact that you can add up to 2GB additional memory and you have the perfect package.  The only thing I can say that kept my rating from being 100% is the fact that in music mode there is no Stop.  You can play and pause which i guess is plenty but stop would have made my smile a little bigger.  Other than that this is a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone of any age!  Also, don't forget there are all kinds of cool accessories that go with it from silicone, leather, canvas and industrial rubber protective cases to Car transmitters and portable speaker docks.  Get yours NOW!

<Title>Great player, great value
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've never had an iPod, so I can't give you any insight there. But I did do my research, and this MP3 player delivers the most bang for the buck. It does it all, music, pictures, video, FM radio with radio record, even voice recording. You won't find all that in any other players this price. But my big question was, how will it work? Well after several weeks, this thing has worked perfectly!  The USB mode was a little tricky. After reading some reviews, I knew to change the mode to show up as a drive. The problem was, the music folder was hidden! I had to change my folder settings to "Show hidden files" but after that I had no problems whatsoever. I'm glad I don't have to use any programs to sync up, although I like having the option if I go that way one day.  The audio quality is great. The headphones that come with it aren't anything special. I've got some Shure E2s from my in-ear monitor system that I use, and those are great. But the headphones that came with it are perfect for work (isolation of the E2s: great for music, bad for jobs where you have to hear the phone ring!).  The construction is pretty good with one exception. The thumb wheel feels like it could break at some point, although I haven't had any problems yet. I've you've ever used and iPod touch wheel, this will take some getting used to. Other than that, it's a sleek looking unit, and the metal backing is quite nice. I take good care of my stuff anyway, and I definitely don't ever see this thing breaking.  All in all, I don't think you'll find a better player for the money. If you're thinking about buying an MP3 player and can escape the hype of the iPod, the Sansa is definitely the way to go!

<Title>Beats the iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>While I have only had the Sansa for a short time but already I have fallen in love with it.  It offers features not found on the iPod such as an FM radio, voice recorder (can also record radio programs/songs), and the battery can be replaced down the road.  I find moving between menus to be a snap.  The graphics are clear and easy to follow.  The roller is also simple to use with your thumb.  The sound quality is excellent and the in-ear headphones are comfortable.  The device is smaller than I expected and very light even when I have it in my pocket jogging.  The case is sturdy and great looking.  I've only placed two videos on it so far ('The Run' and 'Son of the run' for you Georgia Southern fans) but the software made it easy and the video plays great.  I've experienced none of the freezing others have mentioned. I have yet to record any voice, to me the radio record feature is much more useful.    Overall this is a great little gadget.

So i clean more.  I like it because it has enough memory for my music and his and we can just play our list so we don't have to keep skipping songs or erasing and adding songs.  This is the first mp3 player i've ever had so i can't say it is better than any other but i like it

<Title>This thing is the best there is, but it's not perfect
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player about a month ago after trying out several others and found it to be the best of them all. It's a great player with a lot of good features but it's not with out faults.  Here's the list:  Pros: - Flash memory (a must if you plan on going out - if you drop it, it wont break like a hard drive will) - Excellent scratch resistance on both sides - Great screen - video playback is good, but not perfect - photos look great - audio quality is great - microSD slot - i thought about getting another player to put more music on until i found this feature - up to an extra 1gb is great! - the wheel is nice for scrolling through songs - radio is awesome - voice recording is top notch - awesome battery life - 20 hours no kidding - two usb modes  Cons: - you have to charge it from the computer, so if you're on a trip and it dies too bad. - the usb cord is not normal, so if you lose it... you might be screwed - I keep it in my computer at all times so that wont happen - if your battery is not fully charged, a long video will run slow and out of sync with the audio so you get a japanese voice over effect - no dedicated volume buttons!!! - a dedicated recording button!? who needs that? - plus it gets pressed on accident a lot which is annoying. - start up is too long - the button layout, while getting props for being tactile and not touch, sucks.  The buttons are hard to reach because they're lower than the wheel.  So in a nutshell, this player kills all others in all aspects except for control and the occasional firmware bug.  I still wish it could have a click wheel like the ipod but its just a dream. oh well. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an mp3 player with a lot of features.

<Content>I have had horrible luck with MP3 players, this being my fourth one I believe. My last just kinda, flipped out on me. What I like about this one the most is the exoandable memory option. A plus if I ever run out of room for all my music =) I also like the screen, all my past MP3 players had very small screens, and only showed one color. Another thing I like is that fact I can play videos on it. I haven't tried it yet, but once I get around to learning how to convert them, I will. It's perfect for me =D I hope this one lasts >.&lt;

<Title>Very Solid MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a first rate MP3 player and I've been very happy with my purchase to date.  I primarily use the e250 for Music but have uploaded pictures as well..I've found that loading my pics onto the Sansa was actually quite simple, for either music or picture.  MP3 Player: Most of my music is in the MP3 format and encoded at 192 kps, my Sansa currently holds approximately 510 songs and could probably fit a few more onto it.    Playback is solid and I've been pleasantly surprised with the volume control, although I can definitely tell when a song encoded at 128 is played - volume is significantly reduced.  It's easy to switch from song to song; the player has a shuffle function that lets you shuffle by Album; Artist; All; Genre.  The screen is great, just large enough to easily view song title, album artist etc, but does not significantly drain or hinder battery life.  I would recommend purchasing a set of plastic screen savers.  You have to cut them down to fit the Sansa screen, but when the screen saver gets scratched up you can just pull the plastic off and put another one right on.  They cost about 9.99 for a set of 15.  As mentioned in previous posts, there are currently few accessories and it does not come with an armband, however I found one at BestBuy for 14.00 and it's been fine for me. Although I also agree that the USB only battery charger can be a bit of a drag, I have found a USB Battery Re-Charger.  You connect your USB connection to the accessory and it plugs into your electrical outlet.  It's worked fine for me and re-charges the Sansa in about 60 minutes.    If you don't want to purchase an iPod and convert all your music to the Apple DRM Format (if it's WMA), but you want to purchase a great looking, great sounding, windows compatible player.  This is it.

<Title>I loved it....until it stopped working correctly.
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, I bought this thing a bit more than 2 weeks ago....and for about 1 week, it worked just great (see "positive" reviews).  Then,  I wasn't able to add anymore songs to it.  It loaded up into the player thru the computer and showed up in the drive when plugged in but didnt show up on the songs/albums list.  Its like the song disappeared or was hidden somewhere.    So I took it back to the Best Buy where I bought it and the nice clerk told me that she ALWAYS saw this player returned (out of all the mp3 players).  She kindly told me this after I told her I wanted to exchange it for the same player.  I took her advice and took store credit cus I didnt think she'd lie for no reason.   SO BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!  They may have some kinks to work out.  I suggest either buying something else now and trying some later models of this.  Sandisk may have rushed this to get it out into stores.

<Title>MP3 players are getting competitive
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player by sandisk is a sleek little player that has many good upsides in comparison to the ipod.  It's sturdy and has a good solid feel to it (not a cheap plastic feel).  Navigation of the device is easy and intuitive.  The scrolling circle that controls the menu and volume is easy to use but the buttons take a little longer to figure out with use.  The screen is a good size and the resolution is clear and the colors vibrant.  Battery life is good.  Volume to earphones is loud.  There are some drawbacks to this mp3 that I wish they could thought about before they released this model:  1)There is no separate power jack.  You have to charge it with the USB while attached to the computer.  Which can be a bad or good thing.  while transferring songs, the player charges at the same time but it'll be less convenient to find a USB jack to a computer.  2)Radio reception and automatic radio scan was not the most important engineering priority.  3)Forward and Reverse button that move you to the next song is too close to the scroll wheel making difficult for fat fingers to access.  4)There are equilizer options (rock, pop, hip hop, etc.) but no manual bass boost options.  5)Software support is not convenient to use as the ipod but it didn't take me long to upload my songs, pics, and video.  All in all I gave this player a rating of 4 stars.  It's a good player that I've enjoyed and I hope you will too (I juse hope I don't lose this one...).

<Title>Works great for one week
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received my E250 on christmas and was quite pleased with how it worked and the life of the charge-- until today, precisely one week since I first laid my grubby mitts on it. After loading it with music and leaving about 80mb to spare, I turned it off. I get to work tonight, turn it on, and this infernal machine informs me that I don't have enough free space left to build the database and that 6mb need to be freed. Even if the E250 provided a feature to delete music through the player itself (which it does not), it wouldn't matter because it won't show you any of the files. The files ARE there, of course, you're just not allowed to see them! I then tried to reconnect it to the computer to free up space, but the player didn't register on any USB connections unless it was in MSC mode. Too bad you have to be in MTP mode to have your removal noted by the player. I then went to SanDisk's website to update my firmware-- the only thing that needed updating wasa *manual*-- not software! I then downloaded the Sansa data recovery tool from SanDisk's website-- this tool refused to recognize the Sansa and told me to call customer support. I decided to cut my losses and do a hard reset of the player by following the instructions on the website-- holding down the reset button for 15 seconds. By the tone of this review, I'm sure you can figure out where I'm going with this. Right, no hard reset. Now I'm left with a worthless pile of cables and an equally worthless mp3 player that decided to BRICK ITSELF. I know I'm not alone with this sort of problem, either.  ---EDIT--- Called Sandisk tech support, and they were most helpful. They resolved my problem in under five minutes AND gave me tools to fix it myself if I ever have this problem again. Having nice, competent tech support goes a long way in raising the score, and I consider it a wonderful feature.

<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product and it got to my house today.  I opened it up and I found out that this product like way to many of the current mp3/ media players cannot play normal mp3s.  what I mean by normal mp3s is an mp3 gotten by putting the data from a cd on to your computer.  The only mp3s that it can support is ones that have the special permition encoding like ones bought online.  This product did not even deserve the star I gave it.  If you have a library of mp3s that is all bought online then this is the mp3 player for you.

These are really great except for the fact that everytime I try to put new music on...a little red box pops up on my MP3 player saying..."Synchronize to continue music subscription"...I don't really know what they mean...but being able to record off thine radio is truly a blessing! Blessed art thou, good Lord! So, back to the Sansa...the videos are good quality and the pics are fine! You keep your and I'll keep mine! (iPods are useless) The world revolves around my Sansa...on Mondays, that is. Walking home from school with sleek black earbuds tucked in your ears...a sleek black Sansa in your grasp...and the world couldn't be any better...unless you were sippin' on some Frangelico. (Imported from Italy) Frangelico. Sansa. Earbuds. Miami. This is what makes a good life... May all fellow Sansa owners share in my blessings! Amen to that!

<Content>This MP3 player was the best Christmas present for my child!!  For those who are unfamiliar with modern technology (me), I was able to pick it up & easily figure out how to use this little jukebox.  My little one, of course, immediately started sorting, rating & downloading music with absolute ease!  Good quality sound & video.  Perfect size - not too small; not too big!  I like the added feature of it having a recorder and the fact that it has expandable memory (via micro disk).  AND what I really loved was the price!!  It's worth every penny.  I think I'm going to get one for myself!!

<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I very much enjoy this MP3 player.  The sound quality is great, but obviously the screen is a little small to watch movies on.  The headphones are a little uncomfortable so I would suggest buying a better pair.

<Title>Buy it Now!
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this media player! I've had it for about three weeks now and it's been great. It's stylish, pretty durable, has great sound quality, and shows images vividly as well as video clips. I would advise to make sure you take the player off "hold" before you turn it on for the first time, as it gives you and scare and will say "system shutdown" and not resart again, until you hold down the on/off button for like 30 seconds to restart it. Other than that little scare, I've had no problems with it. Of course the earbuds are kinda crappy, but who uses earbuds anyway? Just get some headphones. This player is a great buy for the money. Go ahead and buy it now!

<Title>Nice price, but the firmware is shakey
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this unit as a low cost way to try out a "Playsforsure" player to use with the URGE music service.  The player has a lot of nice features for the price, however my enjoyment has been seriously curtailed by frequent lockups, and reboots of the player.  The record button is in a really horrible location on the side, which is very easy to inadvertently hit with your finger while you are listening to your music.  I have done this several times.  It wouldn't be so bad if it just went to recording and you could actually stop it, however more often than not the player will lockup if you start a recording while playing music.  You have to hold the power button for 10 secs or so to shutdown the player.  More recently however, my player started a reboot loop which it could not recover from.  Even after removal of the battery, and a reformat/reupgrade of the firmware the player still couldn't recover.  It is now on it's way back to SanDisk for exchange.  I think SanDisk could have a really decent product, but they really need to work the bugs of the software for the player.  An "appliance" like this should not lockup/reboot.

<Title>Sansa Wipes The floor w/ iPlod
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Sansa e250 (2GB) on Thursday August 10th, it arrived the very next day, and I've spent the last 2 days enjoying it!  Setup was a breeze, the sound is very good. (And I have trained audiophile ears, have worked in audio recording studios since the 80's.) I was actually quite surprised at how good the included earbud headphones were.     After charging the battery, the first thing I did was check out the  FM radio feature. Very nice. Easy to program presets.  Reception was excellent. My only beef would be that the order you insert your station presets, is how it will search them. There's no way to arrange them to go numerically up the frequency bandwidth from 88.1 to 108.      Later on I loaded up my first 60 or so songs in WMA & mp3 file formats.  A snap in the "drag & drop mode" .  One thing I must caution people of... Make sure all your meta-data is correct on your song files. I found one or two of my song files hadn't had all the meta-data filled in, so the Sansa player displays "track 8" instead of the song's title.  My fault, not the Sansa player.  All in all, the Sansa e250 is an amazing media player!  Great sound, plays all my music files, I'm not forced to buy songs from only one source, like Apple's iPod, ( I'd say this player wipes the floor with crud like the iPod Nano...) And this is about $50 cheaper than a 2GB Nano. which doesn't play WMA files, or video files, like the Sansa... It's really no contest! This is definitely the better player of the two!  The only way this could get better? On Thursday, I paid $137. on Amazon for it, on Friday, the price dropped to $120.   Oh well, still a better price than if I had  walked in to Best Buy.

<Title>beautiful unit, but....
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is a real nice unit. great features, but here are a few that bugged me. the recording button can be pressed by accident much too easily. it has an equalizer, but not a customizable one. the battery is rechargable & replacable. but not like the c & e-models. they use a AAA. just pop in a new one & you're good to go. plus, you can only recharge via usb. not that convenient if you ask me. the display is top notch. really nice. displays time, pic of the album, battery life, time of song played & time expired. also, it has a slot for mini sd cards for expandable memory. really nice feature there. but if you have a really LARGE library, i suggest something with large memory capacity like a creative zen. i've seen high as 30GB but be prepared to spend. good luck.

<Title>Sound and view screen are great, controls are horrible
<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased a sansa e250. I mainly use it to listen to FM radio or recorded talk programs (NPR etc.) The files I make are large, usually about 1.5 - 2 hours in length. Here is what I hate about my Sansa:  1. It takes 1 minute to advance 14 minutes into a recorded program. It takes over 4 minutes to scroll through an hour long program.  2. The fast forward and reverse buttons are really stiff. And since the fast forward is so slow your hand starts to cramp after holding the button down after 4 minutes or so (to get atleast 1 hour into the track)  3. The buttons are inaccurate and you have to hit the "sweet spot" just right to get them to function making this thing almost impossible to use while jogging or cutting the grass unless you stop and hold the thing with two hands.  4. The FM performance is marginal when compared to my 3 year old iAudio cw300. To get the best FM reception you have to attach the usb cord. Who wants to walk around with a usb cord hanging out?  I am going to ditch my e250 on eBay so now I am looking for a replacement. Here are qualities (ranked in order of importance) that I am looking for in a DAP:  1. Controls that are easy to use. 2. Fast forward that starts out slowly and then accelerates. 3. A screen that is easy to see. (I don't view pictures on this or watch movies so even a basic screen would be fine so long as it's easy to see) 4. Great FM reception 5. Decent battery life. 6. Bookmarking ability. 7. 1 gb or more. (preferably 2) 8. I would prefer that it have its own have a built in battery. 9. Ability to browse by folder.

<Title>Great MP3 player...
<Date>Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great sounding player... and I like the features and screen. The memory size is a bit small... but, I don't think that I need more, having the ability to remove playlists and add new music. The expandable memory is a big plus. I can add more memory at anytime.   Some things that I wish this player had or was different. The headphones sound good but, are VERY uncomfortable. A user configurable EQ would be a nice addition to an already great player. Removing music from the player wasn't easy to do at first... you have to show hidden files and folders on your pc if you want to take off the songs that are preloaded.   It looks sleek and is not too small in your hand. I purchased this going on reviews I got from several reputable sources and have to say, so far, I am completely pleased. Picture resolution is really good for the size of the screen.

<Title>The way it mangae your files is a a PAIN
<Date>Sat Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It is the reading of this posts that brought me to buy this Sansa E250 player. I had it for more than two months, here is what I found.  This player can't organize your data in folders. While plugging into the computers, you can save songs in different folder, but when it is plugged out, then all the songs were listed alphabetically, just imagine how annoying it is to scroll down 150 songs to picking up the one you want to play. You can use the function of album, however, it won't work as you expect. Some albums will not show up. If you delete an album, it will still be shown on the window, and it has one song left there, but that song just has a name, can't be played, I call them ghost files, very annoying. I am not able to view those ghost files even you select to show the hidden files after conneced to a computer.  The payer was dead once, I hold the menu bottom for a long time to restart, fortunately it worked.  The ear bud is uncomfortable, with mediocre sound quality. The rubber ring of the ear bud is easy to fall off.  Reviewing and moving forward is also a pain. If you want to go back to listen to some segment again, it is very inconvenient. If you go fast forward, most probably it jumps to the next song. The speed to review back or go forward varies from time to time, not sure how to control it. Not good to listen to books on cd.  The FM radio works along the lakeshore drive in Chicago, but not while crossing the downtown streets or in Naperville that is 40 miles away from Chicago.  Do I recommend this to my friend, No. The way it manages your files is such a pain.  I have used 4 mp3 player before coming to this one.

<Title>Firmware Issues
<Date>Wed Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Watch out -- this player's firmware does not, at this time, support the playing of Audible Audio Books.  Sandisk has in the past eventually provided firmware upgrades for their other players to support AA format, but have not yet done so for this one.  So, it is a real pain if you buy this player with using Audible in mind.  (There are file coverters and splitters out there, but the legality is doubtful and it is a real inconvenience.)  Another problem is that the Sansa seems to be confused about rights management.  It won't play some music that I have downloaded from MusicMatch over a year ago.  Media Player does so, and says that I have unlimited rights to the music.  (It is not subscription music.)  But Sansa says that I have to "synchronize" to get them to play.  No matter how many times I do so, it still won't play.  Otherwise, it is a pretty good device.  The spinning, glowing dial is pretty cool, but its movement feels a little bit rough/cheap.    For some reason, when you try to view the Sansa's directory structure on your PC, when connected by USB, the "MUSIC" folder is hidden, even though the other folders (Vid, Photos, etc) are visible.  Have to adjust your folder properties to see it and thus to copy music into it manually.  So, I'd suggest that this thing is too quirky.  Wait six months or a year for better firmware.

<Title>SanDisk MP3 review
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband & I purchased the SanDisk MP3 for our 10 year old daughter for Christmas.  It works great for loading music & family photos onto it. Sleek design & glow-in-the-dark circle are very cool. However, unlike the Nano, it is not convenient to load music videos onto it.  As a matter of fact, we have not been able to that yet.  There seems to be no store like itunes for non-Apple products where customers can go & purchase music videos and then click & drag them easily into your player device.  If there is one where you can do that, we'd be thrilled to learn about it.  I haven't even been able to find one where we can purchase & then convert the videos in order to format them to play on the SanDisk MP3.  If we had to do it over again, we'd probably just pay the extra $75 in order to have the ipod Nano.  That way we'd have the ease of using Itunes which is a great web store.

I have the latest Acrobat version (8.0), but nothing I do will bring up the instruction manual! Given the above, this player was a waste of money for me. Also, the available Rhapsody music organizer is priced at more than I pay for my internet access! I get the bad feeling that I cannot get the instruction manual unless I subscribe to Rhapsody.

<Content>If you are hunting for an alternative to the stuck up company who puts on ipod who insists there is only one way to go, their way, you have found it. this is an awesome mp3 player that has excellent screen quality, i would say equal to better than the over priced ipod video. a lot of the options you have to buy a add on for an ipod, like the fm. all the buttons have a quality feel to them, and the wheel control feels better than the ipods, more clicks so more control. -Lots of connecting options and programable options inside the player, how you want it to run and how you want to put music on the player.  -Best part, you pay for a 2 gb item that is cheaper than the 1 gb shuffle and you get all there nice options plus expansion. i just ordered a 4gb card for mine, 40 bucks on amazon. oh what if i want it bigger, then i order a 8gb and then i have a 10 gb player for equal to the price of a nano that is 4gb.  purchase this and be happy.

<Title>LOVE IT!  Forget the iPod
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own an iPod Nano and purchased the Sansa for my wife because of the Sansa's features and it's 1/3 the cost of a comparable iPod. This player stays charged longer than my iPod, has more features, is upgradeable with external memory, and does not come with the annoying iTunes (that renders the iPod nearly useless on other computers when it comes to changing your play list). All you do is drag and drop music, pictures, etc into the Sansa's folder in Windows Explorer and you are done! I use the Sansa almost like a thumb drive to transfer files of all types from my home PC to my work PC without the annoying "syncing" that comes with an iPod via iTunes. I LOVE THIS PLAYER! A+ quality at a reasonable price.

<Title>Not working
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Received this product today.  According to Amazon website it was supposed to come with the Sansa Media Converter.  It was not included. In fact, the little sheet that was included indicated there was supposed to be an   install CD as well.  But inside it says you have to download the user manual and the media converter.    Okay, I can deal with having to download the media converter and the user manual.  However, the fact that it will not fully charge nor turn on is another matter.    We turned it on and it worked at first then we hooked it up to charge. We tried both the AC adapter we bought as well as hooking it up to the USB port.  Either way, when plugged in it indicated that it was charging.  After over 4 full hours between the two charge methods, it never did indicate the charge was complete.  Nor would the unit turn on (hold switch was in 'unlock' position when we tried to turn it on.)  It simply wont take a charge or won't turn on as it is supposed to.  We followed everything the tiny little instruction sheet that came with it said to no avail.    Needless to say, it was a waste of our money and I am returning it.

<Title>Everything I could ask for & more  - PLUS excellent file organization
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After reading Mark Butts review below, I wasn't sure if I would be happy with the choice of this device. To the contrary, I discovered (after calling SanDisk support twice) how I could easily create Playlists in Windows Media Player and transfer (synchronize) each named Playist independently to the e250. Problem is that there's one IMPORTANT step that MISSING in the user manual! Once you've created a Playlist in WMP, you MUST check "automatic" synchronize for the list to make it over to the e250. Otherwise, the songs will transfer to the ONE default folder, in alpha order and while they nicely populate the several sorts provided, alpha sorting only (as Mark described he was getting), would be unacceptable to most anyone. I find the player pleasingly smaller in size than expected based on photos, the earphones work well, just not as comfortable as others I have and will use, the user interface takes a bit of playing with, but is quickly mastered.  There were questions about resuming after turning the device off: Music resumes where you left off - however, Voice recording works differently, it starts by displaying the list, allowing you to select which recording you want to hear. The features of this device are outstanding. I have transferred pictures, modified the EQ settings to my listening preferences, set up the date/clock, backlight, etc.  Just recently tried capturing voice, sounds fine, see my note above. I've yet to try video from my camera to it. Support from SanDisk has been very good. The documentation is only fair and I suggest that you read the instructions on screen from the PDF as it's much easier than trying to strain your eyes with the paper docs. As SanDisk had none to offer, I purchased an Irocks 1050 usb/ac charger/adapter for 9.99. About the size of a large walnut, it supports 100-240V (good for international travel) and it too works well for me. All in all, an excellent value - Happy with the purchase!

<Title>Ipod Killer!!!
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well first off I am very impresses!! this little player has it all. I was just like almost every one else on the planet that got caught up in the ipod frenzy untill I actually saved my pennys and bought the ipod nano. I liked it ok but honestly was more happy with the Iriver I had before. I am always on the go so anything with a hard disk was not what I was looking for. the nano came out with alot more storage that I was wanting. I had it for a total of 2 weeks when my buddy got a new sandisk e250. it was the same storage that my nano had but it had more features, was easier to navigate and in my personal oppnion better looking. he let me play with it and in just the short time I was hooked. I sold my nano and got one.   loading files was easy, (wich is a plus for me) and it has a radio, (a big plus for me)and the center dial wheel makes it very easy to crank it up in a instant. it is a little thicker than the nano but, it also has a battery you can change on your own. not like the ipod that has to be taken in to have changed. the screan is very clean, wich makes it easy to share your pictures. I honestly cant say anything about the video option on it becouse I have not used it. the price is lower than the nano. The only thing I have to say bad about this little player is there are few accessories for it (yet). I will be looking forward to them when they come out. all in all I give is a 10 out of 10.

<Title>This unit is terrible!!!
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After owning the Ipod Mini, I switched to this because it also had a FM tuner, so you can listen to the TV if you are at a gym in a "closed circuit" TV enviroment.  Here are the negatives: 1. Dial wheel can't be used with one hand.  I have medium sized fingers and still have a hard time pushing the buttons because of the raised center wheel. 2. Synchronizing is not good.  I can't even delete files off of the thing. 3. FM radio doesn't pick up reception well.  Many stations don't even come in. 4. You can't plug it in to recharge battery.  You have to hook it up to the computer to charge with the USB cable.  So, if you are traveling anywhere on vacation, you will not be able to recharge unless you have you computer. 5. Oh, and if you want to get better FM reception, the product says, plug in the USB cable.  Who wants to carry their MP3 player with the USB cable plug dangling from it so they can use it as an antenna!!!  What a joke!!!  Don't even bother with this thing.  Spend the money on a Nano...

<Title>Not an iPod killer - just a very solid MP3 player
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I picked up my Sansa e250 right around the same time as a good friend of mine was getting married. One of his father's wedding gifts to the newly married couple were matching 60Gb iPod Videos. And let me tell you: they are eminently desirable consumer items. You just can't deny that Apple's design team struck pure gold. Nevertheless, when I was shopping for an mp3 player, I decided to take a bit of a chance. My criteria were primarily affordability and longevity (given the iPod's seeming 1-2 year lifespan). After three months of use, I can confidently report that you won't be let down by this sleek little player, but don't expect the seamless experience Apple's offering with every successive iteration of the iPod.  For an ever-diminishing investment, Sandisk is offering a full array of features, and this is where their e200 line shines. Audio, video, FM broadcasts, and photos - all at a price well below the Nano. I have no complaints about the sound quality of mp3s, which is all I use my Sansa for. Quality encodes will sound delicious. For my purposes, I thought the 2Gb player would suffice, but for what these players are retailing for these days, I suggest you pick up a 4Gb model. The Micro SD expansion is a nice touch, however, given how affordable that format is becoming.  Bottom line: a very good player that just doesn't have the "buy-me" feel of an iPod... but don't let that stop you. Sandisk seem to be behind their horse, and this is a long and lucrative race for all parties involved. That will hopefully lead to, as other reviewers have noted, continued firmware updates in the foreseeable future. Chances are you'll be pleasantly surprised at the deal you're getting with this series.  Pros: Very affordable price point for all models Drag and Drop file uploading (no need for any proprietary programs) Intuitive & friendly GUI Unit design Video quality Expandable w/ Micro SD Thumbnail photo sharing Resets volume on Power-down  Cons: Only powers up when plugged into a USB device - no AC adapter Battery life could be better (between 10-12 hours a charge) Non-customizable GUI FM Radio does not pick up signals very well Must play a song to add it to a playlist on the fly EQ - only 6 presets, none of which are great Scroll-wheel feels a little chintzy Overall user experience not as elegant as iPod

<Title>Top of the Line!
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Sansa! This is great little machine, rated one of the best by Consumer's Reports, which is why I bought it.  But I know now from personal experience why it is rated so high.  I only have the 2GB model but I can still fit about 800 songs on it in WMA 64kbps.  They just came out with the 8GB model. I want it! The company has great customer service, you can get an ebox on their website and all of my questions have been answered within hours of submitting them.  One thing to be careful of, contact them before updating firmware. Their are a few very important steps they don't tell you about in the manual or on the website that could crash your device, as I found out. They promptly took care of the problem for me, but they do need to make that info known. Nonetheless, I recommend any Sandisk product, whether it be any of their digital music players or memory cards, or flash drives. They are the best in the market. These players have not been on the market that long so they are still working through some problems, but are willing to help with anything that might go wrong. The manual is not the greatest, unless it has been updated since I made my purchase in 05/2006. After a while of using it regularly, you will figure it out and be glad that you did. Unlike many digital music players, the Sansa's battery can be replaced, rather than having a dead machine once the battery can no longer be recharged.  The memory card slot is great for the option of increasing storage space. [...]

<Title>Good player - ipod has competition
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's good player.  Just try the video, it looks great except the file format takes too much space.  It doesn't support chinese character which is big negative for me and I hope next firmware adds the support.  However I like the color and the feature.  The button is a small like other user review.    I use the Windows media 10 to upload the song, the playlist get transfer and song list the same order as on the computer.  So, I don't know what other say it's not transfer.  It doesn't had wall charger, however, I found out that if you have a usb hub that use ac power, you can plug the player into the hub and it will charge.  You DON'T have to turn on the computer to charge.  I hope that solve some of your problem.  I use the hub to charge and I have no problem at all.    I don't own it long enough to judge the reliablity. So, let see.

<Title>Somewhat frustrating
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm one week into buying this product, and all I can say is that I'm exhausted from frustration. It's a cool device, with a user-friendly interface and quality sound (very similar to the Nano). However, it comes with only a Quicky Instruction Manual (the detailed version is on a CD).   That was ok, but the Rhapsody program SUCKS! It's not just a matter of drag & drop as the other reviewers state. If you want your files to be organized, I suggest saving it first on your Library (editing the properties like Genre, Artist Name etc. to make sure similar files get sorted into the right folder), and then transferring over to your mp3 device. Do NOT directly drag and drop a file into your Playlist, and then to your mp3 device. It mixes up everything. No, transfer directly from the Library! Windows Media Player is a little better; however, the files get mixed up if you toggle back and forth between Rhapsody and Media Player.   A minor point, but the FM tuner is nothing to get excited over either (the reception sucks).

<Title>Beats iPod nano
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Awesome gadget. Packed with features, considering how small it is. Very sleek design. And oh so tiny! Memory expansion is great! Beats iPod nano for the same memory capacity! The only thing iPod is good at is putting high price tags. People need more than just play media ...  e250's screen is small but very sharp. If only the bundled media converter also converts iTunes m4p that would be terrific.  Thisis an awesome product! Worth the price, so much much more.  The only thing apple is good at is putting a high price on their gadgets.

<Title>Good player, very happy
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Fisrt what I didn't like. As most of you know, it's good for battery life to give whatever it is you've just bought a full charge before you start using it.  That's what I did with my new e250.  I connected it via the usb cable, and it began to charge.  WinXP saw it, but could not connect to it, as there were no drivers.  I checked the CD, no drivers.  The manual and google said I didn't need drivers, but it didn't work.  I then read there are two USB modes.  One for file transfer, and a special one you use to transfer photos and videos so they will work with the player.  Of cource by default the damn thing is set to that custom one.  Once I switched the usb mode in the menu, WinXP totally connected with it.  Waisted an hour on that stupidity.  Second, it's not easy to organize files in the player menu nor to create play lists.  I have my songs in folders on the player via Windows, but those folders are totally transparent when handeling the player.  I'd rather I could select songs to play by folder.  You can't.  Other than that, it's a sweet thing.  Battery life so far is supper, and sound quality is really good.  It's my new favorite toy.  I'll get me a 2GB Mini SD card for ~$30 which is the same/better then the extra money to get the 4GB e260, and I can use that card in my digital camera too!

<Title>Great Upgrade
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently bought his item because I had broken my Sansa m230-which only happened by the way because I dropped it and ran over it with my bike. Which by the way was a great mp3 player. So, since I was so impressed by the first one I bought from Sandisk it only seemed right to upgrade. I am very glad with the decision I have made. This little mp3 player has all the features I need and more. The sound quality is awesome even with the earphones that comes with it. Pictures have great colors. I do not store video on it but may in the future since it is an option.  Pros: great sound and color small and lightweight easy to use sleek Cons: chargeable via only USB-at this time easily fingerprinted-which can be solved with a simple cover

<Title>Terrible Firmware Quality
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Cons: 1. Unit freezes, requiring hard reset every so often. 2. After a album ends, it does not play the next album. 3. Play all plays songs by alphabetical order of their titles.  This makes it useless for audio books. 4. No Eastern languages support.  Pros: 1. Decent audio quality.  Some buzzing is heard, but not too noticable. 2. Decent battery life.

<Title>Great player 
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the e250 for appx. 2 weeks (my 1st MP3 player), and am very pleased with it thus far. Brief comment/observation: When deciding on the best MP3 player (in the $100-140/50 range) I have been truly amazed that such a large percentage of buyers are choosing the IPOD (Nano) route, which in effect limits the user to iTunes! (Although, in theory, other music services can apparently be used if the user is motivated enough to go through special file conversion processes, etc.; in reality, few do, I suspect). A great / shrewd business model put together by Apple, but I'm absolutely dumbfounded at the number of people who don't want CHOICE (in online music services) when so many great new services are being offered. It would drive me insane knowing that I paid a premium for a high quality MP3 player (the IPOD undoubtedly is this) but then was restricted to the use of that same company's music downloading service in purchasing downloaded music! Amazing... (sorry for the editorial; I couldn't resist. Human behavior of this sort - which seems so very conformist - is really perplexing to me ...). Regarding the e250: Sound quality = outstanding Ease of use / software = Good, but not as logical and intuitive as       it could be. (Sandisk is not a software company, & it's evident to       some degree in the user interface / software, but it's easy enough         to use and very quick learning curve). Size, appearance, quality of construction = excellent/outstanding. Very good feel, great size. Screen quality: Great/excellent. Overall features/functions: Excellent. I really NEEDED FM radio, since my fitness center has multiple TV's on different channels & I occasionally like to watch (& listen) during workout.  Some things that I feel are not optimal: -Buttons surrounding scroll wheel are somewhat difficult/awkward to access. This is the one thing that makes me scratch my head and ask why the company did not (apparently) seek external feedback on this critically important aspect of user experience. These buttons are poorly designed and placed. Unfortunate design flaw that does negatively impact user experience, but you'll get used to it to a large degree. -Scroll wheel - my biggest problem with it so far is the plastic used is "slippery" = not easy to "get a grip" on it, thus it's not very satisfying to use (more frustrating to use than would be a hard rubber material, for ex.). I would definitely buy this MP3 again, & to my knowledge it's the best price/performance/quality out there for under $150 or so. I'm really enjoying it & now understand what the MP3 craze is all about...

<Title>Sansa - an excellent product!!
<Date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been looking at mp3 players for a couple years now.  Always wanted one, never had the spare cash, etc.  I mention this so that my readership knows from what perspective I'm writing this review.  I've never owned an iPod...or even an mp3 player, for that matter.  This device has several things going for it, in my opinion:  1. Price - I don't want to say that this is normative, but I paid $110 for this device. For a device with good sound, 2GB of storage, and a great interface, that isn't bad AT ALL.  2. Scrolling Wheel - I know iPod has something similar, but I'm talking about what I like on this device.  Easy to control the volume.  Easy to navigate the menus, etc.  3. When it's set to MSC USB mode, it acts just like a hard drive when plugged in!!  Drag and drop your files. No playing with a magical interface that tries to do everything for you, so you can't fix it when it breaks.  The downsides are there...very few devices are close to perfect.  1. As has been pointed out, the USB cable is proprietary.  Standard USB plug on one end, proprietary SanDisk end on the other.  It's annoying if you happen to be a geek like me.  I almost always have a spare USB cable plugged into my computers, and I carry one around with me in my bag.  Now I've got to buy a spare cable.  It's not major, but it is a downside.  2. No 3rd party devices out for it yet.  DLO and Griffin have announced some neat devices, but they won't be out until this winter.  I want an FM Transmitter that also charges the device.  Nothing is out yet, so I must be patient.  In all, it's an excellent device!  I highly recommend it.

<Title>Picky listeners beware
<Date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sansa e200 series has a lot going for it--sleek styling, sturdy exterior build quality, an attractive and fairly intuitive interface and a boatload of features. It also has very attractive pricing right now. Many people will love this player. However, if you are a discriminating listener who uses in-ear monitors and/or plans to listen to music in a quiet environment (e.g., not at the gym), you may be disappointed in the sound quality. The music reproduction itself is okay--fairly flat, with some roll-off in the lower frequencies. This can be corrected with the unit's custom EQ. Unfortunately, the Sansa also suffers from some pretty prominent system noise--2 or 3 seconds of high-pitched static that occurs when tracks are switching. This doesn't happen during the silence between the tracks, but over the music itself either at the beginning or end of a music selection (and sometimes in the middle of longer tracks). Lower levels of constant system noise are sometimes noticeable throughout very quiet music passages, such as in classical or jazz music. This apparently is a hardware-related issue and has not been fixed by any of the Sansa's four firmware upgrades. If you think this might bother you, you probably should demo one of these units with your own headphones or monitors in an environment that most closely matches where you'll be using it (and not on a noisy showroom floor in an electronic store). It's really a shame because otherwise this is a top-notch alternative to the iPod nano.

<Title>So far, not so good
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought one of these in October, and it's already died. Fortunately, we also purchased an extended warranty, so the item is currently in the shop--and my guess is it will have to be replaced.  The problems--  Within the first 4 weeks, the item lost two screws holding the back on. They were either poorly installed, or stripped. Screws should never fall out like that, much less within a month.  The battery did not hold a charge, even after being reset.  After six weeks of play, the mp3 screen went green and black. That is to say, one could not read a menu, or anything else.   We were very disappointed, as we were told that this is one of the sturdiest mp3 players on the market. But until we get back the replacement and experience some of the promised good results, the jury remains--out. ________________ Update Jan 7, 2008: The unit was not replaced, no doubt because it was beyond repair. That is a rather pathetic statement about this item. Do NOT buy Sansa. Recommended as a "study, durable" item at the retailer, we'd have to say it's one of the worst electronic items we've ever purchased. Junk.

<Title>Satisfactory, But Not Good Enought for Daily Use
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an okay model, but if you listen to music daily for a period of time, an iPod would be a better choice (or a basic Mp3 player at a lower cost if you cannot afford an iPod).  It plays the music very well, has great color quality, and it is not difficult to use.  It is also slender and quite light, which makes it convenient when you are using it while exercising.    I only recommend this model for people who would not use it daily like I did.  As time went on, the tiny screws on the back fell out.  I did not notice this until one day the back fell off.  Without the screws it can hold, but that made it easy for the battery to fall out as well whenever the back would come off.  Although this did not affect the Sansa e250's ability to work, the color of the back faded in time from holding it during use.  Also, it began to freeze every once in a while; it is easy to get out of this (you just hold the power button for about 15 - 20 seconds and it reboots), but it became an annoyance, especially when it happened twice within a couple of minutes.  Finally, after only almost a year of having it, the battery went completely dead.  Of course the battery cannot last forever, but that is when I decided to  just upgrade to an iPod; although the e250 was an okay model, it cannot take the beating of frequent use in my experience like an i-Pod can.

<Title>Not bad
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall, not a bad mp3 player. Here are my biggest complaints: - not compatible with iTunes (you have to use Windows Media Player) - must use their cable (previous Sansa's, like my m240, used a standard USB plug - the same type that comes with most digital cameras) - no replaceable batters (nice in the sense that you don't have to replace them all the time because its rechargable, but that means if you were using it and the charge runs out, you wouldn't be able to just replace the batteries and continue, you'd have to let it recharge)  And obviously, all those "complaints" aren't really major things to me.   It is very nice that it would do movies and pictures as well.

<Title>Fantastic MP3 player
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this for myself a year or more ago, and I LOVE it.  I liked it so much that I got one for my 17 year old son for Christmas this year.  It does music, photos, videos, voice recordings and plays the radio.  Quality is great.  Easy to use.  Sound and visuals are superb.  One complaint is the goofy ear buds, but they all use those these days.  My son uses his player with regular over the ear headphones, and they work great, too.  I chose this model over the Ipod, and I'm glad I did.  The versatility on this one and value for the price are great.  This is compatible with all music software - we use winamp, but it also works with windows media player, etc.  I wasn't crazy about Rhapsody - the software that came with the player - the quality of the downloads wasn't always there.  We've had great luck with winamp, though.  We are able to click and drag to load songs in seconds.  We wanted the ability to load music from several sources and not be stuck with one software (itunes - used by the Ipod).  We are totally happy with this player.

<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my 11 yr old son for Christmas.  It is very easy to use and my son already has the hang of it (1 day).  The sound is fantastic on the hearphones included.  We had one problem at first.  I dont know what happened but it turned on and worked for a few minutes and then went off.  I tryed everything, even trying to charge it thinking the batt died.  Apparently, it needed to be reset by holding down the on/off button for 15 seconds.  After that, it worked great.  I almost sent it back!  Also, we have downloaded music from our computer as well as the internet and it was very easy.  I would have given this unit 5 stars but it is worth noting that it is harder to find a charging dock and speaker set for this unit then it is an Ipod.  I found one but the choices are very limited. Ipod has a million choices. That is the only con so far we have found.

<Title>Not Worth It Even With The Discounts
<Date>Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I usually don't write reviews, but I have to for this one. Looking at the other reviews for the e250 product, they made it sound real good, and there was the ~$90.00 discount; thats why i bought one. Mistake. When I got it, the picture quality and sound was perfect. At first, I thought the only con to this product was that you have to plug it to a computer to recharge it, but it was no biggie. But after I used it for 2 HOURS and I shut it off and was about to turn it back on, it didn't work. I looked at forums here and there, and many people with this mp3 also had the same problem. Some gave solutions, but even thought I tried them all, it still didn't work. In the end, I had to replace it, just like many others with this mp3 did.   The only good thing is the picture and sound quality; I'll give you that, but what use is it when it doesn't work? Not worth the $110.00. I give you my word that it will break in a year if not sooner.

<Date>Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was so excited about finally getting a MP3 player and had done quite a bit of research and decided that this was the one for me.  It had great features....and a very good price.  But.......it only worked about 5 minutes and the screen went black.  I was on the phone for over 1 1/2 hours to finally get a customer service rep that said "oh yeah...that model has a problem with the battery".  He told me to go get a screwdriver and take the back off so that I could give him the serial number on the battery.  Needless to say, I did not start taking something apart that I had only had for approximately an hour.  I am very disappointed and guess I get to start the research game again.

However, the first the first time I actually took it to the gym for a workout, I was showing a friend how I had this cool video of my Grandson to take with me wherever I go, and while showing her, the video froze and the picture just started fading away till it was gone. That was the end. It was totally unresponsive from then on. It's a gamble purchasing this item. I noticed others had the same problem so I didn't get a replacement.

<Title>Great iPod Alternative
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I originally attempted to buy this through Best Buy's website, and selected in-store pickup. Due to the store's ineptitude, when I went to pick it up (after being told they had it) not only could they not find it they still charged me for it! I still have not gotten my money back after several weeks of arguing with their nonexistent "customer service" department.  So I bought it on Amazon, paid $20 less, got it in a week with free shipping, and I love it! I'm an Amazon customer for sure!  As for the Sansa e250, I'll second what most others have written. Affordable, mostly easy to use (and I can avoid iTunes), great display, great looks, and includes the FM radio that works better than I expected. Now I have the option to listen to a ball game or the news in addition to listening to my MP3s. Recording off of the radio is a really cool feature. Displaying album covers is cool, too. Having a user-replaceable rechargeable battery is also a plus over the iPod (Apple makes such a big deal about not having any screws outside... but this makes it impossible to replace the battery!). The expansion slot is also attractive to me since I like to have the option of buying more capacity in the future.  As for drawbacks, I'm the same as most. I wish I didn't need to charge via USB, and the dial feels cheap (but works fine) and interferes with easy button pushing.  If you're in the market for a flash-memory portable MP3 player, I highly recommend looking at the Sansa e series players. They seem to be a much better value and feature-packed product than the iPods, for sure.

<Title>Sansa E50
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very versatile item. I have downloaded songs to this very easily. They play back beautifully.   The FM radio is a dream. I have listened to this in my office building in downtown Chicago. The sound is very clear. I walk around inside the building and continue to have great reception. Right by the elevators it gets a little fuzzy. Inside the elevators it gets pretty staticky and I pretty much lose reception. It comes back when I get out of the elevators.   It is light and small. I hang it on the (included) lanyard around my neck, and use the (included) earplugs. This is wonderful, and I really love it!  It has 2GB which is supposed to be 500 songs. It has a slot for a microSD disk. I have a 1GB disk, it should hold another 250 songs. If I got another microSD disk, I could swap them out whenever I felt like it. I could have a number of music libraries.   This is also supposed to do pictures and videos. I haven't tried that yet.  I have ordered a speaker dock. Also a little case for it. The included case, according the the other reviews, is supposed to be a hair and lint magnet. I ordered a leather case, I think it should be OK.  The cable that comes with it plugs into your computer USB port to recharge the battery. I can listen all day at work and the battery indicator goes down about halfway. There is, however, a wall charger available here on Amazon. Search for "Sansa Charger", the first item that comes up should be it. Make sure to check that it is a US outlet plug because there are European ones available. Don't get the wrong one.  This is the first day I am using this player, and it is working great. Some other reviewers have said it doesn't work for very long. I wouldn't know about that yet. I just recharged it to full, and I am listening to my (one and only) downloaded album right now. It is sounding great.   The menu is a little weird to get used to. Hit the little menu button to go back to the main menu. (It is the little button on the bottom left.) If you just press it, it goes back to the main menu. If you hold it down for a few seconds, it will shut the unit off. The right button works you forward through the menu, the left button works you back. The top and bottom buttons work you up and down through submenu selections. The top button pauses and resumes when you are playing downloaded music. The little round wheel is the volume control. The volume goes up and down fairly slow, so you don't scare yourself if you move it too fast.   There is a little port on the right side for the microSD disks. There is a button on the left that seems to control the record function. I pressed it accidently, and I'm not quite sure how I got it to stop now. I think you can use it to make a memo for yourself. I guess I need to read the instructions to really know how to use this little gadget.   Yes I have not read the instuctions yet. So it is pretty easy to use. I am pretty much loving this thing. I hope this has been helpful for you.

<Title>Good enough
<Date>Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have both Nano and this E250. Nano is faster on startup, slimmer,  lighter and much slicker looking but this Sansa is not bad, almost there. The bigger screen on the Sansa is a big plus. It makes up for other shortfalls. There are two features I really like on this Sansa are the FM radio and recording capability. On a side note, the Itune interface 7.x is better than Rhapsody 4.x and easier to navigate.  Bottom line is both units are great. can't go wrong with them.

<Title>Great features for the price!
<Date>Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a cheap 128 mb mp3 player and was looking to upgrade.  I was specifically looking for a 2 gb player and had been shopping around.  The Sandisk e250 came up here on Amazon for $99. which seemed like a great price for all the features that it had.  I didn't really care about putting photos or video on it but the large color screen is a nice feature.  This player works great with Windows Media Player 10.  I plugged it into my computer and dumped 102 songs to the player in no time.  And it's not even 1/4 full.  I can load tons more music on it, and if needed, I can even add an extra 1 mb microSD card.  I found the menu system to be quite intuitive and didn't need to resort to the user's guide.  I'm happy with the sound quality but I'm not a big fan of ear buds and might pick up a set of lightweight headphones.  I like the rechargeable battery and it appears to have a long life.  The fact that it is replaceable by the customer is a plus also.  The one thing I don't really like is that the e250 won't play while it's attached to the computer.  With my old player I could take it to work, plug it into a USB port and play my music through the computer.  Using earbuds or headphones at work is not an option so I won't be able to use this player at work.  Overall I'm extremely pleased with this player.  It has tons of features and compares favorably with players easily costing twice as much.  It's a lot of bang for the buck.

<Title>So far, so good...
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Despite what everyone is saying about the scroll wheel being tough to use and the buttons on the side being hard to push, they're right. However, it's extremely easy to get used to the feel. The first few days of using my Sansa were kind of strange, but now I'm even able to change songs and turn up/down the volume through the pockets of my pants.   Sound quality is good, but not the best. Also, having to plug it into a USB port to charge is also a hassle sometimes. Overall, I've had no problems with this mp3 player and I'm very pleased with it so far. And whatever issues others have had, it seems SanDisk has fixed them with new firmware releases.

<Content>Let me start by saying, I bought the Sansa October 1st. It is Febuary 27 and about one week ago the screen died. I still gave it 3 stars because it worked great and the Sandisk company was going to get me a new one no charge.It is a great product, but spend a little bit mor for the Ipod which will last 30 times longer!! That is what I did and My Ipod works great. If you want to take the risk like i did, go ahead but Just spend the extra money and get a great better product. Another thing that happened is that it froze up alot.Great cutomer service, great price but bad product. Sandisk, you got some work to do!!!

<Title>give your media player a boost
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the e250 factory refurbished for $30 (from another site in Nov2007) and it is everything I thought it would be. I have used this player before and liked it, but I didn't want to pay $100+ retail price for it because of the following CONS:  * Does not support many media formats * Requires proprietary conversion software (SanDisk Media Converter) to get any videos or photos (and some music) to work on the player. * The blue scroll wheel is bright and gets annoying quickly * The position of the wheel and buttons is not comfortable/ergonomic. This is a general problem with ALL similar players on the market. Try turning your player upside down in your hand -- isn't it much easier to use the wheel and buttons now? It is for me. * There were no accessories at all for this player when it came out. The situation is better now, but with so many products it is hard to choose and buy them online (just look at the forums here).  So why did I buy it? Because 1) I came across the refurb sale (mentioned above) which had good reviews and comments regarding 2) an open source software called Rockbox as alternative to the built-in software. If you are not technically challenged, I highly recommend you install Rockbox (dot org) because of the following PROS:  * Supports many media formats (mpeg, jpeg, 15 sound codecs) * Does not require any format conversion (unless you want to resize your video to the screen size or aspect ratio) * Lets you turn off the blue light behind the scroll wheel (or configure how long it takes to turn off automatically) * Turn the screen upside down, so holding the player can be more comfortable * Comes with many additional applications and games (you can now play Doom on your Sansa!) * Highly customizable (supports much more than the original software, including themes, multiple presets and configurations, etc) * Open source (with frequent updates and enhancements)  So far I only found one (documented and hopefully soon-to-be-fixed) problem -- it doesn't support MSC mode. You have to restart the player into the original software (by holding LEFT button when starting up) for transferring files.  To summarize -- the player is good and the software can be upgraded to good. Highly recommended.

<Title>Nice player, but...
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice player with decent display and storage for the price.  However, we had trouble with it and ended up getting it replaced under warranty (no cost to us) after some frustrating phone calls.   It is easy to use for music and radio, although using it to play photos or videos is a little tricky since you have to use the provided software to convert those types to a format which can be loaded into the player.  We don't use it for that, so no big deal.

<Title>Great mp3 player, and awesome value
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa e250 isn't the greatest mp3 player ever made, but its the perfect one for me. It had all the features I wanted, and didn't have all the features I didn't want, thereby saving me a ton of money. Here are some overviews:  Design:  Its not quite as responsive as the iPod, so it doesn't feel quite as smooth when you're navigating throughout the interface, but its really not a problem, its a no frills mp3 player. Its very small, and lightweight, but feels quite durable. The scroll-wheel (like an ipod) isn't quite as sleek as anything I've ever seen, but it works well.  Around the wheel are 4 buttons. One toggles pause/play, two of them skip to the next track or previous, and the one below goes back to the menu, so you can browse your stuff while the music is on. There is also a power button and a voice record button on the side. The screen is good for browsing through music and good enough for a few pictures. I wouldn't watch videos on it, so if you're really big on videos, not only does this thing not have enough space to have too many vids, but also really the screen is too small. One last note, there's a button in the top which effectively acts as a screen-lock. If the white is showing, its unlocked. Otherwise, if the orange is showing, its locked.   Basic Overview:  -Charges through USB cable to computer-2GB Flash Memory: for people who don't need all of their music on their player at once, this is actually enough. You're going to have to plug it in to the computer to charge anyway, so how hard is it to drag and drop a few files? Also, this player comes with a MicroSD slot, so you can upgrade the storage. Additional 4GB of space costs about $33 on amazon, so you can have a 6GB mp3 player for not too much more if you're not happy with the 2GB it comes with. -Around 1.5 inch screen diagonally measured -20 hours of battery life: I actually cannot verify this personally, but I have used it probably for 12 or more hours and it has not died (it actually has not died on me ever) -Voice recorder: Its not like one of those things where you can leave it on a desk and it'll record a conversation 50 feet away, but if you hold it near your mouth and talk into it, then you can make voice notes with no problem. -FM Tuner: Self explanatory, its a good quality FM tuner which lets you listen to FM radio -Advanced features such as playlists: I have not used playlists because I swap music all the time but the feature is there -Shuffle/Loop modes  Getting Music On:  -There are two USB modes that this mp3 player supports. I don't quite remember their names, I think the acronyms were MSC and MMC or something like that. The difference between these is, one of them requires you to syncronize your mp3 player using some included software. I found this quite pathetic and instead switched to the other mode (you can consult the manual for more specifics, but its an option in the 'settings' and I think its MSC) and that way when I plug in, it finds my mp3 player, and I can open it in "My Computer", and simply drag the files into the "Music" folder. Now, I can either sort these neatly by making folders for each artist and album, or I can just throw the tracks in there and the Sansa will sort and arrange them.  RockBox:  This is the most important section! If you know whats good for you, you'll upgrade the firmware of this mp3 player to use RockBox software. Just google it, and follow the instructions, and you can totally upgrade your sansa. There are HUGE advantages to this, some of which include a better interface, custom themes you can download, much much more customizability and options, Last.FM support (if you have a last.fm profile, you can enable it, and it'll write your tracks into a file, and you can take that file and upload it somewhere and it'll sync it with your last.fm profile). Also, RockBox enables you to resume playback and all this funky stuff, and gets rid of the minor complaint I have (see "problems' section). RockBox is great, there's even a mode where it'll read the settings out loud to you. But the absolute best part of RockBox are.......the games! RockBox comes with about probably 30-40 great games which are fully playable, including pacman, tetris, chess, bejeweled, and a lot more. But my personal favorite is, Doom! Yes, you heard me right, the full 3D version of Doom (Freedoom) is on this thing, and its really playable and quite fun. Sort of amazing that top of the line computers barely ran Doom, and now a cheap mp3 player can run it?  Problems:  This was the hardest section for me to write about this sansa, because there are so little problems with it, especially after upgrading to rockbox. But, after much effort I have come up with two.  1. The "Database Bug" as I have coined it. If you use software to shuffle music to your mp3 player until its full, such as the feature in Windows Media Player sync option, it'll totally fill up the drive. The problem is, when you copy all your songs over and turn the drive on, it'll search all the tracks for their information, and make a database out of them, enabling you to sort them by artist, album, songs, etc (as on all mp3 players). This process of creating the database takes well over a minute, and in the end, it'll work, but won't be able to save it because you filled up all the space on it. So each time you turn it on, it'll have to create the database for over a minute. The solution for this is, either try RockBox (although I haven't tried it yet and am not sure how it'll work), or just delete some songs off of it, which leads me to #2  2. If you delete a song off your mp3 player AFTER the database has been created and saved, chances are, especially if you're shuffling your music, you're going to bump into that track information, and your player will look for it, see its gone, and an annoying "corrupted file" error will come up, and then it'll automatically go to an arbitrary song, which is the same everytime, so you have to press skip twice. I deleted an artist from mine which was about 1/8th of my total collection, and it drove me nuts since I skip tracks a lot when shuffling as is, and after every song or two I'd bump into that error  3. When you stick rockbox on this, while you're syncing, if something goes wrong or you turn off your device improperly (I'm not sure exactly how it happens), the blue wheel will be illuminated, and then you can't turn on your player and it can't syncronize. This really worried me the first time it happened, and it is a problem with RockBox. The solution to this is to press the power button for probably 15 seconds (yes it really takes that long) and it'll do a "hard-reboot."  The Competition:  I started off this long-winded review by pointing out why I think the Sansa e250 is not the perfect mp3 player, but its the perfect one for me, so let me explain why.  I paid $35 for this (got it used, but in great condition [refurb]). I could have paid $250 and got an ipod, but I paid almost 8 times less for this. And here's what this has which the ipod doesn't:  1. Smaller, more lightweight, more portable 2. FM Tuner 3. Voice recorder 4. Custom themes (an assumption I guess) 5. Lots of games, and fun ones 6. I can play Doom on it!  The only downside is, its not enough storage, (oh and it isn't white, oh no), but I can buy a microSD card and throw it in a can of bleach, so problem solved!  So I hope this review helped you, and hope you decide to get this great mp3 player.

It's easy to use, the recorder is great, and it works with the equipment we have at the school.  Charging is no problem, although, I would like the company to come up with a way to charge without a computer.  But, I plan on buying more when I get the resources.

<Content>It is a pretty good player.  And for what is on the market in this price range it is one of the best buys. But, if you plan to listen to it while cutting grass you will have to have it turned up all the way (my old Rio Nitrus was way louder).  Maybe the ear buds it comes with make it louder, but I like my old sony wrap-arounds. And, I am not a fan of the bottons, they are stiff, probably so they don't get pushed while in pockets, but I don't like the feel of them or the toggle ring. The battery life has been very good so far. The voice recorder works pretty well.

<Content>This MP3 player by Sandisk works fine. I have had no trouble with either the media converter software nor the player controls. The sound is good and the construction of the unit is solid. Beware that although this model is equipped with a micro sd card slot, it does not support any sd card above 2mb. I found this out the hard way as it is NOT written anywhere in the user info nor is this info on Sandisk's website. I found out through customer service after buying a 6mb card that would not work.

<Title>Also a neat voice recorder
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I picked up the Sansa e250 because I wanted an easy voice recorder, and the Sansa fits the bill. (I already own a couple of smaller-capacity MP3 players, but no iPod, because Apple will not recognize my WMA format music.)   The Sansa e-series is, so far, the only MP3 player with a dedicated "record" button, and it works like a charm. No matter what you are doing with the Sansa--listening to music, watching a video, adjusting settings--just press the record button and it goes instantly into voice record mode. One exception: if you are listening to the radio, it goes into radio record mode. The recording works very well; it comes out ultra-clear in comparison with the junky digital voice recorders made by Sony, for example.   One caveat: I assumed that it would record in mp3 format, and that I could use the entire 2 gigs of storage space. Not quite: it records in bulkier but higher-quality WAV format (same as CDs, so it can play on your computer without any conversion), and the Sansa will only allow about 512K to be used for recording. That means a maximum of 4 hours and 20 minutes of voice recording time. This spec does not show up in any of the "literature" on the machine that I have seen. I don't know whether the higher-capacity Sansas are set to hold more, or whether adding a micro-SD card (haven't tried that yet) will expand the recording capacity.   And a second caveat: there is no auxiliary input for adding an external microphone, so you are stuck with the tiny but serviceable microphone that comes built in the machine, and there is no way to turn up the record volume, so you have to keep the Sansa sitting relatively close to the speaker if you want it to pick up everything.   But, so far, so good; and as a great bonus, I can listen to my music on the way to and from interviews, too.

<Title>Comparable to Nano, for sure
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had the e250 now for a few weeks, I mainly use it to listen to audio books in the car using the auxiliary input to my car radio.  Here are my impressions:  The Good: The sound is real nice, even with the included earbuds.  I think that the media player interface is just as easy as iTunes for my wife's Nano.  It plays video, it records voice very well, it has a decent FM tuner that get's better reception than I expected, The grey silicone case I bought for $5 protects it very well (compared to the $35 case I got the wife)and it has a microSD slotfor extra storage.  The Bad: There is no way to turn off the screen during USB charging, which is the only way to charge it (That's why I only gave it four stars, its annoying).  The price of the MicroSD cards is a bit high still.  As others have said, the buttons are a bit small but manageable.  (Update Jan. 4, 2007:  I finally got a microSD card for the unit and find that now any time I turn it on it has to update the database, which takes way too long.  Still a better buy than a Nano though.  SG)  [...]

<Title>Works with non-XP systems after all
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sandisk shot themselves in the foot with their documentation on this one.  The specs would have you think Windows XP and Media Player v10 are required; this turns out not to be the case.  The e250 has two data transfer modes -- Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) mode, which is set up to work ONLY with XP and the hideous Windows Media Player v10; and Mass Storage Class (MSC) mode, which makes it look like any common removeable flash drive.  Using MSC mode I had no trouble getting both Windows ME and 98SE (with USB drivers loaded) systems to recognize it and transfer files/folders with no problem using Windows Explorer. Also, MusicMatch versions 9 (ME/SE) and 10 (2000/XP) had no problems finding and syncing with the e250.  I suspect it would work equally well with Mac and Linux systems.  MTP mode's only advantage is to sync with Media Player, otherwise it is really awkward;  you can tranfer files but not rearrange folders nor rename files.  OTOH, in MSC mode you can transfer files bidirectionally, create folders, move files among folders, rename files freely, etc.  Otherwise, the e250 is a nice iPod work-alike at a much lower price.  I bought it to replace a Sansa e130 I destroyed by dropping one time too many.  The two are similar but the e250 is better in most respects.  The screen is larger and a sharp true color compared to the e-series' blue monochrome, and on startup it scans the files and builds a database faster.  Both read MP3 tags and will let you sort and select music by artist, album, date and genre.  It will also let you make one "Favorites" list.  Plus the e250 will display JPEG's and has FM radio and voice recorder function.  Only drawbacks I've found are [A] the four cursor arrows are not prominent enough to find easily in the dark, and [B] you have to charge it through a USB connection, which means you have to buy a USB charger device if you are going to travel away from computers.

<Title>Better Than iPod Nano!
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My older sister recently got me a Sandisk Sansa e250 as an "early christmas gift", and I LOVE it! It is very easy to use, and has a large, easy to see, backlit screen. The screen is about twice the size of an iPod Nano's, which makes the songs, and artists, etc. easier to view. My sister has a nano, so I have been comparing the two, sort of, and I would much rather have a sansa. The turn dial in the center is much like an iPod's, but you psychically spin it around. On an iPod, you simply move your finger around the circle. I have added some home videos, and pictures, and find it really nice. You can't do that on a nano, as far as I know. It's very cool, because when you add a song, it organizes it into genre, artist, and album! Unless you download the song off the internet, then it sometimes doesn't. The Sansa also includes an FM Radio, which I listen to a lot, and even a recorder, so you can record your voice, or anything else you want. Trust me... this is MUCH better than an iPod nano... it's even a LOT more durable! It's not quite as light, or thin, but it is more durable and shorter in length... =D

<Title>great alt to nano or zen
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is light weight , i love the easily useable and readable interface.  I use it for music mainly but the picture on video mode isn't to shabby either (just as a bonus feature).  has a really long battery life, info from manufact says up to 22 hours but haven't really tried to stretch it out that long.   only problem with this is the charger is through usb ONLY. there is no other method still (pretty new product)  As for accesorries, someone before said there were none but i did find a skin - like many of those offered for ipods, it is a plastic-y stretchable skin that does fit, the description is for sansa 200 but it works for this player as well. look for it on amazon.  have yet to skip, very durable, first thing i did when i got it was drop it (on carpet thankfully) still hit pretty hard but no damage so far :)

<Title>I LOVE IT!
<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the Sansa e250 a few days ago and it's wonderful. To summarize: 1. When you first take it out of the box, be aware that you should charge it before using it. (Kind of like charging a new cell phone). 2. The buttons around the scroll wheel are a little small, but I have regular sized girl hands so I have no problems with it at all.  3. The voice recording actually has a good quality and so does the video. I use the video to watch anime, but because of the size of the screen, sometime's its hard to read the subtitles. But I don't mind it at all. 4. Sandisk has great online technical support. My video converter stopped working yesterday so I created an eBox on the Sandisk website for assistance and quickly received detailed instructions on how to fix my problem. (I had to format the MP3 player). I'm trying my best to keep my Sansa e250 from malfunctioning for the next few years and, for now, it seems like it will last for quite a while.

<Title>Very bad but have had worse
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well let me start off by saying you will be fairly impressed when you open up the package and see the sleek design as was I the problem was exactly 31 days later (1 day after my warranty expired... how convenient) you will start to discover that its a real piece of cow dung. See what happened was the damn thing just up and quit on me. It does this thing after it is released from the coomputer called "refresh database" (which takes a long time regardless of how much you have on it) and on this particular day it never "refresed" and til this day (Oct.23 5:34pm) it still says refresh database everytime i turn the damn thing on. And just to make the matter worse I bought an mp3 player from this very company that did not play videos and looked very much like your typical strictly mp3 playing machine and within a week wouldnt you know the focus of the screen slowly dwindled until it [the screen] eventuaally stopped working all together. So in conclusion please don' waste your money if not for you then please for me ...trust me youll be glad you did. I told myself that i would NEVER fall into the ipod crowd but...after constant review this was the best i could find and it turned out to be crap so i guess ill have to swallow my pride and join everyone else . O and by the way the other mp3 player mentioned above was the: SanDisk SDMX2-1024 Sansa e140 1 GB Digital Audio Player with SD Expansion Slot Sandisk should be ashamed of them selves for putting out such crap!!!!

<Date>Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am not impressed with this product. I updated the firmware and followed the directions exactly. It then rebooted itself just as the instructions stated to only show "load main image failed".  Now it does nothing.  Also, prior to this upgrade it would freeze or just not allow you to turn off. In addition, if it is hooked up to your computer to charge you can not turn it off.

<Title>Some things left behind
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just purchased one e250 and really the device itself is good looking and solid buit. The earphones sound very well too, with good bass response.  But also I figured out that some things were left behind: 1- It won't work on anything else other than a computer running Windows XP. I myself use a W2K machine, so I have to borrow a computer to transfer the songs. You also can't use it as a USB flash drive because it won't work on any computer. 2- The file formats it deals with is very limited: MP3, BMP and .MOV Quicktime movies. To watch movies you need to convert them all with the supplied software. The software only works with the device attached to the computer, so it also doesn't work on my computer also. 3- There is no arm strap or case for the earphones. That's something that really misses on a portable device. 4- It does not support accents on the name of the musics. It will show accented characters as a square.

<Title>My first and last Sansa
<Date>Mon Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I read quite a few negative reviews about the Sansa, but I still decided to give it a shot. When I got it, I carefully followed all the instructions and loaded my music. While listening to it, the screen went white and the Sansa died ... after less than one hour of play. And I mean it really, quite sincerely died. Guess I should have heeded all those negative reviews. I went to SanDisk's website to try to troubleshoot it, but the amount of work they expected me to do to on a brand new product was unreasonable. Fortunately, Amazon took it back and gave me a prompt and hassle-free refund. I'll stick with MUVO...

<Content>This is a great device. 2GB holds a lot of songs, videos and photos.  The FM radio tuner picks up the stations I listen to clearly. The videos and photos show detail very well.  It's small, but does a lot.  You can record your voice and playback is crisp and clear.  The only issue is using an mini expansion SD, but I believe the problem was me not understanding what I was doing, not the device.  I love it.

<Content>I purchased this product as a Christmas present for my teenage daughter.  While not an iPod, it was more affordable & seemed to offer the same features.  What a mistake.  It never really worked well from the beginning.  It kept loosing music. the video portion never worked fluidly.  Then, one day I called tech support & they gave me tips on reprogramming it.  We did & the screen went rainbow.  My daughter never used it, went back to her old fashioned use the batteries mp3 player. Leaving it alone, a cat walked on it broke the screen & it's the biggest waste of over $100 I have EVER made. Sandisk sucks! @least this Sandisk product does.

<Title>An Absolutely Horrible Little Gadget
<Date>Fri Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Sansa e250 for a little under a year and it's been hell every day with this thing.  The first few months of owning this player was great, but then it started giving me errors, minor errors, but they were still noticeable and I had to discover little shortcuts and quick fixes to make up for it.  It was working alright, then it stopped playing audio out of the left channel.  I had to fix that by wrapping a rubber band around the player to keep the audio wire in a tight position so I can get sound out of both earphones.  Then after that, it started giving me massive programming errors; menus would take forever to load, settings would pretty much set themselves to whatever the player wanted to (totally erasing my settings) and worst of all, it stopped displaying my music.  I have over 1080 songs on it and now none of them are showing up.  When I connect it to the computer, you can see that the songs are obviously there, but when I disconnected it, poof all gone!  Really save yourself the trouble and just get an iPod or another player.  I wanted to get this player as an iPod alternative, but this thing is just horrible, I haven't had one month of uninterrupted usage since I got it.  On top of all that, Sandisk's customer service is a joke.  There's a reason why it's so cheap, seriously look into getting another player if you want quality.

<Content>SanDisk E260 is a great little unit and ideally suited to listening to recorded books which is what I do. The E series San Disk will only download the free library book format. It's easy to operate and has a rechargeable battery that last about 12 hours.  The silicon rubberized case is and after market item and doesn't provide a belt clip or fastening device. I cut a small retangular section out of the back of the rubber and stuck a piece of velcroe through the cut out to the MP3. I made and belt loop with a Velcroe patch that I attach the MP3 to.  Unit easly downloads books using library or Media sofware and with 2 Gigs it will easily download about 20 books, give or take.

<Title>Great little player! 
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading mixed reviews of this product I took the plunge and got it for my 11 year old son for his birthday. I have an Ipod Nano (2nd generation) myself and I totally prefer the Sansa E250 to my Ipod. It's heavier in weight - but that's not an issue. The screen is clear and bright, the sound quality is great. I uploaded music, photos, and video for him ahead of time and he's been using it constantly. The video quality is great - now, I haven't seen video on an Ipod so I can't compare, but it looks crystal clear to me on the Sansa.  So far we've had zero issues with freezing up as others have had. The software was easy to download although my computer did slow down for a while, but that's been resolved. It's far easier to drag and drop files onto the Sansa vs. using Itunes with my Ipod. Using the converter program to upload photos and videos is very easy as well, and takes seconds to do.   I HIGHLY recommend this player - granted he's only had it a week, but it's given us no trouble at all. We are getting a case and screen protector for it just because some reviewers have noted that the screen scratches and breaks easily. The price is far better than an Ipod and the quality is just as good.

<Title>Excellent Nano Alternative
<Date>Tue May 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since I have most of my music files ripped in WMA format, I've been  looking for a flash MP3 player to compete with the IPOD Nano. After much research, I decided to take a chance on this newly released player.   I'm very impressed to start. The player is small (just a bit thicker than the Nano), and fairly light. The screen shows excellent color- based on the menus. I'm not planning to use it much for video or photos, so I'm not very concerned with the screen size, which is expectedly small. The player in general is very easy to use. I looked over the quick reference guide and didn't even bother with the user guide (user guide is in PDF format on the cd-rom.) The overall appearance is excellent.    You can load music by dragging and dropping, or using Windows Media Player 10. I prefer to use WMP10 to sync, since I have my music organized well. Syncing in this manner was very simple. I didn't encounter any issues with the first two syncs I've performed. If you have your id3 tags correct, the Sansa will display your music by Artist, Album, Songs, or Genere. There's also a "To Go playlist". The Sansa sorted my music just fine. The display is informative when playing music. The sound so far is excellent. I've used a few different headsets to test it and have no complaints.  The center dial/wheel rotates and glows in a bright blue. It allows you to scroll through menu items and to increase/decrease the volume. The directional buttons around the wheel are a little difficult to use with only one hand. Because the center dial is raised so much, you end up needing to use the tips of your fingers to press the buttons that surround it. I suppose it will take a little getting used to- but it's not a dealbreaker for me.    Following the precedent set by other companies. The USB connector is of course proprietary. This is currently the only way to charge the Sansa, so don't lose it. I don't see any wall/travel charges offered yet- even at the Sandisk Website. Since it's new- there aren't really any accessories offered. This isn't a concern to me personally- so I bought it anyway. I definitely would like a separate charging apparatus, rather than having to charge via USB- so I hope Sandisk offers such an item, sooner rather than later.   It comes with a small velvet pouch. I'll be searching for some sort of "skin" to protect the player, instead of relying on the pouch. It's just not efficient if you want to protect and use the player at the same time.   Pros: It looks beautiful.  Plays WMA Files. Easy to sync. Drag & Drop available. Sounds great. Flash memory- so no need to wory about hard drive skipping.  2GB of memory with models that go up to 6GB. Expansion slot for miniSD cards for more memory. Lots of features: Music, Video, Pics, FM, Voice Recording, etc. Price - $159.  Cons: Buttons can be hard to use. Charging via USB only (at this time.) Not many accessories offered (yet.) Doesn't support many file types.  Again, please understand when reading this, that my primary use is for music. All the other features are merely a bonus for me. So if you're looking for something to use regularly to play video, pics, etc- please do your homework to see if the player is a good fit for your needs. Most of the time when I read negative reviews, it's because the reviewer bought something that did not fit their needs. Companies are in business to sell their products- do your own research to determine if the product is right for you.

It has lost of features such as subscription compatibility, an FM tuner/recorder, voice recording, and photo and video playback into a compact and durable device. I love the tactile navigation wheel.   And unlike the ipod you can actually remove and change the battery. Another cool bonus is that I can store mp3 on Micro SD cards, then load them on the player as I see fit. Hence, this give this player unlimited storage capacity. Great player

My friend has a nano and honestly I think this SanDisk is way better. FM tuner, can accept pictures and videos. The record (voice or radio) feature is sweet and it will know what order to put songs in when you transfer an album into it (as well as give you the cover artwork). The menus and LSD screen are top notch as well.  It can only be charged in a USB slot.. which might bug some people. I usually charge it in my Xbox 360 USB slot while i'm playing games.

<Content>I've been reading about the Sansa e250 since it was launched at the CES in Las Vegas in January.  I'm glad I waited until it was finally available; it's a feature-rich package at a great price that really does give the iPod Nano a run for it's money.  It's true that the controls take a while to get used to - but  let's face it, it's always going to be hard to beat iPod's click wheel for ease of use.  I have no real complaints and set-up for me was very easy - I was listening within minutes.  I did consider the c140/c150, launched at the same time, but they feel really flimsy and I have seen reviews questioning sound quality.  No such problems with the e250 - I'd recommend it without hesitation.

<Title>The Benchmark for MP3 players
<Date>Wed May 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>PROS: Fantastic quality, functionality, and price. Durable  CONS: Lack of accessories   In the world of MP3 players, it seems there exists two categories; I-Pod and everyone else.  As an employee of a major retail electronics outlet, the sheer volume of customers coming in requesting I-Pods (for no other reason than they saw it on TV), is a testament to Apple's overwhelming marketing success in the industry.  However, while I-Pods account for about 60% of all sales of MP3 players, they constitute a larger than average share of our MP3 repairs and service.  Additionally, the sheer over saturation coupled with the fact that consumers are forced to use I-tunes to interface their songs encouraged me to think outside of the I-Pod empire, and research various competitor models.  	After comparing several models of MP3 players I decided to purchase the Scandisk e250, it has proven to be a great choice.  The design is slightly similar to an I-Pod, however its' dark colors and sophisticated design distinguished it from other run of the mill handhelds on the market. The most impressive feature on this unit is its' display screen.  While similar in size to some of its competitors, the vibrant display is bright, clear, easy to read, and is advertised as scratch resistant. Best of all, a 2GB model (about 500 songs) cost twenty dollars less than a comparable I-pod.   	In terms of overall functionality, I can't praise the e250 enough.  A very easy interface by way of USB will load any file format of music and mpeg video for easy organization and storage. The FM tuner provided, delivers a strong signal for radio fans, and the unit also stores digital photos and movie clips.  The menu is very well organized and easy to navigate when you're on the go.  	In terms of durability, I've owned this player for about a month and it has shown almost no sign of wear and tear, it has gone with me virtually everywhere in various conditions indoors and outdoors.  I tend to take care of my gear, but as a 21 year old college student, the e250's durability is tested daily, and has surpassed any MP3 player I have previously owned.  Perhaps the only drawback to the e250 is the sparse selection of cases and other accessories for this unit. However, as popularity of the brand increases (which it hopefully will when others learn of its quality value) availability of accessories should follow suit.  Overall, the e250 delivers outstanding quality and value for the money.

MUCH more durable than iPod Won't attract fingerprints and scratches like the nano Battery life is phenominal had for 3 days barely a dent in the meter.  CON'S (If that) Maybe the buttons could be a little bigger. Video quality isn't the best. What do you expect for a 1.7" screen though? I bought my mp3 player for songs anyways. If you want to watch videos, by a portable dvd player

<Content>Sometimes Rhapsody's wma's won't play right away. Two days after I got it, I turned it on and the display was just a bunch of squares and nothing would play. I reloaded it and it has worked quite well since (other than hanging at the beginning of some tracks occasionally). Also bought a Toshiba Gigabeat 40gb player which is advertised as Rhapsody compliant. The thing was complete garbage. It would play some Rhapsody tracks, but mostly it would not. I returned it and will stick with the sandisk. My only complaint is that they don't make one with enought space to hold all my Rhapsody tracks plus my cd collection. Having to remove and reload tracks is kind of a hassle. Overall, very satisfied, though.

<Content>I am a very active woman and would recommend this device to everyone.  I like the dial with the ridges as with my bike gloves on I can easily manipulate the device.  The customer service department has been great in responding to questions both by e-mail and over the phone.  I have downloaded 500+ songs.  I have also downloaded books from my local library system for free.  I haven't yet used the movie aspect.  The radio tuner is very poor in my rural, northern wisconsin area.  My computer operating system is XP pro.  I see this device also plays WMA format and this would allow for even more songs so I will check into this option.  I purchased just this week the new arm band and protective case which I really like much better than the earlier silicone cover which I do not like as well.  My little son can operate this system very well and I don't have to worry about him deleating anything accidentally as this is only done on the computer hookup.  We have a dual jack so we can both listen on the motorcycle.  I see on the sandisk site that there is a new accessory that will allow us to play over our car radio and charge at the same time.  I will get this as soon as available.  The free books from the online library is so cool on this.  No more switching over cd's!

<Title>Beware, Never worked. Nice piece of garbage.
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After reading all the reviews, I decided to take the risk and order this player in the 2 Gb version (e250). The player was nice in outside, I get to my house open the box, charged the player and.... nothing happened. The player started and after the San Disk Logo, it went into a black screen. I follow all the instructions on the FAQ in the San Disk web site, and in the instruction book in the included CD. After reseting the player it alternates between a black screen and a stripped one. The player never worked. I packed everything and will send it back to Amazon. I will ask for a refund and I will buy an iPod from my local retailer. It's a shame, it was a nice player

<Title>Great Product....and now at a great price!!!!!!!
<Date>Thu Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Sansa since early May and I love it.  I too had some of the sync/refresh database problems that a few of the other reviewers noted.  However, if you'll play around a little bit, you can actually treat the device just like a jump drive in Windows Xp and reformat the thing.  Media Player 10 will then restore the drive structure for you and you can re-sync your songs.  Patience is the key here.  I love the price, the size, the sound, the display...everything.  I just hope SanDisk will hurry up and get the licensing stuff taken care of so I can get some accessories (car charger, FM Modulator, speakers, etc.).  I also highly recommend a gel-skin for the Sansa.  Overall, this is an excellent product.

<Title>Great Value Great Sound
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My first experience with a MP3 player of my own, and I am very impressed. Great features at a great price. Easy for this 57 year old grandfather to use. Listen to it all the time now. Good FM reception, and I live back in the woods. Music quality very good, although not a good as some Ipod's I have listened to. I suggest upgrading to Shure earplugs to improve overall sound quality. Would be better if it had regular charging adapter, but they are available for low price. My grandkids love it.

<Title>Easy to use technology.
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this to replace a Dell DJ ditty.  I got it for free when I ordered my laptop and it died less than 8 months later.    I needed to find a replacement and I did like the small size of the Ditty.  I looked at several models including the I-Pod and decided on the Sansa e250 because it is expandable, small and easy to use.    I like technology to be understandable even if you are not a techie who has hours to spend figuring out the nuances of hardware, software, shareware, firmware etc.  I just want to be able to follow instructions and with some effort get the device to work.    This device is easy to operate and understand.  I have my favorite albums, I listen in the grocery store, waiting rooms on the train and I find time seems to pass faster with great music.  Installing the software was a breeze.  You can also put pictures and video on this device; I keep pictures and video of my kids on this to share with friends.  Mine has been going strong for six months and I am still pleased with this purchase.

<Title>great mp3 player..for the price
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>originally bought this for my husband to borrow it to take to work. Didn't know that it was a great little gadget. it has everything (what i probably wouldn't use now) for its price. my husband loves it and looking to getting one for himself. the only problem with it for me is the headphones, they are quite big for my small ear canals(hurts after awhile of wearing it). But with my husband it fits perfect for him. it plays fm radio, which we both like, and to find out it can record a song you like on the radio instantly is great. it is compatable with all music subscription online(the other one he received as a gift won't do that).video showbacks are good for him too. great little player in one. i would have given this a 5 star, but the headphones weren't good for me.

<Title>A good mp3 player
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player is definetly worth it's money. The sound quality is pretty good. The battery lasts about 19 hours. It has a pretty nice screen yet it scratches easily so it's a good idea to buy screen protectors and a case even though it does cover up the player making it look less appealing. The player is pretty easy to use and transfer music. Though when I used Rapsody To Go with the player the synchronizing was screwed up and a screen kept on popping up saying that music needed to be updated even though I tried serveral times. So it comes back once in a while. For some reason my mp3 player just died on me and didn't work properly. The screen wouldn't show up, it wouldn't turn on/off properly and I couldn't play my music. So I sent it back and am now waiting for a new one. The support service for SanDisk is very helpful and considerate.  I think it's just my player that was defective. Though overall the player is very good for it's value compared to an ipod (replaceable battery, radio, and less $$) and it's great to exercise with. I recommend the player to anyone who is looking for a compact mp3 player that's easy to use.

Right off the bat I liked it alot. the only complaints I had were that at full volume the music wasn't quite loud enough for me( I listen LOUD) and that it's built in EQ's were not really good. Then I downloaded the latest firmware update from sandisk's website. WOW! what a huge difference that made. Now it's plenty loud enough and has more EQ options and even a custom EQ! YES!!!!  For about a hundred bucks this thing is unbelievable!

<Content>We were very disappointed with this MP3 player. After having it for only about 2 weeks, the screen stopped working properly. In addition to being disappointed with the MP3 player itself, we're STILL waiting for a full refund from Amazon.com for this MP3 player (it was returned 5 weeks ago & still no refund). So, we're also disappointed with Amazon.com in regard to their return & refund practice.

<Title>You only get one chance to make a first impression
<Date>Sun Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I was all excited when I bought the e250: good price, has a built-in microphone, does videos, is USB rechargeable, and has an FM tuner. Turns out the FM tuner only grabs a few stations, but that's not why I bought it in the first place. Good sound overall. I'm still trying to figure out how to synchronize it w/ Media Player 10, but that's neither here nor there.  However, I hit a snag when I installed and tried the firmware updater that you download from the SanDisk site: the updater kept telling me there was no internet connection. I tried it several times, even to being on the SanDisk updates page when I ran it, but it still said there was no internet connection. I emailed customer support, and their reply was that the device is only supported by XP Home and Professional Editions. I'm running XP Media Center, simply because that's what came with the computer.   I wrote back and said, gee, I didn't see anything on the advertising that said the e250 doesn't run on Media Center, and if you tell me that it doesn't, I may return it. Their reply to this was, and I quote, "Please be informed that the player may or may not work with Windows XP Media Center. However, the minimum system requirement for the player is Windows XP and we can only support the player on XP."  In other words, according to this reply, they don't know. If the fact that the player "may or may not" work with Media Center was in the advertising or specs and I missed it, it's definitely my bad. However, their response did not address whether this detail was mentioned or not.  I like the e250 and haven't decided whether to return it or not. However, if I do keep it -- given that I "may or may not" be able to update it -- I'm going to consider it a disposable. When it goes, I'm going to get an iPod.

<Title>works great but needs to be more user friendly
<Date>Sun Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned a creative, apple, and a sandisk, and find this sandisk to be a solid buy.  Overall I favor creative due to it's superior options as far as creating lists and the ability to decide what songs it's going to play next.  The Apple I dealt with was a royal pain to load songs onto, and I couldn't find any reasons to warrant the extra money it cost other than for the name.  My sandisk has been a solid and reliable player for about 9 monthes now and the only real complaint is I can't go through and select songs to play after the one that's playing.  It's either switch at the end of the song, or select the other song and have it switch right away.  The creative I owned had a play next option that sandisk needs to incorporate into it's menu.  The lack of this item is the only reason I didn't give it a five star rating.  I must also say that the microsd expansion slot is absolutely great, but I would recommend grabbing the 4 gb player if you are serious about having a variety of music.  Overall it's a great player at a great price, but it needs a few more options in the menu department.

<Content>I bought this player because my old one was on its death bed but I didn't want to spend too much money and this was perfect. The screen is very nice and bright. The sound and video play is excellent. Not only does the player look better than an ipod in my opinion it has a similar program. Even if I weren't to compare it to an ipod in general this is a fabulous mp3 player I would suggest you buy. There haven't been any glitches on my player yet and I've had it for 2 months.

<Title>Nice hardware and body but terrible user interface and programming.
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is an averagely priced mp3 player. It has good sound and hardware body. But you have to be aware that like any other things with glossy surface, the screen is scratchable.  The recording button on its side can be extremely annoying. Adequate amount of pressure on the button can trigger the recording function instantly. It can be quite vexing as you would put it in your pocket and walk around and enjoy music. Suddenly the music would stop as the recording function gets triggered. You would then have to take it out, cancel and delete the recording, go back to main menu and go to last music to resume. Or you might put it in your bag. If the player is not turned off, and if the recording button is somehow accidentally pressed by the shaking or trembling or any other mean that could 'provide' enough pressure on the button, you could find the storage of the player is completely depleted when you take it out after sometimes (or long time). All these really have happened to me.  After you save them into the storage of your player, you WILL need a computer to delete those recordings. So far I havent found a way to do it without using computer. This could be a big problem. For example, you go to your class and want to record down the lecture. But then you find that you have forgotten to delete the previous recordings and your player storage is full. So, unless you have your laptop with you, you would lose the opportunity to record the lecture.  The user interface is terrible: very confusing and ineffective. You have to go through a lot of steps. The folder system is horrible. Sometimes you would want to put your favourite songs into one folder so that you can listen to them easily. But the player will definitely group and present them to you into categories of genre, singer, album, and so on no matter what and you just have no control.   Oh yeah, the player would hang if it fails recognize the format of mp3. It would restart or jump to the next song after around 1 minute.  Sometimes songs would even go missing.  If Sandisk could release a firmware that fixes all the problem it could beat IPOD to the toilet.

<Title>IPOD, No thanks.. this is a great item!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was trying to stay away from the IPOD bandwagon so I did some research and from previous items of Sandisk I knew the name and liked what info I had found on these, so i went for this model and have been very satisfied with it.  The buttons are a little hard to push once you buy a protective cover for the unit.  Also, more annoying than anything is that the VOICE RECORD button is on the side of the unit and there is NO way to disable this useless function so while on my belt and working outside that mistakenly was always being pushed and then stopping my mp3's from playing and trying to record voice. I had to take a little piece of a paperclip and tape it to the unit so pressing this button in could not happen.   It plays videos very well, which allows me to show off vids of my daughters to everyone, annoying? Yes, Proud father? yes! haha The one thing I wish i had done was spend a few more bucks and buy the 4 gig model, you'll be amazed how fast you fill up a 2 gig model and the expansion slot for memory is nice but not as easy to use as you would think. When the Xd memory card is placed in there and plug unit into your pc you cant see the mp3's on that card through the Sansa, you will need to take the memory card out and place it into a memory card reader, not that hard but an inconvenience none the less.

Only problem my daughter found is if you are not careful you can crack the screen.  I have had mine for about 1 yr, and have always had it in a protective case around the player, but not on the screen.  I do not have any cracks in the screen.  Maybe perfect for 15+ ages,  but not pre-teens.

<Title>Horrible! Just get an iPod!
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player is terrible! It doesn't work. Spend the extra couple of dollars and just get an iPod Nano. I got this because it was Plays For Sure compatible. The website said it worked with Urge and Walmart, the two sites I used for music downloading. After I synched all my songs from Urge and Walmart, I turned it on and on every song a box popped up and said "Synchronize to continue music subscription." I looked at the FAQs on the Sandisk website and it said that as long as you play the songs from Walmart and Urge once on your computer, it would work fine. I had played every song once and it still would not work. When I went to delete the songs, there was no music folder for the player. I sent an email to Tech Support and fixed the problem for me and the songs played for me, but when I syched again to add more songs, there was once again no music folder and the songs wouldn't play. I thought that maybe I had the songs in the wrong format, but all my songs were in WMA, the proper format. The only songs that worked on the player were the songs from iTunes and the website said it didn't work with iTunes. And to get the songs to Windows Media Player from iTunes, I have to burn cds every 15-20 songs. Like I said, just get an iPod.  P.S.- I would have given it no stars but customer service was good and there was great sound quality.

<Title>Very Pleased
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very good product for the money.  I admit I have filled up the 2Gig capacity all ready, but I have around 18 hrs. of music at my disposal when ever I want.  I have a job that at times is very mentaly draining, and to be able to strap this mp3 on and get my mind back to a place where I can function without being a grumpy gus is an awesome thing.  I absolutely love the neck strap/lanyard.  Its always easy to adjust when its that close, right around your neck.  My only problem was I dont use windows Xp which is supposed to be a requirement in order to upload music.  But there are always things to get around the requirements and make it work.  I couldnt find drivers for my opperating system but was able to upload music using real player 10 or higher.  Probably could do more things or compress files if I had the right software but 18 hrs. is plenty of music for me.  Nice long battery life also.  Hope these comments help you enjoy your music more by not wasting your money on an ipod.

<Content>The e250 is gorgeous! It has a beautiful screen and is very attractive overall. The navigation could be a little more logical, and the buttons around the scroll wheel could be a little bigger. I do like that the scroll wheel has a mechanical feel; the iPod scroll wheel has no feel to me and I don't like using it. Sound quality is pretty good; it would be better with some really good earphones like the Shure e3.

<Title>Great 'cept for playlist
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great product, and the price on Amazon is WAY less than I payed at a local retailer. I only got the player too, no case. The circular scroll feels a little rough, but works fine. Nice display, intuitive interface. Sound is good if you have nice earbuds (the included ones are sub-par, of course). Video playback is smooth, doesnt get hot with continuous playback. FirmWare update is a must, and is plenty easy to do,  even for novices. It will give you more stability, as the player can freeze up if you move to fast through menus while its playing i.e. setting ratings for a song; also will give you a custom EQ. My only major gripe is the method for setting up playlists, having to play a song and then choosing to add it to the ONLY playlist available. Very good buy, IPOD KILLER!!  P.S.: Just so you know, it only plays mp3 and wma.

<Content>I was looking for a high-quality flash style MP3 player without the iPod price premium. This unit fits the bill to a "T". I am delighted. My only mistake was not buying a larger capacity unit but that is easily repaired with the addition of a MicroSD card. It is so easy to use that I didn't read the manual for a week and then realized I didn't miss anything by waiting. If something should happen to this one, I'll be buying another (probably 8 gig) right away.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this mp3 player. It is easy to use and has alot of memory even without using the SD expansion slot. I have about 200 songs on it, which has only used about half of the memory. The radio works pretty good even without the cord being used as an antenna. The battery is pretty good also - it lasts through several of my study sessions for medical school. The only thing that totally annoys me at times is the case. This is because since the case just slips over the mp3 player, it gradually slips off when walking or running if the player is loose. However, since it is really good about protecting the player from scratches & it does stay on when it is in my bag, I'll live with the case.

<Title>Great player, frustrating software
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So far, I have had this player for just three hours, and here are my first impressions:  The player itself is beautiful, a nice size and weight, with a very clear screen and a navigation wheel that lights up bright blue.  The player is very intuitive, within half an hour I had figured out how to record from the radio and set radio presets, more or less how Rhapsody channels work, where everything is in the menu system, and how to change the settings.  The buttons can be a bit confusing as their functions change depending on where you are, but that is very easy to get the hang of.  The player comes loaded with enough good music to keep you occupied for at least a little while without ever plugging it into the computer.  My big complaint is the software.  It took over two hours to get the program to recognize the player.  Now that it is all set up finally, it will hopefully be ok.  The library is sloppily organized; the only way I could see to upload music from the hard drive into rhapsody was to have an entire folder uploaded.  I had hoped that the subfolders would hold true, but all the music was put into one big category.  It does have a column on the side which sorts by artist, album, and genre, but this was really unhelpful for me because I don't have album info with most of my songs.  One great thing about the software however is that you can import your itunes music.  Also, when the player was FINALLY recognized after much reinstallation and tribulation, you have the option of uploading the pre-made playlists on the player (which have a wide range of good songs).  Overall, I would definately recommend this mp3 player to anyone, the player itself is incredible, and the software is decent, after the beginning frustrations with installation.

<Title>Everything I wanted, Almost
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great mp3 player, same space/price as Apple Nano, but also does movies, has expandable memory, and replaceable/rechargable  batteries.  Only problem, if too many buttons get touched at once, the screen freezes out for a while. Music plays back and controls work, but you cant see anything. Not really a problem if you listen to music or don't compulsively touch things.

<Title>Died today - the first time I started loading MP3s to it
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yep, my brand new device went kaput today.  This was the first time I  tried to load music to it.  It hung up a couple of times and then just finally just died.  My computer started telling me that the USB device was unrecognizable... The entire device is still locked up an hour later.  Can't turn it off. Can't do anything with it.  Nice. Thanks a log SanDisk.

<Content>I thought 2GB would be enough for me, but I do wish I had atleast a 4GB player.  I use it primarily when I travel, or do yard work.  I have noticed that it seems to take a long time to I turn it on and off.  I would have thought it should be faster than it is.  It powers up and down more like a cell phone than a PDA.

<Content>this is a good mp3, shipped very fast. I like the look of it, its very small and light-weight. So far I am happy with my choice. But it came with 20 preloaded songs and a demo video that seem to take up some memory and I havent figured out how to delete them. I used windows media player to download songs, and its was quick and easy!

<Title>Excellent sound, terrible for video
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Forget about the video functionality. It crashes often, and even when it works it's so small as to be pointless. But the sound is fantastic. Sound quality is a variable that's often forgotten when shopping for MP3 players, but quite a variable it is from experience. This player has better sound than my ipod, and much better sound than my Insignia player. Just because it's digital doesn't mean the quality can't vary. Clearly they used good components in these, and the sound is crisp and without distortion. (I'm listening on a pair of high end in-ear phones.)

<Title>Use for Audio Books
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player so I could download audio books at no cost from NetLibrary.  I bought it.  I hooked it up.  I downloaded my book. I downloaded the license. I hit the sync button and waited for the green bar to fill up.  I disconnected it and turned it on.  Ahhhhhh.  What could be easier.  Worked perfectly first time - took maybe 10 minutes total.  If you're looking for an MP3 Player to use with audio books from NetLibrary - this one will work just fine.  May not be the best (jury is still out on that) but it does work and was a piece of cake to set up and get going.

<Title>great player for the money
<Date>Wed Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my e250 for a year now, and can't say much bad about it. I use it pretty much on a daily basis. It has crashed (froze)on me a few times, requiring me to take the battery out to reset it. But this has happened very rarely, probably a corrupt mp3 file.  my only regret is not buying a 8gb model, however the micro sd slot adds up to 2gb of additional storage. this is great when you want to shuffle your tunes and not have a chapter in your ebook come up in the mix.  I easily get 16 + hours of playback (mp3). My biggest gripe would be that the software for adding video is picky, often fails to convert files. I would recomend the rockbox firmware hack ([...]). this firmware is great, loads way faster than the original firmware and give you total control over and adds more features to the player. it also adds games, like sudoku,doom,minesweeper, and many more, even adds mpeg support. overall great player, blows the nano away in features, just dont sell yourself shot on memory, one dvd loaded on the player eats up 1 gb.

<Content>I gave 3.5 stars, because it's good for the price. I'm using this device mainly for running, it fell twice and still working. The LCD is great; I believe is better than the Nano. However, I `m sure you want to read the negatives. I don't like the noise it makes every time change songs, the bulky thumbwheel and/or the smalls bottoms which I need to stop from time to time to change artist or songs while I am running.  Other than that it is a good product for the price and for my purpose. Se los recomiendo. Gracias

<Content>My 10 year old son had received an Ipod from his grandparents this last Xmas. His grandfather dropped the Ipod and toasted the drive (sad icon). His grandfather was so guilty that he wanted to replace the unit. I suggested this unit because 1)flash memory is less fragile, 2)it can expand with SD memory, and 3)loading the unit with files is drag and drop easy - easy enough for my son to perform with little direction. Since getting it, my son has had a blast. The unit is like a little jewel - really well made and very solid feeling. I am very happy with this purchase (so is my son!!)

<Content>It's not an ipod although it does look like one but it definitely is a very good product. It offers so many things that the ipod doesn't and in my opinion a better mp3 player. But it does have two drawbacks because of it not being an ipod. One is the cool-factor is not as high because mp3 players are pretty much called ipods now when they're not and people will automatically think that it can't be used with the greatest media player itunes when it can be.

<Title>Sleek Stylish MP3 that's easy to use
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the e250 almost 3 months ago, and have found it extremely easy to use. After the little setup issues trying to figure out the two settings for wma and mp3 files, the player has worked way beyond what I have expected. I had researched it pretty well, and wanted a player that could grow with me if needed, and allowed for fm listening and recording. I have used the record mode to record public speakers, capturing over 4 hours in one day. Battery life is great, although the comments about needing an external charging adapter are valid. I went out and bought a Belkin USB charger for the cable that ships with the e250, but it doesn't give the same charge as the computer. Also, I have noticed a long lag time when I rate songs, sometimes having to wait for 15 seconds before I get control back. Overall it is a great player for any user level. I hope SanDisk keeps adding accessories to the line, and hope to see prices come down for extra memory soon! I'm ready to get another one for family.

I know a lot of people have written reviews that have been less than flattering, but compared to an ipod, you spend less for more features even if the physical characteristics aren't perfect. If you just want a device that stores pictures and lots of music for low cost and little hassle and little things don't bother you, this is a great device.

<Title>2GB MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 2nd Sansa MP3 player and was a gift for my dad.  The quality, once everything is done is fantastic.  It seems easy to get around and play what you want, volume, sound quality - all great.  However, the initial set up overshadows this greatness. It wouldn't work with my Mom's laptop because it didn't have a 2.0 USB port. My 1 year old computer had difficulty recognizing that the player was plugged in. And I had to contact SanDisk to find out how to remove the songs that the player initially came with.  It all seemed quite awkward and hard to navigate.  Again - I say, once it was done, it's been terrific.  But very frustrating getting to that point.

<Title>Subscription Music Rocks!
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sure the wheel on the e200 series isn't as sexy as the iPod Nano's. But iPod owners are completely unable to play any subscription music and I suspect most don't realize they're totally missing out? Services like Rhapsody are positively addictive! For less than the price of one CD a month you can have access to a staggering amount of music. And it's music that's already properly ripped, tagged, has cover art, is easily searcheable, etc.   I'd spend $200+/month at the iTunes store if I had to buy everything I listen to every month on Rhapsody for $12.95! So, in my opinion, the BIG reason to buy a Sansa over a Nano is the option to play subscription music and not be confined to Apple's expensive and proprietary iTunes music sandbox. I have a Sonos music system at home and it's wonderful to be able to share the same Rhapsody subscription among multiple Sonos players and the Sansa portable. There are no good options for playing Apple's music from anywhere but an iPod or computer.  So... with that out of the way, what about the Sansa otherwise? Well the display is nice and easy to read and there are lots of cheap accessories available (armbands, cases, chargers, cables, etc.). Another big plus over the Nano (and all other iPods) is the battery is user replaceable and it's only like $14. Last time I checked Apple wanted almost $100 to replace an iPod battery. Batteries do wear out so keep that in mind?  The e200 only has 3 disadvantages for me:  The sound quality isn't quite that match of the best players out there. Even when playing 320Kbit well ripped music it's a bit "grainy" sounding if you use high quality revealing headphones. If you're using the supplied headphones, or any other inexpensive headphones, you'll likely never notice. You also won't notice if you're using it in for commuting or in other noisy areas. It plays reasonably loud and clear. But if you're a critical listener and have high-end headphones (especially in-ear models like Etymotic, Shure or Ultimate Ears) you might notice the sound could be better. But what do you want for the price?  The wheel/buttons/menus are logical enough but a bit cranky to use in practice. Lots of other reviews talk about that so I won't go into more detail--just expect to have to get used to the fussy wheel and stiff buttons.  Lastly, looking at the pictures you may not realize it's almost twice as thick as the current Nano. This only matters if you're going to "wear" the player and even then it's not usually a big deal. I think the thicker design is a worthwhile trade off for the bigger display and user replaceable battery.

<Title>So easy even my Mother can set it up and use it
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I LOVE this little player.  I was really look for something that WASN'T an iThing and found this.  Got it for Christmas and have listened to it everyday, almost all day, since i got it.  It goes on trips with us, plays at my desk at work, plays for hours.  I use the Griffen car tuner with it and love that as well.  And love the fact that its expandable.  I love mine so much that my son and son's girlfriend bought one, a 4G and 8G. My son works for a landscaper and uses his at work EVERY day.  We love it so much that when my Moms birthday came around (number 67) , i sent her a 2G.  She immediatly loaded 4 albums on it and she LOVES it.  Simple to use.  Now, she is pretty PC savvy, but all you have to do is choose your USB mode (from settings on your player) plug it in and start loading your music according to the USB mode you've chosen.  One mode allows you to load music from WMP 10, the other mode allows for drag and drop loading.  OH, and the sansa site has video tutorials now, so this couldn't be easier to use.    I have loaded pictures and video on mine using the software provided with the sansa, but have not done a lot of that cuz i mainly got it for music.  The video i did load was a home movie my son made of his Senior College project, so a mom has to have that on her sansa, right??  I think the wheel is easy to use, buttons are pretty easy to press, I really have NO complaints whatsoever about this device.  Some people say the screen scratches easy, but just cover the darn thing with a sticky screen protector.  Geez.  I have a case, but prefer to just carry it as it.

<Title>Not quite an iPod killer
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to agree with most of the other reviews. This is a good solid MP3 player. I also agree with the two major complaints. The buttons and wheel are pretty flimsy and hard to use. The buttons are even worse once you add a case with a lip around them. I also find it silly that you can't charge and listen at the same time. Maybe they'll have a fix in the firmware for that at some point. The Sansa has two features that almost make up for it, and are the reasons I purchased it.   1. The battery can be replaced with a $20 kit. Something about the iPod "send it back" model just doesn't work for me.  2. The expandable memory with SD cards was the other big selling point. This basically makes the capacity unlimited.

<Title>Do not purchase this item! - it freezes!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was so excited when my brand new Sansa 2Gb was delivered a couple of days after I bought it, and I even got free shipping!. The reasons why I decided to get it (instead of the Nano, which was my other alternative) were that it was cheaper, nice looking, 2 Gb is enough for me and all these good reviews in Amazon (yes, it's true, there were some bad reviews as well that I should have listened to), so I decided to take a chance on it, and I was so happy about my decision.  Well, I have to say that I am totally disappointed by this item and I will be returning it.  I've had it for about two weeks and it freezes at least twice everyday if I am lucky (I consider myself electronic savvy, so I would not assume I am doing something wrong), it freezes all of a sudden, when a song is playing, for instance. It freezes when I want to change a song, it freezes when I switch it on and when I switch it off or when I go to the main menu. It freezes even with the sample songs that were already in when I bought it! And, besides, the users guide is not really user friendly.  This item has a bunch of excellent reviews in Amazon so maybe my product was damaged or I am the only one with the freezing problem, I don't know. But in any case, I want a mp3 that works, this is why I am returning it and getting the Nano...

<Title>Very nice MP3 player
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought two of these, one for my son (birthday present) and one for myself - ummm, so I could provide good technical support and since my old Archos died.  Both of us are enjoying our players.  First the good stuff - it's small, light, and has a good battery life.  The screen and scroll wheel are wicked bright (might just help you find your dropped keys at night!), and the screen is very sharp.  It has an expansion slot.  The sound quality is good; make sure you update the firmware, as mine would crash a bit before that, and a custom EQ option is also included in later firmware updates.  I don't much use the other features: the video player, voice recorder, FM radio, picture viewer.  But they're there.  Feels tough, haven't broken it yet.  Titanium back.  Slightly thicker than a Nano, and a bit heavier.  Supports MP3 & WMA, plus of course has portable disk capability.  The not so great - mostly nitpicks: it's expandable, but only with MicroSD/Transflash.  Those cards are only available up to 2GB right now, and they're expensive at that.  Also, the expansion card can only hold music (I guess that's so they can guarantee sufficient bandwidth); movies and pics are limited to the internal flash capacity.  FM radio reception is only OK, also recording FM only seems to be mono.  The record button on the side I find easy to hit and interrupt my music, wish I could just disable it.  Videos must be processed through SanDisk's media converter, and it just doesn't seem to work so well, particularly with longer movies.  Uses a proprietary USB cable, cannot play music while charging.  Overall this is a very good MP3 player.  Definitely think about one with more memory like an e260, e270, or the 8GB e280.  2GB is really fine for us right now.

<Title>SanDisk's new "e" line on target
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The newest Sansa "e" line from SanDisk is a much improved product than their last attempt.  The construction is superior.  The viewing screen is quite good.  The round scrolling dial is easy to use.  Expanding memory with a mini SD card is convenient.  Load some personal photos and you can conduct a slide show with your favorite songs.  You will not find as many accessories as the iPod, but those will come.  This device is a great alternative to the iPod at a greatly reduced cost.  I was told that I could get 500 songs on the e250 (2GB) device.  In actuality, I got about 375 songs with a little room to spare.  However, if you delete the digital photos/images that come with downloaded songs via Rhapsody, etc., you get much closer to a 500 song capacity.  A good buy.

<Title>Better than an iPod...
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Sansa e250 after trying many other mp3 players.  Without a doubt, this one is the best I have ever used.  It's easy to use, easy to transfer music back and forth and the sound quality is great.  I wish I had spent more money and bought one with more capacity.  At any price, this is a great mp3 player.  At the price I paid for it, it's that much more of a deal!  Highly recommended.

<Title>Sansa e250 2Gig
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I looked for some time before buying my first MP3 player.  This was my choice due to capacity, use, and price.  First sight out of the box, I was pleased as punch.  After software installs, connectivity issues, etc, I was less pleased.  But that was fixed quickly, and was more my fault than devices.  Screen is bright, controls are less than completely intuitive, but easy to navigate once you get the groove for them.  A couple of gripes here now.  It has frozen on me twice now.  The first time, I looked for a master reset or anything to reset the device.  There was no mention of anything like this in the manual.  I called the service line, and was immediately helped and fixed the issue.  Second time, I did the same thing, and it worked fine.    When connected to the computer, it view the device, and the MicroSD card as separate drives.  When navigating though, it is seamless.    All in all, a wonderful buy (though they get cheaper and higher capacity all the time) and I am wonderfully pleased with this Sansa product.    Another plus is the ability to watch video, listen to mp3, and not have to convert these files into some specialty, proprietary format (like IPOD).

<Title>Solid Product, Some Tech. Flaws
<Date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall, this is a solid product. Sleek, light weight, and excellent sound quality, this product is great for people with few to no specifications. For those that require more, it may not be a bad idea to look for a more sophisticated product. For example, the randomization feature is questionable. Also, when you delete one song from a batch, you may receive a "Missing File" message on the LCD screen. Otherwise, the product is good and serves as a competitive alternative to an IPOD.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this unit for eight months - it has lasted longer than any other player I have purchased, and I am very pleased. I wear this player five days a week, eight to twelve hours a day, to keep me from going insane in an extremely boring job, it has saved my sanity!  I listen to a mix of podcasts, radio and eBooks and have rarely had any any problems - I think I have had to do a major reset only once. I use MP3tag (free) if I need to organize, enumerate or otherwise change how the player perceives groups of files.  I do recommend a hard shell case that covers the screen - I had another Sansa model that became unusable after slight compression on the screen - the unit electronics were fine, you just couldn't read the screen.  I have successfully transfered video to the unit and it runs well - but an hour video takes up most of the memory and the screen is really too small to be viewable, still pics are clear but still too small - the color screen is best used to view CD covers.  The sound quality is good enough for most, but the supplied ear buds should be replaced. As to the controls, the buttons do seem difficult to access at first...but I now have no problem using them through an untucked shirt, with a hard shell case and very large fingers.  So far, my unit has hit the floor twice (about 3 feet), both times it's been in it's hard shell case - no effect on the unit - minor damage to the case.  I do not like the idea of a proprietary battery, I prefer generic rechargeables, but this battery is still going strong and is user replaceable (I recharge every other day). The charge lasts 20-24 hours in my case. If it lasts a year and costs $15, I think I am for it!  Good sound, tough, battery life..... Pretty good unit.

<Title>I think we have our I-Pod Nano killer here...
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great player with more features and at a better price than the overrated ipod!  I got my 250e on sale for $99 vs $179 for the Nano I-pod.  Pros: Sturdy player Very easy to use, no instruction manual required Microsoft Vista compatiable Awesome sound from unit  Cons:  Glossy finish on player produces lot of finger prints No protective case other than cheap pouch Would have liked a wall charger FM radio only, AM would have been cool  Overall a great deal for what I paid. I had purchsed a Sony Walkman NW-003f 1 gig which was nice but the included SonicStage software doesn't work with Vista (Many say it doesn't work well with XP either). I paid a bit more for this player but it was well worth it.

<Title>FM radio barely works
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not sure if this was a defect or if they're all like this, but the FM radio on mine hardly worked at all, it could barely pick up even strong stations.  Since this was one of the main reasons I bought it I returned it.    Not a bad player overall but: - menus are a bit hard to navigate - not much tactile feedback on center button, hard to use - bulky compared to nano, more so than I thought - it seemed solid enough, especially the scratch resistant back, but not as nicely made and not nearly as slick as ipods  Center wheel works fine, blue illumination looks cool, screen is OK for menus, marginal for photos and videos.  Sound quality seems about the same as ipods which is fair but not great.    Since radio doesn't work anyhow, I'd pay the $30 more and get a nano.

Sound quality is awesome; earphones are comfortable; picture quality is very good though small; FM Stereo picks up many station in the local area even inside the building I work in where signals are usually hard to pick up.

<Title>Locked up
<Date>Fri Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Never did get to use it. Loaded the firmware updater on my computer and restarted. Info showed new firmware. Updated itself and said to disconnect and reboot the mp3 player, so I did. Never came back. ERROR MESSAGE: Failed to load main screen, switch to system recovery.  Nothing happens it is locked up. No info in user guide and nothing on the website. Worst part is I bought it for a trip to drowned out my wifes family. Guess I will be listening to boring chatter instead of music this trip.   At least admit your products have problems and offer people solutions, Don't just give an email address and RMA #'s that someone might respond to in a week. Offer these solutions where people can read them and fix something or return it right away. I hate that issues have to be dragged out.  This screen I got is obviously there for a reason, Do I need to switch to recovery mode? Will it do it automatically if you let it run for several hours? It is in the basic program you should cover it.  To discredit the product would be unfair because I never used it, but the manufactuer needs to admit problems and address them in a place people have access to.

<Title>Good Starter Unit
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you want a smaller unit that is not as costly this is your baby. If you are buying for your kids this one is nice as well. It does leave somethings to desire.   Like any other electronic it will mess up. I had a scary episode where it locked up before my plane took off. Talk about angry Air Attendants. Whew. However it is pretty shock resistant which is nice. Go ahead and buy the silicon skin so that it has extra protection.   For a high end user who is doing video or large amounts of audio books this is not your baby. You might like the higher space offerings by this brand but you will want one of the top of the line units in the end.   This unit while very Rhapsody friendly is not very Audibles friendly. It is a huge downfall for me. I had an older one from the C series that works with Audibles but this model does not. It makes me sad. I do not want to keep two MP3 players so that I can have one for Audibles and one for music.   Also to note accessories for this unit are hard to find. I was told well the I pod takes up over 70% of the market so those are the add ons we sell. I had to get my FM tuner from amazon and I searched 5 stores in an emergency for a cable with the add on pieces to charge in the car and at home. Also accessories for this item are just as pricey as they are for the more expensive units which make them less cost effective.   In the end I will end up buying another unit from one of the major two brands and giving this one to my daughter for music.

<Title>First impressions are favorable
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the 2 GB player as a birthday gift for my fiancee.  The player is a little larger than a stick of gum, but has a suprising amount of weight.  It didn't seem heavy, just solid, considering its small size.  The player is a little confusing to use at first because it is so feature rich.  Once I overcame my confusion, it was a cinch to drop and drag music (wma format), videos, and photos into the player. I use Windows media player 10 to transfer entire playlists of music into the player.  The quality of music is pretty good.  I wish it had a EQ that I could customize rather than presets for rock, normal, hip hop, classical, pop, etc....Don't pay attention to the previous reviewers who complain that the player is not as loud as an Ipod. They will probably lose their hearing before they are 25.  The volume range is fine.  I loaded the firmware fixes available at the sandisk web page, so I have not experienced any glitches or freezing that others have complained about.  The FM radio works OK.  Sandisk should have the FM station presets more easily available, rather than having to click twice through menus to find them.  I transferred some home videos and an entire feature-length movie into the player.  It took about half an hour for the conversion software that came with the player to convert the 225 mb movie from WMV format to Quicktime, then it automatically installed the movie on the player in three volumes.  The 1.8" display is about the size of a large postage stamp and adequately bright and super clear.  The scroll wheel (easy to use) is used to increase volume and scroll through menus. The tiny on/off button also serves as a menu and reset button. The player control buttons (pause/play/forward/reverse/sub menu) that surround the scroll wheel are also tiny and akward to use quickly if you have giant meathook hands like myself.  The protective sleeve that comes with the player is really cheesy, I hope that sandisk provides a better cover in the future.  Overall, I really like this player, and I can't wait for my current player to break so that I can have a reason to buy the 8 gb version.

<Title>MP3 Player review
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok well I just got this MP3 player yesterday and over all its pretty good. This is my first MP3 player so i really don't have anything to compair it against.It comes halfway charged but in the manual it said to charge it full way. So I did. You can't listen to music while it is charging which I didn't know but it didn't really bother me. The radio is pretty good but i live in the woods so in some spots it has static but i just moved it around a little and it came back clear. The speakers that come with the model are pretty good sound wise but the foam coverings keep falling off. It comes with an extra 2 foam coverings so if you lose one don't fret.  Over all Pros: good price has expansion slot FM radio can put pictures videos on it Sound is great Screen is a good size Picture is clear  Cons: Buttons are a little hard to push can't put pictures or videos on the card (I heard this am not sure if its true yet) Scroll wheel does not have a smooth scroll to it. I think thats it.. if i find more I'll give it to you later.

<Title>highly impressed
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I went to visit my friend in LA, he told me that he bought one of these. I played around with it, and found it to be a lot better than the iPod. The reason being it has more options, and isn't as pricey as the 2gb version of the Apple counterpart.  I decided to buy one myself, and I am extremely impressed. It was a very user friendly interface. It's kind of similar to the iPod, in the sense you have to rotate the round thing with your finger. Unlike the iPod tho, this one actually spins when you rotate it.  This player allows users to listen to music (of course), watch videos, view pictures, listen to the radio, as well as voice record.  The music can be in either mp3 or WMA format. Videos and pictures need to be converted into a special format for the player to recognize. Luckily, the player comes with software which you can use to convert the files into recognizable formats.  Video quality is quite amazing. I was expecting videos to have those blurry squares that you see when video quality is relatively low. However, it's not like that. The video quality will be pretty much the same as how it is when you watch it on your computer.  There are a couple things which I find wrong with this player:  -let's say you decide to transfer a full movie or something big on this player, it basically won't open. I tried opening a 700MB file on this player, and it ended up freezing. So as a recommendation: if you decide to transfer a large file, convert it to several smaller files, and you should be fine. -the only way to charge the battery is when you hook your player to your computer through USB. Once the player is connected, it will automatically start recharging your battery. As I know from cell phones, charging the battery too often will decrease the life of it, so unfortunately the only way of avoiding it is by listening to the music you have on there until the battery is close to dead, or is completely dead  Those cons won't decrease a star for me.  Overall, this product is definitely worth the money. It has more features than the iPod Nano, and definitely isn't as expensive. I, honestly, have never been a big fan of the iPod, and it seems as if their price is constantly the same, no matter how many newer products they release.  If you are looking for a player which will allow you to, not only listen to music, but watch videos and view pictures, this player is definitely what you're looking for.

<Title>They should stick to just memory
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The software on this MP3 player is as buggy as they come.  I've never been able to get the Sansa Media Converter to recognize my Sansa e250. Consequently, I've never been able to add pictures or videos to my player.  This is despite 7 sets of correspondences with their help desk.  Their most helpful suggestion was for me to try to sync to a different Windows XP machine.  Yeah, I'm going to buy a new PC because they can't figure out how to test their software before releasing it to the public.  It's consistently had problems syncing to a playlist.  Most of the music that i've tried to sinc has gotten to my player, but not necessarily in the playlist that I set up.  Instead, in order to hear the songs on the device, I'd have to navigate to each indivual artist's folder and play those (1 - 4, on average) songs, and then go to some other folder when I was quickly sick of hearing the first small batch of songs.  Now my player won't even boot up.  I've only had the thing for 2 months and I can't even get it to go past the splash screen.  What a total piece of garbage.    I hate to say it, but I think I'm going to have to bite the bullet and go back to apple and buy another iPod.  What was I thinking?  Buying a music player from a memory manufacturer!  Just stupid!

When it's on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list.   But overall i'm happy with my MP3.

<Content>As the title suggest this is my first mp3 player and i think I made a pretty good choice. The pros far out number the cons, which are few. I was never really interested in owning an ipod...not into the itunes method, aside from that i was looking for something with alot of features in a resonable price range...my search keep leading me back to this treasure and i was hooked. I cant say anything bad about this product except for the fact that after owning it only a few weeks im starting to see a few dust particles collect under the screen and im not overly exposed to lots of dirt/dust, no i dont spend my free time runnning around in dust storms if thats what your thinking...so get a protective case, the voice recorder is very sensitive so loud sounds are badly distorted...so if you plan to record you fav. rock group live...just don't the out come would be horrible, I'd feel bad for you, and lastly, the video player has very basic controls...but im not complaining Im just happy it plays videos. Other than that Im totally impressed and I would reccomend this product to anyone. buy it. ipods are played out. if my last name was pod i would be chaning it to sansa. But seriously if you can get more than 2 gigs.

<Title>It could be awsome
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I really like the storage and when I could hear properly on it the audio clarity was great.  Well, I have had the player for a few weeks now, loaded about 300 songs on it and it had been working great.  It froze up a few days ago, just quit working mid song.  A few hours later it powered up (the blue wheel was lit) but the screen didn't work, and no functions worked.  I took it home and hooded it up to my computer, and it plays music now.  Only now it will only deliver constant sound to one earphone and the other fades in and out.  I am returning this one for a new one.  I have always been pleased with sansa in the past, so I am hoping I just got a rare bad one, and the replacement will work like this one did the first 2 weeks I had it.

<Content>For my first time use of any MP3 Player, it was a bit of a challange to learn downloading of music.  I was amazed on the sound quality from such small ear pieces. The Bands were playing in the center of my head. And Volume control was easy to manage.  Selection of which song was as easy as looking through a table of contents. Or running with the random play was a supprise on the mix of music that came together.  As a person that listens to my music as I garden, riding my motorcycle, or out at night looking at the stars. I have yet run the battery down on my first charge.  Over all I'm very happy with the SanDisk Sansa e250 Player.

<Title>an excellent player
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa is an outstanding player, integrating seamlessly with current Media Player versions, it's own software package or just about any other music software.  Synchronization is a breeze, navigation is intuitive, screen readability, even in bright sunshine, is excellent and the sound quality is as good as MP3 can be.  I recommend the 4G model, but my 2G is only half full and has several hundred songs on it.  Consider getting the silicon case for two reasons; one, it prevents slipping around in a pocket or in the car(use an FM transmitter/charger-suggestions come with the Sansa)and of it protects from impact shocks if the unit, which is already tough, gets dropped.  I prefer it to i-pod, and the music services available are not priced like i-tunes; on the contrary, you can legally download unlimited music for an entire year for about $[...] with the right service-I prefer 'My Music Inc' easily found on the Web.

<Title>easy to learn and affordable
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa was easy to figure out..and I like easy. The 2GB is just perfect for use in the gym or just about anywhere. I think I loaded 360 songs the first time I tried. Size is great and the arm band is a must for working out. Excellent sound quality. Price is more than reasonable and I did find them on sale for less than I originally paid. I had originally purchased an iPOD and for the added exprnse it was too difficult to learn, and I didn't have the freedom of using my own CD's. With the Sansa I choose the music and weather or not I wish to pay for it. No special sites deal with unless I want too. Sansa is very good...I would recommend it for every one from 10 year old Jimmy to Grandma..

<Title>Great!
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're trying to decide between and this and an iPod, iAudio, or whatever stop agonizing and get a sansa. It's sleek, has a built in microphone, audio and video playback, fm tuner (quality of recording off the radio isn't stellar, but still cool). Rhapsody support is available for those who are in dire need of an iTunes-esqe setup. At the end of the day, great mp3 player that doesn't screw you on the price.

<Title>First MP3 Player and satisfied
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this MP3 for my birthday and am impressed. There are some flaws in it though. First, the Rhapsody is an ordeal. I had a username and forgot it with my password. I could email them to get my new username and password but I didn't get it. I tried this multiple times. Also transporting pictures is also hard. It says when I have the Sansa connected, I have the pictures. One other minus is that the earphones sometimes become uncomfortable and fall off. Good things about it is that the FM Radio is good but sometimes has bad reception. Ripping and then synching CD's is easy. But I cannot sych the songs I have on my Playlists from Windows Media Player 11 unless they are from a CD. I have not yet put on any videos on it as I am not sure how to do it. I would recommend this because of the price and the capabilities of it. Just remember to write your username and password somewher safe:).

<Title>Horrible, dont even think about getting this product in particular and try avoid any other sandisk product!
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this as a gift and the truth is I'm terribly disappointed. When i opened the box and saw it, i thought it's going to be at least a formiadable foe for the Ipod Nano. However, as i fo one using it, i found a bunch of things that make me run away from Sandisk product forever. First of all, this comes with a crappy software, cheap navigation buttons, and distastful design.  When i first installed the sofware to my computer, my whole computer got frozen. It wasn't my computer problem for sure because it's a new one and it's the model second to the XPS line of Dell. After several times trying to install it with all kind of technical support, i finally suceeded. Then came the transfering of music and thankfully it worked. I was quite happy back then since at least i got it working. However, my excitement was short-lived.   The second time i tried to put some more songs into it, I saw duplicates of the previous songs in my mp3, not one but three. I thought that would be a waste of memory, so i deleted the duplicates. It wouldn't let me delete anything, i kept receiving the error message. After a few minutes trying to refresh the device but see no changes, I unplugged the device and check the songs, my list of songs was emptied. Again, I went through the time-killing task just to get my songs back in the mp3. These problems kept happening and the custumer support as well as the homepage sever doesn't help to solve a thing. My family currently owns several Ipods and none of them has encountered such problems like this one. Ipod is pricey but "you get what you pay for".

<Title>Adequate for MP3 Audio ... Worthless With Photos
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Please understand, I've had good results with other Sandisk Products. However, this MP3 player is terrible. Admittedly, it will load and play simple MP3 audio files very well. But, to load or view any photo/video file requires the (enclosed) 'Sansa Media Converter' software.  This software is worthless.  Even after numerous sessions with Sandisk's technical support I am unable to load or view even a small photo (JPG or BMP).  I only paid $109.00 for this product.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Sandisk is marketing an inferior product with this MP3 player.

<Title>Good value for money!
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was thinking of buying Ipod Nano but I was looking for a multi-function MP3 player which would have something more to offer, so, I bought Sansa e250 2 GB and I'm glad I did so :)!  Pros: Great sound quality (try using a sony earplugs instead of the earphone provided with the player) User Interface is good, so navigation is easy. I didn't even need to go thru the manual, learnt mostly thru trial n error Drag n drop songs with Windows Media Player 10+ Capability of grouping songs by Artists, Albums, Genres and a playlist Scanning thru individual songs available Preloaded Equalizer settings are effective Remembers the last played song even when the player is switched off or you move out to some other section of the player Good Recording for FM Radio Surprisingly good voice recording Clarity in Videos, photos Dial for navigation and volume control Looks good Wide screen Metallic Back-case USB Interface Rechargeable Note: I have taken it to the gym (used it on the treadmill) and it has still never malfunctioned!  Cons: Buttons are too small so they're hard to press Rechargeable thru USB ONLY Noise while shifting from one song to another ONLY ONE playlist Media Converter takes a lot of time to convert video files (>50 MB) into QuickTime format Supplied earphones not upto the mark FM receiver can be improved  Overall performance of the player is good and is really a worthy competitor of Nano (when functions offered and price are compared)!

<Title>Do research first! This one isn't worth it.
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>the important information: wmp 11 worked best with this. plays for sure is only on the rhapsody model. update the firmware before you do anything else. converting videos (amazon unbox) never worked - big nightmare! managed to convert one video using 3rd party software - worked! the unit was very buggy and firmware update didn't fix that. controls were loose, the unit had a mind of its own and off and on it was not recognized by my computer.  if you want something mainly for music and your own videos (and you didn't mind gambling), this might be a good player. from the reviews i see that the buggy ones are a smaller percentage. i would not buy another one of these - i am a tinker, and i couldn't make it work. far easier to program a vcr. the two stars were because it really is a thing of beauty.  i am very sad to return it - it was just the right size, the screen is a thing of beauty, and it didn't come with a bazillion dongles. however, after struggling with it for the past day and a half, it just isn't worth it.  btw - customer service on their site was great - detailed answer to my question with options to troubleshoot - within a couple of hours!

<Title>Sansa e250 and Samsung T9 compared
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player and Samsung T9 2Gb at the same time. This was for my wife and T9 for me. After using both I think T9 is much better product for about $[...] more.  T9 is better because  1. T9 has 30hrs battery life 2. Brighter display 3. Buttons are easy to touch (one who used this will know what I'm talking about) 4. Menu navigation I found more intuitive 5. Thinner 6. Lighter  Good part about sansa that it has a micro SD expansion slot, which is missing in T9, even though I'm not sure how often people use it.

<Title>Good MP3 Player, works well with Linux
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Music works well with Linux - Grip or similar to rip .wav files off your CDs and convert them to .mp3; and just use regular file copies (bash or Nautilus) to move or remove files on MP3 player.  Voice recording is also good.  Creates .wav files with date in name, easy to transfer off MP3 player to Linux.  FM player is fine.  No documented method to put pictures or video on to player except included Windows "Media Converter" application. The JPEG pictures apparently need some specific format - a regular JPEG file does not work. I do not intend to use this for pictures or video, but I would add one more star if these were documented for use in Linux.  The CD also includes a Windows only application for access to the Rhapsody online music store. According to the Rhapsody web site, Mac and Linux users can use the Rhapsody service via browser.

<Title>Good Product, Poor Support
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player works great, BUT! I purchased two of these units for my daughters. They work great and hold more music than an average person could listen to in a month. The problem is that Sansa offers no accessories for them. You can't get a car or wall adapter to charge the unit. There are NO cases available that will fit properly. The plugs on Sansa products are NOT the same as Sony's, so don't waste your money trying. If you are not constantly near a computer with a USB port, you cannot recharge the battery. Because my daughters carry them in their purse and no cases are available, they get all scratched up. Until Sansa gets their act together, I would not buy any of their products. I even called them, whereas I was told accessories would be out by Christmas (2006). Here it is April of '07 and still no accessories. Most stores are now refusing to even carry this product. Bad, Very Bad company support.

<Content>I love my little Sansa.  I have used it everywhere - this baby has been bounced around and still works great.  It is a tremendous value for its features (read the other reviews for those!)  I don't like proprietary anything that costs more, so this Sansa was the right choice for me.  The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 because you have to use the proprietary software to convert photos, otherwise, it is so easy to use.  You can just drag and drop music files into it, like a flash drive.  The neatest thing is that my 6 year old is hooked on this baby like a toy.  She figured it out all on her own - now that shows ease of use doncha think?

I was sure that an iPod would be perfect for him, but those are way too expensive. So I got this instead. And he loves it. It has a smaller screen than the Nano, but it plays videos. It has a fairly small memory, but with the expansion slot, you can add more. The device is lightweight, but not fragile. The sound quality is great, and now he has a new, fun, inexpensive gadget to play with!

<Title>this mp3 will ruin your life
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sure, this player looks nice and has wonderful sound quality -- if you can figure out how to get music onto it. Once you have, your real troubles begin. Why, for example, does it suddenly decide to no longer accept podcasts? How do you get it to begin downloading them again? Who knows. This is probably an excellent product if you have an advanced degree in computer engineering. For the rest of us it's an infuriatingly complicated, user-hostile waste of money and time. Oh, if I could only get back the hours and hours and hours I've spent trying to operate this thing since I bought it last summer. This is the first product review I've ever posted. I do it to warn the others: WALK AWAY. DO NOT BUY THE SANSA E250. IT WILL DESTROY YOU. SAVE YOURSELF. Personally, I'm beginning to think the sound of silence is the way to go.

<Content>I just received this MP3 player today and I must admit that I love it.  The screen is bigger than the iPod Nano's and it is very bright.  It was very easy to upload songs using Windows Media Player's sync function.  My only complaint is that the buttons around the scroll wheel should be a lot easier to press.  They could have made the buttons wider or lowered the height of the scroll wheel.  Also, the ear buds could be better.  I will probably look for some replacements soon.  Overall, I love it.  And for the price, it's hard to beat.

<Title>Has potential, but is buggy
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a couple of Sansa e250s for Christmas for my kids and have found the units have some great capabilities but they are buggy to some extent.  My original intent was to have the kids save videos onto their units and not just songs, and the results on that side have been quite good.  Also, the flexibility of having a micro SD slot to store more music was particularly attractive.  The other upside was the price: At about $100, this unit provides tremendous value.  The feel of the unit is quite good.  It is thicker than an iPod but it is not much larger.  The wheel takes some getting use to, but it works wonderfully.  The metal backing makes it feel a little more sturdy, and the little extra weight makes it seem less fragile than the iPod.  The unit plays videos quite well.  The converting software must be used which is fairly slow and hogs resources on the computer.  Also, the only supported format is .MOV which is not the most efficient in terms of size.  However, for the price, this unit does deliver video, and while the screen is small, it offers fair quality.  One of the unit works quite well but the other gave me some problems.  It often locked up and it was necessary to reboot it literally by removing the battery from the unit.  I updated the firmware and it didn't help much.  I believe the cause may be pressing a button while the wheel is turning, or some other unexpected button combinations.  However, my belief is that this should not halt player operation.  In one case, one unit fell and there were corrupt files in the system!  Luckily, I went to an online forum where they mention that setting the unit to a disk-like mode allows one to use chkdsk drive /f so the corrupt files can be deleted.  This is extremely important because if you don't do this some memory will be permanently unusable!  On the whole the Sansa e200 series are an excellent value, but they are not perfect.  My own experiences have been somewhat mixed, but if I had to buy them again, I would.  They offer quite a lot of bang for the buck although they may put some users through a few moments of frustration.

<Content>I bought the Sansa e250, a San-360 FM Transmitter from Maximo, the gray SanDisk skin and a couple of 1GB MircoSD cards for my wife and she loves it.  She likes being able to swap out and add new songs with the microSD cards and play and charge it while in her car with the FM transmitter.  She doesn't mind using Media Player to sync, but she seems to use the SD cards more so she can leave the Sansa in the car.  She like the interface and the controls and even with the skin on has had no trouble using the navigation buttons.  I have an iPod and after playing with my wife's Sansa the next player I get will be one of these.

<Title>Fantastic Mp3 Player!
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The e250 Sansa Mp3 player does take a little getting used to, but I was able to work it right out of the box.  The controls take are small for someone who has large fingers.  I'd recommend this for the first time Mp3 user.

<Title>Nice for the price
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice small mp3 player, controls not nearly as slick as the ipod but you get by, nice size, nice price, nice look to it. Very clunky interface to upload podcasts, must be done (unless I am missing something) by by manually placing files in the drive on "My Computer".  Other than that, it's great.

<Title>Very good value for $100 - unfortuneately Hastings overcharged me.
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I need time to kill so I bought this and it was prettier then the ugly samsung 2gb and can play more types of files. Hastings overcharged me about $48 but it turned out to be a kind of insurance because it chipped right away from a fall onto my rug. I guess it hit something hard on the way. They  let me return it soon after I bought it and I got another one from them. A supersized walmart and nearby little one didn't have the 2gb but only 4gb so I guess it's pretty popular.  Pros:  1. Compact 2. Plays plenty of files types 3. Nice viewer 4. Pretty 5. FM Radio 6. Voice Recorder  Cons:  1. Like other reviewers said the ring is cheap, but I think they meant it feels cheap, which it does, it's painful to use, having a scratchy feeling on the fingers.  2. The blue light may look cool in the pics you see but the novelty quickly wore off on me - it's painfully bright and the color is nauseating. At least it turns off quickly after using it.  3. The log on screen is sick, it has a weird optical illusion effect on the top and bottom and to make it worse it's white colored so it's blinding to look at (I hope they change that with a firmware update.)  4. The headphones are of no use, they are painful and wouldn't stay in my ears at all, they just fell out.  Overall it's a decent value but they should add rubber to that ring so it doesn't feel so harsh and that would help obscure the led's inside which are too bright.  Update:  I saw a better mp3 / video player at walmart, which is exactly what I feared would happen if I bought this thing. The iview I think it's called is better looking and has a bigger screen and is only $80. Also my screen got badly scratched and giving it a waxing didn't do anything, and the black front got scratch too. Depressing.

<Title>Sorry iPod but Sandisk Wups Ur Butt

<Content>Love it.  I'm a audio/video producer and love this widget.  Great for taking quick notes, interviews, etc.  Also love the FM radio recording feature for when you stumble on something good.  The software is a bit lacking but anyone with a handle on Windows can figure out workarounds in a couple minutes.  Display is small but clear.  I use this tool every day.

<Title>good but making play lists and downloading songs an epic journey...
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I brought this mp3 player on sale from radio shack for $99. I'm not going to go into details into all the benefits because everyone has already list them all. Here are the pro's of this player, 1.downloads various file formats (mp3,WMA,ect) 2. FM radio.and you can save FM songs on to the player. 3. microSD expansion slot for extra memory Here are the con's of this player 1. Steap learning curve-Navigating the menu wasn't too difficult, the problem was figuring out how to download the songs onto the player and making playlists. Too bad the full instruction manuel was on the DVD. 2. Operating the SanDisk program can cause your computer to freeze sometimes. 3.The player can get stratches on the surface VERY easily. I suggest you buy the silicon skin cover and those clear anti-stratch sheets for the screen at the same time you buy this player. 4. The battery is not easy to remove. You'll also need to buy a precision screwdriver set so that you can remove the cover to get to the battery. 5.You can only charge the battery via the computer unless you get an AC adapter. Also you should buy a spare battery. 6. The FM player dies in large buildings,buildings with thick walls,and in buildings with no windows. 7. The sound quality of the earphones that comes with this player are good but they are a little cheap and will fall out of the ears of some people. Buy a pair of earphones you find well fitting and comfortble.  Tips on using this player. playlists-This player does synch with the windows media program, but be warned, the way you have your playlists on the computer may not end up the same way on this player. When I loaded my perfectly organized songs on the player, it totally butchered the order of my songs. Sometimes when I clicked on one song another totally different song would play. For example when I clicked on justin timberlake's "sexy back", the song "independent woman" by destiny's child would play instead. So after 3 hours of pulling my hair out I finally figured out how to organize my songs, manaually. This took me another 3 hours. Here's how:    1.Go to the file where you have your songs on your computer. It's usually "My Music". 2. Go to My Computer and open the player. It'll be "Sansae250". Then go to the "MUSIC" file. 3. Now go back to "My Music" on your computer. Create folders in "my music" and name them to group your music.For example name a file "Rock" to put all your Rock music in. 4. Put all of your music in their respected folders. Now you'll have to label the songs in each of the folders. 5. Click on a music folder to open it. Put the arrow cursor on a song and right click it. Go down to "properties. A menu should pop up in which you can label the song's artist, album title, year,track number, Genre, lyrics, title, and comments. The important parts to fill in are the Artist, Album title,Genre,and Title. Fill these out wrong and you will end up with your songs all over the place when you load them on the player. 6. Now fill in the menu. First put the name of the artist. I suggest you label the songs sung by the same person with the same name (and type it the same way too. for example all songs sung by justin timberlake will be typed in artist as "justin t.", and not have some of them typed "j.timberlake" and "j.t.". The player doesn't reckonize different spellings of the same name and will organize all the songs in different sections even if they are by the same person if you spell the name of the artist in multiple ways.  7. Next fill in the album title. If you have songs from the same album make sure that the name of the album in each of the songs is spelled EXACTLY same.Also make sure the album title is the same as the name of the folder you put the song(s) in. 8. Next fill in the Genre. You have two options when filling this out. You can fill the Genre in with the same info that you fill in the album title, or you can fill in the music type (e.g. rock). Once again make sure everything is spelled the same way. 9. Next fill in the title. Put the name of the song here. 10. Now repeat the steps above for all of your songs. After you finished, put the folders with the songs in the MUSIC file of the player. 11. Now hopefully when you turn on the player the songs should be grouped in their approiate sections of Artists, Albums, Songs, and Genres. Now click on the songs to make sure that they'll play. Advice- 1.All the songs are labeled in alphabetical order on the player, so it's pointless to fill in the track number. 2. Sometimes the songs don't load correctly so when you play a song the whole song won't play. For example the player will play only the first 30 seconds of a 4 mintue song before going to the next. When this happens delete the song, on the player and reload the song onto the player again. 3. If all esle fails and if you want to totally delete all the songs and the play lists, delete the all the songs in the music file and delete the "tmp" file in the msc and mtp mode.  So besides all of the programing glitches and the learning curve, this player is good and I feel is much more better than the i-pod. I just hope the future models of their MP3 players are much better. If any one needs help email me at tigonesskay@yahoo.com

<Title>Very happy with my new MP-3 player
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As there are many music players on the market, it is hard to say if I made the best choice. I do know I am very happy with this little player. Bought 2 at same time. (One for me and one for the wife.) Figured I would shorten the learning curve by buying her the same device.  It works great, it sounds great and is easy to operate.  Am amazed by how long the charge lasts. (Have not measured the time, but weeks)  Instruction were easy.  Software works great and is fairly intuitive.  Great value for sure!   Only dissapointment was the radio. Does not come in as well as my other portable.  True, for its size it works great. The FM was just a bonus, really.  In all I love this thing and have no regrets.

<Title>Many problems during past year of ownership
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was surprised to see this player rated so highly.  It makes me think that the problems I have experienced may have been because my player was defective.  That would lead me to believe that some portion of these players will have the same problems that mine had.  Therefore, you consumers run some risk of getting a player with these problems....I'll try to be specific: --Requires a soft reset approximately one out of five starts --Has required 3 hard resets in the life of the product --Very poor customer service.  They never told me how to do a hard reset or even responded to inquiries.  Luckily, Rhapsody had excellent CS and told me. --Very poor FM reception. --MicroSD card not compatible with rhapsody to go songs. --The right speaker output doesn't work.  Trust me, its not the headphones, its the player.  I think I bought the product when it first came out.  Maybe many of the problems have been fixed since (there have been many improvements with the last few versions of the firmware).  If you decide to purchase it, I hope you have better luck.

<Title>Great value in a small package
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sounds great and very stylish in a small, thin package.  Well below the price of a comparable ipod.  Only drawbacks have been working with the Rhapsody website(getting it to recognize more than one device) and the lack of decent accesories.  Most of the stuff is available online, but if you want to run to the store for another skin or a dock, you're most likely out of luck.

<Content> Really love my new mp3 player.  I love the way it connects to Rhapsody ToGo and Napster ToGo. Copying music is just so fluent.  The screen is not the greatest but it works just fine. A great alternate to the ipod nano. The menus and navigation could do with a little upgrading, but otherwise its a very good player.

<Title>Better than Nano!
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved this for Christmas and I love it! The sound quality is great and is much cheaper than the 2GB Nano. The pictures look great (surprisingly)! Plus, the conversion software is very easy to use. It also includes much more features like voice recording, FM tuner/recorder, and micro SD expansion. And don't forget great video playback! Does the over-priced Nano feature any of this? NO! When you buy an Apple product you are mainly just paying for the name! If you are an Apple fan, you should consider looking at an mp3 player like this. With a great price and endless features, you won't be sorry.

<Title>Parents Beware
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was shocked to find out that several of the free pre-loaded songs for my Rhapsody 250 R were "explicit." These were not even the "edited" radio versions of Jay-Z (several cuts), Nas ("Money Over B_S_"), Kelis ("Milkshake"), or Project Pat ("I Keep That"). You can check out the lyrics on-line, if you're interested. On c.d., I believe these albums come with Parent Advisory Labels, but these songs are easily activated on a computer (with or without internet access as far as I can see). I was able to delete these pre-loads (my preference). Also, the "Parent Controls" come "Inactive" and must be activated if you are going to limit internet downloads.   As far as the technical side of the product, I have been using it for just 3 days, but I am very pleased with it's capabilities. The screen graphics are clear and visible. The size is great. I haven't had any trouble with operating it. The only thing that I know I would change is the size of the buttons that surround the thumbwheel; they're small and little difficult to press. Overall, it's a great device.

<Content>Bought my grandkids IPODS a couple year ago. Batteries wore out and are not replaceable, causing the IPODS to be useless.  This year I bought them this SanDisk unit and they are extrememly well pleased. In addition to owner replacement battery, it has FM tuner and other features, such as expansion memory slot etc. The like this unit much better than their former IPODS.  Better unit with nicer features for significantly less cost.  Buy it, you will like it. They convinced me to now get one for myself!

<Title>Sansa vs Nano
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My niece got this for Christmas while my son insisted on a nano.....after seeing his cousins Sansa he asked me to sell his nano on ebay and get him a sansa!  Guess he'll learn to do his homework before making his wish list for Santa!  The Sansa has many more features than the nano. What I like best is the sansa you can change the rechargable battery yourself but the nano you have to send in and pay $65 plus shipping to have it changed out.  My advice.....do your homework!  Sansa is the much better deal!

<Title>Awesome, for the price especially.
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player because I was on something of a budget, yet I wanted more than 512MB of space (because I have about 30+GB of music). The nice color combination and sleek design, plus the bonus of playing movies and expandable memory made this a quick purchase. I recieved it quite fast, and overall I am very happy with it.  PROS: plays movies, displays album art, plays WMA/MP3, ability to use as a transfer device for any media.  CONS: doesn't have support for OGG/FLAC, the movies and pictures have to be transferred exclusively with the software that comes with it, sometimes when you delete an album, it stays on the album list unless you completely delete everything on it and refill.  I've had it freeze once or twice, but you just have to turn it off and on again. Overall, I haven't had any catastrophes yet in the 6 months I've owned it. My roommate is going to buy one for herself as well.

<Title>Awesome Player, Great Price
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the Sansa e250 for Christmas, and I must say I have been thoroughly enjoying it since then.  My sister got an iPod Nano at the same time, and since that seems to be the general standard in the small mp3 player industry, I will base my review on a comparison of the two.  LOOKS AND AESTHETICS This is the one area, in my opinion, where the iPod has the real advantage.  It is slimmer and lighter and sports a cleaner design, and the case is entirely metal.  The Sansa, on the other hand, has only a metal back; the front is made of a plastic that is rather easily scratched.  The screen of the iPod also scratches less than that of the Sansa.  Nevertheless, the Sansa's screen is twice as big, and the colors are vivid and clear.  The Sansa is admittedly bigger than the iPod, but it is no means of an objectionably large or bulky size, and its thickness is hardly worth criticism.   EASE OF USE The user interfaces of the two mp3 players seem remarkably similar.  The most noticeably differences are that the iPod's scroll wheel is touch-sensitive while the Sansa's is mechanical.  I personally prefer the touch-sensitive version (although it does take a bit of getting used to), but I have had no problems with the other.    One convenient feature of the Sansa is that it has a power/menu button.  Pressing the menu button below the scroll wheel shows a menu based on your selection (similar to right-clicking an object in Windows), and pressing the Power/Menu button brings you back to the main navigation menu.  I'm sure the iPod has some way of showing a submenu too, but I was not able to find it.  Another nice thing about the Power button is rather obvious: it allows you to shut off your player.  The iPod has only an auto-off feature.  A number of reviewers have complained about the difficulties involved in pressing the buttons on the Sansa.  I can see why they complain, but at the same time I don't have a problem.  You just have to press the buttons with your thumbnail.  Also falling under the "Ease of Use" category is synchronization and computer use.  I don't think one is much harder than the other, but there are more ways of adding to the Sansa than to the iPod.  While the iPod is limited to iTunes, the Sansa allows synchronization from Windows Media Player (which I use), Windows Explorer, and many other programs.  Some reviewers have complained of the difficulty of making playlists, but it actually isn't hard at all: all you have to do is find the song you want to add or delete from the playlist and hold down the select button (the large round one) for about a second, and the song is automatically added or removed from the playlist.    FEATURES This is where the Sansa jumps ahead of the competition.  Both players have great sound and allow the playing of music by Artist, Album, Song, Genre, and Custom playlist (the iPod adds "Composer" to the list, and its playlists are more easy to use), but there most of the similarity ends.  The iPod has games, but the Sansa has Video, Photos, MicroSD expansion, Voice recording, and FM listening/recording.  All of these features have worked fine for me, and I especially enjoy the FM feature.  I get three of my favorite stations with great reception even without plugging in the USB cable (which functions as the FM antenna; if the radio didn't work without the antenna, I don't think I'd ever want to use it).  PRICE This factor obviously fluctuates, but the Sansa generally has a tremendous advantage in this area.  SUMMARY The Sandisk Sansa e250 is a very nice mp3 player, with more features than an iPod Nano and a much lower price.  The face scratches easily, and I've had a few minor problems with the firmware, but these are the Sansa's only flaws.  I highly recommend this player to anyone who wants to get twice the mp3 player for half the price.

<Title>piece of junk - waste of money
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing is a piece of junk. As others have stated, the wheel is just poorly designed.   It will likely either randomly delete or duplicate songs when you sync with Window's Media Player.   The record button is poorly placed and too sensitive, so when I had it in my pocket while walking, it would randomly start recording.   The port where you plug in the headset went bad on mine 2 months after purchase. The exact same thing happened with the replacement. I became so frustrated with this piece of junk, I eventually just slammed it against a brick wall.   It was enjoyable seeing destroyed into several pieces. I should have spent the extra $[...]and got an Ipod (although I can't tell you if they are any better, but based on the reviews they certainly can't be worse).

<Title>Doesn't support UNICODE characters!
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player is fine except for one massive flaw: It doesn't support Unicode characters like an accented 'e' or an 'o' with the umlaut, for example.  So when I downloaded some Brazilian bossanova music, I found out the hard way about this major flaw.  Why is it a major flaw?  It would be one thing if the player gave you an intelligent message telling you to rename the track or something like that.  Instead, if you add an album to the player that contains tracks whose names contain characters from the UNICODE character set, you will find that when you browse to the album on the player, the list of songs says &lt;EMPTY>.  That's it.    That's called a bug folks.  A huge, glaring, massive oversight in product design and testing.  Other than that, the player seems to be fine for my needs.

<Content>I just turned 60 last week, am new to this technology, but decided I had to have this MP3 player. The price was right, but what really sold me was the fact I can record from the radio. Last night I downloaded 45 songs from the computer with no problem. You don't need an engineering degree to use it, in fact you probably could figure it out without the manual and CD.

<Content>I really like my new mp3 player.  It is very easy to load music and what I like most about it is that you're not just stuck to one computer for loading music and you don't necessarily need SanDisk software to add music.  I use media player.

<Title>A good option
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sansa player looks quite robust and durable. The screen is brighter and is quite easy to use, the interface intend to be iPod like. However, compared with iPod, the sansa player feels a little bit coarse.  The goods:   . Price   . Memory expansion   . Easy software to uploads videos   . File system do not scramble your mp3 files and folders (just read them however you upload to it)   . It comes with a small but useful case (to avoid scratchs)   . You could record directly from the microphone   . You could record the radio   . Size  The bads (that is because I didn't put 5 stars)   . The volume wheel is completely mechanic, then your thumb works out spinning the wheel.   . Software to upload mp3 does not have as many features as the iTunes has   . The interface could be better   . Headphones could be better   Sansa e250 is a QUITE good mp3 player. It's a good opponent to the ipod nano if you don't have enough money to buy one of those.

<Title>Durable to the extreme!
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this mp3 player for probably three or four months now, and it's been babied the entire time. After updating WinAmp/Windows Media Player, it's really quite easy to use by just dragging and dropping your files/playlists onto the player. I haven't used it for anything other than music as of yet, but likely will when I buy my replacement.  Now the fun part. It somehow made it into the pocket of the wrong pair of pants and went through the washer and dryer, full cycles for each -bear in mind it has no case, merely the little suede cover that comes with it. I opened up the dryer to see one of the earphones hanging out and had burst into tears, until I saw that I could read the screen and that it was playing. I picked up the earphones to hear it playing beautifully, just like new. Only issues are water trapped in the screen, showing only half of a charge, and it looking like it's been dropped at least once a week. Aside from that, it works just like new! Though I wouldn't recommend someone washing it on a regular basis... I plan on replacing my Sansa because I'm a sentimental fool, but it will be a while before that can happen. However, I know this will make it through at least until then and likely much longer.  I would highly recommend this player to anyone who has a teenager/child who wants an iPod. I'm 20, and this is my third mp3 player. The replacement I buy for this one in the near future will be the same, only a 4gig instead of a 2gig. I know I can rely on it to last much longer than the iPod Nanos I've been hearing people complain about having to replace, or that have been snapped in half on accident. I actually owned one before owning this, and constantly worried that I was going to break it if it was jarred suddenly, or if it accidently hit the ground -this is even in a sillicone case. Yes, Sansas are slightly heavier, but it's more of a safety net should it be dropped or knicked on something.  The Sansa is half the cost, infinately more durable, has the possibility for unlimited memory (read: using the Micro SD cards), and does more than an iPod Nano does. Like I said, I had one once, but sold it to get this after buying one for a friend for Christmas, because I fell in love with the ease of use and durability while showing her how to use it -said friend is accident-prone, and also a music major who uses it constantly to study works for tests or to just jam out in the car, and I now know that hers should live through her (ab)use for quite a long time!

<Title>This is a great MP3 player
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great little device for athletics.  I use it for biking and running  just about every day and couldn't be more happy.  The interface is good and the volume is more than enough for me.  I have tried a number of MP3 players and for the money you can not beat this device. My only two gripes are that it can be a little hard to see the screen while you are running and it is in an arm strap and I wish moving between playlists wasn't didn't require going back to the main menu as it throws off my stride.  Minor problems really.

I also like that you can view the album art. It isn't a neccessary feature but nice. I purchased the DLO Action jacket also which protects that player without adding any weight and it also has a handy clip to attach the player to whatever!

<Title>Good for the kids, not suitable for audiobooks
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The kids wanted MP3 players for Christmas and I instantly fell in love with Sandisk's e200 series players (Santa delivered 3 of them).  I thought I'd borrow one of them from the kids and switch from being a "books on tape" to a "books on MP3" listener.  Wrong.    Like so many other MP3 players, these are missing 2 important software features: variable-speed/high gain fast-forward & reverse, and bookmarking.  Without these the unit is worthless for trying to listen to an hours-long audio book.  Without bookmarking, you'll frequently find yourself inadvertently reset at the beginning of the book.  And its 5X fast-forward would take 2 hours of button-holding just to get back to the end of a 10-hour book.  Each of these features is a fairly trivial bit of software/firmware.  And Sandisk has wisely built into the e200 series the ability to update the firmware.  For now I'll hold out hope that Sandisk will retrofit these features into their firmware.

<Content>It's a great little player for those who don't want an iPod. Haven't found a reason to watch video on it, but it's nice to know I could. Just a few cons, playlists are tricky to set up, and it's far too easy to hit the record button on the side. Also, fast forwarding is a pain, especially if you lost your spot in an audiobook because you accidentally hit the record button on the side.

<Content>Not a bad little player for those out there who are unwilling to join the nerd herd iPod bandwagon.  The price is outstanding and the pros outway the cons.   Pros Drag and drop any music file and it plays AM/FM receiver works fine Great price compact/lightweight=great for running Great little screen Cons Spin wheel takes some getting used to Video and pics are only transferable after converting them to some weird format. software included (one more thing to install on my computer) Only recharges when plugged into computer so i have to make sure i have one with me whenever i am away from home for any lengthy trip.  All in all, i really like the player.  what can i say, I hate Apple's insistence of buying songs from iTumes that won't play on anything but an iPod.  Down with DRM.  This player accomadates my music gathered over the years from different places and is a great little music player, especially for the price.

<Content>What is not to like?  Expansion slot for additional memory, Radio, Music, Voice recording, Video.  The Sansa has it all.  I have been using it for about a month now and I can only say it is all good as far as features go.  A couple of words of caution, consider buying a case for it as it only comes (much like all of them) with the flimsy little bag carrier and a useless carrying cord.  The unit also only comes with a cord to charge your unit off of a USB port on a computer.  It would be worth it to get the AC cord.  I am considering buying both of these.  Other than that....it is a great unit.

<Title>Great iPod Nano alternative
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my daughter (age 10) who, of course, wanted an iPod. I convinced her that this would be an acceptable option and sold her on the features of pictures, video, the radio (iPod players still don't have this), and the price. I'm very happy with the product. Navigation is intuitive, but its scrolling device isn't as smooth as the iPod which is why it won't get 5 stars from me. I use Windows Media Player to sync songs and it comes with software to convert and sync photos and videos - works fine. We replaced the included ear buds soon after purchase with an inexpensive set of headphones.  I also bought the e200 rubberized sleeve that I would recommend to keep the player shiny and new-looking. It comes with a cloth sleeve for protection, but you have to take it out every time to do anything (adjust volume, change songs, etc.).

<Title>Good Player, died so soon!
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Read on why 3 stars, if it werent for some trouble i would give a 5 stars, but...  I am having one of these players and i have to admit it, its the best player out there, despite of the wheel that all people care about, come on guys!, its not an ipod. But it will surelly kill and actually eat every apple nano out there, video playback its 15fps but it actually look real nice, very bright, photos look amazing in this device and audio playback is really good. There were some options missing but hey no player has it all. Until here 5 STARS  Now the bad news, i bought this device cause I first saw it to a friend o mine, his player died 3 months after buy it, another friend saw it from me and guess what, the player died too after about 3-4 months but not before mine died after 5 months of usage, also mine had some gliches, like it didnt want to boot allways, 1 out of 5 times (ramdomly) the player froze so it took me more than 20 seconds to bootiit. You may say Hey why U didnt returned it,... i dont live in US territory and it could be more than 20 dollars for me to change it, so i said WTF.  Overall is a good player, i am so proud i didnt buy the 6gb model as i was trying to, but while it lasted, great product.

<Content>I Love this MP3 player it's perfect for the gym and hiking and running, but you will have to buy some accessories. You will need ear buds (the ones that come with it are not very good for working out) you can get very good noise canceling ear buds for under $40.00. You will also need the battery charger or car charger and the protective skin is really nice to have. I bought a package from [...] that includes all that and more for only [...]. All in all I really like this MP3 player, it's much better than my previous players. I highly recommend.

<Title>Sans-ible choice. Nice little player
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Firstly, let me start by saying that my review excludes the video features. I have not used that as yet, and did not buy for video.  Audio Playback quality : ------------------------ I would have to say it is pretty decent. But I have not compared it to other players. It does have a built-in equalizer with presets and a custom EQ that you can set.   FYI : CAR ADAPTOR and CAR Playback : ------------------------------------- I used to connect a MP3 CD player via my Car Cassette adaptor before. I am quite certain that the Sansa has lesser quality than that cheap CD player. I did use the same car casette adaptor. Its still good though IN THE CAR. I playback FM from the Sansa FM tuner through my car stereo as opposed to the Car FM tuner. Quality is not as good as the car tuner but still decent. Benefit: You can hit record when a good song plays whilst you drive.  Earphones : ----------- I did not like these. They are loud enough. But distort. Invest in decent earphones like the Shure if you expect good quality.  On some material, I would not be able to turn it all the way up (prob even in noisy surroundings).  FM Recording : -------------- Recording quality is decent for later identification but poor if you wish to use it like a downloaded mp3. It records in WAV and I think it has a limit of 2+ mins. You can pause and resume the recording. I plug this into my car via a car adapter. When I like a song, a single press starts recording FM. Channel Reception is decent to good when in the car. Indoors, it does not pick all channels. When you record FM, it prefixes the file with the channel freq eg FM95_5_....wav  The interface is very easy to use and looks pretty good. Many people have talked about no STOP button. The pause button is your stop button. You do not need a stop button as this has no moving parts and is a flash drive. So there is no wear on the device if you pause it.   Battery life : -------------- Its pretty good. I set the display brightness low and the backlight on for 5 secs before auto-turnoff. I estimate it to go for at least 12 hrs. But it could go for 15-18 too, I guess.  CONS : ------ Proprietary USB cable means you can only charge from that cable, buy another for approx $12 or purchase a USB car/wall adapter for this device.  The headphones are cheap but I was not expecting better for the price.  CONCLUSION : ------------ Worth it for the price, features & quality. If you are considering it for video, please research it.

<Title>A good value in MP3 players
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall a very acceptable 2G player for under $100. Display a bit too small, image quality depends greatly on the viewing angle making it difficult to watch videos and photos. The unit is built solidly and is well designed except for the control buttons which are very hard to actuate and have very poor "feel", the scroll wheel is OK. SanDisk could have made the buttons bigger and more prominent, space would have not been an issue.  Sound quality is very good, provided you get yourself a decent pair of earphones. I just don't get it, why do these companies (iRiver the same)after producing spectacular technology ruin it all by throwing in crappy 25 cents transducers(earphones)ruining the whole effect. A good pair of earphones should cost you about $10-15. You should fudge that into the final cost of the unit.  The FM receiver is OK, tunning in on stations is not easy because of the poor functionality of the control buttons, setting and scanning presets is somewhat cumbersome (I like the iRiver better).  Voice recording at lectures and meetings I found to be marginally useful, maybe in a pinch if you have nothing better at hand...  Videos need to be converted using proprietary software and will not play if they are larger than about 60 or so megs. If you have a large video that you want to load and watch you will have to split it in sections not exceeding the critical size(I did it by trial and error, a veritable chore and a hindrance). I hope SanDisk remedies this with some kind of firmware update in the near future.  Now, a little problem I found, sometimes (very seldom) all mp3 players freeze (the system crashes), it happens most frequently when connected to a computer (via USB). Most units have a tiny hole labeled "reset" where you can insert a pin like object (preferably non metallic) to reset it. Well, this unit does not appear to have one. Mine froze and I had to disconnect the removable battery on the back side of the unit to accomplish this. The manual instructs to hold the "menu" button for 15 seconds but that did not work for me I still had to do a hardware reset. Caveat, the unit does have a little hole on the top side, DO NOT insert anything there for that is the built in microphone (it is properly labeled though).  On the positive side, this is one of the few units on the market that has an easily accessible and replaceable battery (in fact SanDisk makes available a replacement/backup battery for about $20, a great deal as custom batteries go). Too bad that you have to remove two small (and easy to lose) screws to loosen the battery. Why couldn't SanDisk go all the way and design a quick release latch for the battery??!!  Another plus for this unit is that it accepts MicroSD memory cards. This adds expandability to the unit. I have not used this feature so I am not sure if music and video files can be played directly from the card.  I also have an iRiver U10, iRivers are terrific players but significantly more expensive than the Sansas (with comparable memory capacities). Functionally, iRivers leave the Sansas in the dust. Better controls, better user interface, better and larger display, better FM tuner etc.. but at about twice the price. The Sansa is thinner and a little better constructed though.  A very good value.

<Content>after installing the software and connecting the player via USB to the pc, it shows connected in its screen and it also charges. But when opening either Windows Media Player 10.0 or Sansa Media Converter to transfer music or pictures, it keeps saying "device not detected" (WMP) and "no available player, please connect your player" (SMC). I did not find anything in the manual to solve this. Maybe it is just a silly detail or maybe something is working wrong.

<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa e250 is an amazing mp3 player. And what a great price!! Come on, you could buy this thing that plays music, pictures and video (and the quality is quite superb for its size) for about $100, or you could just play music on your ipod for about $150. The sound is great, the video and pictures look amazing and it's overall an amazing player. I guess the only bad thing is that the buttons are rather small, and should be bigger, but I've learned to deal with them. I love my Sansa. I would also reccomend buying a case w/ a screen protector so that the screen stays nice and crisp. Overall, it's pretty much amazing!

<Title>Great Device for the money
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great device.  Every feature on it is better than both versions of the iPod nano (I have owned both).  The video is good quality, but it's not as smooth as I would like it to be.  The front and back don't scratch easily, which is a pro in comparison the the original nano, which scratched super easily.  I'm actually selling my Sansa now though because I don't listen to that much music.  But you should definitely get the Sandisk brand mp3players instead of the nano if you want a nonscratchable, multifeatured device for a great price. [...] I'm selling a used 2gb without any scratches for 50% off, with a free 512mb Micro SD to add 125+ more songs onto the Sansa.

This was my first mp3 player and I am highly impressed.    Item is light, compact, and easy to operate.  Screen is incredibly clear.  Sound is amazing.  And video quality is also impressive.  The e250 holds not only songs, but can record voice with clear playback, has an FM tuner and the option of recording songs from the radio station, it stores videos and photos, and accepts every major song format (except for protected files).  The battery lasts a very long time without having to be recharged (provided you don't have the screen lit 24/7).  The scroller makes it easy to change between menus if you don't like the buttons instead.  And if you decide later that you need more space for songs, the e250 comes with an expansion slot where you can plug in an extra memory card.  Songs synch to the device just like they do on an iPod.  Using Windows Media Player, you can organize your songs according to album, genre, artist, and title.  If you are absolutely new to downloading songs onto an mp3 player, you'll need to just explore and tinker with Windows Media Player. It's not hard to figure out; it just requires you to actually READ the instructions.    There aren't many accessories for the e250 yet and that is mostly due to the fact that it's a fairly new model (I hope).  The only way to charge it is to plug it into the USB cable and connect it to your computer or laptop.  Charging takes only approximately 30 minutes, depending on how drained the battery is.  The package comes with a small velt pouch to keep the mp3 player in.  It's not a heavy duty protector, but keeps your screen from getting scratched.    All in all, the e250 is a surprisingly great and fairly undiscovered mp3 player that I personally think could kick iPod's butt in a fight any day.  Many of my friends have paid $200+ for iPods that constantly need repair and have only HALF the features of a Sansa e250.  I paid $99 for my Sansa and have had NO problems, NO repairs, and NO complaints.  It's a great mp3/video player.  Enjoy.  :)

<Title>Very good value
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player meets all my expectations having several other similar devices but the interface is so much better than all except the ipod. The ability to add extra memory cards on the fly is great as it means you can prepare for different outings or let the young children use when driving etc etc. The exchangeable battery removes the issue with ipods. The display is excellent meaning I don't need to put on my varifocals. The sound is excellent with only one complaint, the lowest volume level could me a little less for use in quite environments. With my BOSE noise cancelling headphones the quality shines through. Really good value and with a gel case it is well protected from the elements.

<Title>Very disappointed
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a gift for my husband who can't stand iPods.  He loved it, but the first day of use, the sound started cutting out randomly.  He tried different headphones with no luck, so we exchanged it.  Second one worked for a little over a month before the same problem started up again, then it started making whining noises in his ear.  We returned it and are going to buy a Creative.  It's really too bad as the features of this mp3 player are perfect (except that the battery life is REALLY short) and the price is great.  But I guess you get what you pay for.

<Content>I bought one for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it.  I'm even thinking of getting one.  It beats my ipod - it can play AM/FM radio, and you can store pictures and movies, it's not as ridiculously expensive, you can use it with windows media and the best part is you can add more memory.  Highly recommended.

<Title>A newbie whose made the right purchase...
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While not the most agile when it comes to the latest technology, I reviewed the customer recommendations for the Sansa e200 since I was looking for a good MP3 player, and was pleasantly surprised to find most customers were very satisfied with their purchase.  A friend who also has a Sansa advised that I would get easily addicted to down loading songs, and she was right - I was up late last night doing that very thing.  The directions are pretty clear, and luckily I did some research prior to my purchase to find a site that would be most compatible with my Sansa - for my preferences, it's Rhapsody. They have the `click and drag' method and I was amazed at how easy it was.  My only complaint, and mind you it's a small one, is the screen is already scratched.  It's not a big scratch but I know it's there...if anyone can recommend on how to protect the screen, or give any idea's, that would be great.   Overall - I'm a very happy customer.

<Title>I've had it for 4 months, and just can't bring myself to complain...much...
<Date>Sat Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a neat little toy - it always works, it's never *ever* locked up, the software is witless and simple for pics and vids, the batteries last for-freaking-ever, it sounds very good, and it's survived a gazillion falls - even down hard concrete stairs - without issue.  Those falls, by the way, were absorbed by the Speck case <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IZ78A2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9553683-9352858">Speck Products ToughSkin Case with Belt Clip for Sansa e200 (Black)</a> which is the gawd-awfullest militarily brutish looking thing in existence, but man does it work.  My complaints, one real and one nit, are as follows: The nit - the bulk factor.  This is juuuust a little fat, compared to some other players.  With the Speck case it's downright obese.  Still, not so big that it would stop me from recommending it.  The real complaint: the earbuds.  They sounded like crap.  Got some better ones, and viola!  Sounds great.

<Content>I love my Sansa e250 mp3 player.  Much cheaper than an ipod Nano and more versatile.  It also has a much larger screen than the ipod Nano.  I have had mine for a couple of months and it works flawlessly.  The only problem I had is that it would not interface with my computer but that was an issue with the computer and not the player itself.  Do yourself a favor, save some $$$$ and get one of these instead of the ipod Nano.

<Date>Sun Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for about $165 last year for my graduation gift. Well... so I've been using this player for 8 months and I'm done. At first, I really liked the design, the blue click wheel  and it's large screen. But honestly, if you get it, it's kinda cheap-looking and people around me thought this is sorta IPOD copying one of the cheap mp3 players. Well and they've got this cheap earphones... And it really doesn't support many languages... which was a drawback for me since I listen to many Korean songs. Sometimes the player froze out of nowhere so suddenly... and it stays like that for ever until battery runs out and mine is broke now... screws are unscrewed... Hmmm... what should I say... for $105 is a decent player I guess but I'm buying SAMSUNG'S YP-K5...with built in speaker it's totally cool the design is... is... just lovely ... you just gotta check that out the audio quality is much better if you want to follow the trend, this is out I regretted not buying IPod instead of this :(

<Title>better than ipod... period
<Date>Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i purchased this item back in november and since then i have loved it. the best part is that i can replace the battery myslef without having to pay a billion dollars to have it shipped back to the manufacturer like most ipods. in addition, it has a radio voice recorder and all kinds of other things. the only flaw is that the buttons are hard to manuever and it has a tendency to freeze up and sometimes it will not play certain tracks because they are "bad tracks" that have corrupted the mp3 player. but to fix this problem i just go to sansa's website and download the format driver for the mp3 player which upgrades and refreshes it. all in all, it was a very good buy and the expandable memory is awesome!!

It's very easy to use.  I haven't done anything with the video element of it yet, But I'm sure I'll get to it one of these days.  I did have a problem with my first one.  However, Amazon sent me a new one like the next day.  I have to say you guys have a great customer service department.  Hope to do business with you again.

<Content>Well we bought this as a gift and overall it's working pretty good although it has froze up once.  The most difficult part is getting the music on the thing in the first place.  We've tried but can't get it to download directly from Windows Media Player,we have to go through several steps just to get songs on this thing.  Very time consuming.  Other than that it's ok.  I'm actually going to buy my son the Creative Labs version for his birthday.  My niece has one and she says it pretty much plug and play.

<Content>Looks great, worked great, for the first 3 weeks.  All of a sudden it freezes up.  I cannot get it to stop cycling through the Sandisk title screen, over, and over....  I tried the reset, about a million times.  Let it drain then tried agian.  Nothing.  Thank Heavens for Amazon's return policy as I am returning this and requesting a replacement.  I am willing to give it one more try.  This time the first thing I will do is update the firmware as I did not do that before it got stuck in start up mode.  Funny thing is I bought two of these.  One for my son and one for my wife.  They were half the price of the Nano and they wanted other things for Christmas.  My daughter just wanted a Nano, so I got her the Nano.  She is laughing at us while listening to her Nano and we have problems with this Sansa.

<Title>I can't wait til I really learn to use it lol
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I do love this and I know that it will be one of my fav things  as soon as I learn to use it properly.  So far I've downloaded 2 of my fav songs, but unfortunately don't know how I did it so can't repeat it yet. I'm not good with technology. Usually, tho, I can follow directions very easily.  If I had had a 12 year old here I'm sure s/he would have it full of music already.  For this 58 year old, non- techy woman I found the instructions provided not very clear (and I really am good at following instructions).  I still give it 5 stars because the 2 songs I did put on it sound wonderful and I feel very sure that I will eventually be able to learn to use it more easily.  I would recommend it, but not to someone, maybe older who isn't familiar with these kinds of things.

<Title>Good MP3 Player, But....
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 2 of these MP3 players and 1 has operated flawlessly.  The other one had problems straight from the box.  After my daughter loaded some songs and videos on the player it froze up on the logo screen, rebooting over and over.  The wait on the tech line was very long and I finally hung up and emailed tech support with the problem.  Due to the holidays it took over a week to work through all the suggested fixes but after reformatting the player and updating the firmware, it has work just fine.  As for the player itself: PROS: *The sound quality is good but better ear buds made a big improvement. *Easy to load songs through Windows Explorer (drag and drop)   *Navigation is easy *Loading video and pictures is a snap after learning how to use the software. *The video screen is surprisingly clear  *A fraction of the cost compared to a iPOD with the same features   CONS: *The navigation wheel feels cheap in comparison to the rest of the product *FM radio received only very local stations (I expected that though) *The "Artists" menu often lists the composer instead of the recording artist (ex: Jimi Hendrix showing up as the artist instead of Stevie Ray Vaughan) *DRM makes things difficult when loading from Windows Media Player.  Over All: Very happy with this product, would recommend it to anyone.  I would however recommend that you update the firmware as soon as possible.

<Title>No iPod Beater
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought it because I wanted a radio, which iPod doesn't offer.  But I was disappointed by the reception.  The radio uses the earphone wire as an antenna, and an addendum to the instructions suggests also plugging in the charging cord and letting that dangle for an additional antenna (an admission I believe that reception is poor).  But I didn't find that the additional cord made any difference.  Walking around inside my workplace, I find that even strong signals fade into static depending on which direction I am facing. So far as the mp3 player goes, I had a problem with that as well, although one could say it was my fault.  Usually I use my iPod shuffle at the gym but one time I forgot it but had my Sansa. I wore it around my neck but tucked it inside my shirt so it wouldn't swing around while I was on the treadmill. After about half an hour it quit working, although the display would not turn off -- a victim of my intense sweat.  Happily after it dried out it began working again.  Moral: Don't expose to moisture.  Another criticism: While the volume may be loud enough for many people, it's not as loud as my iPod Shuffle2, which I find amazing, considering how small the Shuffle is.  Some songs are at lower levels than I want, but I can't do anything about it.  Conclusion: This is still a lot of electronics for $100 -- just don't expect good radio reception inside an office building.   UPDATE: Later I bought a 2 GB expansion chip, and that was a disappointment as well. Every time I turn on the Sansa it requires about 2 minutes to "refresh" the database to incorporate music on the included 2 GB chip with music on the expansion chip.  In the meantime the controls are locked and you can't even listen to the radio. No wonder Apple remains the best seller by far!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9553683-9352858">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a>

<Content>Seems to be a well constructed item, however, a lot of the time it can't seem to load the selection for 3 or 4 minutes.  Menu is simple to use, but there's no real shortcuts to hitting the button and waiting for it to make up its mind.  I've only got it about half filled with downloads from Napster.  Screen and front scratch VERY easily.  "Earbuds" aren't confortable at all.  They're simple small speakers with a thin foam pad on them.  Would I buy another one or recommend it - not if there was another option.

<Title>great buy, much better than the competitor
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item rather than the MP3 by that other company mostly because of the huge price difference.  All my buddies have that other MP3 player.  After comparing features and functionality, I am quite proud that I resisted going with the crowd and buying an iPod.  My iPod owning friends are impressed with the Sansa.  The Sansa has several features (FM tuner, recording capabilities) that the iPod doesn't.    Best of all, you don't need to load your personal CDs through iTunes before loading to your MP3 player.  I can load my CDs onto my pc and drag them over using Explorer.  Much simpler.  And personally, I don't want iTunes or anyone else knowing everything I've loaded onto MP3 player. That's just creepy.    There are 2 not so great things about this player though. 1 - The earbuds just don't stay in the ear.  The ear pieces are really light and even the slightest tension on the wires pulls them out.  Also,  the ear pieces are really thin and flat and round, and they just don't fit well.  So, plan on buying new earbuds.    2 - No belt clip (iPod doesn't come with one either).  The lanyard just doesn't cut it.  So, plan on buying a belt clip or armband (or both).

Now I almost foot I still have this e250 until I saw the page from here so I think I need to share part of my experience. I don't sign up for any online music service. Only use media player to transfer music from my library and collection. For many times I have difficult to transfer the right songs to right location in this e250. I feel there are many bugs issues in this model. So I gave up and go get ipod to get the better life. For sound quality I may give it 3 stars but for ease of use I will give it 1 star. The conclusion, the quality at sound can't even compare with the digital voice recorder "OLYMPUS ws-300m". How sad!!

<Title>An excellent upgrade
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've enjoyed using this mp3 player, especially when compared to my old 128 mb player.  True, the screen is small, but the interface is pretty self-explanatory.  I got all of my favorite songs on the player with room to spare.  You do need to buy some sort of specialized sport arm band if you want to use this player for exercise - otherwise you'll either deal with the device hitting your chest with every step, or you'll be unable to change the volume/song/etc through a generic arm band.    Unlike some of the other users, I haven't had any trouble using the buttons (but I have smallish fingers).  I think the light-up dial is just as easy to use as the touch-senstive ipod pad.  It is bigger than the nano and has fewer available accessories, but I've loved it so far.  I have not yet tried to construct playlists, so I can't comment as to the ease of using the supplied software.

<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the e250 a couple months ago after reading hundreds of reviews about various mp3 players. So far, I have been completely satisfied with it. At first I was worried about using up 2gb quickly, but now I don't know if I'll ever fill it up. It's a piece of cake to transfer music files with Windows Media Player, but I haven't experimented with video files yet. Loaded with tons of features [...] I don't know of a better value out there. I give the e250 5 stars and will definitely buy more SanDisk products in the future.

My cousin has an ipod and I am glad I got this instead. I also think that since this costs less than an ipod nano and can play videos, record and listen to fm radio and the nano can't, this is a better deal. This also can be expanded. Get this if you want a good mp3 player that can also view photos and play videos.

<Title>My husband loves it
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would have rated it 5 stars but I am an Ipod lover. I bought this for my husband to use when we workout at the gym. He loves it. He has put all his CD's on it. He even walks around the house listening to his music. The only problem we have is we can not figure out how to make a playlist. He uses the artist or albums list instead and he doesn't really care that much that there are no playlist on it. He did purchase new headphones because the ones that came with it were too large for him. I think he is ready to get the microSD disk for it so he can put even more music on it.

<Content>I am somewhat disappointed with this product.  I have found the wheel to be more difficult to use than I expected, and I've not found the software to be as intuitive as I had hoped.  I nearly returned this product, and I don't use it as much as I thought because I don't like it that well.

<Title>As good as ipod (if not better)
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave the Sansa E-250 to my daughter for her birthday. I downloaded the updates and started loading the music and videos. couldn't be any easier! She told me that she thinks this mp3/video player is as good as an ipod if not better. It comes with 2 gb but if you buy the micro sd card for it, it could be as big as you want. Very small and lightweight. I recommend this player to anyone.

<Title>Not Perfect, But Pretty Good
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Once I figured out how this mp3 player worked, I've had no problems with it.  The owner's "manual" is pretty much worthless.  The manual on the install CD is better but still leaves many questions unanswered.  The biggest trouble I had was figuring out how to set the USB connection--there are two choices and the manual isn't very clear on which one to choose.  I apparently chose the wrong one and when I downloaded the first few albums I really got a mess.  Songs were put under different artists' names and in different albums.  I contacted the SanDisk tech support and their response was pretty much a form response and didn't address my questions very well.  I finally deleted everything and started over and since then I haven't had any trouble.  The positives, though, now outweigh the negatives.  The player has excellent sound quality, the menu is easy to navigate, and the Sansa e250 is a small and attractive player.  I bought this as a gift for my wife who is not very tech savvy.  She loves it--uses it when she does her aerobic workout.  I have had to order a case and clip to attach it to her waist--the e250 doesn't come with that.  Also, I ordered a better set of headphones--the ones that came with the Sansa were adequate, but didn't fit in the ear very well.

<Title>Sansa is Superb
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this so I could have something small to listen to at work.  The 4Gb is plenty enough space to hold what I need. (It does come in larger versions) The size and features are perfect for me as i perform my duties in the factory where I am employed.  The sound from the ear buds is very good. The EQ settings make playback very appealing.  Would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good MP3 Player.

<Content>The Sansa e250 is great looking, relatively low-priced, easy to use, easy to navigate, has great battery life and is compact & lightweight. It replaces a low-capacity player I'd owned for several years, and there's just no comparison. I only wish now that I gotten the 4gb model.

<Title>Great ipod alternative
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought two of these for our daughters for Christmas after they had asked for ipods.  Besides saving $100, we were thrilled to hear them say that they loved them.      Right out of the box without charging, they both turned on...  one correctly dispayed the locked screen but the other one froze.   Once we charged them and unlocked the device, they both functioned properly.      After browsing through the manual we were able to download songs from Musicmatch 10 in a couple minutes and with very few problems.       The radio function worked well even without using the USB cable for an antenna.       So far we have not used any other media types but the picture quality on the small screen is impressive and leads me to believe that  we will explore that feature very soon.  The left and right buttons are a bit of a challenge to use but not enough to be frustrating. We look forward to seeing more available accessories including separate charging dock instead of USB system.

<Date>Thu Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm more than satisfied with this player.  It's easy to use, and I think the sound is great.  However, in the latest issue of PC World, this player didn't even qualify to be included in the list of 21 players they tested.  According to them, the sound is so lousy that it's not worth being on their list.

<Title>Impressive MP3!
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 is a great player! It has lots of things you can do - radio, albums, video, photos, recordings. It's compact and stylish. Both of my boys have iPods, but now wish they had this instead.   I don't like the earphones that come with it - they are too big for my ears, so I went out and purchased ear buds and those are much more comfortable for me.  I did read that the buttons around the dial are somewhat hard to use, but I haven't experienced that myself.  For the price, you can't beat this one!

<Content>I ordered this product for my son (age 12). He enjoys using the music features. I still like the iPod navigation wheel better than Sansa's, but that's me. He likes this mp3 player and I would recommend it for anyone needing a good reliable starter product for a pre-teen.

<Content>I purchased this item as a christmas gift for my 14 yr old daughter.  The player has a tendency to freeze in which it will remain that way until the battery dies out.  At that time, it will function properly again.  I am not sure what causes the freeze (downloaded music etc..) but she continues to enjoy using it and hasn't asked for another brand.

<Title>Great bargain for $100, kicks nano and shuffle in the arse!
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A bright screen (that can be adjusted), video player (with a program that makes videos easy to convert, but may sometimes take time if converting multiple videos), a photo viewer, and great sound. I bought this the day after Christmas, and I've been using it for over a month now, so I feel it is time to write a review. It was way worth my $99.99 (what it was priced at the date I purchased it, with free shipping as well!). Compared to a 2 gig iPod nano, I actually prefer the Sansa (I won't even compare it to the shuffle, since the shuffle has no screen, and I just hate it). It has the ability to play videos, something the nano cannot do. Also, the Sansa feels more durable than the nano, as the sansa is a bit thicker and has a durable backside and a sleek frontside. The nano is thin and feels flimsy, and looks like it will snap in half. But enough with the comparing. The nano has 2 gigs, but you can add more memory by buying memory cards (you can buy them for pretty cheap if you look around). Oh, and I almost forgot about the radio playback. But there ARE a few cons in the Sansa. I have 2 songs that played fine on my laptop, but on my sansa, it got cut off midway each song and got overtaken by a loud screeching sound. But of course, this is only 2 songs out of 288 songs. Also, I recommend you to get your own headphones if you purchase this mp3 player, since the ones that come prepacked SUCK. They fall out of your ears, and when they DO stay in, they hurt like heck. One final con of this player is the radio. It sometimes doesn't sound to clear and at times does not receive good reception. But mostly, it plays fine and you can hear what is playing. Almost forgot, the voice recorder works fine too, sounds just like if you were recording your voice on a mic on your PC. Overall, I give this player 5 stars because I absolutely love it. Though it does have a few cons, they definitely get overtaken by all the good of this mp3 player. Pay the [..] or so dollars for this. Its worth every penny.

<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my daughter.  All I can tell is that she loves it and all her friends who own Apple ipods envy her.   With ability to watch video & photos, and hear music and voice, a slot to add memory, all for a price much less than what an ipod costs.    Most often, brand names are just a hipe!

<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This Mp3 player is Simply the best on the market today! It is tiny (smaller than the pictures suggest) and the screen is much larger than an iPod's. The graphic design is splended too! The menu is a true work of art as is the sound quality.  I say save the $50 and buy this instead of an iPod, you won't be dissapointed!!!
