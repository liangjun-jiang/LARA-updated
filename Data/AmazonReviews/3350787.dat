<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has done it again.  As a 40 gig iPod owner, I love the shuffle.  Its the go anywhere, do almost anything, store more than music mp3 player. Battery life is great, storage capacity is more than the stated 120 songs, and the sound is INCREDIBLE! ...as is the price.  I used it while excercising and there were no skips.  Easily fits into your pocket and weighs less than a set of keys! The shuffle will fit perfectly into your busy lifestyle. P.S. The required installation software can be a bit of a problem if you already have iTunes on your computer.

<Title>A non-iPod-user's review
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a compact, flash-based mp3 player, the shuffle fills a niche in the market.  Apple's greatest contribution to the mp3 player market was the aesthetics of their players: love it or hate it, you have to admit that the iPod looks unique, and most people (like me) will go as far as saying it looks pretty good.  Before everyone and their neighbor's dog owned one, you could pull out an iPod and make the room stop.  The shuffle continues this tradition.  Apple's sleek, simple design hides a fairly powerful little flash-based player.  It's tiny (although not the smallest player on the market, despite what their ad people may say), feather-light and on the whole, very trendy looking.  The 512 memory is just about the right size for what I suspect is the primary target market for these players: people looking for a small, durable alternative to their iPod for short trips, work-outs, etc.  Other pros:  -Simple, intuitive control interface  -Easy to interface with pretty much any machine  -iPod users can use all their .AAC format music  -No, seriously, this thing weighs next to nothing.  Cons:  -No external LCD.  Apple had to sacrifice SOMEthing to make this product as small and lightweight as it is, and the LCD screen is the first of these things.  While not a problem for those intimately familiar with their music collection or those not picky about what they listen to, many users will definitely not appreciate the inability to easily navigate the songs contained on the player.  -Terrible battery life.  Much like the iPod compared to its competitors (e.g. the Zen Touch), the Shuffle has less than 2/3 the average battery life of comparable features (meaning with no LCD screens).  Again, Apple had to sacrifice something in order to make the product as lightweight and small as it is, and this shouldn't be a problem for the majority of users, as the shuffle seems to be geared toward short trips.  -Like the iPod, you must interface the Shuffle with iTunes.  Now before the pro-iPod army comes and kills me, let me explain: I have nothing against iTunes, it's a great program (as evidenced by Microsoft blatantly copying it with Media Player 10), but I personally despise being forced to use any one application with my hardware.  If Apple had made the Shuffle drag'n'drop compatible, it would have been a much better purchase.

<Title>Sexy, small,  white iPod Shuffle - I like
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own an iPod.  I never felt like I need all the storage.  I would be fine with 120 songs, therefore I ordered my iPod shuffle as soon as it came out.  When I got the package at home, I was in love.  Even the packaging is sweet. I loved the smell of the packaging, the sexy flirty display in the box and ultimately the size.  But wait, how about the sound and the music...  I Love it.  I synced my iPod with iTunes (I only have 40 songs) and listened to it in shuffle mode and WOW... the sound is amazing.  I have found the end of my portable music player search.  Not only does it sound great but its a head turner.  Everywhere I go, people want to touch it, feel it, listen to it.  Stay away!!!  I have to fight them off with a stick.  Now, I walk the streets of New York, shuffled...  Now I drive Shuffled, heck, I even go to the toilet... shuffled.  I'm all shuffled up.  Lets face it, you add songs to your playlist that you love, not bad songs but great songs, and the shuffle feature is awesome.  Its like it picks the perfect songs to follow... Its a virtual dj...  Now, stay away, cause this shuffle is mine.  Till death or technical issues, do us apart.  Yahhhh!!!

<Title>uhhhhhhhh, NO!
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a confessed musicaholic. I could sit and download for hours. But, why would anyone buy this flash memory player when there are other ones with more features AND a display? I will stick to my Iriver any day. The inline recording feature that it has is remarkable. It really is cd quality. Not that I want to rip off the music industry, but with this feature you can record an album, for instance, off of AOL for nothing. It really is cd quality when you record like this. This IPod can't do that. I think the hard drive Ipod is a brilliant idea, and maybe someday I will get one. But for the money, you can buy another flash memory MP3 player, with a display, with a radio, with voice recording (some may find that useful, I don't) and the inline recording. And they look better. Whats with the boring white? Naah I'm not sold on this.

<Title>Don't be taken in
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> Don't believe the Apple hype or the ranting by Apple disciples. Comparably-priced players have a ton more features - a display, FM-tuner (great for the gym), voice recorder, replaceable battery, folders to organize tracks on the player, equalizers, shuffle functions, great ease of use, and on and on... And this player is plagued by the common Ipod problem - when the battery dies the player becomes a paperweight. Steve Jobs once said that the only thing flash players are good for are to sit unused in the back of drawers. Well, his company has made one that will fulfill that prophecy.

<Title>Deserves the 5 star rating, reviewing it for what it is
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No, it doesn't have a display. No, you couldn't get at 512 MB player with a display for $99. The Shuffle breaks new ground in flash memory players not only because it is an equisite player (you gotta hold one in your hand and be baffled at the big sound coming out of such a small piece of plastic), but because of what iTunes has done with it. The Autofill function is awesome, and perfect for what the Shuffle is. I didn't want to take my 40 Gig to the gym for fear of dropping it... the shuffle is fantastic for that. Plus, I can listen to audible books on it and quickly get to them by just starting at the beginning in non-shuffle mode.  This really is just a phenomenal product, and I haven't had any complaints... on the contrary, I'm surprised at everything that I can make it do without the screen. Seriously, I don't miss the screen with this thing. You won't either.  Small, light, inexpensive, impressive performance. What's not to like?

<Content>This is my FIRST time buying an Apple product.  Mainly because they are waaay too expensive.  But the Shuffle is great.  I use it mainly at the gym, or out running.  My Zen Xtra is way to big while lifting weights.  With this puppy, I don't feel like I'm carrying around a tape player that weighs like a brick.    I don't recommend if you're a hardcore music listener.  Casual music listeners/runners/weight lifters will love this.

<Content>This product is not revolutionary by any means as some people would have you believe. It's all hype. There simply are better flash based mp3 players that are equally as small. Have a display, great battery life, shuffle function, fm radio, voice recording, excellent sound quality, and look pretty, and have more codec support, but don't come with all the hype. Creative Muvo TX fm is priced similarly, small, and is much better in my opinion, and also prettier.Don't follow the sheep.

<Title>People Just Don't Get It!
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just because the Shuffle doesn't tailor to your standards doesn't mean it's going to be a failure. The Shuffle is the ideal mp3 player for the active user. When I go to the gym with my iPod mini, I still notice the weight in my pocket and the harddrive is subject to damage when I move. Also I never look at the screen. This is why I got the Shuffle. I don't need a screen BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW WHAT SONGS ARE IN MY MP3 PLAYER! And for 100 bucks you really can't go wrong.  Only Apple could pull off an idea of making the Shuffle's most obvious "weakness" (no screen) and turn it into it's main feature (Life is Random).

<Content>The shuffle works nicely.  Itune is not user friendly.  The battery dies after occasionl to moderate use for a little over 1 year.  What kind of battery do they put in the shuffle.  Normal Rechargeable battery last way longer than that, at least 2 to 3 years minimum.  For a great company and an expensive product, they sure know how to short-change the customer.  Horrible.  Yeah, I'm done with Apple.  That is why monopoly is not good for any company or business.

<Content>It should be 4 1/2 stars but I will give it the benefit of a doubt. I love it.  It is intuitive, very thoughtful and simply designed much like an Apple computer.  But sometimes it would be nice to have playlists or a viewer. 512 MB is about the maximum I would down load into one without the ability to quickly find what you want to hear. I have purchased 2 refurbished Shuffles with no problems for the last 2 years. Just remember to disconnect it the way the instructions tell you to.

<Title>A Poor Introduction to Apple Products
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's not much more to be said about this product.  It does what it advertises.  And with the newest iTunes, Windows support is better and not as completely annoying to install compared to a year ago.  But this cheap player doesn't really have much to offer.  You are locked into using iTunes to "organize your media" which is very annoying for Windows folks.  I guess this is "personal preference" as most people are willing to jump on the iTunes bandwagon.  Other than the software annoyances, the player itself really doesn't impress.  Battery life isn't that impressive compared to most other flash players.  From what I hear, the battery also dies within 1-2 years AND its not user-replaceable.  The biggest problem for most people is that there is no navigational display because Apple wanted to save money on manufacturing.  That's inexcusable.  The headphones that come with it are terrible and should be replaced immediately with something more comfortable/better sounding.    The manual and website are confusing even for the technologically inclined.  The website is terribly managed and you have to walk through several screens before getting to wherever you want to go if you're looking for technical support.  Don't expect to get much help there.  All-in-all, if you want to "look cool" and do the ipod thing, this isn't the player for you.  You probably will want an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EP4TWQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-4646271-3591145">iPod Nano</a> instead.  If you're a Windows user and you want a good, cheap mp3 player, save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one.  As cheap as it is, its not worth it.  iAudio makes some good cheap players that act as a USB Mass Storage device instead of using proprietary software, but you can also sync it with whatever as well.  Frankly, I don't know who this player appeals to.

<Content>The iPod Shuffle is really a pretty good value for $99. It is small, and to the point. You'll want this if you use the Apple iTunes Music store. If you don't, or aren't interested in trying it out, or are commited to a *shiver* Microsoft Windows Media store, then maybe look at other stuff too.   If you do like iTunes, however, the Shuffle is small enough to bring anywhere, and the added capability of using it as a 'jump drive' is very convenient.

<Title>sold out!!!!!
<Date>Tue Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was in the Apple Store on the first day of sales for the Ipod Shuffle.  I would say they were sold out in 5 minutes or less. Apple should have manufactured more of these before their release.  The Apple store I went to had maybe 50-80 Ipod Shuffles for sale. If you thought about the purchase for more than a 30 seconds --you most likely lost out. Most of the purchasers were previous Ipod owners who wanted something smaller/cheaper/more durable. A regular consumer had very little chance of getting an Ipod Shuffle. At least with the Ipod Mini they were in stores for the first few weeks.  The day wasn't a total loss however.  I purchased a Mac Mini with the 512mb memory upgrade which I am very happy about.   The employees did a great job of handling the 200+ crowd. After the first 1/2 hour it calmed down greatly.  Nice store + knowledgeable salespeople.

<Content>I understand Apple is trying to set a "random" list revolution with the Shuffle, and I've purchased one, but I realize there are many times I wish to be able to see how much further to go forward to play what I want.  I can't memorize a 100 song playlist.    I don't know where Apple is going with this, I'm going to return my Shuffle for a Sandisk 512, which is now lower in price and has a screen.  I don't know where Apple is going with this...I wouldn't buy a car without essential gauges and I'm certain you will find it cumbersome at times with the Shuffle.  I don't recommend this product.  I'm sure it has great margins for Apple though.  I need the screen, and you will find you will too.

<Content>I say that this mp3 is great, but only for some things.  I already have a 4th generation and ipod mini, but i bang them around a lot, so when i heard about this new one, i pounced on it.  People can complain about it not having a screen or a radio, but who cares, i never use the radios that i do have.  And as to it not having a screen, i know what songs i am putting on it, and i am only using it to practice for basketball with.  So to sum it all up, get this if you have a larger player, and want a smaller one that you can bang around more.   But if this is your first mp3, i would pass and get a different one.  Also the battery life is very good, i can easilly get about 18 hours out of it.  Overall great player!!

<Title>Superb replacement flash player and complement to iPod
<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the iPod Shuffle as a replacement to my flash player (256MB).  I have a 3rd gen iPod and use a flash player when jogging and at the gym, so my comments are from that perspective.  The lack of a display is not an issue for me, due to my usage of the player.  Prior to receiving and using the Shuffle, I was a bit concerned about the limited ability to navigate to different songs on the Shuffle and the shuffle aspect of the player.  However, after actually using it, I am sold on the shuffle aspect of the player.  Initially, I allowed iTunes to load the Shuffle randomly from my music library; but found that there are a lot of songs that I don't care to listen to when exercising.  So, I started loading songs using the 'drag-and-drop' method.  Once loaded, I switch the Shuffle to play random and I'm good to go !!  I'm only listening to songs I chose to begin with, so random is nice.  Although, playlists are nice; it is extra work to create them.  I left the player on all day yesterday to test the battery life and the battery charge light was still green after 8 hours.  This is the point at which my old flash player (powered by two rechargeable alkaline AA cells) would need a fresh pair of batteries.  As for the sound quality, it's excellent.  Just as good as my 3rd gen iPod and old flash player.  My only complaint about the design is that there is no 'reject' button.  Although the Shuffle has a 'next song' button, I can see the utility of a reject button in addition to the next song button that would mark the song for removal on the next sync with iTunes.  This would make removing songs that I did not want on the Shuffle easier and 'refreshing' it with new music from time-to-time easier.

<Content>This is a really awesome player.  Although it was a bit confusing at first, the iTunes iPod import software was very easy to use.  Comes with a full charge so you don't need to wait 4 hours to use it when you get it.  Extremely tiny!  it's even tinier than the ones in the pictures on the web.  I would say this is a little more than 2 inches tall.  Lanyard cap is very secure.  Left earbud doesn't fit very well, but still sounds great.    Overall, this thing is great.  The no screen is not a problem because unless you have thousands of songs, you should know all your song's titles.  Also, the shuffle feature is great.  It's full of surprises.  You never know what will come next.    A++ player.  This will set the benchmark for all over flash players to come.

<Content>Why do people buy bad products like the Shuffle and then try to justify their purchase with dumb reasons? I like to get my money's worth when I buy things, and to me a portable music player that has no display so you can't even skip to the song you want, is pretty close to worthless. I recommend the Sandisk 512 or 1GB MP3 players, or heck, ANY other Mp3 player that has a DISPLAY, as a better alternative.

<Content>I've had it for 2 weeks now and I love the shuffle.  Seems like most of it's critics are people that don't own it.  This is my first apple product.  The battery life is awesome.  You get 12 hours and most importantly, it's rechargable so you never have to buy AAA or AA batteries.  If you are the type of person that sits with your MP3 player to pick out each song, this is NOT for you.  If you are a person that likes MP3s as background music to other activities, then this is a GREAT low cost solution.  In some ways, it is actually superior to the original iPod.  It's got a better battery life, is smaller and is lighter.  Listen to people that have one, not other people that just seem to hate apple.

<Title>a nice intro to the world of iPod
<Date>Sat Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought one of these for my mom-ever since she saw my blue iPod mini, she's wanted an MP3 player that can hold a lot of music but is small enough for her to workout with.  So when I saw the shuffle at a store, I figured she'd want one. I was right, she did want one.  It looks really cool, it is about the size of your thumb and all.  I had to help with it as Mom works and all and is unfamiliar with MP3 players.  It has a few subtle differences from my mini, including its lack of display.  We had to get used to the Autofill option, that was something that did not pop up when I was learning how to use my mini.  One of the other major snags is that Media Player would not let my mom export her songs into iTunes-she has to redo her music library, which is a pain.  She does like the Shuffle, but I get the vibe that it will only have a constant use until Mom can get the necessary funds to get the green mini.  Overall, it was okay, but I really do like my mini iPod better, and so do my parents.  It was a good starting point, however, and excellent introduction to MP3 players for my parents.  My parents are not computer illiterate, they just haven't caught on to the MP3 player movement yet-they prefer playing Legends of Camelot, which was the other reason my mom likes the Shuffle-it charges while she plays Camelot.  I give it four stars because it is fairly easy to use, but not as nice as its bigger counterparts.

<Content>After having my friends whine on AOL and chats about how cool their new iPods  were they got around X-Mas,I felt cheated. I am a lover of MD and MP3CD. An iPod was not an option do to price and well...I saw this coming I guess. So patiently I ignored those Apple comercials with  U2 and dancers in black shadows.  And rant I did about how iPod doesn't have this or that my MD has or iTunes this and iTunes that for two years! Now finally with this lower price and average storage for my taste,I can say to my friends out there "look what I got!"  It's so tiny. My stick of gum looked big. But it's really slick to use. I put nearly a day and a half MP3's and simular files together for my meditation rutines,and it played for almost a day! I do wish it had more power. iPods lack this feature. They should look into 56 and 72 hour playback like HI-MD then I'd rave more. Sadly too my Realmedia files were useless too! Made me a little nervous,but it still plays most formats. For the price you can get two,but well..iPod is that price isn't it? I'm enjoying using this player it's cute. Apple just look into the battery issue and make peace with Real,that issue is just pitiful.

<Title>PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the worst and I mean WORST Apple product I have ever used! I bought one with my money because I was replacing my dead 3rd Generation iPod. I liked how small it was, and since I only needed 512 MB, it was a good buy for $99 in May 2006. But then only a month later, I was listening to it on the bus and it died suddenly. It wouldn't turn on, but Apple gave me a new shuffle. Once again it died and it wouldn't come back to life. I got a pink nano for Christmas and that is way better than this piece of trash. I don't reccommend this iPod to anyone!

<Title>This iPod is overrated.
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPods are a great line of music players, and I respect that. Sadly though, I was anything but impressed with this iPod. Apple tries to trick people saying "Oh yeah, random is the new order." Anybody who's smart knows that they just said that [...] as an excuse for no display. This would be a great flash-based MP3 player if only they had a display! It's so annoying when you put an album on your iPod, find out about a song you like and then want to know who does it. Then you look down and say "Oh, silly me. I forgot! I don't have display! But that's alright...random is the new order!" Even the new iPod shuffles don't have displays. The iPod shuffle though, is a pretty good player overall. The battery life is decent and the iTunes software is incredibly easy to use. The ear buds have very good quality, and the unit itself is very easy to use. It doesn't need batteries either, but this can also be a con, because it means once your lithium-ion battery dies, then you have to either buy a new iPod or pay [...] to replace it! A radio would have been nice, along with a voice recorder and equalizers. 2 of my family members have Scandisk Sansa M230s that have these features and cost only [...]. The iPod is a great player, but consider other brands as well. Also, I filled this thing up in an hour (not kidding). I get bored of music pretty quickly, and this thing can only hold 12 albums. If I could go back now, I would definitely go for a 30 GB video.

<Content>It does exactly what it says it does (thus 5 stars) but IMO get a Nano instead as it's only slightly more expensive, has many more features yet still gives you the same shuffle feature.  This is a great answer for your parents or grandparents though who want to listen to music while they take their morning jog or walk though because it really is easy to use.

<Title>Ka-Put!
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this two Christmas's ago.  Even though iTunes can be temperamental I loved having this! I primarily used it when I went to work out.  One day, I'm at the gym and I turned it off for a couple minutes to talk to someone.  I go to turn it back on and two lights just flash back and forth.  Then iTunes doesn't even recognize it! It says it needs to be restored.  So I clicked "restore" and then it says it's unable to restore due to an "unknown error."  I look into sending it to Apple to get it fixed but it would cost as much to buy a new one as it would to get it fixed!  I just couldn't believe it was go kaput just like that.  Not to mention Apple's has the worst navigation on it's website.. you have to click through seven pages just to get a simple question answered!

And thats not the only thing before the battery died the ipod would only allow the headphones to play on one earphone.My parents thought it was the headphones..so we bought a new pair after a while it doesnt work again.I'm planning on returning this piece of junk pretty soon and I've been looking at some ipod nanos.Those look better.

<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Aside from having the iPod name, this thing is nothing like it's parent-product.  No screen, not as easily usable.  If you're interested in finding a specific song on your iPod Shuffle, it'll be pretty difficult unless you know your list pretty well.  I'd consider getting the SanDisk 512 Mb (or 1 Gb) Embedded MP3 player instead.  It costs the same, has a screen, FM tuner, and voice recorder.  A much added bonus is that it doesn't use proprietary software (ie iTunes).  Just plug it in and drag and drop your mp3s.

<Title>A great intro into the IPOD world!  
<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Shuffle for a few days, and I love it.  I've thought about an IPOD for over a year now, but I couldn't justify the cost.  Under $100, this is easy to justify, and of course, I can already see how it's going to fill up too easily.  That just makes me want to also get a 20 GB IPOD to hold all my music, and keep this one to work out with.  I personally love the shuffle feature.  I don't care that you don't have a screen, because the simplicity of the thing is really beautiful in this day of complicated user manuals.  This is one of the few truly plug and play products I've bought in the past few years.   This is not ideal for a real techy, unless they have a larger IPOD and just want an additional tiny thing for working out (it truly is the size of a pack of gum!).  It is an ideal gift for someone's parent, pre-teen, or anyone who is not terribly techy, because it is so incredibly intuitive.  ITUNES is also awesome in that regard - easy, easy, easy.   Basically, this ipod shuffle satisfies a particular niche for Apple, to get the non-techies hooked as well.

<Title>The Shuffle is a good introduction to the iPod world.
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been eyeing the hard drive-based iPods for a while now. Although they are fabulous products, I haven't (yet) been able to justify the $299 price. Also, since I'd mostly use an iPod while riding my bike, I was concerned about dropping it.  So, when the solid state $99 Shuffle arrived onto the scene, I considered this would be a good introduction to the iPod. Plus, its price is only a little more than a data-only USB flash drive. I could use the Shuffle for both music and data, I reasoned.  I'm rather impressed with the operation and sound quality of my Shuffle. The size is perfect for popping it into my pocket while I'm out on my bike, and I don't have to worry about breaking it. The Shuffle works elegantly with iTunes, and the battery is long lasting. I like how easy it is to recharge:  just plug the Shuffle into your USB keyboard.  My only significant criticism is that the three-position sliding switch does not have clear detent positions. It's too easy to slide the switch from "Off" to "Shuffle," bypasing the center "Play in Order" position.  Two interesting things have happened since I've owned the Shuffle. Wearing the white earbuds prompts "thumbs up" signs and smiles from strangers -- and now I'm more inclined to buy the 20 gigabtye iPod. Apple has devised some way to make its products addictive.

<Title>Good entry-level iPod
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the first Apple MP3 player that I've purchased.   I was drawn to it by it's size, simplicity and cost.  I don't need the LCD display or any complex controls since I'll be using it while motorcycling and with my limited song library, I figured the 512MB will be plenty for the tunes I may want to carry with me. PROS: I haven't tried the included Apple earbuds yet, but find that this small unit (about the size of a pack of gum) has extraordinary sound when coupled with my Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones.  The iTunes software (included) is easy to use and the online store has an immense library. CONS: The only fault I can find with this player so far is that I find the on/off switch to be difficult to use.  It's just a slider on the rear of the unit and I wish that some form of finger-grip was built into it. ALL-IN-ALL: I'm so impressed with the sound quality that I'm already thinking about the 1GB version (or a regular iPod). You can't beat the deal for the price!

<Content>If you absolutely need to look for a particular song you want to hear, then this is not for you. I have a 4G iPod (with view window) and I never even look at it except to find a playlist. Then I put the thing away and zone out. With a Shuffle, you set up your playlist and load. You can play through the list or random play your music. Of course there are always people who stare at their big iPods all the while, looking for specific songs to play, rotating the wheel all over the place and burning up precious energy. Set up your playlists the way you want to hear your songs on iTunes on your computer, load and you'll be good to go!   Woof, the lights and buttons and switch takes some getting use to...  If you're wondering whether to get the 512 or the 1gig... I don't know if I'd ever listen to 1 gig of music in one sitting before the juice runs out... Believe me, you can get an awful lot of music onto a 512. However if you're also thinking of using the device for file transfers, then the 1 gig would serve both purposes well.   A very excellent 2nd iPod for traveling light. And also easy to lose!

<Title>Simply Awesome, but Not For All
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yesterday I purchased my first MP3 player, the iPod Shuffle. I was extremely excited about this purchase, and when I got it home, opened up the fancy green and white packaging quickly. The minute I saw the size of it, I was amazed. In many pictures and advertisement, the size of the iPod shuffle seems a bit bigger. Its not, Amazingly light and thin, I was perplexed of how music and complex music files could fit into it. I read the little cheat card that comes with the packaging, got myself familiar with the device and got readt to plug it in. I have an iBook G3 laptop Paris 2004 LE edition, and along with the iMac/eMac(some models), it has a plastic 'case' for embelishment. Now the whole point of the iPod Shuffle is that its plug and play, you are able to stick it into your USB port, autofill from iTunes and go listening for up to 17 hours.(thats how long it went for me, Apple underestimates their products battery life) But because of the plastic casing around my laptop, there was no way for me to stick my little buddy iPod Shuffle into my main computer, and only computer with iTunes. Disappointed, I headed over to the Apple Store to pick up the dock, and that flashy sports case. The store, to my amazment, was jam-packed. There were two more iPod shuffles at the counter, and people were fighting to get to them.  I looked around and found one of the helpful employees there. They did not have the docks, or cases. Instead I got a USB re-direction port, just a cord with a USB port and a USB plug, so I could Shuffle. Its a simple problem with a simple solution, but Apple should consider the many thousand people who still have their older products. Just because a company evolves, doesn't mean that all of their customers will upgrade. When I finally got my iPod Shuffle hooked up to my laptop, iTunes quickly filled it up with the 123 (perfect for the product) songs on my library. Autofill is an amazing new feature to iTunes, and its very nice how the iPod can update itself, and not re-load songs onto itself. When I put the earbuds in, and turned the little rectangle on, I was amazed at the sound it had. It sounded just as good as by Bose sound system downstairs. The sound quality is awesome, and some mediocre songs sound fantastic on it. Some new, more comfortable earphones, and your ready to go. Some people here complain about the lack of LCD, well Apple was trying to reach a more leanient part of their customers. I, and I assume many others, listen to their songs in iTunes on the Party Shuffle mode. The price is very nice, and there was no way I was going to buy another iPod for the ridiculous $300 they were expecting. Some people are not as money safe as I, but many are. Apple iPod Shuffle is your own private Radio station on the go, with only the songs you want and the choice to skip a song. Many mention the difficulty that is brought up when trying to find a song. The whole point is not to find a specific song, but to mix it up. Also, a big up for this iPod is the motion. Shuffle, is no skip, unlike the other iPods where if you shake it a bit, the music goes crazy. You can do all the crazy moves the people do in the Shuffle commercial and it wont skip even once. Overall, this little baby is for those who are fine with not knowing whats coming next, and not knowing what their listening to. And who needs a voice recorder, FM radio and other things in their MP3? Their just useless add-ons to a music player. Overall, iPod Shuffle is for people OK with not knowing what's coming, athletes, and people with few favorite songs. I recommend this product to those kind of people. Happy Shuffling

<Title>Yes, yes, a triumph of design
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's true.  This is another brilliant Apple product.  I ordered one for my wife and it finally came this last week.   Kind of like the regular iPod, the Shuffle is hard to quantify.  I mean, it's just not that easy to explain why this product is better than comparably priced mp3 players with screens and Napster compatibility.  But holding that little, tiny thing in your hand is cool, and that's always tough to beat.  The software for iTunes that comes with this is easy to use, and if you take the time to line all the songs up you can get what you want, but that kind of seems to defeat the whole shuffle idea.  I definitely prefer mine with a screen.    I haven't figured out any way to gauge the battery life, and if you have an older computer without a USB 2.0 port you will need to buy a power adapter.   I would recommend this for someone who likes the iTunes model over Napster's and doesn't want to spend a lot of money on their MP3 player.  It's also a way to get a fun little piece of Apple cachet for $100.

<Title>Apple has the MP3 player market sewn up, top to bottom
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My first impression was not about how small the iPod shuffle is (plenty of MP3 players are small), but how light. When it's in a pocket or bag or around your neck, you just don't notice it's there (which will, I'm sure, lead to many people losing their iPod shuffles, or having them stolen, and not finding out till much later). It is, I expect, the lightest way to carry around 120-150 songs that has ever existed.  Like online columnist James Lileks, I've found the iPod shuffle experience educational. He wrote that, "when you have 10,000 songs you are always compelled to see what's next, whether it's better than this. When you have 100 songs, and A) have no idea what comes next and B) haven't heard 60 of them in a long long time, if ever, you tend to listen."  The lack of a screen is fine in most circumstances, if you're just listening as you would to the radio or a CD changer. But it can be a pain if you're trying to find a specific track, or move on to the next album in a set, or simply figure out what that song you never knew you had is called when you're away from the computer. Still, it prods you to enjoy the music rather than analyze it.  What's most striking, after you've used it a bit, is the iPod shuffle's minimalism. Apple obviously spent considerable time and effort figuring out what to take away, rather than what to add, and how to make the remaining stripped-down essentials as easy and basic as possible. Here is everything you can do with it when it's not plugged into a computer:  * Turn it off. * Switch it to regular play. * Switch it to shuffle play. * Check the battery status. * Plug or unplug headphones (or another audio line for the 1/8" jack). * Start music playing. * Pause music playing. * Lock the front-panel controls (so they don't press accidentally), or unlock them. * Go back the beginning of the list of tracks. * Skip to the next track. * Start the track over, or skip to the previous one. * Fast forward or rewind (in choppy increments). * Raise or lower the volume. * Remove the end cap, to pop on the lanyard cap, or to plug the iPod in.  I don't think I missed anything. And neither did Apple.  But that last task is the key. Besides the shuffle's appearance and good sound, its ability to plug in and synchronize with iTunes is what makes it an iPod. That's regardless of whether you buy songs from Apple's store, which I don't, or just use files ripped from your album collection, or those you make with GarageBand, or whatever. Much of the intelligence and power of the iPod brand--more than I realized, especially for this model--comes from that piece of software. Little touches make a huge difference, like the ability to transcode tracks to good-quality 128�kbps AAC files if they are stored at a higher, larger-file-size bitrate--or in an incompatible format--on your computer.  My previous MP3 player is nearly as small, and almost as light, and it has a screen (see photo). But it is profoundly inferior: it doesn't work seamlessly with iTunes, its interface and appearance are clunky, it has been a bit flaky since I first got it, and over time firmware upgrades have actually worsened its performance, even degrading the sound quality significantly. Plus it holds many fewer songs, and was more expensive. I speculated that Apple would own the entire MP3 player market after the shuffle was introduced. Now that I own one, I'm sure of it.  Here's a tip: If you use the Autofill feature of iTunes with an iPod shuffle, set it to pick from a Smart Playlist that excludes stuff you don't want to take along. My "Mostly Rock" list, for example, is set so that it contains only songs where the Genre does not include terms such as Christmas, Spoken Word, Children's, Holiday, and Sound Effects, among others.

I have a creative MUVO player that palyed some mp3 songs downloaded from the internet with no problem but when I used ipod Shuffle it won't work no matter how hard I tried. It may work with CD which I didn't need in my case, my view about this is that Apple want you to buy songs from iTunes so all  apple ipod players are rigid as far downloading different format from the internet If it palys any at all.  Bottom line If you bought ipod shuffle to play songs from the Internet you just wasted your money for nothing!

Charging this iPod by computer is easy, but my friend wouldn't know how so I also bought her a small speaker system with docking (charging) capabilities. A supplied AC DC charging plug would have been nice, but didn't come with the iPod. Bottom line: great little system with very decent sound at a very affordable price!

<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I purchased my iPod Shuffle, I learned that once the battery dies it costs $10 less than a new iPod Shuffle to get the battery replaced.  So this product is basically disposable--once the battery dies, you get a new one.  Also, the headphones are permanently connected, so you can't use your own headphones.  Other than that it's great.

<Title>Software iTunes, not mp3
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great product, but I need to gripe about the iTunes software interface, it's not stable. If you are new to mp3s, then you will have little difficulty converting your music CDs into the apple format... But if you already have mp3s, you'll need to convert it to the apple format to play on the shuffle. Battery life is great. Earbuds are low quality. There is also little bass response. Controls and functions are limited. Wished there was an equalizer to boost bass response, as well as LCD display screen, you can buy a regular mp3 player with these features for much less.

<Title>awful product
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This shuffle is awful.  The first time we had a problem with it our computer wouldn't regonize it and we ended up getting a replaced.  Now the shuffle doesn't let the head phones work except for one ear, we thought it was the headphones and bought new ones but the same thing continues to happen.  You are better getting the newer model in hopes they have figured out the problems with the first one.

<Title>Surprisingly disappointed
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I thought Apple was an oasis of ingenuity and performance in a world captured by the mediocrity of Microsoft. I was wrong. I had problems right out of the box. First off, the unit would not fit into my USB port and the package did not include a extension cord. In my humble opinion, a piece of equipment that is required in order for my shuffle to work should NOT be an accessory. All other players such as MPIO and IRiver include this equipment. Secondly, the software was painfully slow and never recognized the player. I installed and re-installed the software twice with no luck. And I thought this was Apple's strongpoint.   I've never had these problems with other manufacturers and this trashy product is going right back to where I bought it. This experience helps me to realize why Apple never made it big. I never thought I'd say this but "Thank the Heavens for Microsoft".  P.S. The previous reviewer was right. The switch in back is poorly designed and needs a textured surface to grip your thumb while you switch modes. Excuse me Apple but DAAA!!! Have any of you guys ever used your products??? Get out of your ivory towers and figure out how to design a world-class product!!!  Long live Microsoft!

<Title>Great for Sports!
<Date>Tue Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Lots of people have complained about the lack of LCD screen and other features.  But the simplicity of the unit is one of the most appealing things for me.  The lack of an LCD screen is great for those of us who like to run and bike with music and have dropped/broken other portable electronics over the years.  What you give up in features with the ipod shuffle are made up in the simplicity, durability, and smallness.  You can't beat the ipod shuffle for running or biking, you can't even tell it is there it's so light and small!  I would highly recommend this mp3 player to anyone looking for a unit for sporting activities.  If you're looking for a jukebox with all the bells and whistles, then this mp3 player is not for you.  I agree with other reviews that charging and transfering music is easy with iTunes and the sound quality is great.  I also agree that the head phones suck!   Overall, a great player for athletes!

<Title>The iCult has gone far enough
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was never a real big fan of the iPod. Many say it's just because I cannot save 300 bucks to buy one of them. I personally would not want to make such a stupid move as that. The iPod is nothing more than a white plastic fad that will come and go just like many other gizmos of our past (i.e. Tamagachi, Mini CD players, etc.). Personally, I think the iPod Shuffle proves the point that this iPod business is nothing more than a costly cult.  I actually took some time out of my life to try the iPod Shuffle, and I wasn't surprised. It is an overpriced jump drive. For those who do not know what a jump drive is, a jump drive is a USB "key" storage device that can be directly plugged into a USB port to save data and other things. Realistically, the iPod Shuffle does not differ from other USB key players out there (i.e. Ridata OLE3000 MP3 USB Pen Drive WITH DISPLAY, Apacer AS820 MP3 USB Pen Drive WITH DISPLAY AND LINE IN, Transcend JetFlash MP3 USB Player with DISPLAY AND LINE IN, etc.) Keep in mind that the models that I just listed are just as small, if not smaller, than the iPod Shuffle with the DAMN LCD included. They also have those in White if you desire that color.  Let's talk about the most important part of the player; it's battery life. Most of the iPod's listed before had mediocre at-best battery lives (8 to 16 hours compared to others clocking at 32 or higher). This averages at around 12 hours of battery time. Of course, there are several other USB MP3 players that clock higher play times, even though some of them may use a AAA battery to operate. All-in-all, the battery specifications and performance of the iPod shuffle is satisfactory.  The audio quality of the iPod is nothing special. I could never understand why most people would get the iPod based on its audio quality when there are so many other players that can much better audio quality on all fronts. The iPod shuffle is no exception to this paradox. All of the iPods use a SigmaTel Audio processing unit to process the sound, which is alright for a portable device, but doesn't really product great sound like the Creative Zen or iRiver MP3 players. The chipset is also supposed to have bass and treble control, but this iPod locked that capability because of the lack of screen, meaning that your music is going to sound a little better than flat most of the time. The only way to set it is through iTunes, but that still shows its crippling dependency on the computer.  In order to do ANYTHING on this thing, you need a computer. It pretty much has no purpose other than looking pretty without a computer to connect to.   The iPod shuffle, in my opinion, is a worthless buy and the money can be spent accordingly elsewhere.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have never owned an Mp3 player before but because of the low price I decided to buy this one on valentines day. I think the product is great and the sound is great. I hooked it up to my car stero (with an accessory) and transfered all my cds to it. As far as not having a screen, I think that it is not a big deal. If you just put your songs on it in the order you want them why do you need a screen?  I love it and find it easy to use. If you want something simple, small, and easy to use this is for you. Where else can you get an Mp3 player that has 512mb for $99?

<Title>Almost perfect ... almost.
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you don't have an iPod or another MP3 player, this is a pretty good choice for people on a budget. That said, there's just no excuse for Apple not putting a little LCD display on the iPod shuffle so you can see what you're playing and so you can have more control options.  Yes, it's VERY compact, yes the "shuffle" concept is great, but at the end of the day a good MP3 player needs a display. Don't get me wrong. I'm still happy my wonderful wife got me an iPod shuffle ... it's a great MP3 player and it certainly makes work and workouts easier, but Apple should have done a better job with product design. I mean, come on, it's from Apple ... the leaders of cool!

<Title>You can't go wrong for 99 bucks....
<Date>Mon Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the 512MB Shuffle a few days ago (finally)....After waiting for 4 weeks for Apple to ship it....It is great for what it is....A small, cheap MP3 player that you can take anywhere, and uses the great iPod software....It is good for places and activities that you would be afraid to take a regular iPod...The whole point is that it is cheap enough to be expendable....Get a regular iPod, add case, extended warranty, tax etc. and all of a sudden you are talking 400 or 500 bucks.. At that price, you are not going to be taking it to the gym, out in the snow or rain, throwing it in a backpack with other items etc..This you can..It's 99 bucks and small...No need for a case, an arm band, an extended warranty (because of the poor quality of the iPod battery).You can take the Shuffle anywhere, wear it under a coat in foul weather, let it receive bumps and bruises...If the battery dies in 3 years, then so what! It cost you 33 bucks a year....The Shuffle does sound great, and the software for it is nice and simple....Other MP3 players may have an LCD screen, a microphone, radio etc. but their software is not going to be as easy to use as the iPod software which takes only an hour or two to get the hang of....A tiny LCD screen is probably going to be more hassle than its worth....And the whole point is for the Shuffle to be simple and inexpensive....Something to take to the gym or work....You are not going to be taking it on a trip to Antarctica, or storing your whole music library on it, all cross-referenced... That's what a regular iPod for! The Shuffle is for environments where you wouldn't take a regular iPod....It only takes a couple of minutes to install your music on the Shuffle...You can play the songs in order, and skip to the next song in the list...You don't need an LCD for 100 songs that you choose to download to the Shuffle....The only drawbacks that I have found to the Shuffle is it can be easy to lose the cap and lanyard when the iPod is plugged into the computer....The ear buds sound great but are uncomfortable....The Shuffle might not be ideal for audio books that are one, single file....If you go to another song, you will lose your place in the audio book, and the fast forward feature on the Shuffle doesn't go too fast....Do you want to wade through an hour or three of narration until you get back to the right spot on the audio book? I also bought the 30 dollar optional Dock for the Shuffle. I didn't want to be plugging and unplugging into my computer's USB port 10 times every week....The connector on the Shuffle sticks out and looks easy to break off....It is easier and safer to plug and unplug it from the optional Dock instead...It provides a place for the Shuffle to stand, and charge....And I don't like plugging and unplugging something into my 2,000 dollar computer every day....If something is going to break, it will be the 30 dollar Dock, not the USB port on my computer.....

If you complain about the LCD not being there, (hate to say it) but you probably haven't worked out a day in your life. Who fiddles with a tiny screen while they are on a treadmill? Honestly, who needs a LCD if you're actually busy doing something productive? If you need one, suck it up and buy a hard drive based mp3 player. Don't be cheap. Quit complaining.

<Title>The latest news about iPod family
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>**** LATEST update to iPod family **** - iPod & iPod photo lines merged; no more iPod photo 30 GB - iPod comes in two capacities - 20 GB ($299), 60 GB ($399) with color screen & photo support - U2 iPod (20 GB) down to $329 from $349 - with color screen & photo support - iPod shuffle 1 GB down to $129 from $149 - iPod 60 GB down to $399 from $449 - new version of iTunes (4.9) that support podcasts *************************************** This is not a review of iPod shuffle as such - great reviews are available already.  Here is some information that might help in deciding which iPod to go for.  Apple announced a major upgrade to the iPod lineup today (23 Feb 2005).  The biggest advantage is the reduction in price ($ per GB) and improvement in battery life. Another significant change is that USB 2.0 is being emphasized although FireWire continues to be supported. AC adapter is USB based instead of FireWIre and the FireWire based AC adapter still sells as a separate product.   The impact on iPod mini:  > A new model, iPod mini 6 GB is introduced for $249  > iPod mini 4 GB now priced at $199 ($50 down from earlier price)  > Change in colors - now mini is available in new shades of Silver, Blue, Pink, and Green (the Gold color is discontinued)  > Major improvement in battery life - up to 18 hours (was 8 hours earlier)  > AC adapter ($29) and firewire cable ($19) no longer shipped with mini (have to be bought seperately if you really need)  > iPod mini 4 GB and 6 GB now ship with only three things: earphones, belt clip, and USB 2.0 cable > The indicators on the click wheel now match the color of the iPod mini  The impact on bigger iPods:  > iPod 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 30 GB (new product) replaces the 40 GB iPod photo and the regular iPod 40 GB  > iPod photo 60 GB now costs $150 less -- $449 instead of $599  > iPod photo 30 GB costs $349 ($150 less than iPod photo 40 GB and $50 less than regular iPod 40 GB)  > iPod dock ($39), AV cable ($19), carrying case ($29), and firewire cable ($19) do not ship with iPod photo (you may not really need them)  > Now we get three things with iPod photo: earphones, USB based AC adapter, USB 2.0 cable > In additon to the above, a firewire cable continues to ship with iPod 20 GB & iPod U2 edition > iPod photo Camera Connector is introduced - this can be used for connecting your digital camera directly to the iPod   With these changes, there is an interesting $50 gap between:  > iPod 20 GB and iPod photo 30 GB  > iPod mini 6 GB and iPod 20 GB (as earlier)  > iPod mini 4 GB and iPod mini 6 GB  > iPod shuffle 1 GB and iPod mini 4 GB  > iPod shuffle 512 MB and iPod shuffle 1 GB (as earlier)   Price, size, weight, and ease of use are major considerations while buying an iPod shuffle.  If price is the only factor, iPod mini could be a better choice over shuffle.  I have all the models of iPod (shuffle, mini, regular 40 GB, and photo 60 GB) and I find myself sticking to the iPod photo 60 GB since it carries all my music and has a better, color-based user interface.

<Content>At $99.00 it's a great price for this 512MB unit. I was not in the market to spend $300.00-$400.00 for the regular Ipod. I was really impressed with the sound quality of this little unit. I use it while I run and on the train to work.  Pros-  Price        Sound Quality        Compaq size (pack of gum)        Ease of use        Can also be used to store data  Cons- Earphones are uncomfortable/fall off.       On/Off button is flush (sometimes hard to use)       No Display (not an issue for me)       Playback is either sequential or shuffle mode.  So it's the perfect device for working out, traveling, etc. Obviously if the Display is a must have, or your looking to transfer your entire music collection, the regular Ipod is the way to go. (Shuffle holds about 120 Songs)

<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>yes, for 99 bucks the ipod shuffles does seem like a steal, but apple needs to stop portraying their products as simply 'disposable'.  E-waste is a serious issue and the fact that apple continues to produce and create new ipods that have irreplaceble batteries is not helping.    it is not ok that if your ipod dies, u can simply throw it away and purchase a new one "for only $99."  it does not make sense that apple charges you to replace the battery, nor does it make sense that they charge you if you want your ipod 'properly disposed of'.    please visit this site and learn how you can help: www.badapple.biz  i agree, apple is producing some of the coolest products ever, but why cant they do so while taking the problem of e-waste into consideration?

Tech support was no help, and neither was the website.  :(     So, now I'm shopping again.  I will definitely NOT buy another Apple/IPOD product.

<Title>Great sound; decent form factor; minor issues
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 512 in mid-January 2006 when I got tired of waiting for the rumored new Shuffle that didn't come until, well, this week. Now I'll give my current one to my wife and get a new one. But I've enjoyed the original shuffle, though it has some minor problems.  First, the sound is very good. I encode my CDs in all AAC files due to the fact that I think the sound is better than the MP3 or other format. I also encode at the highest rate possible. I still have room for about 45-50 songs on the 512 shuffle. I thought before I bought it I might also use it as a thumb drive, but I haven't for various reasons. The main (really only) use I have for this is while jogging. It works very well for that, though you likely will need an accessory to hold it. That's one of the minor issues that looks to be corrected with the new model.  Another issue is the location of the off/on(play in order)/play shuffle switch on the back. I like the idea of the slider, but its directly behind the other controls. That creats a problem when trying to turn it off with one hand while attached to a belt clip. You can do it, but often you will inadvertantly hit a control as well. Its not a huge problem, though. Likewise, the size of the unit clipped on a belt forces some people to move it around their waist as it sticks straight up. Its going to stick into even the flattest stomachs!  I still like the unit and would buy it again. Forget the lack of a display. If you want that, get the Nano. The purpose of this unit is to shift through 40-100 songs or other files (depending on encoding format) while you are active, whether jogging, walking, going to/from school or work, etc. For that purpose, its great. Even greater if you don't need to clip it on yourself.

<Content>I cannot exercise without it.  It is soo addicting.  However the play pause button died on me about a month ago.  But I loved it so much that I used the previous/next button to play songs.  Now that died too.  Can't play anything.  Im sending mine in as I write this.  Oh the how technology is a double edged sword.

<Content>This dandy little unit has helped me loose about 35 lbs, and get me in the best shape in 20 years....  Hop on the good 'ol elleptical and just crank up the sound and the time just flies.... Better earphones really help get rid of the tinny noise that comes with the ones supplied. Also, with the cartrige addapter, we can get good quality sound on things we really like to hear while driving. For seventy bucks, I give this product an A+

<Title>suits my needs just fine!
<Date>Sun Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Ipod Shuffle. Sure, it doesn't have a display, and sure it "only" fits 100-120 songs, but it gets the job done.   All I needed in a MP3 player was music, and the Shuffle fits the bill perfectly. The sound is great, the storage size is fine by me, it's so light and compact you can fit it into any pocket or purse, and it's user friendly. Love that. Additionally, because it doesn't operate on batteries (rather a charge from your computer) it's got a play-back life of FOREVER. I use mine at least 1-2 hours daily, and I only need to charge it once every couple weeks. It's SO nice not having to worry about batteries!  The only thing that could make it better was if it came with an arm band. Working out with the shuffle is a bit of a pain... If I felt so inspired, I'm sure I could buy an armband off [...] for some astronomical fee, though.  All in all, a great little tool. Very basic, NO bells or whistles, but it gets the job done.

<Title>HORRIBLE SOFTWARE!
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had several problems with the iPod, mostly because of its horrible software iTunes. It messed up the firmware on the device several times, it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes.  The most horrible thing however was that it would mess up your MP3 music collection in a way that can never be undone. I had orgaized my collection in the file system nicely by genre, author, album etc, and this thing messed up everything. I have another mp3 player - iRiver - which I reccommend as a lot better than the iPod anyway - and I wanted to be able to copy things on it from my library. Now i am not able to and have to go back and re-organize the mess manually!.  I do not recommend the iPod and I do not recommend using their software either.

<Title>Perfect workout companion
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I needed an easy to use, lightweight mp3 player for working out at the gym and jogging, and the shuffle is just perfect for that. Its buttons are the easiest to navigate without looking. It's super light and feels like nothing in your pocket when running.  Instead of giving a full review and repeating everyone else's comments, I'll just list off some tips and features (both cool and annoying). In no particular order...  - iTunes is a big part of the package. The shuffle is a real simple machine, but iTunes is what makes it great. Once you have cleaned up your library and rated songs properly, etc, use smart playlists and autofill to fill your shuffle. You'll get a good enough variety of songs on there to last a week of workouts, jogs, and commutes. You can edit what autofill puts in your shuffle if you're not happy. - Set your shuffle as a source in iTunes and you can put songs on it without it plugged in. Then plug in the shuffle and walk away while it's synch'ing and charging. - The indicator lights can be confusing when it's plugged in. It will indicate activity instead of charging progress if the OS sees it as a mass storage device. After you're done filling it, if you're in Windows, go into Windows Explorer and right click on the shuffle's drive to eject it. The lights will now indicate charge progress and will be continuous amber until charged. - There is a real shortage of good accessories right now. Both the weatherproof sport case and the armband are very hard to get (2 month wait). And what most active people really need is a hybrid of the two: a waterproof case that's an armband. It doesn't exist yet. - The slider switch on the back can be hard to use sometimes because it's flush with the body. - Pressing the big button for 3 seconds for hold/unhold isn't quite practical. It is also easy to bump a button when it's not in hold. - Pressing the play button 3 times in continuous play will start the play from the first track. This is useful when you want only up-tempo tunes for working out. Place your workout songs at the beginning of your playlist for use in continuous mode and you can use shuffle mode during your commute, shopping, etc.

<Title>Nice Flash Player
<Date>Fri Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>With my iPod 20GB not currently funtioning and not under warrenty, I decided to indulge myself in the iPod Shuffle as a stopgap between my old iPod and a potentially new iPod.  I really didn't have high expectations for the shuffle, as I thought it was still relatively overpriced for what it had to offer, without the LCD screen, and whatnot.  Boy, was I wrong.  I cracked open the shuffle, and immediately started charging my shuffle and at the same time, I was able to load my songs from my iTunes into my shuffle.  This means that if you have any experience with an iPod or even iTunes at all, you should have absolutely no trouble with the shuffle, as it's basically the same thing.  The shuffle also gives you the option to automatically update, or manually update.  With 14 GB of music on my computer, I choose the 'Manual Update' option of updating my songs, and I drag playlists (created through iTunes) into my shuffle while charging, and once done, I just take it with me wherever I go.  The nuances of the shuffle may annoy people, such as the  shuffling of music or the lack of an LCD screen.  I honestly have no need for an LCD screen because I pretty much know all of my music, and if I had the screen, would probably just browse to my favorites all at once.  And to quell a lot of people's fears of the shuffle, you can actually set playlists and drag them into your shuffle, and keep your playlists playing in order.  The shuffle just randomizes your music, not something I do, but I know people love doing it.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase so far, and enjoy the shuffle far more than my iPod, when it did function.  I mean, do you really need 4,500 songs with you at once when you can just upload maybe 150 with you for a day, and update which songs you want on your shuffle for the next day?  I would reccomend the shuffle to anyone.  If you absolutely have an inherent need an LCD screen, then I would not reccomend this to you, but otherwise, I'm not going back to my iPod because of this small wonder.

<Title>Frustrating Software Isues
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple make a big song & dance about ease of use but I found it just wouldn't register with ITunes on our Mac, despite endless messing about with IPod Updates. At each point it would just silently fail to work or occasionally provide a cryptic error such as "Failed to update IPod Shuffle. (2)". Gee, thanks Apple.  Ironically, it communicates fine with a PC. Once the songs are finally on the device, it works OK.

<Title>Miss or KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid)?
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let's start with the major negative. You already know it just by looking: No screen. You can't see the song you're listening to, you can't quickly find the song you want, you can't look at the clock. It was definitely a risky move by Apple. I'd like to say it doesn't bother me, but it does. I would like to have a screen.  Let's move on for now; we'll get back to the negatives later.  The first thing I thought when I saw the Shuffle was, "It's that small? I could keep that in my pocket all the time." It's truly shocking how small the thing is. I am in awe of the whole thing: An amazingly player with about 16 hours of battery life (my measurement), superb sound (at least as good as the other iPods), and a 512 MB memory that I can use to carry my work from computer to computer.  Let's look at the Shuffle's benefits compared to other flash players: size and convenience. First the size. It's almost half the size and weight of the smallest other flash player. That means it can be a permanent part of your daily life. The second factor is convenience. With other flash players, you can expect to carry around a black usb cord to connect the player to the computer. Take it from me: It's annoying. Apple was able to include the usb attachment on the Shuffle because the Shuffle is so small. That means no cord. Just slip your little Shuffle into your pocket and go. With other players, you need to take a player at least twice as big PLUS a cord. Not so easy.  Back to the negatives now. The Shuffle also lacks a voice recorder. Apparently, a great deal of people spend their time recording conversations. I never have recorded from my other MP3 player, but I should probably start being careful of what I say. This might be an important consideration for some people, particularly spies and the ilk, but I see no need for it.  The other feature the Shuffle lacks is a radio. I wouldn't mind a radio on the Shuffle so I could listen to the TV programs at the gym (they broadcast the sound on unused FM spectrum). I don't understand why Apple doesn't include this with their other iPods, but obviously the Shuffle can't have a radio because it doesn't have a screen with which to see the station.  The Shuffle is a clear winner if you want an attractive, go-anywhere, easy-to-use, inexpensive, great-sounding music player. If you want something more, such as a radio, a voice recorder (again, why?), or a way to manage the 120 to 240 songs on the player, then you have to buy something else.  Personally, I bought the Shuffle because of the size and convenience. I already have a big 20 gig MP3 player, but I wanted something I could carry in my pocket and not have to worry about. I love reaching into my pocket and copying over a file from a friend's computer; when I drive home, I listen to tunes on the Shuffle (through the car radio), then I forget it's in my pocket until I need it again.  I'd still like a screen, though.

<Title>Great Device, cheap and worth the deal!
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great buy, the cost is great, and sound and everything is just as great as an iPod mini or Regular iPod.  It's light-weight capability benefits for athletes like me that like to work out a lot and its sleek design will make people stare in envy at it.  It doesn't have an LCD screen, but who cares?  It's very simple to put the songs onto it too.  You just plug the iPod into the optional USB port or the extension cable that comes with it and an iPod symbol will appear on your iTunes at the left.  Then just go to the library and drag the songs over.  Could it get any easier?  But i definately recommend buying a sports case for it.  It adds color and protects it efficiently at the same time.  Overall, this is a must-have for someone that can't afford the outrageous price for an iPod mini or Regular iPod or for someone who is just looking for a good light-weight deal.

<Title>Great product.
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Shuffle over the weekend and it is great. I bought it for the sole purpose for working out.  The machine itself is light weight, the buttons are easy to use, though the on off button can be a little slick to grip on to.  The sound quality is better than my radio or discman.  I have a PC with Windows XP and Itunes has not had any problems and it makes loading all my cds on to my computer a breeze.  Many have complained that there is no screen, no FM tuner, no recorder. Well, if you want those things don't buy the Shuffle, that seems to be a fairly easy solution. The Shuffle is great if you are looking for an MP3 player and nothing more. If you want more, look elsewhere.

<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I thought I would not like the new Shuffle because it lacked a screen.  Boy was I wrong.  First off, for $99 you can't go wrong.  I now understand the random concept.  Its great.  I have a 3G ipod so this is a great companion product.  However I find myself using the shuffle more than my other ipod.  I can choose to shuffle the songs or I can put my own playlist on it.  I use it while in bed, at school, and walking.  Battery life for me was better than what Apple rates it.  Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.    My only quibble is that it does take longer to load an charge than my 3G, but thats minor.  Some people may say that it lacks an equalizer, but if you select it in iTunes it seems to transfer over for me.  I highly recommend this as a companion for the millions of ipod owners.  It better as a second iPod than a first one, thats what I think.

<Title>Great product, what else can be expected from Apple?
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased the Shuffle based on a couple of factors.  First, I have heard that the Mini and the regular IPOD are fairly fragile, and since I am rough on things personally, and I would mostly take the Ipod to the gym, hiking, biking, running, or on trips or other "high risk" adventures, I thought there was too much potential for me to break the darn thing.  Second, the cost of the more expensive Ipods gave me pause.  Third, the Ipod is not forever, as battery life is likely to die after a while. I didn't want to risk the battery life on a $300 product.  $100 to me seems to be near 'throw-away value' personally.  Second, the Shuffle uses flash memory, which is longer lasting, then the mini hard drive in the regular Ipod.  Again, I thought this was a safer choice for me. All these considerations led me to believe the Shuffle was the best choice.  I know 'merely' 120 songs doesn't sound like a lot, but I tried an experiment with the Itunes software (which I recommend using even if you don't have an Ipod because of its simplicity of use!) and I came to understand that 120 songs is quite a lot.  Sure it would be nice to access more songs, but for my purposes 120 is enough I think.  Plus, Apple has issued an update to reduce the bit quality of the songs in order to put more songs on the Ipod Shuffles!!  I have heard of almost 200 songs on the smallest model.    As to the Shuffle itself, it is a glorified USB drive key.  However, for $99 dollars, I get a virtually unbreakable piece of equipment that I can transport anywhere.   It is incredibly light.  So light you can't believe it, I still can't get over it.  It's like a virtual "DJ es machina."  My only quibble is the switch for 'off' to play is a bit cheap in tactile feeling.  This doesn't feel to soild.  No, you won't feel like it will come off, rather it just feels like its insecure.  However, this is the only moving part besides the volume and play control button in the front.  That control is intuitive and very similar to the regular Ipod.  No problems there.  As to the complaint of a lack of a display, it is somewhat unfortunate. However, with the limited songs I can put on the thing, it doesn't really matter because I know each of the songs on the playlist (it's GOLD Jerry!) and they are all my favorites.  I am not losing anything by not being able to see the songs.  Also, for my purposes the lack of a display is a good thing because it would add a battery loss and also a gain in weight and fragility to the thing, who needs that?  I don't.  As is typical, I plugged in the software (PC user here) and away I went.  I already had Itunes, and the software updated Itunes for the Ipod seamlessly, and I mean seamlessly!  Within minutes I was placing songs onto my Ipod.  After a four hour initial charge, I was using the Shuffle.  The sound is great, it is light and the shuffle feature works like a great eclectic radio station delivering the kind of music I like to hear.  Wow.  I have always loved Apple products, and supported Jobs over Gates, now I know why. Believe me, if your purposes are similar to mine, you can't go wrong with this thing.  By the way, if you are a traveler like me, you may like the fact that the Shuffle charges by being placed in a USB port. Now, I know the regular Ipod can be charged with the additional international adapter from Apple to eliminate this problem, but I like the fact that I can take the Shuffle to any computer with a USB port, stick it in, and begin to charge it.  This is convenience!  In short, I heartily recommend this product.  Apple had done it again.  All

<Title>Brilliant design; limited usefulness
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the sleekest mp3 player on the market and worth the 99$. If you are happy listening to 100 or so songs in random order without being able to find a particular song, this will do. If you want to keep you 400$ Ipod with its fragile hard drive at home while you listen to some music during your workout, this will do, also. Having lost one ipod due to dropping it down a flight of stairs, I am not anxious to risk that again. The ipod shuffle was an investment I made in order to have a few hours of mp3 files with me at all times. I listen to talk and music files constantly (I have almost forgotten what radio is. Oh, yeah, that's that annoying thing with all the commercials and the small playlist of oldies). Think what you will be using this for before you buy it. If you have a big collection of music, save up for the full size ipod. If you do not, spring for this one. If you want something that is sturdy for everyday use, get this. Otherwise, forget it.
