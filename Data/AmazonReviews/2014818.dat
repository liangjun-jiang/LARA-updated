<Title>Terrible user experience 
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Zune Thursday and affter a day and a half of trying it to work with my new HP laptop I've given up and will be sending it back to Amazon for a refund.  Conversely,  went down to Best Buy purchase a iPod nano and was down loading songs from iTunes in under 2 minutes.  Microsoft's Zune, a failure so great Microsoft is still struggling to sell models from last year at fire sale prices.    (BUY AN IPOD OR SANDISK MP3 PLAYER)

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third MP3 player after a first generation ipod mini (which I subsequently sold) and a creative zen micro photo (which recently died after 2 years of impeccable service).  I liked the Zen, but wanted something a bit more sleek, so after reading some good reviews of the Zune, I bought it.  I was not disappointed.    All of its controls are pretty intuitive.  I think the control pad works as well as the wheel on the ipod mini I had, if not better.  The zune software, while not my first choice for music management, works well for its purpose.  I definitely prefer it to iTunes.  The screen is bright and the wireless sync worked flawlessly.  I don't really have a bad thing to say about this player.  Others have complained about the lack of an equalizer.  I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile and I think the sound is just fine, even through the included headphones.  This may not be the case for those with more discerning ears, but I think it's just fine.

<Title>Not all files play
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for audiobooks that we download from our local libray. They are WMA format, and the Zune says that it plays WMA files, but when I tried to transfer it wouldn't work. After deeper reasearch I discovered that it will indeed play WMA files, but only if you buy them from the Zune store. It seemed like a good player but I returned it right away, so I didn't get a chance to explore it. I bought a Creative Zen and it is sweet and played all my files perfectly, including the audiobooks.

<Title>If I can help just one person it will be worth it. 
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After owing the Zune for over a month and dealing with its user UN-friendly music and video formats, I've come to realize that Microsoft's reason for such limited formats may be an attempt to force change upon the music and movie industry to create yet another monopoly.   This is the only reason that one can find when looking at the limitation of the Zune and realizing that Microsoft is a software company. They are not a start up company with limited resources but are on a course for market domination.   Buy the Zune if you want, but realize you are financing intellectual and progress limitations.

<Title>Very Impressed
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a Zune for Christmas. I have been an avid iPod user for many years. I wanted to switch to the Zune because I got tired of iTunes. The Zune is very small and lightweight. It is the size of a credit card so it makes it convenient to just throw in my purse or use at the gym. I like the fact that it has an FM radio because I can listen to NPR in the mornings. It's design is very impressive and I like the Zune interface. Overall I am very satisfied and will recommend the Zune to anyone. It is a great alternative to the iPod nano.

<Content>Not sure why others are having software issues... I run Vista on my pc and XP on my laptop.  I haven't had any issues with either and was downloading songs to it from my own music library within just a few minutes.  Haven't had to buy anything from the Zune store, and have had no trouble programming radio presets at all.    This is my 2nd mp3 player (last one was a cheepie) so I don't know what I'm missing with this vs. the iPod, but I don't care...  I love my Zune!  :-)

<Content>I got this player for my wife this Christmas just to try something different than the Ipod Nano I own. I was expecting to be pleased with the player but after using it I am very impressed. The player works great and is very easy to use. What I am most happy about is the use of the Zune marketplace with the Zune. The marketplace is very graphical and intuitive. This complete package makes me recommend this player to anyone looking to get their first mp3 player or someone who is looking to try a new brand.

<Title>Fantastic, Easy to use MP3 Player!
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player was very easy to set up and use. I bought some music from the Zune marketplace that I didn't own, and uploaded a lot of my own music from my vast CD collection. I had no problems at all with the software-I run Windows Vista, and it was a snap-very easy, simple and fast. The sound quality is excellent, and the video quality is outstanding. The price is right compared to the Apple IPod, which I think is very overpriced. I'm glad to see someone competing with Apple and doing an excellent job of it. The only thing I did not like is the standard earplugs that come with this-they are very uncomfortable! I purchased thru Amazon the JVC marshmallow set and they are so, SO much more comfortable and keep the sound quality.   The mistake I made was getting the 4GB. I should have gone for the bigger  GB, even though I have about 160 songs saved in 3 different playlist headings. For next Christmas on my wish list I will ask for a larger Zune 2nd generation MP3 media player. Zune is definately the way to go!!

<Title>Zune 4GB microsoft
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i really liked the menu of the zune (2nd gnrtion) it's way easy to use and also the browsing is easier than ipods, at least for me, i've been using both for several years and now i prefer zune. really good sound as the song is recorded.  contras: well, i guess they didnt make a EQualizer or presets to set music. also when you buy it (even new), at least the (2nd GNRTION) dont bring the CD with it, you have to download all the software from the website, that's a little confusing for someone who's not Bill gates. but anyway, if you want to surprise somebody with a gift, this is a good choice.

<Title>Works pretty well for the most part
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for a Christmas present. So far it works pretty well.  A couple complaints are that we've spent over 8 hours trying to figure out how to get podcasts to show up correctly in the player podcast area.  For some reason, if they are not from the Zune Marketplace, they just won't show in the correct spot. They keep showing up in the music area.  Screen is small with the 4gb model, but very sharp. I was able to play some videos, but they don't support enough types yet.  If you like a nice small flash player for music, this item fits the bill.  If you want more, you might be a bit disappointed.  The price was very competitive compare to Ipods though so what you get for the money might be enough.  I think Microsoft should spend more time on the basics and less time on the practically worthless wireless sharing thingamajig.

<Title>Works pretty well for me
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So this is my first MP3 player, so I cannot provide a detailed comparison with the ... you know ... the other brand.  I haven't wasted my time in research on the topic either, this is a $150 device with a pretty simple functionality so I don't really care : when the time comes to drop 3 grands on a 60" TV I'll be more careful.  I just happened to like the form factor better and I like that there is competition in a market too.  I'm not invested in any particular DRM'd ecosystem, I use the device for listening to my ripped CDs and AmazonMP3 DRM-free tracks so anything would work for me.  I haven't figured out yet if it's possible to shuffle playlists.  Until that I'm staying at 4/5 stars.

<Title>Zune is great, software isn't.
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First, they didn't ship ship a software CD with the Zune. So, because I didn't have an internet connection at the time, I had to go to my friend's house just to download the software.  I like the Zune hardware better than the Ipod. The interface is much easier to use and the screen is better vertically placed like the Zune.  What I don't like is the Zune software and the limitations of it. The software is too simplistic and doesn't allow as much customization as iTunes. iTunes seems more complete and professional. The thing I hate most about the Zune software is that you can't drag and drop music to it. You have to have a folder monitored by the software and it will take care of it for you. That's the only way to add music to it.  The Zune works similarly. You add music to the Zune by monitoring your Zune Music Collection which monitors a folder with your music in it. The lack of drag and drop convenience is the big killer of the Zune.  Finally, the touch pad they changed to is just a gimmick. I couldn't find any use for it. I prefer the way it is on the 1st generation Zune.

<Title>ME AND MY ZUNE
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the Zune for Christmas. I had never heard of it before, but recieved it based on the fact that everybody knows I would have never bought an MP3 player on my own, and would have probably spent the rest of my days avoiding the whole craze, and sticking with portable CD's. Well, I have it now. It's been a few weeks, and I like it. I like the fact that it's not an I-POD, just for political reasons, and the fact that the "I'm a Mac" kid has been on my crap list for a while now.  I don't like the fact that I can't figure out how to play albums that I've loaded into it, without them playing on shuffle. For some reason, everything in my I-Po.... err...Zune, keeps playing on shuffle.  Also, and I saw someone else complain about this; the headphone jack is screwy. This happens to me a lot lately though, with various devices that use headphones, so I don't know who or what to blame this on.... I never had problems with my headphone jacks in the nineties.. I know that much. Plus points go to the FM radio. I love those things.  Minus points go to the ultra sensitive touch pad. I've turned it on several times already without realizing and killed the battery.   Anyway. It's cool. Mine is olive green. It's harder to make jokes about the name Zune, than it is to make jokes about the whole I-Pod, I-Tunes, I-sex, I-friends yada yada yada stuff. Spell the word I-cup....  ....you see me PEE?!   ha ha ha... gross.    Can't make those kind of jokes with a Zune. However, if you go to Zune.com and read the whole introductory page, you are bound to get a few laughs. Especially at how "hip" they try to make the Zune community sound. Oh well. I'm sporting a Zune. Que the Odd Couple music... I'm sure we have a whole future together of hillarious stories to tell...

<Title>Great Alternative to iPod
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I previously owned a 2nd Generation iPod Nano and msotly liked it, but was sick of the iTunes software and the DRM music Apple offers.  This Zune is the perfect size and has just the right amount of weight to make it feel sturdy, but not a brick. I especially like the metal case. The screen is very bright and to my untrained eye looks nicer than my Nano. The new navigation on the Zune is very intuitive - requires no thought. Audio quality is just as good as an iPod. One huge plus over the iPod is the digital AM/FM radio. It also has wireless capabilities, but I personally don't have much use for that.  The Zune software is OK, not great, but easy enough to use. No problems with installation.  Overall, this is a great product - exactly what should be expected. If you want a high quality music player, take a look at the new Zune.

<Title>terrible product for audio books
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product to mainly listen to audio mp3/mp4 books. ie. foreign language lessons. The device will not sync all the lessons, will not tell you why. However, you can play all the mp3 lessons on your computer, so the format must be correct. Also the zune software on your computer which you use to navigate playlists or manage the device is poorly designed and doesn't work properly. Once you spend time to organize your playlists after syncing the device, the audio mp3's have been re-arranged from the playlists in the actual device. You can not re-organize your playlist on the device without doing it through the software. Another terrible product from Microsoft!!

<Title>This Green Machine is hard to beat!!
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the 4gb Zune 2nd gen in green, and so far love it! First of all the Zune software installed and worked flawlessly on Vista Ultimate. It was also very easy to sync my couple of playlists to. With only 4 gigs, I didn't want all of my music auto syncing to it and it didn't. The Zune marketplace has just as many songs if not more than iTunes. I even found a Mp3 to download that I couldn't find anywhere else. Between my wife & I, we own several mp3 players (Zen Vision M, IPod Classic, 8 gig Zune and my beloved Zen Stone!) This new player is quickly becoming my favorite!!  The controls are very easy to use and are not to sensitive that you bump them, or wiz past your song. (you can also lock your buttons) The radio feature is also very useful, just be sure to disengage the "scan" or you'll blaze right past your station.  I just really enjoy this player & highly recommend it.. As far as cons..Just small ones..I would not recommend using it for vidio 'cause the screen is a bit small, and it would be dumb to squeeze a movie file on 4 gigs. There really is no manual, and not many accessories, cases etc..The supplied ear buds are huge! I just plug in my Creative ep630s and all is well...Am kicking around ordering the 80gb Zune.  p.s. I'm not suzerstar..I'm her better half. :-)

I went with Zune since for better or worse i am married to Mr. Bills microsoft land on my new Dell laptop. All my music is loaded into windows media player. I hoped that this would make syncing my existing media data easy and I am pleased to report that this is truely the case. Its very easy to set up, sync and use within a short easy to follow download. My music loaded no problems and even my entire picture portfolio. I set my own skin. In the zune marketplace I found a bunch of free podcasts on topics that are of great interest to me that I did not know even existed. Anyways if you are a windows user and are wondering which way to do I would reccomend this product.

<Title>ipod is better
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased Zune because I was sick of all the ipods out there and wanted to be different. I checked the reviews for Zune and found some good ones. There was one that even stated that the Zune software was better than the ipod's (itunes). whoever said that must have been a plant for microsoft because I purchased the Zune and found the software confusing. I thought it would run through Windows Media Player just as ipod runs with itunes but this is not the case. The Zune software is separate from Windows Media Player. With ipod you only need the itunes. I returned my Zune and got the ipod. there's a reason why they are so ubiquitous: they are better. The scroll wheel on the ipod is just a much better feel and i-tunes is the better player. But be prepared to shell out an outrageous $25.00 for a standard plastic cover (a necessary accessory) if you get one at a Mac store.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player.  I'd always thought I might like a small device that could be used while exercising, but I've hesitated to buy one because I wasn't sure how much I'd actually use it.  The Zune feature that pushed me over the edge is the FM radio, which made the device too attractive not to try out.  I'm extremely happy that I made the plunge and bought the Zune.  I now take it everywhere and listen to music or the radio at work, on the bus, at the gym, everywhere.  It has easily surpassed my bar of usefulness and utility.  I'm not a big gadget person and I don't like the time and energy it takes to figure out how to use a new program or game, but the Zune user experience has been everything that I could have hoped for.  The controls are simple and a pleasure to use.  Right out of the box I was able to get it figured out and working.  This is a great device.

<Title>New to Zune
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first attempt at MP3 technology.  I wanted something compact, powerful, and easy to use.   Zune met those requirements.  It is sleek, very lightweight, and extremely easy to use.  Unfortunately the ZuneMarketPlace leaves a LOT to be desired.  Adequate music sampling, very view video's, no movies.  Why have the feature on the unit, if the material isn't available via their own marketplace?  That brings us to product quality.  After one week I am now on my second unit. The identical problem with both units.  The ear phones simply do not function unless the jack is precisely positioned in the unit.   So you have to manipulate the jack, not too far in, not too far out, wiggle it a bit, and do not move it or you will simply loose sound altogether.  Mind you I'm not at the gym or jogging.  I am sitting in my office with the Zune in my shirt pocket.  And I still loose sound.  I am returning my 2nd (and last) Zune tomorrow.  I will not be getting another one.  BUYER BEWARE.

<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted an MP3 player primarily to use while I'm working out and I wanted to be able to easily switch between radio and music and the Zune seemed to fit the bill perfectly for me. One of the first things that I tried doing was to preset radio stations; but, I couldn't figure out how to manually select radio stations. The manual stated that you would need to turn the 'peek' function off, but it didn't explain how to do it. After much frustration, I called Microsoft support. After much explaining about what I was trying to do and the support person asking me several times to hold on, I was told that the 'seek' function could not be turned off because of the  frequencies.  I told him that the documentation stated that stations could be manually selected.  They still insisted that it can't be done.  The next day, I went to Best Buy, the Sales Person there showed me in 1 second how to turn peek off and select stations manually. So I give Microsoft Support zero stars. Overall, I am very, very pleased with my Zune.  I simply love the way the  Software works in handling of creation/deletion of music. I had been looking for several years for an MP3 player.  Up until now, I was  not pleased with what was available on the market.  This fits the bill perfectly for me.

<Title>better then ipod ?!?!?!?
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>well until a week ago i had a 4Gb iPOD naon for all my music needs. but when the new ipod nanos were released i decided to upgrade. but when i got my hands on aone it was so small and thin in my hand it felt like i was holding a gram cracker. so i decided to search for something else and then i came across the ZUNE it was the same size as the old nano but with video and a radio. the interface is so easy to use and the scroll pad is awsome . Video is small but super clear i was able to put 300,Transformers, and a bunch of south park episodes.not to mention the Zune software for your computer is way better then Itunes and super easy to place media on your Zune. the only problem is that it does not include extras like stopwatch,calender,and clock. but unless you really needed those you wont miss them.if your in the market for a new or 1st MP3 player or you want something different dont pass this down.

<Title>Great device
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ill start off by saying that this is an awsome device, i bought this for my mom sence her philips is starting to wear out. I own the 1st generation zune and it was awsome, well i didn't have much cash so i went to numerous pawn shops and all i found were ipods and a couple of 1st gen zuns that they wanted $200 for, i refused to use the ipods since my friends always seem to have problems with them, and the fact that all my music is on zune software. So after over 6 hours of searching i finnaly gave up and decided to go to Circuit City, i picked up this 4 gb for $135 which was about $35 more than a used ipod. Well the software that was downloaded from my previous zune (the same software) took about 10 minutes which isn't to bad. I dont really use the zune market place, but the few times i did it worked fine and it had good quality music. Although i am very disapointed with microsoft not using wma format instead of mp3, because you get twice as many songs but i dont think my mom will be able to fill up 1000 songs very easyly.

<Title>Might be nice, if you can overcome the bugginess and software incompatibility

<Content>It never ceases to amaze me that Microsoft fails, time and time again, to make its own products work well together. Before getting into specifics, I will say I'm not an Apple "fanboy" by any stretch of the imagination. I had actually gotten the Zune in hope of finding an alternative to the ipod, but it looks like the Zune is going back and I'm going back to Apple...  I picked up a Zune this past weekend. This was my fifth audio player in the last ~9 years, having owned a Creative Zen, a Gen 4 ipod (20 GB, HD Based) and a pair of Gen 2 nanos. The ipods, while great devices, seemed to bring me bad luck, as I had gone through 3 in 4 years. I had heard good things about the Zune and, now that a flash-based version existed, I figured I'd give it a shot. It's a very nice looking device, feels great in the hand and has remarkable video quality for a player of this size (I haven't seen video on the Gen 3 nanos and as such, can't compare the 2 objectively). The sound quality is right up there with my old ipods (I never use the stock earbuds, but used the same pair of Shure e2c buds that I used with the nano)  Unfortunately, that is where the positives end. I'll preface this by saying that I'm fairly computer savvy and have done plenty with software, hardware and peripherals in my day.  A week before buying the Zune, I picked up a new, Vista-based laptop. I was unable to start using it until I got the Zune, and figured it would be a great opportunity to "launch" both of my new toys. I booted and updated the laptop, then downloaded the Zune software. Hooked the Zune up and as soon as it was detected, the software crashed. Tried a few more times with the same result. Uninstall and reinstall of the software caused the same problem. Growing frustrated, I broke out my old, Celeron-based XP laptop and tried the Zune on there - wouldn't even detect the device and wouldn't let me install the drivers manually. 3 hours on the phone with Zune support (nice enough folks) were wasted with no solution. I had one more computer in the house - a 5 year old Dell desktop (Pentium 4, running XP) and was able to get everything working on there. Not wanting to be tied to that dinosaur (especially given that its best days are behind it), I continued trying to get it running on the Vista laptop to no avail. Another 4 hours with tech support over the next 2 days provided nothing more than additional frustration, apologies and a few compliments (nice to have an L2 tech tell you that you seem to be well versed in the technology they're paid to deal with). Continuing to play with it on my own, I FINALLY got the software to run, with the Zune connected, and was even able to sync music (another problem is the way in which the Zune software organizes and re-tags everything). At that point, my last nerve was touched. I had a few TV shows I had downloaded and converted to MP4 using cucusoft's Zune video converted (a great program, BTW). I moved the files onto the Zune software and it crashed (DLL error). I searched for a fix and thought I found one, which I put in. At that point, I was able to launch the software and get the videos to show up, but the minute I tried moving one of them to the device, it crashed again...and again...and again.  I give up - looks like it's back to ipod-land for me.  The amazing thing is that, somehow, Microsoft's own device fails to work with its operating system...

<Title>good player!!
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got this player today. Previously I owned a 2nd generation ipod classic. Zune looks pretty nice though I wish the screen was a little bigger. It takes time to get used to the Zune software and player controls because they are quite different than Itunes and ipod. Unlike the last reviewer, I found it extremely easy to install the softwares and set up the player. Overall I am satisfied.  However, I have found the following negatives:  1. No equalizer, as many mentioned before 2. Can't find how to play the file at any time I want. It may not be a problem for songs. But for some podcasts, I want to fast forward or get back to an earlier segment.   3. Can't preset the radio frequences. 4. Doesn't display song names in chinese (it is just my problem)  update: It turns out that 2, 3 are not problems any more. I should have read the user's guide first. The control is as good as apple ipod. The software is better than Itunes. I guess I should play for a few days before I give reviews..  How can I change my rating to 5 stars?!!
