<Title>A great first MP3 player!  Cool features and a great price too!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sandisk's MP3 players have really come into their own.  Not only are they packed with features, but the price is reasonable.  Sandisk has come a long way from their original Digital Audio Player.  This model has tons of things going for it. - great sound, nothing not to like there - light-weight  - FM tuner - voice recording - ergonomic design - great navigation and sorting features  - Microsoft PlaysForSure compatible (for those who are into that) - USB 2.0 connectivity - replaceable battery!!!  The cons are minor in my opinion - limited shuffle features - built-in microphone could have been improved - mediocre backlight - slower transfer speed on older computers  For those needing more space, the Sansa M240 and M250 offer more space in the same form factor.  This unit is not ideal for those who primarily want to use it for recording.  Sony's various models are all superior in that regard.  One thing I have to wonder is why Sandisk didn't include an SD slot in this bad boy.  I've already seen a few similar players with them.  I took a test drive and I liked it so much, I bought it as a holiday gift for a friend.  I would definitely recommend it.  I wanted to keep it myself, but I'm gonna get my own instead.  :)  Enjoy!

<Title>Nice sound, Nice features, Nice price
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wouldn't say that this is a top of the line audio player, but with better headphones you can get a great sound.  For a little more, I suggest you get the M240 or M250, which have the same features, but with 1GB and 2GB of storage, respectively.  Why to buy this unit:  -Rock bottom price -Decent sound with your own headphones -Nice interface -Works with various music subscription services (somtimes requires firmware upgrade--see sandisk.com) -Has "Plays for Sure" software embedded. -Can be used to store any type of file (mass storage mode) -Can shuffle play -Comes with an arm band and player sleve for walks, workouts, etc. -Lightweight -Plays for 11 Hours on 1 AAA battery  Why not to buy this unit: -You want to use it with I-Tunes (not possible) -You want a unit with rechargable battery (buy rechargable AAAs, only option) -You want a unit with swappable media (SD or flash) -You want a unit that comes with good earbuds or headphones -You want a unit that has 1GB or more (see the M240 and M250 or a variety of other players) -USB modes can be confusing, causing unit to suddenly not register as a compatible music device with windows (easily fixed by changing modes back to music playback instead of mass storage) -controlls sometimes require futzing with to get what you want.  I recommend this player for a first-time player and for those who need a cheap player with good sound.

<Title>A nice mp3 player for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is really the first mp3 player I have owned.  I initially looked at the IPOD's but was turned away from the price and also the fact that I had to purchase the songs from Itunes.  This player is simple to use, sounds really good, is very small and lightweight, and is a good deal for the money.  If you want to store 1000 songs, or watch videos, then this is not the player for you.  If you want something that's easy to afford, and can store around 200 songs, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this one.  I rated only 4 stars, as you may want to consider the 1G player as it would hold somewhere around 400 songs.

<Content>Husband received this as a christmas gift.  It didn't work with his (older) W98 PC, but works great with my XP laptop.  I got it loaded and working in about 5 minutes.  Not slow as some have reported.  Could use a little more memory, but at this price I can get another and have my genres separated.  I was holding out for an iPod, but this little baby kicks! Better fitting earbuds would be my personal choice, but that's no big deal.

<Title>Good First MP3
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very good first MP3 Player. I don't listen to a very wide range of music, so 512 MB is plenty for me. The one problem with it was, we tried to use it with iTunes, but it wouldn't download to it. So we had to burn a CD then take it from the CD to the MP3. Overall, it is a very good product and its not very complicated to use.

<Title>SanDisk Error
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product that SanDisk markets is not compatible with Mac computers. The manufactor does not disclose the fact it is not compatible with a Mac computer, until you call for tech support at SanDisk. When asked how to resolve the problem is to return it or sell it to someone else. SanDisk is not accountable for the error and dismisses the customer to resolve their error. I give this product a ZERO because of the lack of integrity by the company.

<Title>A good Mp3 player, but.........
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its a good Mp3 player, and once it get even slightly smacked, its a dead Mp3 player, I got one of these "the square model, I forget the name" and that broke by being in my pocket when I fell, and I used my warrenty, and they gave me this, I had it for 2 days, and I dropped it by accident, and it was busted, so dont buy this if you think you might drop it, it is a good Mp3 player, but its too fragile.

<Title>I really found what I want!!
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like this player very much.  First, it is very easy for using. I believe for any electronics, easy using is the first for user. Every step is so simple. You will never feel pain to find out how to use it.  Second, transfer songs is just copy and paste. That's it! Before I bought this player, I have a Sumsung 20G player. But transfer songs is so difficult. Many songs can't be transfered for no reason. But for this player, what you need to do is drag the songs and put it into player. Just like using a usb drive. Then, enjoy~~~~  Third, it can be used as a usb drive. I really need this function. I don't need to pay money for another 512M usb drive.  The last and very important thing is the sound is so great~~~~  The only pity for me is it can't be extended by SD card. If this works, I think that will be perfect for me.  But I like it!

<Content>WMP will sync only the songs if you sync MANUALLY, but if you use WMP's AUTOMATIC syncing, then the playlists themselves (as well as the songs) get put onto the device (note that WMP still doesn't SHOW that the playlists are on the device, but they are definitely there and can be used).

<Title>Especially for first timers, this is your player
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've never had a personal MP3 before, so I found this one at erwincomputers, via Amazon for just under $24, including shipping.  Its a good intro to the world of MP3 and WMA, loaded onto, basically a flash drive with a player.  This player in particular is easy to operate in both transferring Windows Media files and replaying them.  Also, it's durable and nearly foolproof in that it just continues to play faithfully when the controls are locked.  It comes with a clear vinyl cover w/beltloop, but I just lock the controls and drop it upside-down into my shirt or jacket pocket.  I doesn't interfere with most activities.  Even if I ever decided to upgrade, I can't see any reason not to have one or two of these on hand. Oh yes, and the sound was much more dynamic than I had guessed.  You can hear all parts of the music in proper proportion and the little (cheapo) ear buds you get with the player are actually pretty good.

<Title>I like this new toy
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ordered my Sansa m230 Sunday, was in the mailbox on Wednesday, and I was working out at the gym with my new toy by Thursday.  I didn't know an MP3 player could be this affordable, so I looked like a dork at the gym with my DiscMan up until this week.  (Okay, I'm an over-40 woman--I'm not into gadgets.)  I took this player out of the mail box, and had all my favorite songs downloaded to it (with my custom playlists) 2 hours later!  This is probably the best thing I have ever bought for less than $25.  I highly recommend it.  Go ahead and order the silicone case w/clip if you get this player.  The earbuds that came w/it are the best I've ever worn; somehow they stay in place very well for me.  Plenty enough volume to drown out the cell phone yakkers on the treadmill next to ya!  The only negative comment I have is that the tiny quickstart manual teaches you nothing about how to scroll thru the menu on the player or the menu's different features.  It took me longer to figure all that out than how to burn my music onto the thing.

<Content>I purchased this product mainly for the radio tuner to use at the gym.  They have tvs that use the radio stations, in order to listen to them.  The signal is great in the gym, don't have any problems there.  It does drain the battery a little fast but I use rechargeable batteries.  It has enough space to save several songs to listen to while working out.

<Content>Honestly, you get what you pay for. From the minute I got this thing in the mail, I loaded it up with music, put new batteries in and was ready to go. Unfortunatly, the device was not. I had to keep playing with the battery to get it to turn on. When it did finally turn on, I listened for a bit and put it on pause.....when I did that, it shut off and once again, I was playing with the battery to get it to work. I've tried Energizer Lithium batteries and Duracell thinking maybe it was the battery but sad to say, it wasn't. Like I said, you get what you pay for...what do you expect for 20 bucks? lol. When it wants to work, it is great....but those with little or no patience are urged to stay away from this device.

<Title>Great value, SanDisk stands behind warranty
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this unit on "Black Friday" (day after Thanksgiving) at Best Buy - couldn't beat the $40 "early-bird special".  After about two weeks, after trying to load it up with some more songs, the unit got stuck on the "finalizing update" screen when I disconnected it from the computer.  I e-mailed SanDisk about it and they responded quickly with a few things to try.  Those things failed, so I called them the next day, and they had me do a few more things, which also failed, so they issued me a RMA number to send it back to them.  A few weeks later, a brand new unit was shipped to me, and I have had no problems with the new unit.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who's looking for a relatively simple device that will support WMA files from services like Napster (my personal favorite), MusicMatch, or FYE; iPods will not work with WMA files.  The FM tuner is also a plus.  However, my only problem with this unit is that the USB cable that they give you with it is very short - less than a foot - which tends to make it a bit of a hassle to connect it to the computer - since it practically has to lay on the floor while you're adding or removing songs from it, if your computer doesn't have any USB connectors on the front of it, you'll need to either "rubberneck" to the back of your system or get a longer cable.

<Content>I bought this on black friday for only $40 and it's the best mp3 player for $40 dollars. It doesn;t have a huge memory but it's good for young costomers. it's vert easy to use and is a bit bulky but fits nicely in your pocket and in your pocket. I suggest have some back-up headphones because first-of-all thier the most cheeeeeeesiest headphones i've ever seen and they might get screwed,lke mine.It's has very easy to use controls and frowards pretty quickly. I had some problems with it, i didn;t even know what, either the songs wouldn't delete or it just tirned off. I suggest making an account at SanDisk.com/support to help you out. The usb cable is really short but doesn't bother me I use rechargeable batteries but i listen to music every day and used it since black fiday and have only rechaged then 3 times. If your in the market for a new mp3 player, the Sansa m230 is PERFECT!!!!!

<Title>One of the best little players for it's price
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Alright, so mp3 players, yeah there's so many to choose from, it gets really annoyin, especially when all of your trendy friends are telling you to get an ipod. Don't get me wrong, ipods are great, i have one in fact, and i love it. But i rollerblade (not recreational, like the kind where you go to skateparks and grind handrails and various other things). So the the ipod's size makes it more prone to be broken, which is why I love this thing. I'm going to skip all the candy coating and get straight to the tootsie roll filling:  pros: -Most other mp3 players are a little bit thinner, but the sansa has a flat control panel and the back is round to fit in your hand, i know, i know, you're going to put it in your pocket, well just put the interface on the inside of the pocket and none of the buttons have a chance of breaking, or the screen.  -The sansa has an extremely long battery life for one little AAA, around 20 hours, which is awesome since i hate buying batteries, but that's not a problem because i have rechargable AAA, but it's gets extremely aggrivating having to recharge batteries everytime you go out.  - The buttons are perfect, they're big, they're bold, what more do you want, and i noticed most mp3 players put these tiny little pin size buttons on their players, what's the point of that.  -The menu is really straightforward and simple. You just press the menu button on top of the player, and then use the 4 buttons (play/pause, previous track, next track, and stop) as the directional buttons on the menu.  -I used to have the older version of the sandisk mp3 players (256mb) and it was never loud enough, like i would be on the bus or in a busy area and not even be able to hear my music! Thankfully they enabled it to become louder and have a better sound quality.  -It's very inexpensive, i payed 40$ for mine  from a seller on amazon. And that's about how much it goes for retail everywhere else.  Cons:  -The only problem i have is that the earbuds that they come with aren't the best in the world, but i still use them, they're the only earbuds i have ever found that have fit my ears without a 2 billion dollar price tag. Or i would get new ones.  -The fm tuner that comes with this is junk, i get a good signal every once in a while, but it really shouldn't be used as a marketing gimmick, considering most flash mp3 players have one now.  Ok, well thanks for reading my review of the sandisk sansa 512mb. I forgot to mention that it has a decent voice recorder for notes and such, but i always have mine filled to the the rim with music, so i've never really had the oppurtunity to really try it out.

<Title>Exactly what I was looking for
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is exactly what I've been looking for.  I wanted something small and durable so that it would withstand rattling around in my backpack (as I am a college student), and it seems quite sturdy so far.  Also the buttons and interface are very user-friendly.  The volume control is also easy to access and adjust when the player is in my pocket.    The earphones are (in my opinion) very high quality, and I am pleasantly surprised as to the quality of the sound this thing produces.  And here's a plus: when you have the earphones on, other people can't hear them.  This is how it should be, but a lot of times with other MP3 players' ear phones you can still hear peoples' music.  Not so with these; they're intended for the listener only.  And their style and design is also quite sleek-looking.  I am also quite pysched about the built in radio.  I enjoy listening to the radio from time to time, because of the variety of music available.  And in comparison to Apple's I-pod, you have to buy a sort of "add on" radio tuner to be able to listen to the radio with an I-pod, and such an add-on costs around $50 by itself.  For just $13 more, you can buy this MP3 player instead, and still be able to store your own music on it just like any other MP3 player.  I should mention about the radio though, that you only have access to FM stations and not AM stations.  Overall I found that this player has everything I need.  It's really an amazing deal for the amount of features you get, and I am quite pleased with it.  I highly recommend it.

<Title>Best Flash Player for its price
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this last Thanksgiving for only 30 dollars at Best Buy, plus 10 dollars for a 2 year insurance. Awesome deal. It was way more than I could ask for, for only 40 bucks.   The pros imo: - Very light weight. I could barely even notice I had the Sansa in my pocket when I used it at work. Also, the arm band is very handy so you can keep the cord out of the way while doing things. - Buttons very easy to reach. I could push the play buttons through my sweater without even looking at them. - Equalizer options are great since you can cuztomize your own. - FM tuner, is always a plus, but it didn't really work for me because I live sort of far from Boston so I couldn't get the good stations. Well I can't get the good stations even on my house stereo. Only in my car's stereo I can tune in to them. - The case that comes with it is a perfect fit, and it protects the sansa from scratching. - Playlist support if you sync it with WM player. That's such a neat option that lets you create playlists and update them to your player very easily. - Also you can access the sansa with windows explorer, and add music by drag and drop.   The cons: - 512 MB not nearly enough for my needs. This is not really a con, because for the price it's still a bargain. But that was the main reason why I sold it to my friend for $50. I'm planning on getting a hard disk now. - When I bought this player I thought that I could upgrade the memory by adding a sandisk flash card to it. Guess I was wrong, but some other Sandisk players do have that option, even though they're twice as expensive. - Earbuds are kinda crappy. I mean they fit nicely in my ears and also had that little cover, but after about 3 months the left one started dying on me. I had to keep the cord in a certain position so I could hear the sound. I guess I broke the earbud because I kept getting the cord caught on places and I kept pulling on it by accident. The sound quality is great though. - You can't use folders as playlists. You can't use any other player to add playlists to the sansa except for WMP. I used Real Player (not a good player I know) to upload my music, only because it gave me the option to convert my mp3's to wma while adding the music to the sansa. I hate wma files, but I used it so I could fit more music into my player. You get almost twice as much space if you use wma instead of mp3. Later on I found out that the sansa won't recognize Real Player playlists. Then I tried to Create playlists on Windows Media Player then add the songs that were already in the Sansa to the playlists, but you can't add files to a playlist that way with WMP.  So no playlists for me, just regular playback through all my library. I could still play by genre, or by artist, but still wasn't the same. If it wasn't for that I think that this player would have been perfect.

<Content>i love the mp3 player. sure there isnt a folder system but organized by artist is fine (with legit songs) for me. the big thing is not being able to stop the music besides pausing and turning off the mp3 player. is there some way around it like pressing two certain buttons at the same time or smth? lol i would rate it five stars if it was present (minor nusiance for some) ---so easy to use !! :-D   i bought it from j& r music world only because there was a 10$ rebate (69.99-10.00= 59.99) and besides, i wouldn't have to wait for the mp3 player to arrive to my door; the downside of J&r  was the NY sales tax that came up a tad higher than i expected so my purchase came up to 75$ and after rebate it will be 65$ instead of less than amazon (with supersavings and tt long wait with supersavings).   if only sales tax could be abolished!

<Content>I purchased this for my 12 yo son. He has recorded music (sister's band concert song), downloaded songs and listened to the radio. He has had no difficulty manipulating the buttons or using the mp3. The sound quality is fine. The head phones are okay quality. If you are looking for a decent first mp3 this is it.

<Title>Great little mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this mp3 player to go running and exercise with. You can fit approx. 3-4 cds on it, which is more than enough for an hour or so at the gym. This little mp3 gives off great sound, takes batteries, and is really light weight. It is easy to see and figit with. The buttons are so accessible that I can even change songs when I am running.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't come with an armband... at least the version I purchased. I had to buy a separate armband that didn't quite fit is and made it difficult to use.  Other than that it is a great product and I recommend it.

<Title>Disappointing...
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this mp3 player as a gift and was very excited. It was small, portable, and had many handy features. The big issue was that it runs on batteries. Well, it DID run on batteries until it broke and wouldn't run anymore. For some reason, the programing on it corrupted. I would not recommend getting this version of the SanDisk Sansa. After talking with a few other people who owned this same player, they also said they had problems with it and ended up buying something else. I would most recommend upgrading to the 1 GB version of the Sandisk Sansa.

<Title>Great sound and price
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I used to own a 30GB Ipod but it broke after being dropped only a couple of times. This led me to the conclusion that spending high $ on high tech mp3 players is pointless. Why spend hundreds to store tons of music? If you want to store tons of music, get a 500 GB hard drive for your computer. When I'm out and about I only need a few cds worth of songs. And if it breaks, who cares? I only spent $25 including shipping! Plus the Sansa's sound quality is great and the headphones it comes with are really good, almost great, and better than the Sony headphones which I bought for $20. So you get good headphones and a low cost, compact mp3 player for under $30! Take it from an audiophile and music collector, the Sansa is worth much more than the low purchase price.

<Title>Had to return to the store...twice
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I felt comfortable purchasing this product after all of the good reviews on this site.  It did have good sound, but the particular player I purchased kept skipping from song to song after playing only a few seconds.  Some songs would play for a few minutes and then skip to the next song, others would only play for five seconds or so.  I returned the player to the store and tried another M230.  The exact same thing happened again.  As I returned this model again, the store clerk privately told me that there had been many returns on this particular model and he advised me to try either Iriver or Samsung.  Hopefully it was just a bad batch that had arrived at that particular store, but I won't be purchasing a Sansa again.

<Title>Sandisk M230 Honest Review
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research on this product before purchasing.  I have several Sandisk Compact Flash Cards that work great, so I knew the quality was good from the company already, so I gave them a try and Amazon had it at a great price with Free Shipping.  Bottom Line about the M230 (M200 series):  The unit is very user friendly and works great.  Some positive notes about it are:  Affordability, Equalizer, FM Radio (20 Pre-sets), Sound Quality, Firmware Updates, Backlit Screen (nice blue), Uses non-proprietary batteries (big plus in my book), comes with a protective case and arm strap that works.  Others have stated the arm band is not any good, but I disaggree totally.  I use my unit at the gym several times a week and running on the tread machine, it stays put and never skips a beat (literally).  I've never used the recorder, but it is good to have as a memo option if needed on the go.  Being I go to the gym regularly, the stopwatch is very handy to have also.  The equalizer settings (Rock, Jazz, Classical and Pop) are good right out the box.  The unit also gives you the option to manually set the sound which is what I use and improves on the already great sound that the preset equalizer gives.  One of the things that really sold me on this unit was that you aren't limited to just one computer to load and delete songs with the unit.  I can use any computer with a USB plug (1.1 and 2.0) and add new songs and then instantly play them unlike some other well known named products which must have the same computer to be able to play the song.  Another key feature is that it uses a single AAA battery and not a proprietary type or worse an internal type which can't be replaced easily or cheaply.  When your internal or proprietary battery runs out of power, that's it. You can't run to the local drugstore and buy some AAA batteries to continue use. The proprietary type must be recharged before reused.  I use 900 mA rechargeable AAA batteries.  The battery life is about 24-30 hours of continuous operation which is great.  A regular Akaline battery in this unit last for 15-19 hours.   The only minor issues are that the the supplied USB cable is on the short side (9").  If you do not have a front USB port, this can cause a small problem, however, I am able to use my Canon digital camera cable for the camera and the Sandisk M230 which works prefectly and gives plenty of length.  The other small issue is the back light stops operating when the battery reaches 3/4 empty which is really understandable being it takes a lot of power to run a backlit screen.  The IPOD Shuffle doesn't even have a screen nor many other features the M230 has.  This was a great buy.

<Title>Best Quality for the Buck
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB blue player near the end of January unfortunately.  I say unfortunately because I missed all of the Thanksgiving Sales!  I could have gotten this for $40 or $50 but I ended up paying twenty dollars more.    The SanDisk is my first mp3 player.  I can't help much in the way of comparison.  But my only complaint is that it doesn't play very loud...which is understandable.  Hard to fit a nice amp in a tiny package!  The earbuds are decent but no way near the quality of my SHURE in-the-earbuds.  The FM radio is decent but doesn't pick up weak stations.  The voice recorder would be useful if I had 1 GB or more space.  Right now the 512 is packed with music so no space for voice recording.  The buttons are easy to use and the menu is simple.  But as stated in other reviews, the shuffle feature needs a better algorithm.    I would recommend this mp3 player because downloading music is very simple and it is very easy to use.  Cost is the icing on the cake.  Updates in future.

<Title>Great Deal!
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recieved this MP3 player for Christmas about a year ago.  I have really enjoyed this player.  It has a fairly good battery life although I would recommend you invest in some rechargeable AAA's.  Music is easy to upload with Windows Media Player, or simply using the drag-and-drop method straight from your computer.  It comes with a plastic case that you fit over the player and that is a really nice feature.  The radio transmitter is great and gets amazing reception.    The earbuds that came with it lasted for about 2-3 months and then one ear went out.  I used them that way for about 8 months and then the other ear finally went out.  I would get this player (since it's a great value) and invest in some noise cancelling earbuds. I also have never been able to get the "playlist" feature to work on the player... I still can't figure that one out.  Overall, I would definetly recommend this player.  It's a great player for the price and does a good job.

<Title>Not that good even for a budget mp3 player...
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Even in a budget mp3 player category, the Sandisk Sansa M230 lacks in so many ways. The FM player is glitchy and can't seem to get a strong signal. The screen is always on(you can turn backlight off, but it always has scrolling text of whats playing, eating away at your battery).  The most annoying part about this Mp3 Player is the lack of the ability to make playlists and folders. Forget about having multiple directories for different genre's of music, they all get arranged by the Mp3 player and stuffed in one list... you can't even pick the order they play. And for someone like me, who listens to Rock and Electronica, thats annoying... They are both great genres... but after hearing Pete Tong lay down a great beat, I don't want it to go into A guitar rhythm by Angus Young of AC/DC.  If you not picky and just want random music, why bother with the Sansa M230? Save yourself some cash and get an Mp3 player without a screen, cause if u don't listen to FM or care about EQ... you get nothing else worthwhile with the M230.  This thing simply looks basic, even when compared to entry level budget mp3 players...

<Title>Voice recorder makes this a plus.

<Content>I bought this as an MP3 Player for my commute into Washington DC last year because it was cheap enough that if something happened, I wouldn't be as distraught as if I lost a $300 ipod.   Well, I've actually wound up using this more as an FM radio with acceptable performance, and as a voice recorder to record some personal phone calls on the speakerphone.  I am sure the sensitivity of the microphone is not as good as a dedicated voice recorder, however that advantage would make this a buy again for me.

<Title>Great little player, only a few flaws
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, I use this thing nearly every day.  I love it minus a couple flaws which I'll explain.  1.  If you like podcasts and ever wanna fastforward or rewind them, this Sansa has a tendency to skip to the next or previous track after you've been holding rewind or fastforward for a couple minutes worth of MP3.  In other words, it fastforwards a couple minutes then auto skips to the next track so it's fustrating if you listened to 20 minutes of something already and wanna jump to that spot on the track.   2.  It doesn't let you delete tracks from the Sansa, you have to plug it in the computer to delete tracks.   3.  512 megs isn't quite enough for me, but it works. 4.  It has a funny way of organizing tracks.  It auto groups things by the same artist, which is ok, but the display will show the entire artist, album title, song title bla bla bla like 20 feet long and slowly scroll past so if you're driving in your car, you have to wait to see what's playing or what's next.   5.  The lighted display doesn't stay on long sometimes.  This again is a pain if you're driving at night and have to wait for the title to scroll slowly while the light goes out after 4 or 5 seconds.  For the most part these issues could be addressed by firmware updates from Sansa, but I don't know how much they listen to customers.  I've suggested they change some things and hopefully they do.

<Title>The original sansa player is still a great bargain!
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is a great bargain for those who are willing to give it as a gift to someone fairly new to MP3 devices or someone who is young and has knowledge of digital music.  Control navigation is huge so you can access it easily.  All you need to do is plug the cable (which is included with the player) into your computer and all you do is click and drag any music you want to on your player, it's really that simple.  This is recommended for those who do not have a lot of music on their computer and are satisfied with a handful of music, or for those who do not mind constantly replacing music.  This makes a wonderful gift to anyone who is a beginner to MP3.

<Title>Simple, no problem, mp3 player with long battery life and good support!
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my M230. SanDisk is a fantastic company with great support. I originally purchased an earlier machine and it ended up having a bug. I was offered a new machine. I accepted the offer and was sent this M230.  When the package arrived it had one of the old buggy machines. I gave corp a call and was immediately sent an upgrade and was allowed to keep the buggy machine. My original M230 was stolen so I purchased another one from Amazon (that is how much I love this).  It is amazingly easy to set up. I do not use the included software just copy and paste after connecting the M230. It copies the music fast and after a couple minutes is ready to go.  I use the new, ready to use, rechargeable batteries and after many, many hours have not had to change the battery even once!  I understand that SanDisk is one of the few companies that actually manufacture their own memory. Also customer service is in America (the last time I checked).  Highly recommended. frank

<Title>Say hello to my little friend
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am really happy with my Sansa. I have had mine now for about a month and it's already taken a beating and it keeps on going. It's VERY durable.   I use it daily for my workouts, and the armband that is included is perfect for people who are working out or performing an activity.   I can fit about 90 songs in .mp3 format onto the unit, and it does have a good battery life.   I am very happy with this .mp3 player and couldn't have made a better choice.  Pros: 512 MB of room for songs, or about 90 .mp3s Decent earbuds, I have no problem with mine. Small and convenient, the design of it makes very little difference. Easy to understand and operate. Sleep timer for automatic shutoff.  Blue backlight- very weak, but it works.  FM tuner, again, I have had no problems with signal strength and have had great results with that feature.  Armband included, great for active people. Compatible with real player- so I can use one program for listening to music and downloading music onto my sansa.   Generally, I love my sansa. I use it when I go grocery shopping, when I go to the mall, when I go gambling, or when I am absolutely bored. I love it and highly recommend it to anyone who is on the market for an inexpensive and reliable .mp3 player. The sansa is great!   Cons:  It's not an iPod

<Content>I purchased this player for my son and we are both very pleased with what you get for the money. The sound quality through the earphones provided is terrific and the features are plentiful for a player that cost us about $63.My personal list of improvements would be a longer USB cable for data transfer and a slightly brighter backlight. I also have difficulties with obtaining a strong signal using the radio, but this may be more an issue with where I live versus the ability of the player. Overall, if you are looking for a solid player and not looking to pay the IPOD prices, this is a great player to consider.

<Title>No problems; significant advantages over iPod 
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa is a small flash-based mp3 player that runs for many hours on a single AAA battery available wherever. It is so easy to use I did not and have not even looked at the instruction manual. The sound quality is really good and the price can't be beat. As others have noted, the array of mp3 devices is really bewildering. Basically, there is iPod and everything else. Ultimately, this product seems to be the best of the "everything else" category - and there are some significant reasons why I think people are better off with this than with iPods. Firstly, and most importantly for me, the Sandisk player functions as a drag and drop drive into which you can just put your music files and they play right away. There is no proprietary interface such as iTunes required. This is a huge advantage for anyone who does not use or like iTunes, as I do not. Loading and unloading files can be done easily and seamlessly through the regular windows desktop interface. This results in a device that is considerably more useful and robust than iPods which require the use of the stupid and childlike, yet strangely frusterating, iTunes software - one of the biggest problems of which is that you can only use one computer at a time to sync to your music library. This is really not cool. If, however, you want to use a designated piece of software to sync to the Sandisk, you can use musicmatch or a number of others and it works without any of the hassle of iTunes. In fact, with one click, you can sync whatever is playing on your Musicmatch playlist to the player... something that I never really figured out how to do with iTunes. Furthermore, you can easily use the flash memory to hold any other kind of file just like a pen drive. In the end, I can only attribute the success of iPods to their marketing blitz and to their kind of catchy designs. But these are not really good reasons to buy a music player. I had an iPod for a while before I spilled coffee all over it and I don't miss it one bit. I only wish I had gotten one of these sooner and had given away my iPod to someone who likes them instead of the unfortunate end that it met. I think if you buy one of these you won't regret it. It's not quite as tiny as the iPod shuffle and it does require AAA batteries but it is a much more useful piece of equipment.

<Content>We now own 2 of these players. My wife likes to put entire CDs on the player. I like a variety of tracks. Syncs up nicely on windows media player. Sound in the earbud headphones is excellent. Great for FM radio too. You can put about 80 MP3 songs on the player comfortably, and can update and replace songs pretty easily as you synch up on windows media player.

<Title>ugly but tough little thing
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I  hook this up to my car through the tape deck.(yes both my cars have tape decks)  The good: runs on AAA battery, long battery life. I use this every day on my  7.5miles 20mins commute, and occasional jogging/exercise. Supports chinese character.  Support wma. Plug this into the USB port(windows xp) and it acts as an flash drive where you direct drag and drop files. No crappy itune needed. I bought this to replace the Dell Ditty which was smaller but unreliable, and also as an alternative to my Ipod which doesnt support wma. Sound quality is decent, but I dont really care for my radio talk shows. And unlike ipod, I can leave this ugly thing in my car without worrying someone gonna break in. Becasue of the size, the main buttons are very easy to press which is important when you are driving.   The bad: The designer needs to go back to design school as this is one ugly piece of equipment. For a 512M unit this is pretty big. The battery life indicator is not accurate when I use my 1.2v NiMH battery, it shows full life when it is about to die.    Bottom line: Good for old-school people like me, not for show-offs. No custom rechargable battery or painful softwares to worry about. But dont hang it on your neck unless you want to make a fashion anti-statement.

<Title>Great alternative to the iPoos!
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was the first personal mp3 player I ever purchased, and nearly 2 years later, it's still going strong.  I selected it on a whim as I was waiting in line to pay for my other Black Friday (day-after-Thanksgiving) purchases.  With people all around me shelling out $100+ for iPoos [sic], I figured $50 was a bargain.  I was right and then some!    What I love about this is how easy it was for me to put music on it.   Since I already have a 30 gig directory of music I ripped from my own CDs, it was as simple as dragging songs from there to the Sansa. (I've seen my VERY tech-savvy hubby curse while trying to load and set up his different iPods. *cackle*)  Being able to adjust the sound playback style is nice, too (Rock/Pop/Classical, etc.)  I also love that the Sansa has a radio and voice recorder function; no more writing little notes on my hand during the day!  I've also used my Sansa as a regular flash drive to transport files to and from work.  Since it uses standard batteries, I don't have to worry about remembering to charge it, either, and I've been quite surprised at how long I can use the Sansa before I do need to replace the battery.  I'm very impressed!  While I don't recommend it, I've dropped my Sansa several times and banged it around plenty, with no apparent ill effects.  Overall, I'm quite happy with my impulse purchase!  I do plan on getting a new Sansa, only for a larger capacity, though.  When I do, I'll be passing this one along to my 12 year old.  I'm MUCH happier with the thought of her carrying around a good $50 mp3 player than one that costs several times that much.  The Sansa M200 line is a great, budget-conscious gift for a tween/teen or yourself!

I replaced the ear buds that came with it (Doesn't everyone?). The player plays the music loud and clean. 512 Mb is plenty of music for doing chores and taking my walks. The price is excellent. This player is worth every penny I paid. If you want an inexpensive MP3 player that sounds excellent, this is the one to buy. Enjoy your music while you save some moola!

<Content>I am shocked that anyone would complain about this player (I almost didn't buy it based on one review). For the price you pay, it's quite a good product. I purchased it only for when I go running and bike riding....it's perfect for entertainment on the go. I use it to go running three times a week, and I bike almost everyday. The arm band works well (it's not pretty, but it does the job). I haven't had any problems from rain. The batteries last a good while. The sound quality is good. Granted, the first time you put music on it is a little bit of a pain, but once you work it out, it's all good.  What it isn't good for is having your entire musical library on one MP3 player. If that's what you want, get something else. But if you want to be able to listen to good music, go running, and not break your bank account doing it, this is the ticket!

<Title>Great MP3 Player for the Money!
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased 2 of the Sansas M230 512MB.  The first one I got for my son(8 yrs) for passing CRCT Test and it is great. Easy to use and he figured out the features quickly. Even showed me things I didn't know were on it. It has all kind of ways to list your selections and songs. It just adds new songs without erasing others. So, when my daughter (11 yrs) passed her test - I purchased another one for her.  I also purchased a pink skin for hers.  Now hers works a little differently on downloading the music but the manufacturer said it was set up differently.  They enjoy them both and I am very happy with my purchase.  The sound is great and they work great.  It also has the FM Radio which I definitely wanted for them and it picks up all the stations clearly.    Great gift for yourself or someone who wants an MP3 player.

<Title>Good for low cost device
<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player does a good job of simply playing MP3's.  I use it daily and have had no problems with it.  Like most people, I replaced the ear buds with some better ones that I already had.  Don't buy this device for playing FM stations unless you are staying still in one place.  The USB adapter cord has to be in place to get any stations, and the stations fade in and out with any movement.  I've not used the voice recording feature.  The USB mass storage device interface for moving mp3's to the device is a bit strange in that it doesn't show up in windows XP as a separate drive letter, but as a separate device under my computer.  Also only music files can be copied to it.  Even with the above comments, it does it's simple playing job really well.

The only thing you need to consider is that it requires AAA batteries, which can be good, or bad, depending on where you are when you need to charge it.  It looks good, and the FM radio plays well enough that I borrow it to use when I run.  I don't know how to work the selectors, but I haven't asked so I can't complain.

I'm not a musician or a music maven that needs thousands of songs on my MP3 player - the 150 (.wma format)or so that mine seems to hold suit me fine.  My only problems were with the headphones, which expired fairly quickly, and the fact that it didn't come with a manual (found that online easily enough).

I am on my second player (after returning the first to SanDisk) and have experienced the same problems with both players.  The player skips pieces of the audio file (it's the same type of "noise" you get when talking to someone on the phone and their call-waiting beeps) and when you pause the player or turn it off, it won't begin playing where you stopped.  It skips ahead 2-4 minutes.  I have no idea how the player works with music files.    Don't let SanDisk mislead you--this player is not compatible with audible.com.

<Title>Two players so far lock up / crash
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm about to return my second Sansa M230 player.  After only less than a week both times it isn't working properly.  Two main malfunctions are :   1. After clicking "Play All", it will play around 5 songs and then just stop.  2. Also, It locks up often.  No buttons will work to use menu, play music, or even power it down to reboot.  I have to remove the battery in order to reboot it.  These problems occured after less than a week of very light home use...no dropping the player or bookbag abuse.  Possibly the most strain I put on it was possibly navigating through the menu too quickly.  But c'mon, I hope it can handle clicking the buttons quickly.  I called SanDisk about the first bad player.  The CSR suggested some things to try include re-formatting it, but after this didn't work, she said just to get a replacement from BestBuy.  I will likely call Sandisk and press them for info  about whether there is a known problem with many of these players. I did read something about known issues in one of the only other negative reviews here.  I am bummed because the price is very nice on this player and when it is working I have been enjoying owning it.  I have been using the two month "Napster To Go" free trial that came with it.  Which is awesome - unlimited downloads to your player (you can't burn them to CD, of course.  But alas, I guess with this low price player, the reliablity goes down.  I'll likely be trying another low price brand too see if I can find one that works better.  Update : I re-formated the second player (which I tried unsuccessfully to do to the first one).  It now has been working ok for a day.  We'll see how long it lasts....

<Title>Great Product but recommend the next one up
<Date>Fri Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the quality of the Sansa M230. My only regret is that I didn't spend the extra on the next model up. Although the advertisement and manual say 120-240 songs, realistically I've only got about 100-110 on it and it's full. It's possible I'm ripping at too high a quality...128-160 kbs. In all fairness though, I knew going into it that I only needed 11 or 12 CDs on the player at a time. After a week or two I get tired of them and re-sync using Windows Media Player v10. The sync process was the hardest part to figure out but once I got that down it's great. You can also drag and drop to and from the player through Windows Explorer. Windows sees the player as just another drive but you cannot create playlists with this method. As far as quality, sound and features go it's simple and fantastic.  Update May 1, 2006 - Ripping from CDs at 96kbs is very adequate. The quality is still very good and you can fit significantly more music on this device....that is 150-200 tunes.

<Title>Great Features and Value - Tricky Audible Install
<Date>Thu Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Love the features and price point. No problems installing/using with Windows Media Player.  Getting Audible.com's (audio book site) Audible Manager software to recognize M230 was difficult. Seems like the M230 was only recognized when it was powered off, and the "hold" slider (bottom) was set to the right. Only then could the M230 be plugged into the USB port and recognized by the audible manager. I believe this to be the fault of the ever-flawed Audible software since Windows Media Player had no recognition problem.

<Title>Awesome mp3 player !!!
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After checking out the reviews for mp3 players at [...], I chose this one. Don't let the small size or lightweight fool you. Superior sound, and loud enough. The earbuds that came with it work just fine. This one claims up to 19 hours on a single AAA battery. Once started I soon had nearly 3 hours downloaded. (It will take much more). The 512MB size may not seem like enough for some, but to me 40GB seems overkill. I did find the instruction booklet not very helpful, and needed to go on line to www.sandisk.com to view all the information that would be helpful. It lists for $79.95, I paid $48 at an after Thanksgiving day sale, and worth every dollar. VERY happy with it. Choose a brand name like SanDisk. Nice features the Apple 512MB or 1GB do not have, like a display with information.

<Title>Doesn't  work - and they admit it. See below:
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just picked this player up and found out that it does not support the formats advertised - in spite of the Microsoft "Plays for Sure" logo.   I subscribe to Audible.com which is the new "Books on Tape". Audible is an advertised format on the m230. I spent hours trying to get it to work, downloading drivers etc. - but it wouldn't.

<Content>I purchased this at Best Buy. It's fantastic and runs for days on one triple A battery.  Also the FM Radio feature is a bonus.  The display is also a plus that the ipod shuffle doesn't have.

<Title>Haven't been able to part with this since I got it 7 days ago!!!!
<Date>Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought this mp3 player on a whim while waiting in the *LONG* line in the BEST BUY day after Thanksgiving sale.  I have been extremely happy with my purchase.  I agree w/ the reviewer who said that the instructions were lacking in direction but if you stick with it, the pay off is worth it.  For $40 (sale price), you can't beat the sound quality and ease of downloading your favorite tracks. I did have a little trouble downloading my Napster tracks but I eventually figured it out.  If you have a little bit of patience, then this is the MP3 for you.

<Title>Good Little player that Plays Subscription, Audible
<Date>Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>They have now released the Audible Driver (in response to the review complaing about no Audible Support) and at any rate, the Sandisk Digital Audio Player driver worked once you put the device into MSC mode.  Overall, it's a great little device, especially for the price.  It does everything you want.  It doesn't have a Huge storage, but I have 92 subscription songs plus a 6 hour audio book on mine.  It's sufficient for the gym and casual use.    no, it's not an ipod, but it definitely does the job. In fact it has several features going for it over any iPod. 1) FM tuner 2) Recording 3) Subscription Audio files 4)Replaceable Battery(!!!!).  I have a 40GB 3G ipod, and the hard drive is failing, the battery stinks, yada yada.  The Sansa is a simple device, which works consistently. An excellent little device overall.

<Title>Nice Size, Nice Price, Great Quality
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>At first when I bought this cute little mp3 player, I really thought I'd have it no longer than a few months. However, the quality is great and the battery life is outstanding. The ear buds are amazing and can compete with any other headphones I have in my collection. I tried out the iRiver H10 with 40GB and it was too huge and although it could hold alot of songs, it was too time consuming going through all of them. This play now (the Sansa) is just right. I put all of my favs on it and just go. It syncs effortlessly and comes with a nice little case so your screen wont be scratched and you can run with it. I honestly toss it in my purse everyday and it still works fine. I would seriously suggest buying this if you're looking for a cost efficient device with more features than the oh-so-famous iPod. Oh yeah and the bass is great too and the volume is serious on this tiny little gadget.

<Title>Music quality very good, but a few quibbles
<Date>Fri Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this player after I already had a 512MB Ipod Shuffle, because at times I missed being able to see the ID3 song information on a display screen. Also the price was unpassable the day after Thanksgiving as well.  So here it is about a month later, So I can pass on not just the first thoughts, but what I learned thru much experience so far as well. Hopefully the information will help you make an educated decision.  The sound is very good, no background hiss at all, great clarity. You WILL need a different set of earbuds though, the ones it comes with are even worse than the IPOD stock units. I suggest the very inexpensive Sony 828's.  Using the built in equalizer with the "Rock" setting will make the stock earbuds sound OK, but just barely.  The backlight is dim, but a nice blue color. Combined with the small font however, makes the display not useable in the dark. The scrolling of the text is the smoothest I have ever seen on any display. You will see all of the song information.  The Sansa is chunky, but very comfortable to hold. The almost 1" thickness may make it uncomfortable in tighter pockets.  The AAA battery life is very good. I get 20 hours. Interestingly enough your friends probably will not use up any of this battery life. Without reading the instructions, it is hard to figure out how to turn the unit on in the first place! (You hold down the small MENU button on the side for 3 seconds)  The cpu to mp3 upload speed is SLOW. Takes 10-15 minutes over a USB2 connection on a 3 GHZ machine. Same size IPOD takes me 5 minutes.  The FM tuner reception is excellent, good separation, frequency response and sensitivity. Hardly ever fades out. Tuning and presets are good as well.  The voice recorder has only one quality level, I think 32k sample rate, sounds muffled like AM radio quality. Microphone is pretty sensitive. Will fit several days worth of lectures for later study and review.  The shuffle function is not so good. It replays songs you already heard, before you hear them all. It is truly random, but I much prefer the Shuffle method where you hear them all, before you hear repeats. ALSO if you use the FM radio and go back to MP3's, the play list starts at the beginning again, and in the same order!  I still use the Shuffle, because it is sleeker, smaller, and "shuffles" much better. But if you can get the Sansa at a really good price, the sound is excellent, the FM is great, the display good in bright light, and the recorder is just, well, OK. Just don't forget a better set of headphones and enjoy.

<Title>M230 Great Product But Backlight Uneven?????
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this during the day after Thanksgiving sale for $39.99. Cannot beat it for the price after comparing it to the pricer Apple product. I am an MP3 novice as I use this to listen to lectures recorded on my notebook etc. instead of music. Very satisfied with the size and functionality of the product. It could use AM in addition to FM though but have yet to see a player this size offer both. Question for those who have this product is how is the backlight on yours?  Can someone who has one of these tell me of the backlight on theirs is a bit uneven? Light seems to be at Sansa logo end instead of SanDisk end and is brighter where the light is physically located. I dont expect laptop quality backlighting but I have a watch with Indigo backlighting and it is not ueven. Perhaps the light on my is crooked pointing up instead of directly toward the other end causing the uneveness? Is yours like this? Is mine defective? Thanks in advance!

<Title>Very slow transfer speed, but easy to work controls and display
<Date>Sat Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I upgraded from the Sandisk Digital Audio Player line to the Sansa line when it broke; I was also hoping to get a faster fast forward.  I was unpleasantly surprised that the transfer speed from my hard drive was extremely slow.  To transfer 73 MB file (a 90 minute podcast), it took 53 seconds in MTP mode and 40 seconds in MSC mode, compared to just 9 seconds on the older Digital Audio Player.  Also, the fast forward, while faster than the older Digital Audio Player, is still not very fast, taking a full 120 seconds to fast forward through 20 minutes of podcast to get to the place where I left off.  On the positive side, the display is easy to read and the controls are easy to use.  This is very important to me, but not enough to live with the frustration of a slow transfer speed.  It's going back to Best Buy.

<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit sounds great, But after only 2 weeks the volume slider is stuck on 10 so all my music is blasting & I can not lower the volume. That will keep me from buying another product from this company. Other then that it is as good as any unit out there. But the cheap design of the volume button is cause for you to move on to another unit.

<Title>Worth the money
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered 2 of these because they were so cheap. After a few months one quit on me. Sansa replaced it quickly (after a long phone call lol). The 2nd one still works fine and the replacement one as well. If you want something simple to use and easy to operate for minimum cost these work well. Mine are used almost exclusively for running and working out. At the time the 1st one quit I was soaked with sweat and assume I contributed to it's demise because the plastic pouch it goes in to hook to the arm band was full of condensation. IMO I had already gotten my money's worth out of it but called Sansa anyway and like I said they replaced it. It's a cheap easy to use MP3 that won't make you too upset if it accidentally gets destroyed. I only gave it 4 stars because one did quit on me. I recomend one to anyone else looking for a good player with a minimal investment.

This is the perfect mp3 player for someone that isn't looking for an extremely expensive iPod or mp3. The fm radio is great and so is the music quality. I love it!!

<Title>Lousy Audibile Books Playback
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Too things I don't like about it. 1. It looks like a cheap piece of cr*p...plastic exterior. Doesnt inspire confidence. It doesnt look study or of good quality.  2. It sounds terrible with my audio books in the .aa format with audible.com..It plays jerky many times and cuts in and out. Its supposed to be compatible with them.  Otherwise, its fine. But these two points are very important to me. I'm taking mine back, and going to go to a slightly higher priced one with someone else. Maybe RCA, I dont know yet. But I want a good quality player that I can depend on for years to come. Dont want an iPod tho! That's more than I can spend right now.

<Content>When I looked at the specs for this player, it appeared that I would only be able to use it with my PC.  Not true!  I tried it with my Mac, and it was plug and play all the way!  Just drag songs from iTunes into the "audibles" file and you're ready to go.    This player has surprisingly rich sound.  Seriously, it compares to a hard drive player; maybe it's because of the headphones, but Sansa has produced a solid player.  The FM tuner works extremely well for me-- maybe the radio signals are stronger in my area, but it's as clear as it is in my car.    I was figuring on getting a cheap product for the gym and the track, but I think this is the player I will end up taking with me everywhere!

I've seen people complain about MP3 players' volume abilities being lacking, but this thing has awesome volume range, from a whisper to a high volume that allows me to hear my music clearly even when I'm walking alongside a busy road. I'm going on a trip overseas this summer and this will definately be going with me. I can't see what more you would want in an MP3 player.

<Content>I just bought this through Amazon and I love it.  First, I am not a techno junkie who carries Laptop, Blackberry, and IPOD with every little gadgets known to man.  With that said, I realized that I needed a MP3 player, since it is considerable upgrade from a tape or cd player.   I run about 3-6 times a week.  I don't like to run with earphones when I am outside, but at least twice a week, I run on a treadmill.  This MP3 is perfect for my indoor running.  I stored about 100 MP3 songs and I am in my own world for 30-60 minutes.  It is extremely light and comes with an armband.  The battery life is long.  When the juice runs out, then just swap the battery (it tells you how much battery juice you got left).  It is a lot better than worrying about recharging.      So, if you are a simple guy who just want some music while exercising, then this is perfect for you.  I hope this helped!!!

<Content>This was my first mp3 and I'm very happy with it. It's a nice compact size so I can slip it in my pocket and has all the features I need, and more than I expected for something so cheap. I know some have had trouble getting radio reception, but I haven't so far, I've gotten all the stations in our area, one of my favorite features. It has an easy replaceable AAA battery so you don't have to worry about charging it. It was very simple to start using, which was good since this was my first time, and I had it full and ready to go in just a few minutes.  I kinda wish it was a 1GB since I've already loaded this one, but for the price and just starting out, the 512MB is just enough. The navigation took me a little bit to figure out, but overall it's pretty simple. It's all sorted into genre, CD, Artist, etc. Very nice.  I've been telling my family they should get one to start out with. So far it's been a great buy and I'm very happy with it.

<Content>Set-up and loading was easy, but WILL NOT hold 250 WMA songs. The most I could fit was 158, and there was ALOT of memory left.Also, to play Wal-Mart downloads you have to copy from computer to cd, delete from computer, rip from cd back to computer, then transfer to device. Battery life not close to 19 hours if using backlight. For $24 it's not bad, but it should at least live up to claims.

<Title>How to play songs in track order
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it from Circuit city. It was running an old firmware and songs could only be played in alphabetical order. Renaming the file names to begin with numbers didn't help. Then I downloaded the lastest firmware from sandisk website. Problem solved after the firmware update. To update the firmware,  (1) downloaded the firmware to your PC and run it. (2) During the installation, you are prompted to connect the player to PC. Before connection, you need to power off the player and put it at 'Hold' postion( a orange mark will show). (3) Follow the instructions on screen for the rest.  Overall, I found this player very good. Prons,  (1) sound quality is excellent. I encoded mp3s in 320kbps, which sound really good. You may need to adjust the equalizer a bit to get your favarite sound. Try the 'custom' equalizer, works really well for me. Earphone is good enough.  (2) I put mp3s in folder structre as mp3s->artist->album, that's    three levels. The player find all songs in sub-directory. I read somewhere that some Creative models only read upto 2 levels. (3) FM radio and voice recorder are nice features. Many other products at this price range don't offer these.  Cons, (1) Doesn't look that well.  (2) Should build the the right/left earphone in different shapes.

<Title>The Color Is Nice
<Date>Tue May 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Revised review:    It's amazing to me that customers for these devices get so emotional about them.  It's an electronic toy, not a potential mate.  Since iPods are expensive and their batteries are hard to replace once they die, these MP3s are, I suppose, a useful alternative.  But let's not get too excited here, folks; the sound quality of these little players is no more than adequate, the radio is useless for fringe areas, the construction quality is marginal, my PC didn't always recognize it as a USB device (definitely a fault of the player), and the organization of music files is clumsy.    I returned mine once I was told by the extremely helpful Sandisk customer service woman that loading .wav files on it is impossible and that it won't recognize Windows Media Player playlists.  I give Sandisk a thumbs up for customer service, but thumbs down for marketing a device with such a narrow range of uses.  For much of the popular stuff that is called music these days this device will, I admit, produce satisfactory sound quality.  But that's not an endorsement; for music enthusiasts who know what fidelity means, this player will undoubtedly disappoint.  This device is an example of making a product smaller just because you can, not because it makes it better.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is so simple to use!!!  Just plug it into your USB port on your computer and drag and drop the songs. No special software needed.  The stored songs can also be played back through the computer if you like.  The FM tuner works really well for such an inexpensive player.    This one was bought for a Mother's Day gift but I am thinking of getting me one also.

<Title>Complete Review from Pros to Cons to Why I bought it.
<Date>Fri May 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will begin with the pros; excellent value, compact design, great sound fidelity, intuitive menus, and ability to play music by album, artist, or a single song.  Now the cons; battery life - 1 AAA Duracell Alkaline battery seems to last for about 12 hours (for me).  I have a job where I destroy electronics, then sit at a computer and write reports about it.  I listen to my mp3 while doing that for eight hours straight, so I change my battery about every day and a half.  There is also this strange 'glitch' where the player locks up (literally).  I have to pull the battery to get it out of this state.  This is the main reason why I give this player a "4" instead of a "5".  Finally, and I realize this is probably nothing to most of you, but why on earth did they decide on the color white for the foam earphone covers?  I have had this mp3 player about 4 weeks and the white foam is more gray than white any more.  Why did I buy this mp3 palyer?  I bought this mp3 player because I was not sure if I wanted an mp3 player or not.  'Would I really use it', 'Do I really listen to a lot of music', and 'Do I have a large enough music library to justify the cost' are some of the questions that ran through my mind.  Generally, I'm the kind of person that buys the things I buy because I either need it, or I will get some amount of pleasure out of owning it.  I did not want to spend a lot of money on an mp3 player if I was not going to use it, but I needed to see what the 'mp3 culture' fuss was all about too.  Well, as you just read, I use it for eight hours straight.  I do listen to more music than I thought, and it turns out that I had a larger music library than I thought.  I bought this model because of its price, so when I got it home and filled it up with my music choices, I found that I could only get 123 songs loaded on it.  That gets almost every Primus album, The Wall, and most of Wish You Were Here on it.  I still have plenty of Floyd albums, and other Claypool albums, and other artists I want to listen to througout the day, so I will be purchasing another mp3 player with more capacity.  I will stick with the SanDisk on the next purchase.

<Title>The "512MB" Joke.
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would strongly recommened against buying this product. Some of the many things wrong with it:  The player brags that you can fit 8+ hours of MP3s, or 16+ WMAs.  Standard WMAs are larger files than MP3s.  They use up significantly more space space in memory and therefore allow fewer hours, not magically double somehow.  I quote 512MB in my review title because the actual file space free is about 485MB.  The player has a tendency to shuffle songs in memory.  I don't mean the shuffle feature simply turns itself on, no it simply saves the songs out of the order you specified.  Which is okay (though annoying) for some music, but if you are trying to put soundtracks on (for example... the musical Wicked..) it's very annoying when the songs are forcibly in the wrong order.  Deleting and readding the files several (3 to 4) times corrects the problem.  The player brags about easy file adding, how you can simply drag and drop to instantly add to the player.  Not so much.  Instead you have to work through either RealPlayer or Windows Media player (neither of which are very agreeable) to get the files to add.  Then once they are added you can't do anything to modify them (as you would be able to if it were truly a simple drag and drop system), so when there are glitches (incorrect order for example) they are impossible to fix without deleting all the files and trying again.  And finally (this is the problem that made me put the player back in it's packaging 6 hours after purchasing it) when I ripped and added music from one of my legally purchased CDs I got an error because apparently I had put protected music on the player, and it could therefore not play it.  My reaction, "fine whatever, it doesn't have to be there."  However, when I tried to delete the files, the player refused.  Insisting that these were protected files that could not possibly be modified or removed.  44.8 MB out of the already minimal "512MB."  That is approximately 9% of the advertised capacity of the player.   Save yourself the trouble of returning it, and do not purchase this product.  I will be returning mine in the morning.

<Date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player reading the reviews in this site. But I relized they were wrong. This player sucks. It does not play some of the audio files, you have to have a cable to connect to the computer. And compated to Creative Muvo, it is very big too. I would recommend a "Do not buy".

<Title>Good player for price
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This previous guy is bluffing. Infact my "512 MB" player shows 492 MB of total space not 485 MB. Which is correct if you consider the way that space on flash drives are calculated. For a flash memory, in the market, 1 MB = 1000 KB and for your computer 1 MB = 1024 KB. When you attach the mp3 player to the computer it calculates the bits according to its system and give a lesser amount. Plus few MBs are used by the system program. This is true for any and all Mp3 players. As far as shuffling goes, it doesn't just shuffle the songs. You need to know how to operate the (very simplest) windows explorer to open the folder of the MP3 player to add the songs. If the songs that are displayed in the folder has the desired order, then the player doesn't shuffle the songs (unless ofcourse the shuffling tool is on).  Finally if you know a little bit about the piracy laws on the original cds, you would be smart enough to rip the songs with a decoding software first, and then load them on the mp3 player.  I mainly use the player for recording lectures and listening to few songs. It works great. The FM radio is also good.

<Content>See Reviewer:    Flodemir Pavanelli "Flod" (Rio de Janeiro, RJ Brazil)  SanDisk MP3 player is very good. Satisfactory regarding the price/benefit. I have bought 2 already, for both daughters. I recommend it if you don't need to load a big ammount of music. It is very fast to load music and create lists.  He gave it only one star, but I think he meant to give it 4 stars since he liked.

<Content>The SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB player works great.  It is easy to load and use and the sound quality isn't bad.  The FM reception is better than others I've tried.  The only trouble I had was that after a month of use, I lost the sound in the right speaker.  I don't abuse the player, but I'm guessing that the wire must have been pulled a bit while I was using it.  I tried a different headset, but it didn't sound as good, so I simply replaced the jack on the original headset and it has worked well ever since.

<Content>I bought this for my daughter who wanted an IPOD so bad.  Needless to say she absolutely loves this MP3 player.  It is fairly small, a little thick but not too bad, works great, has wonderful sound and a long battery life.  No problems with it so far at all.  The 512 MB is perfect for my eight year old, I only put five CD's on it so far at the 64Kbps WMA setting and it has taken up about 100 MB.  Still plenty of room to go.  I liked it so much my wife bought me the 1 GB version for my birthday.  It's a great, simple to use MP3 player and definitely sold at the right price.  I like that it comes with an armband as well, although not the greatest, I hate having to go spend 15 bucks extra to wear the thing while I run.

<Title>Killer Little Device
<Date>Wed Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It came in the mail and I was quite surprised at what you get for the money.  This thing is LOUD. I couldn't believe how loud it got using the earbuds that came with it. They sounded pretty good all the way cranked up. If you are wondering, well put your fears to rest, this thing will be heard over any car, subway or airplane ambient noise. You will be blown away.  I have a feeling my battery won't last too long since I will be cranking it up regularly, but whatever it is, the shear volume of this for the price will make you perfectly justified about your purchase!  The FM radio works just fine. I wish it had AM, but it doesn't. I am in a small city so no surprise it picks it locally well.  I didn't know it also had a built-in stopwatch...funny, but handy if you are a jogger I suppose.  The EQ has common presets, but also allows you to tweak a built-in 5 band equalizer. It's great for two reasons... you see the entire five bands on one screen and when you adjust them hot, the thing gets a lot louder and has plenty of punch.  The blue backlight is tasty and has contrast and brightness levels. It is very easy to read (even my bad eyesight) and the readout shows file names, artist, ID3 tags with scrolling titles, multi display of length, bit rate, repeat, shuffle, a bar that shows the timeline of song, elapsed and time left, if fact you can even adjust the amount of time before it auto shuts off. Several Advanced Menu features.  I haven't tested it recording a loud event but the voice recorder worked very well.  When I plugged it into my Windows XP system, it recognized it, but I was unable to drag and drop files directly to it. I was forced to plug it in again and select "Sync Files" using the Windows Media Player (version 10). I had to drag files to a "playlist" and then hit the "Sync" button to Xfer them to the unit. I didn't install any of the software (which might make it easiere) so who knows, but I can tell you at USB 2.0 it takes about 1 1/2 seconds to transfer a 3MB song file...not too bad.  I was excited enough to pass on the good word about this unit and wanted to testify to it being a good price for what you get @ 512 MB + all the features. - Greg Lawrence

<Title>FANTASTIC Little MP3 Player!!
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this last Saturday at Office Depot, and it's an AWESOME little mp3 player. My old player had run out of space (it was only 256), so I decided to get a bigger one. This one is "bigger" memory-wise, but it's still really small and compact! The radio is good on it, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. The earbuds are just AWESOME, as I think are all amplified earpieces (my Creative earbuds were awesome too). I only have a half-gripe, and that's that the player is only compatible with Windows XP. In order for it to work with my Windows 98 laptop, I had to go through a heck of a time with the drivers and all. Doing an online search in Google Groups helped, and I was soon able to recognize it on the computer and start adding songs. I've added almost all the songs that I love, and I still have about 80-something MB left! All in all, the PERFECT mp3 player for ya. It's got great sound, awesome radio, everything you could want. A must have!

I am able to download songs very easy (i use limeware).  It is very simple to use. If I could do it over agin I would probably get the 1 gig player.  I predict that I am going to fill up this thing pretty quickly.  Expect to be able to load about 100 songs on to this player.  Very good buy.  it is so light that you might forget yuou are even carrying it.

<Content>With the maximum bang for your buck, the Sansa m230 is fantastic. It has low power usage and combined with a pack of rechargeable AAAs and a recharger the "battery low" alert is nonexistent.  512mb is a good compromise, and I am able to get 100-200 songs on average (all dependent on the quality of the music).  The design is good also, all frequent buttons are easily accessible and it fits well in the hand.  Good little player overall.

<Title>Overall, not impressed
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this mp3 player in March or April 2006 to replace my Sony E-505 mp3 player, which kicked the bucket (literally) after I dropped it in one filled with water. Before that I had an iRiver, which was a fantastic player, but I was attracted to the Sansa mainly because of its price, which is excellent considering the features you get. The Sansa comes equipped with radio tuners, some nifty playlist sorters, a stopwatch, a voice recorder and a sports armband, among other things. It is also programmed to work with Windows, so music downloading is very easy. Overall, it seemed like a good deal.  Well, I wanted to wait to write my review so I could comment on its durability. I'm glad I waited, because it's now June, and the Sansa inexplicably died a few days ago. It keeps coming up with an error message that says that the drive is full, but then it says that there are no songs on the player. I've tried changing the battery, hooking it up to the computer and fiddling with the controls, but nothing works. Granted, I used it a lot- mainly during workouts- but I never abused it. Even under heavy usage, a flash drive mp3 player should last a lot longer than three months. Additionally, I was only marginally satisfied with the sound quality of the player, and the battery life was not that great. Of course, it only uses one AAA battery, but I had to change it every week.  My recommendation? If you're serious about your music and/or plan to use your player a lot, spend a little more money and get a better and more durable one. Sony and iRiver both make excellent mp3 players that are well worth the extra money.

<Content>This was my first mp3 player and i have to say that i am pretty impressed. It has great battery life and transfers music quickly and easily. I have had it for about six months now and havent expierenced any major problems with it. I am a little dissappointed though because the little display screen cracked so now when the player is turned on all you see is a blank screen with a giant blue dot in the middle. I would reccomend it for some one with a small music collection because it only holds around 127 songs. I have a quite a big collection so i am thinking about getting the 2 gb player, but if you have never owened an mp3 player before i would strongly suggest getting one of these! They are very easy to learn how to use and are also very tough! {mine has been dropped countless times on tile and wood floors.} I would have only given this player 4 stars because of the cracked screen but it is just so great that i had to give it 5!

<Content>I am amazed that such quality can come in such a small package and at such a small price. I can get about 12 albums on the half gig of memory. So that I have ready access to my music, I have ripped a number of albums into wma format and I store them on a DVD disk. It is very easy to delete albums from the mp3 player and to drag new ones from the DVD disk through my computer.  I would love to have them accessible by folder, rather than album, but what can you expect for under $50.00.  I think the ear buds are excellent, as opposed to some reviewers.

<Title>Excellent Recommendation from a Colleague
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A colleague actually recommended this to me, which I initially thought was counter-intuitive - after all, I know several people with iPods who swear by them, and the iPod is very prominent in the media.  But I actually sided with my colleague and gave this SanDisk a shot.    The button size is great, allowing me to easily change tracks or adjust the volume without even looking at the player.  The menu is simple and easy to navigate.  The backlight is quite useful, and the amount of time it is active can be adjusted.  The included radio is a nice touch as well.  The number of hours of operation from a single AAA battery is quite impressive.    My only complaint:  It would be nice if the track names scrolled faster.    This may not be as "glorious" as an iPod, but then again, music is music.

<Title>SanDisk MP3 player
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to use when I'm running.  Fortunately for me, my brother downloaded everything for me, but he did say that it was easy to do.  He was able to put 67 songs on it, although I think it could have taken more.  The MP3 player serves it purpose very well!  It's easy to use and sound quality is great!

<Title>Simple and inexpensive MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I found the Sansa a simple and inexpensive MP3 player.  Liked it enough to later buy the belt clip. Important to note that I mainly use it while exercising so 100 songs is more than enough for me.

<Title>Worked for 2 weeks, then quit
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Initially I really liked this player, but it had its drawbacks.  Pros: 1)Cheap price 2)Not an Apple 3)FM Tuner 4)Voice recorder - which works pretty well.  Cons: 1)Volume control was hard to adjust 2)Interface was different on different computers. What I mean by this is that files I downloaded onto one computer could not be viewed on another. I have no idea why. 3)Could not "Click and drag" files into a created folder and still have them accessible when player was unpluged from the usb port. 4)All non-music files wound up in a folder titled "Unknown Artist". Since most of the mp3 files I listen to are not music files, this made making a playlist impossible. 5) Unplugging the player from the computer automatically rearranges all the files in folders different than the ones created on the computer. 6) Flash drive copies non music files from a computer, but cannot be seen on a different computer. 7) iTunes, Rahpsody and Windows Media Player all interface poorly with this player. Rhapsody is the best, but you have no control as to where the files go once the player is unplugged (see point #5). 8)Armband was too small. 9)After 2 weeks it would not play back any mp3 files. The display would read that all the audio files were 0.00/0.00 meaning that the files were zero seconds into a zero second audio file. The player would just run through all the files in an album continuously without playing any of them. These all were files which were able to be played back during the first 2 weeks. It is for this reason that I am returning the player.  Maybe I just have a faulty player, since most of the other reviewers seem to have had a positive experience with it. I'm returning it and not requesting a replacement. It seems that all MP3 players are a gamble as far as quality is concerned.

<Content>I absolutely love this player. Its small, easy to transfer files to using windows media player. Transfer of files is a lil slow but then its not something you do everyday. I got it at an absolute steal price from Amazon and am really happy with my choice. Will highly recommend. The in-built FM Radio is a bonus!

<Title>Awesome, and such a cute mp3 player!
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this mp3 player for Christmas last year, and I just love it. It's small, light weight, and I think the design is very cute! Sure, it's definitely not in the league of the iPod, but if you want something not too expensive that can hold a decent number of songs, then this is perfect. It also has an FM radio, and a recorder, which is a nice little bonus :)  Doesn't break very easily either -I've dropped it God knows how many times and it still works as well as it did when I first got it. I have a friend who has this mp3 player as well, and she told me that it broke after a week - but after I took a look at it, it turned out it was just her headphones that had become frayed and broken, not the mp3 player (headphones tend to break easily, even high quality ones). So, if you're using this and you think it's broken, try getting new headphones first before you get a new mp3 player.

<Title>Great Sound, Easy to use, and Long battery life.
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was a little skeptical when I first bought this but it has proved to be a great purchase, with only one exception, the USB cable is INCREDIBLY SHORT!! I swear it is only like eight or nine inches long and that can get to be very annoying. Other than that I love this MP3 player. I would recomend it to anyone in the market for one. The sound is really good, though I dont use the headphones included with the player, and the batteries last about 20 hrs with everyday use.   After I first bought it and found how flimsy the case included with it was I bought a slicone one for about eight or ten dollars and it does a really good job. If you get this MP3 player get the more expensive case. You'll be much happier in the end.   All in all this is a great buy.

<Title>Very good little player
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for a replacement for an old Rio Sport that finally just must have gotten dropped too many times. I looked into the Shuffle, but since I've not used iTunes, was used to a display, and didn't see the need to spend twice the money, I went with this one.  I really like it. The controls and menus are more intutive for me than the Rio's, and the display is nice and big. I was looking solely for a workout player - no need for the big jukebox - and this delivers. I do wish that it came with a belt clip - the only option that arrives in the box is the arm band - but I think it's just a matter of getting used to running with something on my arm. I may try to rig it with a lanyard, but that's just a personal preference.  The battery life appears to be great. The radio works, the ear buds are typical for this kind of player (in other words, if you have headphones you already like, you could just use them - for a workout, these are fine for me.)  It does not have a slot to expand the memory, but again, for my workout purposes, I don't need more than what's here in the first place. I don't want to work out to every song that I own, and I use the random function to avoid repetitive workout soundtracks. The 512 memory holds enough that I don't hear every song every day by any means, and sometimes it takes two or three before I feel that I've covered everything.   I think this is a great value for the money. I don't have enough "peppy songs" to justify a bigger memory for more money. My gym does have TVs with audio routed through a radio, so the little extras like the radio - rarely used, but available - sent me straight to this one over the more expensive iPod options, and I'm very pleased with the results. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? I don't know, and now I can't change it! It doesn't feel like a "rave about it" product, but I will say that it works perfectly, is a great value, and I can find nothing negative to say.

<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Cheap and easy to use, the M230 is my workout companion and holds about 8 hours of my high quality VBR MP3s.  The documentation is lacking a bit however and it took me a few minutes to figure out some features.  But for plug-and-play get up and go it works very well.  If you're looking for something cheap, small and easy to use, this is for you.

<Title>Not really a good buy and customer support is awful.
<Date>Wed Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My player has been a little buggy since Day One.  The design is clunky and the plastic wrist strap "contraption" is a nightmare; getting the player into it is like trying to fit a wet sock over a boot. Downloading a 5-minute song can take a quarter of an hour(!), so those juicy multi-song transfers are out of the question. Error messages come up all the time during transfer and tech support from SanDisk has involved complete re-formatting of the player several times.  I shipped the player back to SanDisk for a replacement. Although the company is located practically in my backyard - the San Francisco Bay area - the player had to be shipped to North Carolina. SanDisk uses UPS, which is another nightmare.  The replacement player has yet to arrive and the best SanDisk can do is tell me the player will arrive in 3-4 business days.  They've been telling me this for several weeks and nothing has shown up. The Radio Shack I bought the thing at tells me they get a lot of returns and complaints with SanDisk MP3 players.  Well, the price was great but now I know I need to get something more upscale and not the feeble toy this turned out to be.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this for my sister for the car rides up to our cabin.  She's only 13 years old and has a pretty good knowledge of computers... kids these days usually do. Althought I would have to say that to get the songs onto the mp3 player might be difficult for her.  I think one of the most important things about a mp3 player is the software it uses to organize that songs and the way they're put onto the mp3 player.  This uses WMP and personally I hate that program.  It's useless.  I've used iTunes and I have never used anything easier to use than iTunes.  I'd buy an iPod because of iTunes.  Pros: Easily find songs. Battery life. Buttons are easy to press. Dedicated sound control. FM radio works great... at least in Wisconsin it does :)  Cons: Voice recorder sucks. Black light could be a lot better. Getting songs on and making a playlist is often a burden. Included software sucks. The manual says that one is able to drop mp3 songs into the harddrive folder but if you do this and use Windows Media Player(WMP) it screws up the mp3 player and you'll have to reformat it losing all the songs/files on the mp3 player.

<Date>Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to replace an earlier Sandisk MP3 player that wore out after four years (would no longer make decent connection with the head phones). I use it almost exclusively while I am at the gym or jogging. The arm band and cheap protective case is ideal for this use.  I did buy OEM headphones at Wal-Mart for under $5.00, as I find that the ear buds are unconfortable and will slip out once I have worked up a sweat. Would highly recommend the Sandisk MP3 player for this type of use.

<Title>Great for my 8 year old daughter
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought this hoping our 8 year old daughter would use this as much as her portable CD player. We got tired of buying CDs only to have them scratched or lost. We got tired of burning CDs and seeing them scratched too! So, we figured the deal on this particular MP3 (in blue) was music to our ears. It solved the problem and the old CD player is now collecting dust.  Comes with a plastic sleeve that holds the MP3 player and an armband. Also, earbuds that has been working pretty well so far. We have had it a while now and she takes the darn thing everywhere we go (and even to bed). I would reccomend this for someone who is capable of handling a CD player.

<Title>Ingrates for Ipods
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This doesn't feel right.  I'm going to give a negative review to something that was purchased for me, something that was a very generous gift.  Does that make me an ingrate?  I really do appreciate it, it was a very well meaning gift and- based on what we knew about it beforehand- seemed like quite the prize.  But here's the problem.  First of all, it holds about six hours of music.  That may seem like a lot.  It seems like a lot when it's empty.  It seems like a lot if you don't have a huge music collection.  You could certainly load it with just your favorite songs and have lots of good music to accompany your jog or whatever.  But if you have hundreds of CD's, a giant bootleg collection, and/or you want to put new things on it, books on CDs to have incase you're stuck on the bus for example, then six hours is really not a lot.  So every time I add something, I have to pick something to delete.  Not only is it time-consuming, it's heart-breaking.  Second of all, the radio.  My dear, dear, dear, dear loved ones who bought me this chose it over an ipod because it also has FM radio on it, and they knew I liked to listen to the radio sometimes.  But the reception is terrible, so I find myself still bringing along a separate radio walkman thingy when I want to listen to the radio.  It's also FM only, so no sports, no Air Americer.  So that was a disappointment, but again, nobody's fault, but thought I should warn you.  Third, it is suppose to come with free music and programming from certain services, but that turns out to come with a catch.  What you really have to do is sign up for those services, complete with giving your credit card info, and then cancel after the freebies.    Also, I had a quicker internet connection at work, downloaded some bootlegs from nugs dot com, then tried to put them on the MP3 player from that computer at work.  It messed things up.  Now my computer at home, the computer at work, and the MP3 player are all confused, and they are all blaming me.  I don't know, maybe that was a no-no, maybe Ipods do the same thing.  They don't trust you, assume the worst if you try to change from one site to another.  Anyway, a well intentioned gift but not what I'd buy again.  It might be a nice little MP3 player if you just want something small and relatively inexpensive just to treadmill with, if you just want your favorite up-tempo work-out songs with you.  But if you want the complete Beethoven ouvre, a couple of Dick's Picks, and still have room to put on that Buckshot LeFonque CD you never got around to checking out, along with that import live Love Supreme... it just won't do the trick.  Hey, did I tell you, a buddy of mine got me a bootleg of Hendrix and B.B. King jamming together.  He also had the rooftop Beatles concert.  Did you even know that was out there?  It's a brave new world.  Thanks for listening.

<Title>A great "starter player" that you can get for next to nothing
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I could not figure out what the big deal was about MP3 players.  People were happily spending hundreds of dollars for something that, while extremely cool looking, seemed to me like a glorified Walkman/Discman?    Somebody got me an M230 for my birthday, though, and it's changed my life. I'm literally listening to as much music now as I did when I was a teenager.  The Sandisk is lightweight, just slightly larger than a Bic cigarette lighter; it holds about six hours worth of music; and it has great sound.   The weight is perfect, easily shirt-pocketable, and you don't have to worry about jostling it at all.  Using a car adapter, I was also able to play it while driving and it sounds great, even coming through my ratty car speakers.  And no, you can't put 1,000 songs on it -- only about 130. But I have such a huge music collection, I think I'd go crazy if I could put a massive chunk of it on my player.  I actually find that if I put 100 songs on it, after about a week it's a lot of fun to go through and cull the stuff I don't listen to and add stuff I've either bought during the week or suddenly rememebered I wanted to hear. I like that it forces me to be a little selective.  Plus, the bottom line is that this is now selling for less than fifty bucks. If you're not into MP3 players, you can check it out for about the cost of three or four CDs. If you like it -- and you probably will, as have the people I've given this to as gifts -- you can always pay an arm and a leg for an iPod later.

<Title>A great entry level MP3 player
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've never had a MP3 player so I didn't know what to expect ordering the M230.OD had the player for $29.99 after a bunch of mail in rebates but I decided to go with the Shure E2c offer through Amazon which made the player free.   The player feels a little cheap since it's so light weight but it works super. I expected to need some time before being able to load & play songs, but I didn't. As soon as I connected to my USB port I could drag and drop songs. The earbuds are better than expected and are nearly as good as the Shure E2c's. The FM reception is very good. The only serious negative is the users guide which is truely useless. I also purchased the silicone protective cover which fits perfectly and has a belt clip.

<Content>I recently purchased the SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player and I love it!  I listen to a lot of books on audio and find this little player is perfect.  The sound quality is excellent. Its easy to connect to your computer and download MP3's using Media Player.  My only complaint is that its hard to cross over on playlists that are loaded on the player.  Once you get the hang of it, its easy to navigate.

<Title>Good overall, customizing playlist is so-so
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>These are the only 3 things that bother me about this device.  All other features are awesome!  1. Customizing a playlist is a pain.  The manual says that it sorts things automatically and it's easy to view them ... this is not true.  I use this mp3 player mostly to listen to audio lessons, and most of my files are titled something like "Lesson 1A", "Lesson 1B", and so on. I tried giving them different track numbers and albums, but the sort it comes up with is all wacko ... never in the chronological lesson order that it once was in the CDs.  In fact, I don't know what kind of sorting it uses.  It's not by name, title, track, album, nor date.  I tried a variety of combinations and it's hopeless.  The only workaround I found was to change the album name and only play this album.  But I have to do this per lesson set, instead I wanted to list them (all the tracks in all the CDs) per artist.  I had a Rio500 player and I was able to customize the list in the order I wanted and the device would show them in that order only.  I really miss this feature.  2. The repeat AB feature is not very quick. If you want a portion repeated in a loop, you need to press the A section a couple of seconds sooner to start the repeat cycle later ... always have to rewind and try again because the loop is just never timed right the first time.  3. Cannot rewind from beginning of one file to end of the previous file.  This feature is really useful if you have like a 30 min audio and want to get to the very end.  For this device, you have to start forwarding from the beginning, which takes forever.

<Content>My usage is not the usual one of playing music. It is to listen to the radio when doing boring computer tasks and highway driving over long distances. The computer work needs produce sound for others to hear. The radio in the car has been stolen two so needs to be kept separately from the car. It accomplishes all these goals extremely well.

<Title>Best kept secret in consumer electronics
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm extremley grateful to Amazon and all the great reviewers for steering me towards the Sansa M230's direction. I've had it for a couple of days now and I love it. I'm not much of a music fan so at first I was lukewarm about purchasing an mp3 player. I didn't need to hold 1000 songs, so I needed something that was cheap, reliable and didn't have that cheap iPod wannabe look that so many other mp3 players had. The Sansa fit my needs perfectly. I would suggest everyone get one, even if you're not much of a music fan. I personally use it for listening to podcasts as well as music and it's a nice balance, and also 512mb might not seem like a lot but it does the job for me. The controls are very easy to figure out. Compared to the iPod the Sansa's advantage is its price, the more solid and compact design as well as the fact that you have option of picking a online music retail store of your choice instead of being married to iTunes.    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BONJXU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0905521-3220428">SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player (Blue)</a>

<Content>THE SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player (Blue)is a great player for the cheap price. It holds between 96-103 songs depending on how long your songs are. The only reason why I gave it 1 less star because 2 weeks after using the player the headphones didn't work in one ear. Also I do not like how the fm station works, you have to go back to the menu to change the station instead of just hitting the next button to go to your desired next preset station. Overall the sound is great!!!

<Content>I've Had this mp3 player for only one day and I am VERY surprised! It is very loud and the earbuds are great!  The mp3 player is tiny and light weight. The only thing I have to say wrong is that it feels a bit flimsy and tacky, but as long as you take care of it it's great. It has a stopwatch, equalizer (which has modes classical, jass, rock ,pop and custom)  The backlight isn't bad but I haven't tryed the voice recorder yet. The FM radio reception is quite good. It's quite easy to download songs (although I don't use the internet to do it) It's quick and easy to rip songs off cds. The Battery life is great.  I hoped you liked my review

<Title>Good MP3 player for the money
<Date>Fri Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 player. I didn't want to spend a bundle in case it gets lost, stolen or broken. I read the reviews and this seemed like a good choice. It works quite well and is easy to put songs on from the computer. Just copies files or whole directories over via Windows Explorer and it's done. The sound quality is good although the supplied ear bud headphones are not great. It's easy to use. The only complaint so far it I can't figure out how to make a playlist work. I also like the idea of a standard battery AAA that's easy to replace. I heard it's very expensive to replace the recharageable battery in the more popular MP3 player. I encode my CD's at 192 kbits/sec and can fit 7 albums on a 512 Mbyte player.

<Content>The price was good, but the instructions are minimal.  You need to be running Windows XP with Windows Media Player 10.  I had to upgrade both of these.  Also, you need to run the installation CD.  The instructions made it sound like it was optional; just for extra features.  So it was frustrating trying to figure out how to use it, but now that I got it figured out, it is working well.

<Content>I got this as a bonus with another purchase, but I had been wanting another mp3 player because I'm just too lazy to keep swapping songs off my primary player.  This one is very nice.  The controls are easy to figure out.  It's easy to get songs onto it....just plug into a USB port, open windows explorer and drag and drop your mp3 or wma files onto it. No drivers or software necessary.    I am not pleased with it's unesthetic design, but I can live with it (it was free, after all), nor am I happy that you can not attach it to anything (like a keychain, or carry strap or even the arm band it comes with) without first putting it into it's little plastic protective case.  That's why it only gets 4 stars.

<Title>Great Little MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for my wife and she loves it.  She uses it every day and hasn't had any problems.  Every night she loads up her MP3's and her audio books (WMA format) via the handy USB connector.  This is a simple player, without the bells and whistles, but it gets the job done.  If you are looking for a lot of features you might want to look elsewhere.    The only issue that she has mentioned is that sometimes the names of files don't display correctly.  I think that has to do with the metadata that is stored with high quality MP3's, and unfortunately is not included with some homemade music files.  Bottom Line: This is a functional, affordable, highly portable digital music player.  It supports WAV, MP3 & WMA files and has a cool blue LCD backlight.  A digital Jukebox in your pocket, that won't empty your wallet... hard to beat that!

The Sandisk M230 replaced a similar player I was using before misplaing it (the former made by Creative Labs).  I had previously purchased and configured a similar SanDisk player as a gift.    I can say that the SanDisk is rock steady in its mp3 file handling and navigation.  The fast-forward/rewind feature (within a track) works very well and is an important feature when listening to audio books where a single track can easily be longer than 20 minutes.  I also find the sleep function to be very useful in preserving battery life (I often drift to sleep listening to a book).  Sound quality is very good for a portable player.  The ability to drag-and-drop songs using Windows File Explorer is also a great thing -- much nicer than being forced to use a custom interface (this means you, iTunes).  Finally, I tend to rip tracks at variable bitrates and my audio books at a non-standard sampling rate -- the SanDisk has handled all of my tracks without issue (so far).  This is a great player for the current price (about half the price of a single new audio book and free shipping to boot).

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this product since it was introduced. It is a sturdy, strong device.  OK, first of all I would like to ask, Why does everyone need an 80 GB Ipod? This Mp3 Player holds at least 99 songs, or at least mine does. An 80 GB Ipod might have the photo features, but who cares? The Mp3 player is for songs. This Mp3 player has long battery life for using 1 AAA battery.    This Mp3 player is a modern marvel. It's small, it works, it has all an Mp3 player needs, and it's sturdy.  This Mp3 player is approx. 2 inches long, 1.5 cm tall, and 1.5 cm wide. Its small enough to fit in you pocket without creating a prominent(odd looking) bulge. It looks good on your arm if your wearing it, and has good default earplugs.   I also see that some people put the tag "defective" on this player. I ask those people, "What are you talking about?" This Sansa is all you really need. Of course the microphone isn't all that great, but that's not what you got the Mp3 player for anyway. This Mp3 player plays songs, shuffles them, and can skip around through them. What more do you want? A lot of people have the most expensive Mp3 player out there, and have a whole lot of extra gadgets. Why do you need a calender on your Mp3 player?  This Mp3 player has a flash memory, which means it has no moving parts, so it's durable, and you can have it bouncing around your pocket all day. This is an ideal Mp3 player for kids, and clumsy adults. I have dropped my Sansa on the floor at least 300 times, and even when I was playing songs, the Sansa didn't skip a beat. It still works after 2 or 3 years of playing and dropping.   So..., let me wrap it up:  Pros/Pluses: * Long lasting battery * A type of battery where you don't need a charger * Durable * OK looking. * Enough memory to last for 4 hours of songs. * An easy to understand control system.  Neither:   The power doesn't go on directly, you have to hold in the menu button, but this is obvious, otherwise it would turn on or off without your will in your pocket, and your batteries will go empty.  Cons/ Negatives: - The installation software is not needed, yet they send it with it still.  To close, The Sandisk Sansa M230 is an excellent player, with limited features, but with a low price tag, and a great player, I would recommend it to family and friends.  PS: Currently 3 of my friends, and my father has this player.

<Content>I think this MP3 player is well worth what I paid for it.  I does not have some fancy (and really unnecessary) features, but it serves its purpose, and so far my kids haven't had any problems with it.  Unless you are a show-off, you needn't buy any other - a more expensive - player. This one is quite good. Period.

<Title>Sandisk 1GB (Silver)
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 1GB silver Sandisk is great. You can download songs very easily, and it comes with a computer disk that gives you a walkthrough of how to do it.  It has a great FM radio that has 20 available presets, and a voice recorder that works very well. The only thing that I do not like about it is that i havent yet figured out how to delete songs. You only need to use 1 AAA battery, and it lasts a very long time. It is small and lightweight, so it can go pretty much anywhere. The menu is easy to read, and the buttons are big so that you dont have to try and push little tiny ones. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a mp3 player.

<Title>Audible Users Beware
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this player to listen to Audible Books.  Audible lists this player on their site and it came from SanDisk bundled with information about Audible Books.  You would think that it would be suitable for listening to Audible Books.  BEWARE!  I used it in my car and stopped and started the player as I ran errands.  Most of the time when restarted it jumped ahead about 4 minutes and I had to rewind and try to find my place.  I contacted SanDisk Support and they told me that it was a "limitation" on the player due to buffering.  I told them that any consumer would consider it a defect and would never purchase it for this use if they were aware of this "limitation".  I asked that they provide me a player that was suitable for this use.  They never replied to this request.  I would avoid SanDisk products as they misrepresented this player and do not stand behind their products.

<Title>A great little value player, easy to use and plays just about everything.
<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recently purchased this Sandisk Sansa m230, and I must say I am impressed.  For the price, this little model is easy to use, and the MP3 and WMA files are all working with it.  So far, the Playforsure is true to its name.  Best part, this model has become more affordable, most 512mb players near 80-100 dollars, except some cheaper models that can have problems with WMA files and some MP3s.  My brother has a little GPX 128 player, and it has done fair as well. Easy to load, it uses Windows media player to transfer files via a USB connection.  The menus are easy to learn and navagate thru as well.  I also enjoyed playing with the equalizer, which has a custom setting, as well as some preset settings. The sound is actually pretty good as well.  I haven't had it long enough to find out battery life yet. But it does store quite enough music, 120+ songs depending on size or type.  Now that I have this little system, I may be daring enough someday to purchase a jukebox size system and load it.  Either way, this is easy to use, fraction of the cost of some of the other brands, and plays most formats of music files. To boot, it comes with a little plastic sleave and belt attachment, or a band to attach to the arm.  Also included are the earbuds and cord, and a disc with window media player and other software offers.  A+ in my book.   Note Update: This player does not play the MP4 file, which is what itunes uses, so itunes users sorry. My other MP3s are compatable so far still. And battery life seems to be now toward at 10+ hours now.   Note again:Had about 2 months now, no problems, battery life starting with a fresh duracell is about 12 hours give or take.

We have had it for a few weeks and everything is going great.  The player has really good sound, the controllers are easy to use, and we like the arm band that comes with the player.  I would recommend this player to anyone who wants an easy to setup and use MP3 player.

<Title>Works with Linux
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first mp3 player, and I am very pleased with it - and amazed by the number of features it has at such a low price.  The product description talks about the various encumbered music systems it works with, but it also works with simple drag 'n drop under Linux. The player appears on the desktop as a USB jumpdrive. You simply drag album folders to the Sansa to transfer your music, then the player automatically updates its index when you disconnect the USB cable. Music is indexed by: album title, artist, song title, genre, and year - all automatically, with no special software needed on your computer. Deleting music from the player is just the same, right-click on a song to delete, and the player rebuilds its library list.  The player itself is well made and easy to use. The instruction booklet covers only the basics, but there is a larger manual on the enclosed mini-disk.   My only regret is that I did not buy one with a larger memory.

<Title>good for Rhapsody
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like my Sansa because it's compatible with Napster and Rhapsody subscription services.  Pay x dollars a month for unlimited downloads to your Sansa.  They only last a month, though, and then you have to redownload.  Digital rights is a pain, but if you're going to pay for music, it's the best value.  My only complaint with the player is that the volume could be louder at its highest setting.

<Content>I got this MP3 player because my sister has one and loves it.  I've had mine about 8 months and love it.  2 weeks ago, mine fell into 2 inches of water, and stayed submerged about 5 hours.  I tried drying it out, but the next evening it still didn't work, so I ordered a new one.  2 nights later, I just decided to try it once more before tossing it, and lo and behold, it works just fine!  All of my music is still on it, and I've been working out and jogging with it since.  That is a pretty darn good product test if you ask me!

<Title>Don't buy an iPod, buy a Sandisk
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Sandisk Sansa m230 on Wednesday, August 30th. This little blue guy is great for me and my brother and sisters. It doesn't hold that much songs but that's just us.   Anyway, iPods are really overrated these days.  They're expensive and fragile.  Bottom line.  Get a Sandisk for cheaper.  Sandisk is made better and it's just better.  Even though this mp3 player isn't the best on earth, it still rocks! Here's my Pros and Cons for my m230:  Pros 1. Big screen easy to read 2. Big front buttons 3. Pretty easy to use 4. More options for backlight (backlight is only blue) 5. great sound! 6. Long battery life 7. Great FM radio, mic for recorder 8. Come with plastic case to protect from scratches and smudges. 9. it's loud!  Cons: 1. Small volume and menu button (not much of a biggie) 2. if you like a lot of music this isn't for you! 3. Sometimes it randomizes the order of your songs 4. You can't rename files once they're on the Sansa 5. Some songs may be louder or lower than others on the same volume  That's about it.  Overall, I give the Sansa 4 stars because even though it's great, it's still got some cons.   I hope you found my review helpful!

<Content>THis Mp3 player can hold up to 110 songs depending on how many megabites your songs are. The screen is big and lights up blue with option to keep it on for 3,5,10,35,45,60 seconds or have it always on. Another great thing about this Mp3 player is that it takes triple A batteries meanwhile AN iPOD probably takes cell batteries with are expensive and hard to find. THis Mp3 player has very good sound and feels like your  listening to the song at a concert. :) :) :)

<Title>A great alternative to that OTHER mp3 player
<Date>Sat Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player  Last year as I was listening to my bulky CD Walkman, I kept seeing kids on the street with those tiny neon headphones on. That's the sign of an ipod user and a sign of the times. So, while I tried my best to save my money to buy one, I noticed that a local store had the Sandisk Sansa for an After-Thanksgiving Sale, so while others were standing in line at four in the morning to get an Xbox, I rushed in to get this Sansa.  If you can't afford an ipod yet and just want an mp3 player just to have an mp3 player (you can always upgrade later), I'd go with this one. True, it may not hold as many songs as an ipod but all I do is take the bus to work and drive any other time, so I don't need to listen to that many songs. Basically, I'm just fascinated with the mp3 player itself. With my CD Walkman, I have to use up two AA batteries in about 1 1/2 weeks while having to either listen to the same CD over and over or take a CD carrying case with me full of other CD's (which makes the Walkman even bulkier). With this, I can use one AAA battery for about 2-3 weeks and download about seven full-length albums on here. And it fits right in my pocket, always a plus.  There are a few cons: the headphones only last for about six months, when you "lock" the player by using the HOLD button, you hear static in the headphones, and the light isn't very strong, making it a pain to search for songs in a dark location (like on a red-eye flight). But you get what you pay for, I guess. I'll be "cool" someday and get an ipod or whatever else is in these days but for now, I'm happy with this Sansa. -EJR

<Title>Great MP3 player for a great price!
<Date>Sat Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to give to my mother for her birthday.  I am downloading songs so she won't have to. I found it pretty easy to figure out how to download songs. She is not very computer literate.  I think she will be able to operate this player quite easily.  The buttons are very easy to operate.  I like that it has an FM receiver so if you are tired of listening to the songs you have downloaded, you can just switch to the radio.  And the fact that it has a voice recorder is a great plus.  I figure she can use it while on her morning walk and if she needs to remind herself to pick up something from the store she can just make a quick voice memo for herself.  The blue backlight is really neat.  It includes a case and an armband--usually not included in other MP3's.  A great little MP3 for a great price!  **UPDATE**My mom LOVES this MP3 player!  I was a little worried about giving it to her, as she has never owned one, but I can't get it out of her hands!  She thinks it is easy to operate---this coming from a woman who doesn't know how to operate a VCR or DVD player!!! She is amazed at the sound quality of the headphones, too. This has been her most favorite birthday gift ever!

<Content>I'll make it short. When I first got it, it was hard to use, there's a bit of a learning curve to setting the fm tuners, adding music, making a favorites list. But you'll get it. One of the downsides is that you have to use Windows Media Player lol. The battery life is amazing. You can have about 150 songs on this thing, it just depends. So yeah, get it, it's good. iPods break and are expensive; buy a Sandisk. :D

<Content>I have been using this product for about a month now, and besides the capacity, no complaints.  Other than the volume, the controlls are very intuitive.  The menu system is easy to navigate, and the included arm band(optional with I-POD) come in very handy.  Congrats to Sandisk, and I see the new Sansa is even better.

<Title>Great Value For The Money
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good little player, especially for those who don't want an ipod.  It has many features, works perfectly, has easy drag-and-drop file loading,and has a long battery life that is easily replaced (one AAA battery). The controls are easy and it is perfectly loud enough.  It lost a star because it is a smaller player with only 512 MB of space.  This is great for me since I have zero problems with changing out my songs every week or so.  If you want more space, they make 1 and 2 GB players also.  I would imagine they are equally as good. If you want a good quality, true-to-the-advertising, universally compatible player, this one is for you.

<Content>Got this for my six year old who just had to have an ipod.  This was a very economical and efficient way to fulfill her request.  She loves it since it displays the song names, the shuffle does not.  Radio option is also great.  So easy to use and great sound.  Could not have asked for a better deal on a great product.  Both mom and daughter are thrilled!

<Title>Excellent Buy For The Money! ! !
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the money, this player can't be beat.  I've used Sandisk products since the mid 90's and always been pleased with the performance and this m230 is no exception.  I've read some of the negative reviews on this site and anyone that gives this unit less than four stars should have their head examined.  I must admit, I'm rather savvy when it comes to computers and I build all of my own systems from the ground up, but that aside, I have accessed and used every feature on this player without reading the included manual or the complete reference on the disc.  It's very intuitive and had no problem using any of the features.  I've loaded 24 albums (64kbs WMA) onto the player with some room to spare.  Quality of playback is excellent, as good as any iPod I've used.  Equalizer makes a big difference when adjusted appropriately with my Sony Mega Bass earbuds.  With a 2.0 USB port, load time for each album is about 15-30 seconds.  No complaints and I'd definitely buy another if this one goes out.  I forgot to mention that I currently have 113 songs loaded on the m230 in 64 kb/s WMA format and I'm using 220 MB of the 483 MB available on the device. . . By that measure, 248 songs can be loaded, which would break down to about 22 albums of music. On the plus side, the lower capacity gives a person the incentive to more frequently rotate the music selection. Sound quality is perfectly acceptable at the 64 kb/s sampling rate. Gives you twice the storage space of 128 kb/s MPS's, so I'll opt for the WMA. I also have a 20GB iRiver PMP 120 and the same music has been on it for the last year. . .

<Title>Crud
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 512 mb SanDisk Sansa m230 on sale for 60 bucks. That was about a month ago. A week it stopped working, for no good reason. I can't use any of the features at all.  This was a total waste of money. Before this, I had a chintzy little 20 dollar mp3 player that lasted 7 months...That's 6 months longer than this sleek, attractive, "ergonomic" piece of junk held out.

<Title>Great Player, Good Value...Superior to Creative Player
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned three Creative Zen Nano players: 256mb, 512, and 1 GB. The rirst I put the battery in backwards in (I imagine this will probably fry any player...), the second the one-off switech jsut died, and the third the memory got corrupted for unknown reasons. I just bought the m230 because I thought I might havve better luck. I can't say how thngs will turn out in the long run, but the first few hours find me very impressed with the m230 compared to the Zen players. Pros- * volume can be much louder (more chance to destroy your hearing :)) * displayed mp 3 information is much more visible and extensive * ability to play by genre, title, artist gives more flexibility than the Zen * AAA battery. (so do the Zen players) I mention this because some mentioned this as a negative. I am still using the alkaline that came with it, but I'd recommend getting MiMH rechargeables. You should find that they last much longer and the cost is very little since they cna be recharged a hundred times or so...I haven't had one die on me yet so I don't know how long they last. They easily pay for themselves in a short time.  Cons:  * Inferior clear plastic sleeve that is the "case". There is an optiona! It will be my next Amazon purchase. * The Quick Start guide skips things like setting FM presets. The full manual is online but you aren't told of its existence. Do a Google search for "Sansa m230 manual" or go to the Sandisk site.

<Title>You get what you pay for.
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned this device since December 2005. If all you want to do is drag and drop mp3 files and play, it is OK for that. But beware! For virtually any other audio use, look elsewhere. For audible.com content the player injects static every minute or so making the listening intolerable. I've been unable to make it work with subscription music services, like Yahoo To Go. Every few days I have to reset the battery to basically cold boot the device as the buttons stop working.  Also be aware that this device has two different modes, which I still haven't quite figured out, making it difficult to use on different computers. There is a mp3 file on mine I have never been able to get off because I loaded it from a PC I no longer have access to.    Sandisk's technical service is non-existent. Sandisk's website is also useless.  My recommendation would be to look elsewhere.

<Title>Solved the playlist sort problem, and it's not bad...
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I actually like the feel and the value of this player quite a bit, but there are a few key challenges.  The controls are laid out in an ergonomic fashion, and I've found the display fairly easy to read.  I suggest you change the default backlight time to stay on longer, say 45 seconds, lest it frustrate you in the dark by shutting off prematurely.  This brings up one of the three negatives I've found:  The player appears to go into a power-saving mode after a certain amount of battery life is exhausted.  This means the backlight will not come on no matter what you do, until the battery recovers (after being turned off for a while) or is replaced.  Since I always carry a spare battery with me, I'd prefer the player operate 100% until it runs out of juice.  I often use it at night, and this frustrates me a little.  One of the positive aspects, the easy-access battery cover, has turned into a slight negative.  It's just a little loose, and is prone to pop off if you drop the player.  I could see having to put a little piece of tape on it at some point in the future to hold it together.  The last issue I had is something a number of people have complained about, and I believe I have found the solution...  The seemingly random play order experienced by myself and others seems to have something to do with the ID3 tags on the MP3 files themselves.  Rather than using your directory structure as a way of sorting the music, the Sansa sorts by artist and album all by itself, based on info from the ID3 tags.   The songs that weren't sorting in proper album order had one of two things in common:  They were either a v2.2 ID3 tag, and/or had a total track number (as in 3 of 12) as part of the tag.  The way I solved this in iTunes (I use MP3 in iTunes, not AAC) was to highlight any tracks with an "of xx" track number, right-click to "Get Info," and eliminate the number (where xx is the total number of tracks on the album).  NOTE: Leave the track number (first number) alone!  Then I highlighted ALL the tracks in the album, right-clicked to "Convert ID3 Tags," and changed them all to v2.3.  This was a little cumbersome at first, but isn't that difficult, and it seems to make the files something that the Sansa can understand and will sort properly.  If Sandisk would address this, both on their website support FAQ, and through a firmware upgrade that would fix the problem, I'd give this product five stars for excellent value!

<Title>Resume Feature Blues
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Of the mp3/FM players I have accumulated, this is the first one that had satisfactory FM reception, audio output strength, and display readability. That said, there is one galling thing that will force me to look for something else: I listen to long mp3 files recorded from streaming audio with Replay Radio. I like to leave those, in order to listen to FM for a while, and come back to them later, where I left off. If one tries to do that with this product, it will make one go back to the beginning of the track. SanDisk customer support says that the place will be held in that circumstance only with an Audible Dot Com track, but not any other. (It does hold the place if one merely powers the unit down, without switching to another function.) The "deciders" at SanDisk have thoughtfully decided to put this poison-pill feature into their products. By so doing, they put the interests of Audible Dot Com ahead of the interests of the customers who pay money to buy their products. Shame on them!!!

<Title>Great for Unlimited Song Downloading Suscriptions!
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The SanDisk Sansa M230 has an LCD display with a backlight, however it's often hard to read because of poor contrast. The Creative Zen V and V+ have a much brighter display, are much more compact than the M230, and can display color photos at good resolution (the M230 can't display any photos at all), yet they're also compatible with Napster-To-Go. I'd recommend either of the Creative Zen V/V+ models over the SanDisk M230.  The Play For Sure designation for MP3 players, and its logo on this particular MP3 player, don't guarantee it'll work for a Napster-To-Go subscription. Fortunately, the M200 series of MP3 players from SanDisk (including the M230) do work with Napster-To-Go so you can legally download an unlimited number of songs to up to 3 PCs and up to 3 MP3 players in one household.

<Title>Perfect Gym Companion
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little player has a home in my gym bag.  I searched for MP3 players for a couple of months before deciding on this one.  I had several uses in mind for it, but primarily I wanted it for the gym.  I figured I would also use it occassionally while bike riding, jogging and once in a while I'd listen to it while I'm flying or at the office.    I can't speak highly enough about how perfect this little player is suited for how I use it.  Since I wanted to use it during workouts, I needed a player that either came with or had an optional arm band so that I could wear it.  And since I live in Oregon (rain, rain and more rain), it was important that whatever I bought could survive the elements while I'm out jogging or biking.  The Sansa M230 comes with an arm band and a protective plastic cover.  I would have paid three or four times what I paid for the Sansa if I wanted an iPod Shuffle or other similar player and they don't usually come with the arm band or protective cover.    For the price this player can't be beat.  It came with everything I wanted, plenty of storage space, great battery life, the FM receiver works really well and the volume is plenty loud enough.    There are two minor issues that I've had with it so far...  Issue #1: The arm band that it comes with is too small for my upper arm.  I am a weight lifter but I'm not "Mr. Muscles".  I consider my bicep to be average to slightly over average for a 6' man.  I have found that wearing it on my forearm is an acceptable solution that is plenty comfortable and keeps it out of the way.  If you do the same, I would suggest stringing the cable for the ear buds through your shirt instead of letting it hang in front of you.    Issue #2: The plastic cover has too many holes in it.  As I see it, the only hole that it should have is where the ear buds plug into it.  But they put holes it it where the volume buttons, menu button, hold switch, USB cable port and microphone are. The buttons can be operated without needing a hole in the plasitc.  In fact, the buttons on the front of the device are quite easy to operate through the plastic without needed a hole for them.  And I never use the microphone or hold switch.  I can easily remove the player from the cover if I need to connect it to my computer.  All this being said, a little duct tape or electrical tape takes quick care of the holes you don't use and keeps rain/sweat/sprinklers from ruining your little workout companion.

<Title>Dont buy this
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are alot of things wrong with this MP3 player. 1. It takes a very long time to transfer songs into it. It takes about one minute per song. 2. When the transfering was finnaly complete it only had the songs under song title and it is suppose to have it listed by Artist, Album, and Genere. It basically works like a slow version of the ipod shuffle.  3. The directions suck 4. It says that you can have 20 preset radio stations but it does not even tell you how to preset them.  5. The stupid instalation cd got stuck into my computer luckily i got it out.  I got this because my other mp3 player which i bought cheaply broke after 6 months but i deciede just to stick to my portable cd player which i have had for 2 years it is big and all but atleast it does its job.

<Title>Best $30 I've spent in a LONG time!
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'd been hesitant to buy an mp3 player for a while now due to the expense, so I was more than delighted to discover the SanDisk Sansa M230.  Seeing that it had received good reviews here and on epinions.com, I decided to give it a try.  Just got it two days ago, and I must say that it's the best 30 bucks I've spent in a long time.  Part mp3 player, part radio, part media storage device, and part voice recorder rolled together into one sleek package.  Intuitive as hell, too.  I haven't read the instruction booklet yet.  Anyone with any experience with any kind of digital media device will be wheeling around the Sansa's menu in no time.   Complaints about the organization of music files are completely unfounded.  You have the option to play tunes by Artist, Album, Genre, Song, or Playlist.  I had hoped to use my personal headphones with the device after reading some other reviewers' comments, but have found that avenue to completely unnecessary.  Plus, I work in the middle of nowhere, and yet the radio signals for most stations came through loud and clear.  Its 512MB storage is more than enough for my needs.  When I'm going out for a quick jog or blade, it's no problem to just drag and drop the songs I need into the Sansa and away I go.  A carrying case and arm band came included, so there was no extra expense there.  So far, I'm loving this little player.

<Content>This mp3 player works really well.  I like the LCD screen; it lights up blue, so it's easier to see in low lights.  The sound quality is good as well.  The only things I don't care too much about this product are the fact that there's no line out for plugging it into a car, so one must use batteries for it (well, there are always rechargeable batteries; that's what I do), and the instruction manual is very lacking.  I haven't found a random play feature on it.  Still, it's a bargain for the money it costs.  I would definitely recommend this product.  What's also good, is that it'll play wma files, which are smaller than mp3 files, so you can get more music on them (twice as much!).

<Content>If you are looking for a lot of features or looking to impress your friends spend 200 bucks on an i pod. But if you are looking for an easy to use mp3 player with good sound this is the one for you. The headphones could be better but the are good enough. The software is easy to use and loading music is a breeze. Like I said before not a lot of functions but for the price it is an excellent value . I have about 100 songs on mine(it will hold more)and listen to it all day long on 1 aaa battery. So if you are looking for a low budget mp3 I would highly recommend this one.

<Content>okay, understand that if you want to put your itunes music on this mp3 player you must do some reworking of the files itself. suggestion? if you are not tech savvy, buy an ipod. if you want a great deal on a low cost mp3 player with five times the features of an ipod (such as fm radio, built in microphone, graphic equalizer) buy a sansa but be warned - you will have to do some work to make all your drm music work.

<Title>Not worth the hassle
<Date>Mon Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 2 of these players as gifts. At the same time I also bought 2 Creative Zen Stones as gifts (for our extended families overseas).   I loaded both a Sansa and a Zen in the last few days with MP3 files using Windows Media Player.  It took less than 5 minutes (not including the transfer time) to do it on the Zen (which worked right out of the box).   The Sansa took 3-4 hours last night. It started well as the player recognized it and started a playlist sync. Stopped after first file. From then on it became a challenge. I tried drop and drag (did not work). Finally downloaded the firmware update from Sandisk (this was also not easy and had to do it several times). Then it synced.  Why did I buy this? Low price and FM capability. I WISH I HAD PAID $9 MORE TO GET TWICE THE STORAGE AND NO HASSLES WITH THE CREATIVE ZEN STONE (MUCH SMALLER AND RECHARGEABLE). Well hindsight is 2020 but I hope this review helps you in making a right choice.  Sandisk you are no Apple (I also own a new shuffle) and unfortunately not even a Creative.  UPDATE: Since the review I also loaded the other Sansa and Zen. I lucked out with the Sansa this time because the update software made me chenge the USB setting to MSC mode (in the settings menu). With the Sansa sync-ed to Windows Media Player without any trouble.  I would add 2 more stars to the rating based on this update. My view still remains that unless you are looking for FM go for the Zen Stone (for $9 you get 512MB more; it is SMALL (slightly bigger than iPOD shuffle) and rechargeable (save on some batteries and associated costs).

<Title>Good product for price/features w/notable exception
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a need for a low-cost, minimal storage mp3 player and this one does a good job.  I downgrade it since I still haven't been able to create a playlist using included, purchased or freeware products.  The software that comes with the product forces one to install additional unwanted software and it can't be unbundled.  Sandisk website is not helpful nor is the manual.

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only thing I didn't like about this product is you cannot plug it directly into the computer using a USB port -- it uses a cord; but I knew that going in.  I figured the lower price compensated for the lack of a USB port attached directly to the unit.  Excellent sound!  The case holding the player is made of clear plastic which is ugly, but the arm band that comes with it is comfortable.  All in all, I'm glad I bought this item.

<Title>GREAT MP3 player for it's price....
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player to hold me over until I had saved enough money to buy an iPod Video (or until they had gotten cheaper). I had previously spent about $60 bucks on other players that didn't hold up a week! One of my friends had the 1 GB version of this -sadly, it does not go any higher- and I thought to myself "if it works for him, it will work for me!". So I bought it. It is easy to use once you've got the hang of it (10 minutes). It worked fine for the first three weeks. It has an FM Radio feature on it, if your into that kind of stuff, and the battery is just a normal Triple A, so you don't have to charge it if the power is low. It has REALLY good music quality, too. Now, this MP3 player is NOT without it's share of problems, but it has the least 'ticks' that I have ever encountered in a product so cheap.  Anyway, the problems; half the time anymore, when I turn it on the backlite doesn't work. This just happened one day, and I haven't managed to fix it yet. I originally thought that I had set the setting to 'no backlite', but when I checked, it was same a normal!! Another fault is the shoddy booklet that teaches you how to use it. It's not even a booklet, and it's written like some Asian company wrote it; a lot of the time, it doesn't make much sense!! Also, trying to upload and download songs has been a HUGE pain. I can't seem to be able to do it. And the back door to the battery is a bit loose. It can also take a few times to turn on. Kind of touch and go.  Here is a list of the pros and cons....  **PROS**  *Cheap. *Good music quality. *FM Tuner. *Normal battery. *Easy to use.  **CONS**  *Hard to upload/download songs. *Booklet is hard to understand. *Battery door is (a bit) loose. *Back lite doesn't work very well. *Does not turn on at the first touch of the button.  Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, but still the cons ARE pretty heavy. If you're looking for a good quality MP3 player, one that won't break right away, then get an iPod Video 30 GB. It's only 219.99 right now, and has A LOT more space. But don't get a black one; get a white one. The black ones show scratches more easily, and look stupid, in my opinion. But if you're like me, getting this because you have to save up, then get this, because it is the best (cheap) MP3 player on the market.

<Title>Why would you waste your money when you could have this?
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really don't understand why people are so attached to Ipods and Zunes when this is equally as great but at a much more affordable price!  I bought this for my husband and we've both agreed that it was well worth its price and can't believe how great of a deal we got!  Yeah, it doesn't hold a ton of music, but we convert to WMA, and 16 hours is good enough!  Its easy to delete and put more on (especially with a 2.0 USB port)!  I cannot stress enough how this is such a great buy!    I did some research on FM transmitters (because many of them would not work with his car).  I went on ebay and found eforcity.com had a generic digital transmitter listed to work with Sansa, and thought, "why not?" since it was only $4!!!  It works great and I couldn't be happier!  Oh, and just in case you're wondering, I added in about the transmitter for those with similar issues!

Unfortunately, they cannot be downloaded to my Ipod, so I got this cheap MP3 player for the books. I have had it for about 9 months and have had no problems at all with it.  It works great and one AAA battery lasts at least 10 to 12 hours.  I would defintley recommend.

<Title>Great value for the price
<Date>Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently bought two of these for my children (7 and 5) as they finished the school year. I loaded up about 80 songs into them and got familiar with the menus, features and functionality. Sound quality is pretty good, the screen is useful and easy to see in the daylight. I was surprised just how easy they were to use. They are inexpensive enough that it won't be a major problem to replace them if they get lost or broken. While there are many players with far more features and space for music, this player was simple enough for my children to use, and the price was right. It's been extremely quiet around my house lately now that they are plugged in!

<Content>The Sandisk Sansa is a great small MP3 player.  I was looking for something small to listen to while working out.  This works well, and I like that it has FM radio capabilities, too.  I can tune in to radio or the televisions playing at the gym.  I agree with some other reviews that the headphones don't fit too well, but for the price, I'm very pleased with this item.

<Title>Flexible and Reliable MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 player one year ago, and I liked it so much that when I had to purchase some special tokens for awards in our factory I picked it again.  My wife and I share this small but practical MP3 player, and usually she is the one picking the songs, so, whenever the newest update of songs in the player is not good for me, I switch to the radio.  We use it a lot for exercising, and it is the best: you can barely notice its weight and the headphones have the right size to fit in your ear without any discomfort.  Once my wife left it in her exercising clothes, and sent it to the washing and drying machines.  When she found it, it was dead.  As you would expect, it did not work immediately after that.  However, we set it up aside (without the batteries) for 2 days, and after that IT WORKED LIKE NEW!!!!  It is definetely build for tough.  Battery life is good in this player, the sounds are good, but there are some areas for improvement:  1.  The FM radio.  You have to work on the presetting of stations, if not, the navigation comes a little unfriendly when you are jogging. 2.  The USB connection.  It is set for USB2 connection, so we had some trouble getting it to work with our old USB port.  After we changed it, we have had no problems.  This change is not listed on the manual, so we had to figure it out ourselves.  Other than that, we are pleased with this player.  Our next stop: probably a video player or a Cell Phone-MP3 - Video player.  We still don't know.

<Content>This product performs very nicely for the money. It is not as small or sleek as some others, but it is half the price. The controls are easily manipulated through a windbreaker if necessary, but make sure to turn it on first. I have had no problems moving music over to the device. Incidentally, I use Musicmatch On Demand To Go to download and listen to anything in their library. This device works very well with the service. I highly recommend the combination.

<Title>First time purchaser of an MP3 player
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Never had a player before of any type. Decided to try one to use while i run.   Did not want to spend a lot. This product works fine for me. Yes it is limited in storage. Yes it may not have the best sound quality if that matters to you. But at this price it serves me well. I can store about 2 hours of music and that is enough to get me through a 1/2 marathon. The SanDisk is easy to use and the included arm band with protective cover for the player work just fine.  I would make the same purchase again. The price is right, the player does what the material claims it will do, and it should last for some time.

<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will buy an IPOD in due time, but for right now, the SanDisk Sansa is the perfect one start off with. I didn't want to spend a lot of money for an item I never use before. I just want to listen to music without carrying cds/cd player and the fancy stuff (examples: video viewing; combination cell phone).   The MP3 is easy to program your music (make sure you have Windows XP on your desktop [computer] or laptop). This player is also a recorder and has FM radio.  The items that come with this are instruction booklet, mini cd to set-up on computer system (I was able to program music without this cd), plastic cover, velco strip clip-on, earphones, and the connection cord (USB).  Simple and basic, this is the one (PS because the SanDisk Sansa doesn't look expensive, pickpockets and theives are not trying to to steal it like an IPOD).

<Title>Got my money's worth.
<Date>Sun Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Since receiving mine, I've loaded it with MP3's three times, playing it through each time.  I also used the radio enough to put some stations in the memory and get a feel for its usefulness.  Finally, I played with the voice recording for the purposes of writing this review.      Positives:    Lightweight and small  It doesn't feel lumpy or heavy in a pants pocket.    Agreeable sound (with decent headphones)  More bands on the eq. would've been nice, but given the price and size I was satsified with the sound quality.  The earbuds were nothing special.    Affordable  After shipping I spent approx. $40, which is highly competitive with other name-brand players that possess similar features.    Straightforward menus  You need to play around to figure out how to change the settings, and unfortunately the user's guide is clumsily written.  However, once you figure out the interface conventions, they're easy to remember.    Battery requirement  The reliance on a conventional battery form factor (single AAA) means that the player won't need to be replaced when the battery gives its last hurrah, and for the same reason the player doesn't require any downtime.      Negatives:    Awkward shape  The player can only be laid flat with the display facing down, and the angled sides make it clumsy to place the player in a pants pocket, or remove it from one.    Unpredictable backlight  The display is almost illegible without the backlight, which always manages to switch off before you're done.  Further, getting the backlight to switch back on is something of a crapshoot.    Battery life  The battery life suggested in the specs is based on *ahem* optimistic assumptions.  I find myself wishing it ran on an AA cell instead of a AAA cell.    Lousy voice recorder  The voice recorder is difficult to use (read the instructions, fersure) and yields low-quality playback (8KHz WAV, 32kbps).  The filtering etc. leave me under the impression that students wishing to record their lectures should NOT RPT NOT choose this player.  About the only useful applications for this feature are dictation to oneself, and recording on the move for later inclusion in a podcast... if you can't obtain better hardware for either purpose.    Can't delete uploaded files without reconnecting to a computer  Which is all I have to say about that.  One can, however, delete voice recordings (though doing so requires an even more obtuse process than that required to record them).    Doesn't play nicely with Winamp  Winamp has trouble seeing (and thus removing) anything except files that were uploaded with Winamp.  Media Player and iTunes users *might* have a better experience, though I didn't test the player's behavior with either of those programs.      Neutral:    Lousy shuffling  Someday, somehwere, someone will market a player that can shuffle your playlist while playing each song once per pass.  But this isn't the one.    Documentaton  Detailed and available in HTML at the manufacturer's site, but difficult to follow.      Verdict:    I got what I paid for, perhaps at a bit of a bargain (thus the fourth star)... and I didn't pay much.

<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Affordability is the key.  With the increased focus on more memory storage (30GB or even 80GB), this is not the product.  If you want to purchase an item that provides music and entertainment while exercising on a treadmill or doing work around the house, then look no further.  This SanDisk product is under $30 and provides up to 19 hours of play with the use of just "1 AA" battery.  Its compact design allows you to hold the player in your pocket or with an armband.  Easy to transfer music files also...just drag and drop once you attach the SanDisk to your computer with a USB cable.  My only regret is I could have purchased a 1MB for only $8 more.

The buttons and menu are easy to navigate and the instructions that they give you are very clear.  I especially appreciate the value of this product because it offers a great sound, it does its job, the battery has great staying power, and it comes with a protective case (even thought it's a bit flimsy) and arm band.    It has a built-in FM radio player, which is extremely useful and very difficult to find with an MP3 player.  We especially love the voice recorder part of this.    I think this is better than an ipod if you want to use it to run or exercise because it's really lightweight.  Honestly, I was just looking for any MP3 player to do the job, but we are extremely impressed AND satisfied with the quality and value.
