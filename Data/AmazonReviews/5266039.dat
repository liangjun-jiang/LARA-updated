<Title>This Item is not well constructed
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa e280 is straight up garbage.  I had to take it back on 4 seperate occasions because the the memory froze and could not be reset.  when you load all of your songs and movies, sometimes the songs don't appear on your Mp3 player.  you have to load it 3 or 4 different times to get in on your ipod. the buttons on the sansa are pretty damn small as far as the arrows. the volume button and volume button navigation is well thought out but as far as the unit as a whole, I would give a D-. Very sloppy craftsmanship and I think they need to recall this item and fix the errors or else they probable will soon loose repeat business.

<Title>Prettty good - keep trying
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Happy to see that this player (compared to e140) would resume playback where it left off after turning off.  Resets volume to 50% on power up(?) though!  I had the opposite problem than what this is probably supposed to prevent.  I usually am listening at reduced volume so that I can hear what's going on in the background, only to get blasted after turning the unit back on.  Player needs some way easy to bulld playlists internally.  Sound and battery life are very good.  The more storage capacity a player has, the more the manufacturer really needs to think about the interface and software.  But I'm pretty particuar about the order that I want to play back my tunes.  It's not easy being me :-)  Windows Media player for a front-end?  Don't think so!  I may sell this and look at the Creative one even though it' not as small.  I hate their (Creative) software, but at least it has something.

<Title>This is some headache-causing hardware!
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My beloved Zen Micro Photo's hard drive died, but thankfully, I had Big Box Retailer's extended warranty on it. Unfortunately, they no longer stock that unit, so I had to pick out another one. The Sansa looked like the best out of the bunch: Small, high-quality screen, video playback, high capacity, flash-based, and most importantly, it had a built-in voice recorder.  Almost from the outset, there were problems. I don't use any online music services, so having Rhapsody foisted upon me was an immediate annoyance. The media manager application had a propensity to randomly crash, particularly in the middle of file transfers. Not good. The design felt very badly thought out, with a mechanical scroll wheel that feels rough and gets stuck (I see why Apple dumped them!), and buttons that are tiny, hard to press, and don't feel like they're being pushed when they are.   But the real deal-killer for me was a problem I don't think many others will experience: I have a great deal of music whose filenames and ID3 tags are written in Japanese characters. The Sansa's US firmware does not support Japanese (and other Asian languages as well, I'd assume), and as a result, the player will choke whenever it's asked to play a file with even one Japanese character in it. Since about half my music library fits that description, and it would take forever to go back and manually rename all those files in English, I was extremely annoyed. Perhaps a firmware flash would fix it? I tried to get some firmware of Sandisk's Japanese site, but they don't have any direct downloads. Maybe the newest US firmware has Asian language support, I thought to myself. I found the firmware, unzipped it, and loaded it onto my player.  Dead as a doornail. Tried it again. And again. And again. At that point, I just gave up.  Some people don't seem to have any problems with this. Well, more power to you, I guess, but based on my experience, this is NOT something I would recommend. If you're in the market for an iPod alternative, Creative's units still offer the best combination of features, functionality, and design.   Now I just need to figure out what I'm gonna buy after I return this thing.

<Title>Great Alternative to Apple's Proprietary Garbage
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me start by saying that this thing is really small.  I saw the pictures and even some video reviews on youtube, but I was still pleasantly surprised at how tiny this player actually is.  My Motorola Razor cellphone dwarfs it. It's cheap, so unless you're a dedicated Apple user (i.e. have more money than brains), you're getting a great bargain. I got it mainly because of nice size and compatibility (no need for dealing with iTunes - this baby looks just like another drive to your comptuer, which means drag and drop support for files). I wasn't expecting much from video - but changed my mind, after being able to watch tv series episodes on it during my commute to work, or full movies during recent flights.  The resolution/quality of the LCD is simply amazing. FM tuner gets great reception, even in my basement - not to mention the fact that I can quickly record a new song directly off the radio, so that I can listen to it later. The only downside I can list at the moment is the button interface - the rotating wheel could be a little more depressed, to make pressing buttons around it easier, but you get used to it really fast.   Other than that - this device is definitely the way to go.  I couldn't be more happy with the purchase.

<Title>nice feature set, nice look, easy to use
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll admit that I've never owned any iPod, so I cannot directly compare this unit with a Nano.  Why buy a Nano, though, when the Sansa with equivalent flash memory has additional features and costs much less?  Sure, the Nano's interface (the click wheel) is a little easier to use, but that's not worth a 35% premium while sacrificing features such as video playback and an FM tuner.  My previous player was one of the Sansa e100 series.  This player is a definite upgrade beyond the obvious (color screen, larger capacity, video playback).  It definitely sounds much better than the e100 (and I was basically satisfied with that player's sound once I had tweaked its equilizer to my liking).  The interface is a lot nicer than the e100.  As others have written, the buttons around the scroll wheel are small but this hasn't presented a problem so far.  The menu system is so straight-forward that you don't really need to refer to the manual to use the player, though I would recommend looking at the manual at least once if you plan to put any video content on the player.  Contrary to some other reviewers' opinions, I think this player has a nice, not cheap, look.  I don't know whether it's identical in form to the lower capacity players in the same series; if not it seems much nicer in my hand than those players did when I briefly handled them at a local store.  I'm quite satisfied with this player so far, but I've only had it for about one week.  A word of caution to would-be purchasers:  I had originally ordered this from Amazon and, according to their customer service, they don't know when they will get more units in (despite the website saying "in stock").  I was given a delivery estimate of approximately two months away, so I canceled my order and went elsewhere.

<Title>Great player.  No hassle
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall this a great player with many capabilities.  The FM tuner, voice recorder, pics, and video are specs that everyone knows but it comes together nicely here. Replacable battery is always a plus.  Sound is great. If you don't like what you have you can manually adjust the equalizer settings.  There are many to choose from.  You might want to invest in some higher quality headphones though.  The factory set isn't bad at all, but you could go better.  I've heard a lot of complaining about the scroll wheel and the buttons.  The wheel is easy to use and DOES NOT JAM as some other tend to think.  Yea the Ipod click wheel is nice.. but this isn't an ipod is it..?  When pushing buttons, it seems that your pushes does not register but it does.  No issues there.  Battery Life is great.  Running through the menu, playlists, and all the other functions obvioulsy drains the battery but not significantly.  It'll last for at least 9 hours depending on usage.  Ease of use:  You can't go wrong with this player, and it is incredibly straight forward.  The installation cd gives you a user manual just in case you have any questions but you can figure it out yourself by just running through the menus.  File transfer and media converter is straight forward. To easily create playlists the cd will update your windows media player, so make sure you install it.  Media player tends to be moody at times, but once you start dragging and dropping your files, its easy.    Just something to point out.  An earlier review said that the boot time was around 5 minutes or so.  That's totally exaggerated.  I have a little under 6GB of USED space and it takes about 10 seconds max to boot.  Obviously, you should take care of your player.  Buying a case is a best bet even though it comes with a slim fabric case.  Take care of the player and it'll take care of you

<Title>co-dependent
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i must have got lucky i guess cause mine seems to be functioning properly. but i seriously think it's lame not to be able to create playlists or delete media without syncing up to a comp. i never owned an ipod but hear they are pretty much the same. it doesn't work well with windows media player. and i think it's weak for a company to sell a product without proper software included. they tell me rhapsody works better. i haven't had a chance to try it yet. i decided to make better use of my time and came on here to bash it instead. my creative labs is far better with menu options and music access.  the buttons are a little funky but my wheel works great. it does freeze up for a sec when you try and rate a song. it does take a minute to reload after syncing up. which is another reason they should make it so i can create playlists and delete songs without syncing up.  i do like the video, pics, sounds good, light-weight, nice big screen, it has potential, thier customer support seems good, but then when i asked them why you can't delete songs they said cause people used to complain about deleting songs on accident. so now that's my problem. i really appreciate them striving to suit the needs of the underprivledged. i hope microsoft gets the same idea and makes it so i can't create or save on my xbox without my computer. i'm satisfied with my purchase but taking away two stars for lack of convenience. all i want to do is put stuff on it. delete media i don't want when i hear or see it, so i can load it back up with fresh jams when i have time. it is going to take me forever to get it set up how i want it. not to mention adding new stuff yet to come. blah.

<Title>iPod Nano had better watch it's back! The Sansa competes and EXCEEDS in most if not all categories!
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't fall into the white earbud trance any longer!! Wake from your Apple induced slumber people and open your eyes to the SanDisk Sansa e200 Series!! This review pertains to the Sansa e280 8GB mP3 player and let me tell you that the iPod Nano and Apple for that matter, had better watch it's back! The feature set capabilities and price point of the Sansa e 280 should have no trouble making Nano into apple pie as long as users like me help educate consumers to the realization that yes, indeed, there is a whole market of AWESOME mP3 players that in fact cost LESS, have more features, better reliability, and a company that backs its unit even after it has been sold!   For a long while now, many consumers have a certain "fruit" in mind when it comes to the mP3 player of choice. Well, I have news for you. The Sansa e280 outstrips the Nano in almost every regard. the e280 was the first flash player to come out with an 8GB capacity. The Nano soon followed with it's own 8GB (2000 songs) however, the Sansa has and expandible Trans Flash/Micro SD card slot enabling the user to ADD Storage!! Yes I said ADD IT! Currently SanDisk makes a 2GB micro SD card for about 100$ enabling you to add 2gigs to your player(about 500 more songs). Nano doesn't offer this and yet it is still priced the same or higher in some cases as I found my Sansa for under 200$. with this capability, the life of the player should be extended because of increased volumes for SD cards that come out continuously. Unlike with an apple product where if more storage is needed, you have to buy a new player and spend another 250 bucks! You can plug the storage card into the player and all the music transfered to it automatically integrates into your albumn folders which is a fabulous benefit!  Another Nice feature that the Sansa offers is a larger display screen. At 1.8 inches, the colors are bright and crisp. I would have liked to see a higher color resolution, however, still much bigger than the Nano and quite easy to read and see.  The construction of the Sansa is excellent with a poured metal back casing that is virtually un-scratchable (unless you drop it I would imagine) but you really can't scratch it like an iPod or a Zen. It also doesn't use the same plastic as the iPod or the Creative Zen so the front is SO much more durable!!! You would really have to scrape something pretty sharp against it to show scratches on its face unlike the iPod and Zen player in which you just have to place them in a pocket to receive one.   The e280 has a tactile wheel for navigation which is similar to the iPod platform but I find it to be a bit better. The dial has tiny grooves enabling the user to have more control through the screens. Unlke the iPod, the wheel lights up an electrifying flourescent blue color enabling you to navigate in lower light conditions and it also enhances the sleek look of the player.   The Sansa is compatible with Windows Media Player(free) and Rhapsody which is a paid music subscription site just like iTunes. However because this is not an apple product, you are not confined to the Apple platform.    The Sansa offers an FM tuner which is spot on and crystal clear, a voice recorder (useful if you are the memo on the fly type), video playback and photo viewing capabilities. The Nano has video and photo but does NOT have FM radio or recording capabilities. Easy and user-desirable things to add and yet Apple still hasn't caught on.   The cost of ownership for this is already cheaper right out of the gate with the lower price point but also a GREAT feature that Apple refuses to offer as it would effect their bottom line DRASTICALLY is that the Sansa offers a USER replaceable battery for about 19 bucks. You have to send your iPod out to Apple at the cost of shipping and $50 per battery. Not to mention the battery life for the Nano is 15 hours where the Sansa e280 played for 22.5 hours before dying!  All in all I spent 177.00 and got a FAR SUPERIOR PLAYER!! SanDisk customer service is top notch as well. I owned 2 very expensive $300 a piece 20 Gig ipods. in just over a year each(right after the warranty was up) they had hard drive failure which cost 268.40 to repair. I was told it was cheaper to buy another iPod and was sent rudely on my way by Apple rather than their customer service trying to work with me to keep me as a customer. I have done research on every player out there, Hard Drive and flash. I bought a Sandisk. They are the leaders is flash memory for a reason. Not to mention their customer service was STELLAR!! Top notch and happy to have me convert.   In closing, the Sansa is most definitely worth your time and your investment. Don't spend the 250$ on the Nano for your child's christmas present. They will be receiving a far inferior product, will have to replace it or fix it and the cost is RIDICULOUS! Educate yourself and purchase a Sansa.

<Title>Nice, but No Control
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk's other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn't give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped.   It would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. "It's our way or the highway." Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.  It's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products). Well, you can, but it won't make much difference if the device won't play.

<Title>Just OK
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had this for about a week, then it crapped out and would not hook up with PC after.  Tech-help had no clue, "Just RMA" they said.   When skipping songs, there is a real pause that is aggrevating.  Scroll wheel is cheap as stated before.  Screen is real nice and video option is nice.  All in all, I returned this for an Ipod Nano 8gb.  No comparision.  Outside of video (which I have no use for) and price, (you do get what you pay for) this player can't even stand in the Nano's shadow.    Get the nano, you'll be glad after you did.

<Content>It came boxed very nicely, the MP3 player and its accessories were safe and snug, and the battery came fully charged. I pressed the 'on' button and it turned on and was ready to go. To put music on, I just hook it up to my USB port (with the cable that comes with, obviously) and drag and drop the songs onto the drive. It's as simple as that. To charge it, just keep it hooked up to your computer. I always recommend reading the instructions with more expensive products like this, though. This thing works just as well as any iPod could, and holds plenty of music. Thoroughly satisfied with this.

<Title>Very poor software
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product works only with Microsoft Media Player which is a very poor software, nothing for the real music fan. I have tested the sansa e280 in my office when it came and it worked despite all the problems with windows media player. But then I wanted to connect to my computer at home and it was blocked absolutely. I tried everything (uninstall and install again), but without success. Today I went to a computer expert of our lab, but after some trials he gave up. So the Sansa e280 seems to be rather useless because of its close connections to Microsoft.  The update of the firmware solved this problem, but the software for upload is still very poor: let the Chinese do it !  Used the Media Monkey which is much better than the Microsoft Mediaplayer, but still not logical enough.  The memory size is too small for a music freak, 32 Gb would be more appropriate.

<Title>Impossibly difficult to use
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered this unit with high expectations, lots of memory, expandable, multiple modes, from a well known company and an excellent price; how could I go wrong?.  Easily enough, as it turns out.    I was unable to load it and control the play lists.  Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop.  Dragging a folder to the device was pointless.  Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place.  I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from "My Computer" on the host system.  After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out.   I have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method.   This was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb.  Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!.   Using Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on.    After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.  This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.    Throughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.  As it stands, it's without merit as a player.

<Title>Hope you went to college
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've got an engineering degree in computer science.  I've been supporting multi-million dollar web applications for years.  It took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the Rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for.  There is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight mp3 player.  It's not ipod caliber quality, the only reason you'd get it is for the Rhapsody service.  If you are not highly technical and patient, move on!  Player itself works fine.  ------ Edit - 4 days after getting this thing synced properly, it decided the device was no longer authorized to play the DRM'd music.  Only Rhapsody songs that are added again seem to work.  Filling the 8 gigs over a USB 2.0 connection takes hours.  All this after upgrading to the latest version of Rhapsody, the latest version of Windows Media Player, and the latest firmware for the player.  Further investigation indicates this sort of thing is a common problem with the Plays for Sure protocol used by the Sansa to integrate with the music subscription services, though Rhapsody seems to have the worst reputation.  That could mean it's just the most popular.  Get an ipod.  They're #1 for a reason. A lot of the high reviews and comments on reviews for this product are either people that haven't used it with a music subscription service or viral marketing from Real or Sandisk. -------------- Hopefully the final Edit -   We finally got this thing to work right.  It turns out that if part of the memory gets corrupted, the DRM doesn't work properly, resulting in the problems described above.  Oddly enough, you have to reformat the player using windows, like you would a 3.5" floppy disk.  Since doing this it has worked almost flawlessly.  I'd bump the rating from 2 stars to 4 if Amazon would let me.  Rhapsody technical support was no help, BTW.  We installed Napster as a last ditch effort to get the thing working, and the first thing the application told us to do was fix the corrupted memory by reformating the player.  Too bad for Napster it made Rhapsody work again as well.

<Title>Great player for the money, but room for improvement
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a subscription service (Ruckus) so I didn't want to deal with iPod. I did a lot of research on non-iPod players before buying the sansa. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.   Design is very sleek and the size is just right. The color screen has good resolution and pictures/videos are clear. Controls are very intuitive. The side buttons are a little hard to press, but if you buy a silicone case the buttons become raised making life a lot easier. The scroll button is kind of clunky as well, but I feel the sansa's other features compensate for it. Plus it's pretty neon blue... :)  After reading poor reviews about the FM radio, I have to say it works great for me. I live in a pretty rural area where stations are always a little fuzzy and the sansa comes in just as well as anything else. The antenna wires are in the headphones (standard cheap-ish round earbuds which I find very uncomfortable). I'm planning on getting new headphones, so hopefully the radio still works ok. Otherwise, volume is good, almost too loud.  I wish the package included an AC charger, but now that Sansa has been out for awhile, there are plenty of after-market accessories available. Sansa's website links to licensed products. There is also a memory expansion slot, which is a big plus over competitors. However, the battery life is longer than most players and it charges pretty quickly through USB. The downside here is that you can't use the player whenever it's plugged in. This makes for one of my bigger beefs: file management. It's a bit annoying if you just want to delete a song because it has to be plugged in. If you can't remember if you want to delete a song or not and would like to listen to it to check, heaven help you... You can't play anything (either through the sansa or the synced list on your computer) so this requires unplugging the player, listening, plugging back in, then deleting. I suppose this type of occurrence is rare, so I can deal.     Initial ease of transferring files wasn't great either. After a day though, I'm a pro. Yes, you may have to read the manual, but it'll save a lot of grief down the road. Although it's easier to use off the bat than other players I've tried, it could be improved. The sansa allows you to drag and drop files on MSC mode and sync through Windows Media Player in MTP mode (my preferred method). It took me a few tries to import playlists "as is", but contrary to some reviews here it CAN be done. Make sure you're using the AutoSync feature instead of Manual sync in Windows Media. (easy enough to do once I read the directions!) If you do it right, you'll still have a library full of all songs and playlists that will only play certain songs. The Sansa also has a "GoList" feature, but I've found it to be worthless. In order to add a song, you have to be listening to it. You can't queue up a playlist like in any PC jukebox program. May as well just make playlists in advance then import them.   While some things could be improved, I think the Sansa e280 is a very solid player and I'm glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to the ipod nano, based on both on price and function.

<Title>Sansa E280
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When my Zen Micro blew up on me a few weeks ago, I decided it was time to purchase a new MP3 player. I had long tried to avoid the iPod but after playing with a friend of mines new 8GB iPod Nano I decided I would get one. Fortunetly, I stumbled across the Sansa E280 by chance while looking for a good deal on the Nano. I decided to take a chance on this relatively unknown device and am now thrilled that I did!  While it is basically the same width and height as the Nano, it is slightly thicker which might bother some people but I still don't even know it's there while in my pocket. The Nano has a color screen which can be used to view photos and 8GB. It's actually a nice little player but compared to the Sansa E280 it falls easily to a comendable second place. the E280 has an internal 8GB but there is a slot for a 2GB expandable memory disk! It is very easy to connect to the pc as well. I am by no means a computer expert and I use Windows Media Player to store my music. When I first connected the E280 to the pc, it asked me did I want to sync the two, which I said yes to. Ten minutes later the Sansa was loaded with all my music, no problems what-so-ever.In addition to displaying photos as the Nano does, it also plays videos. When reading reviews I thought this was a clever gimic but nothing worth using on such a small screen (it is only slightly larger than the nano's). I put an episode of South Park onto it when I first got the E280 and was suprised by the quality. I still wouldn't recommend replacing your tv with one of these but it is actually far better than I thought it could be. The packaged video coverter works well. I literally dragged and dropped the episode into it and the it was converted and transferred to the E280 before my eyes. The fm radio is also brilliant. My Zen Micro had an fm radio that never really worked. I didn't expect much better from my new MP3 player but once again I was suprised. No problems picking up the local stations at all.   The player itself fits comfortably in my hand. The only complaint I have about the physical player is the rotating wheel. At first I was disappointed with it as it felt very cheap, particularly when compared with the rest of the player. I got used to this very quickly and don't have a problem with it anymore but I think it is worth noting all the same. The other complaint I would have about the player is that songs cannot be deleted from the player itself, you must hook it up to the computer and manually remove them.   All in all, I would highly recommend the Sansa E280. Of the many MP3 players I tried out, this one really came out of top. It is beaten on size by the iPod, although the difference is near negligible. If your looking for a great little player packed with more features than you'd know what to do with, pick a Sansa E280 up!

<Title>big failure
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned 4 MP3 players including the Sandisk 4gb which I give 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I cannot give the E280 the same rating.  I could not get the e280 to work on my computer. The 4gb is compatible with my Sony, but the 8gb was not recognized.  I tried EVERYTHING.  I downloaded drivers for my PC, I downloaded drivers for the  e280 MP3.  I was on the phone with Sandisk for an hour (and they were OK).  Sandisk told me there was something wrong with my computer (EVEN THOUGH I could run the 4gb beautifully).  They said I didn't have 2.0 usb ports (but I do).  I called Sony just to make sure I did have the 2.0 usb ports.  They walked me through hell and high water.  The only thing left for us to do was to wipe out my computer and reformat it just to see if the MP3 player would be recognized.  I wasn't willing to do all of this because I would have to back up all of my data on my entire computer and then reformat it.  Another few hours of work after I already spent 5 hours speaking with both Sony and Sandisk.  The mp3 player is just not worth it to me.  Good price, but never was recognized by my computer.  It did charge up however, and the menu was working.  But, I never downloaded any music to it because I couldn't get connected.  Now I know why it was such a good price.  I am so sorry it didn't worked because I really love the 4gb one.  I guess I have to go with another player.  boo hoo

<Title>my second one
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is my dream movie/mpeg player, i bought one in october and used it continuously until tonight i accidently put it into an olive jar with no olives but lots of olive brine and left it for several hours, (dont ask) so i am ordering my second one. i watch movies on it in bed and i listen to audiobooks on it.  where ever i find myself in a situation where i have to wait it is a great companion and i can get all my spanish lessons on it as well.  i have also purchased a 2 gig micro sd card bringing my total memory to 10 gig, that much memory does the job. i dont understand people who want to store 80 gig of files on their ipod or archos, it makes no sense and forces you to use hard drive based players which in my opinion are a real problem for an 'active' person.  now for the bad news, it is buggy, and does lock up, Plus you have to unscrew 4 small screws to change the battery to reboot, which can be a problem if you are on a bicycle tour and cant recharge, why not make battery change easier.  it uses the quick time movie format which is limiting, and the software conversion program is written by archsoft and doesnt give you 'any' options, i bought the full version from archsoft. the movies i convert are large 4 to 7 gig and in mpeg2 dvd format, and the software/hardware combination wont handle it and the audio gets out of synch VERY badly, i found a solution, i also have an archos 80 gig hard drive type video player so i convert the file to archos divx format first and then using that file i convert to the quick time format killing 2 birds with one stone but the file actually gets "larger" in quicktime then in divx. another irritation is that the player only handles 10 minute video files so the converter chops them up for you and rotates the frame to fit better, i can live with the 10 minute files, but every 10 minutes you get a 20 second pause as it opens the next 10 minutes, plus the conversion program leaves several rows of pixels unused on the screen, and i'd like the screen to be 1/4th of an inch bigger all the way around but NO bigger, i like it small so i'll always carry it.  i also dont like sansa's firmware updater service since if you have toasted the snasa's operating system the computer wont recognize it and the updater wont update the non-existing operation system, i am still trying to find the firmware on their web-sight.  so with all this pain why buy another, well 'love' is like that.  flash memory is really 'sweet' and the battery lasts and lasts, but for me the main thing is that it is SO small and light weight that i always have it with me, and when you find yourself stuck waiting at the doctors office and you are content watching a movie while those around you are stuck reading dog eared cosmopolitan magazines you'll love it, even those people who have other video players wont have them with them because they are just toooooo big.    hopefully later products will 'iron out' some of these little irritations. and thats why i only rate it 4 stars not 5. hurry up ups i need my sansa.

<Title>Great Unit
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've never written a review on Amazon before, but I like this unit so much that I thought I'd capture a few points that I think make this player a great choice:  1.) Currently an excellent $/GB value. 2.) Build quality is great (solid metal backplane). Screen will scratch, but one of the many available screen protectors will address this problem. 3.) User interface is well-deigned. I'm a fairly big guy (6'1") with large hands, but I have no problems operating the 4 buttons arranged around the scroll wheel. I was apprehensive about the scroll wheel, but it works great for me. The fact that it - unlike the iPod wheel - is raised a bit (i.e., has a positive profile) makes it easy to locate with your thumb when the player is out of view. 4.) Battery life is excellent; I've never run the unit to full discharge, but with heavy use on trans-pacific flights I've never gotten close to battery-empty status, so the stated 20 hrs. seems very realistic.(Remember that turning the brightness down will do wonders for battery life...) 5.) My player is loaded to capacity, and it takes apx. 10-15 sec. for booting, no more. 6.) Sandisk phone customer service has been more than satisfactory on two occasions (wait time was quite long but the actual service was very good).

<Title>Sloooooooooooooooooooooow...
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really want to enjoy this player... its a beauty to look at and is the perfect size. But...  Takes about 30 seconds to boot up, takes another 10 seconds to get anything to play, takes about 10 seconds to skip to a new song, takes about 30 seconds to transfer 1 song...  i've never had a player that was anything but instantanious (except for the initial boot).

<Title>Its extra features, may not be what you'd expect
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Sansa e280 (8GB) about a year ago and my wife has the e260 (4GB).  They have been reliable and easy to use.  I selected Sansa over iPod because of its lower price, the ability to listen to and record FM radio and voice, and because of its expandable memory, user replaceable battery, and not needing to use iTunes.  I'm not going to compare similar features of these two products, but rather focus on Sansa's extras.  To me the microphone in the Sansa is surprisingly good and its voice recordings are excellent.  I was surprised to find recordings in WAV format, rather than MP3, and have not seen this mentioned in other reviews, on Sansa's web site, or in the product manual.  Recordings are 16-bit mono, sampled at 16kHz, which is fine for voice.  The level is preset, working well for voice, but set too high for amplified live music.  For FM recording there is another surprise producing a 16-bit stereo WAV still sampled at 16kHz.  The surprise is that the signal is mixed to mono, but recorded in stereo, doubling file size without providing the benefit a stereo image.  The low sampling rate means playback sounds worse than the original, losing frequencies above 8kHz.  A sampling rate of 32kHz would be more appropriate for FM recording, but would double file size too.  I have not needed to replace the battery, but I suspect the cost may not be justified when the time comes.  The microSD slot is not HCSD compatible, so expansion is limited to 2GB.  It's better to buy more memory up front, if you can afford it.  On your computer, a separate drive is installed for the expansion slot, and files must be placed there manually.  Despite its issues, I find the Sansa to be a great value.  Not needing iTunes is priceless.

<Title>Nice player.
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had a Sansa e280 for little over a year. Unfortunately, it broke a couple days ago. I was very satisfied with it, but now i'm thinking about upgrading to a higher memory. The only cons are that it freezes fairly often- many times i had to wait until the battery died to use it. Also, after you put your music on the player, you can't edit the title, artist, album, or anything like that.  I would recomend this item over a nano.

<Title>Bad Product line
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Sansa e200. It was on sale for about $84. I also bought a power supply for use while traveling. It was a total waste of money. My e200 has menu screens that are neither English or Spanish. The manual/instructions were supposed to be available on Adobe PDF. I have the latest Adobe (8.0), but I cannot bring up the instructions. All attempts to solve this problem have failed. I would never waste my money on another Sansa product.  Puffmaru

<Title>Meh.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Good: I love the metal backing!!!  It's pretty much the reason I bought the product--I'm a very clumsy person and have managed to drop it several times without it breaking.  Pictures look pretty nice, and although the only video I saw on it is the preloaded one, that was good too.    I like the EQ settings and that you can rate the songs. The voice and FM radio are nice too.  I've never used the micro SD slot, but it's nice to have the option.  The Bad: You can't edit your playlists on the go.  I've previously used Creative players that can so that could just be me.  It's also frustrating that you can't play only one song from an album without adding the entire album to the now playing list.  Basically, unless you have a playlist you have to listen to whole albums at a time.  I also wish you could change the orientation when looking at pictures, but it's not really a big deal. It also takes a ridiculously long time to start up, which makes me sad.  Overall: It works, but I'm not terribly impressed.  It kind of feels like (gasp) a return to the CD era in that unless you have a mix already made you're stuck to just albums.  It's perfect for some people, but I'm looking for a replacement.  Most Creative Labs products would be a nice alternative.

<Title>What more can you possibly want?
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought my e280, not being confused by Apple's marketing "trick" of convincing people that the nano is not just another player. And I don't need the prestige value that Jobs has built into his player. Rather, I get to keep my various music files on separate cards, so I don't have to play with the whole "list" business. My classical music isn't inter-mixed with my pop music, or my 30's collection.  But more importantly, the e280 is feature rich. I use every one of them, especially the recorder which allows me to structure my day and make certain I get all the essentials done. The photos are great, the video quality only suffers because most video producers do such a terrible job wih focus and lighting, and the built in FM receiver has allowed me to use my car stereo with the addition of a simple Giffen car device (at some point I'll spring for the built in system, but not until I get a Click and just leave it in the car). I use Bose earphones at home and the sound is simply first rate. Given the price, the increasing music options (including the ability to turn my records into mp3 files), and the freedom from iTunes makes this a no brainer, unless you have some deep, psychological need to be "in" and have a nano to impress your friends. One suggestion - get the rubber black cover for your e280. I've dropped mine a few times and it just bounces wihout any damage. As for the nano crowd, just wait until you have to replace your battery! In conclusion, I'd rather save $100 and use the money to build my music collection than give it over to Apple. The nano is just more proof that no one has ever gone broke underestimating the foolishness of the American consumer.

<Title>Cannot set MSC connection mode
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Before purchasing this device I downloaded the Sansa E280 user guide from the Sansa website. The user guide has clear instructions on how to set MSC or MTP USB connection mode. Really simple. Just select Settings/USB Mode from the main menu. Piece of cake. A child could do it.  That is, a child could do it IF THE F*****G Settings menu had a USB Mode selection. Which it doesn't.  Sorry - didn't mean to shout.  I sent the device back this morning, along with the nifty base station that I was going to use to hook up the device to my home stereo.  Now, just to be clear: I was able to find out that there is a magic handshake that will allow you to set MSC mode: everytime you connect to your PC, put the device in LOCK, and hold down the left-nav button while you are connecting the device to your PC. So simple even an ambidextrous ape could do it, BUT WHY WOULD HE WANT TO???!!!??? Why the f**k would Sansa ship a device that has to be used in that way?  Oops, shouting again. Sorry.  Anyway, I sent the device back because life is far too short to allow oneself to be aggravated by poorly designed or poorly implemented electronic gadgets.

<Title>Kicks iPod's butt!
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this a year ago and I love it!!  I use it constantly.  Battery goes forever and recharges quickly.  It is very light weight and I don't even notice it when I run.  Far easier to use in my opinion than ipods. I like the actual wheel and buttons instead of the touch pad, which I never could master.  I have had zero problems which is nice since I moved to Africa with the Peace Corps right after getting it and would never be able to get it serviced.  Far less expensive because they don't spend billions on advertisements, but the quality is high.  My only recommendation is that you get any accessories at the same time you order this.  You will save on shipping and it is hard to find accessories that fit it elsewhere.  The world only seems to want to sell ipod stuff.  Buy it!  Love it!
