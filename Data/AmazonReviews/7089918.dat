<Title>Awesome, well-designed little player
<Date>Mon May 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm a fanatic...I normallly do alot of research before buying anything...I looked at the Creative Zen, mini-IPOD etc. Then I came across this beauty by chance on Amazon, released at the start of April. It is incredible..very light and tiny, beautiful clear screen, user-friendly software, great sound. The earphones included are terrible but thats pretty normal for this sort of purchase. Everyday use is childs-play, uploading songs is quick and easy. Controls are perfect too and well-designed.  I took a chance and bought this without any real knowledge of its reliability..so far so good..dropped it already and no problems. Also comes with a handy case.   Most of my friends have mini IPODs...I was tempted to join the masses...but everyone agrees this jukebox is superior...and its far nicer to look at..the aluminium finish is superb, though it does get smudged easily. I am a very proud owner so far. Added addition is ability to look at photos.  Be brave and buy this...you will not be disappointed!!!

<Title>Pretty nice mini-DAP
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Good Stuff - Small dimensions, average build-quality - Shiney, polished-metal style materials (plastic, actually)  - 5Gb MicroDrive  - 5-way joystick plus a mechanical wheel-scroller for zooming quickly through lists  - Charges over USB  - Color screen (not TFT, the duller type) - File/Folder browsing AND iD3 based browsing (Artist, Album, Track, Genre, Year, etc)  - Profiling (can scan tracks and self-databased iD3-tag info like Rio Carbon, no software required)  - View photos  - 5-band custom EQ  - Choose MSC or MTP complient in the Settings Menu. First time we've seen this ability. Might as well stick with the Mass Storage Complient option unless you're a big fan of WMP10  - Damn near gapless MP3 playback  - Power output (volume) is very strong, like 50 steppings - Includes a protective case with belt clip and AC adapter (you don't get these with an iPod anymore) - Includes Sennheiser MX400 earbuds which are a lot better than you usually get for freebies  The Bad - No dedicated play controls, use the joystick instead  - Color screen is small (1-inch), colors are washy  - No FM radio or recording  - Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time - Battery life doesn't seem that great so far, like old iPod Minis - case does not have cut-outs for controls or screen  (...)

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Sun May 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased this product and expected a lot from it. The overall design is sleek and the advertised features impressed me. While the price tag is a bit steep, I nevertheless forked out the cash. To my surprised I was very disappointed by its performance. The USB cable was flimsy and didn't seem to fit my player properly, my computer would not recognize the device. I was forced to use an extra USB cable I had. While the music transfer was a breeze, my player began to get extremely hot in minutes. And froze on several occasions. While this might merely be one time malfunction, nonetheless for the 250 dollars I paid I expected a lot more. I would not recommend this product.

<Title>How RCA Lyra works with Napster To Go
<Date>Sat Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>How to make RCA Lyra RD2765 be recognized as MTP player and installed as Napster To Go device.  There are 2 settings you should check:  1) Be sure that your Protocol is set to MTP (Microsoft Transport Protocol) to insure that your device will work with N2G.   2) The correct MTP driver must be installed by Windows XP. If not, it will only be recognized as a USB Mass Storage device.  There are 2 protocols in this device: MTP & MSC.  You can switch between MTP & MSC if you are a Windows XP user. Unfortunately, old Windows O/S users like Win98 cannot make this switch. It will be fixed to MSC.  How to switch from MTP to MSC and vice versa.  1. From the settings menu, rotate the Control ring to select Advanced.  2. Push the Control Joystick to the right to view Advanced options.  3. The current protocol will be displayed.  4. Press the Control Joystick to switch be tween MTP and MSC.  5. Push the Control Joystick to the left to return to the previous submenu, or press the M button to exit the menu.    More information on MTP & MSC:  Why do I want to use MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) Mode?  MTP Mode is essential if you want to transfer DRM content to your Lyra Jukebox. Today MTP Mode is only supported in Windows XP and through Windows Media Player 10.0 or other special software provided by your music service provider. In MTP mode you Lyra Jukebox will no longer show up as a drive letter. So programs that were designed to work with a device that shows up as a drive letter will not be able to work directly with the Lyra Jukebox.  Why do I want to use MSC (Mass Storage Class) Mode?  If you are using Windows 98SE, ME or 2000 you can not use MTP Mode only MSC Mode is available. Your Lyra Jukebox will always show up as a MSC device.  If you are using Windows XP your Lyra Jukebox will show up as a MTP device, but we have provide you the option to be able to switch it to MSC Mode with a setting in the Advanced Options section of the Lyra Jukebox. Once this setting is set to MSC Mode every time you connect the device to the PC it will show up as a drive letter and allow you to use any software that can work with MSC Mode. This will also allow the current version of LyraDJ or any other playlist editing program to find the device.  All supported content put on the device in either mode MTP or MSC will be available to play on the device once it is disconnected from the PC. So you could add mp3 files in the  MSC Mode then run LyraDJ, Profile the device and disconnect it. Then switch it to MTP Mode and reconnect it and add DRM content to it.

<Title>it...
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>personally i think that this thing is a great mp3 player if you intend to only have it for a few months, i've had mine for 3 months today, and so far the only thing that i've found is that is, wheel used for ajusting the volume sucks! and then eventually the little joystick will stop working and it is very hard to keep clean. It is currently in the process of being sent to the manufacturer so that i can be fully refunded my money.

<Title>I'm not impressed
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My unit is actually the red one that is 4 GB but otherwise the same. I'm not impressed at all. Within TWO DAYS of gentle treatment the screen had a line through it. I didn't like the musicmatch software or synching with Windows Media Player. I DO like the hard drive factor  and once I changed it from MTP to MSC it worked better. I thought it was a good price for a 4 GB model, but I'm not sure I'm even going to keep it now. It is small and cute, but not very sturdy. I also can't find a case to fit it appropriately and still allow access to the controls. All the cases seem to be made for iPods.

<Title>This thing is worhtless
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this because Consumer Reports gave it a high rating.  I should have read the reviews here first.  It won't even connect with our computer using a USB port I use all the time and we've tried 3 cords, 2 of which are verified.  The device just says 'connecting' and windows says the device is malfunctioning.  I hope we can get our money back since we ordered it through an Amazon affiliate.  We've tried some of the settings suggestions posted here to no avail.  I would give it a negative star if that was an option.  Maybe it's just this one that is a lemon.  But this is a real disappointment as it was a gift for my husband and I spent a lot of time researching this purchase.  Paint me a sucker.

<Title>Terrible service
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am still waiting to receive my player from having it shipped off more than 1 month ago.  Got the player for Christmas, got it up and running with no problem.  Putting required software on my computer was a breeze.  I really like the sleek, shiny look of the player and it had good organization of files, etc.  Anyway, after about 2 days, got a message when I turned it on that "File system was corrupted."  Player was still under warranty, so I shipped it off to their processing HQ in TX.  They received my package (as shown by UPS) 4 weeks ago.  Called once, after 2 weeks, and they said it had not been logged into the system, but would get it taken care of.  Now, today it is still not logged into their system and I can call back in 24-48 hrs to check my status.  Calling in takes every bit of fifteen minutes of listening to horrendous Pan-flute music looped over and over again.  I think this would be a nice player, but customer service is sorely lacking.  I will write a real review of this player... if I ever get it back.
