<Title>Good Value

<Content>I just received this.  I plugged it into my computer with media player open.  Then put the songs in the sync list. Clicked sync.  The computer did the rest. Can't get any easier than that.  Good sound too.  Now those of you with older computers may need to put some extra software on for this, but I don't know.  Mine is a 2000.  I love this little gadget.  It is so small and holds all the songs I want.  So if you are looking for a bargain and don't need an overkill of space for songs then this one's for you. One thing to look out for- before installing the battery that comes with it - remove the thin plastc covering it. It is barely noticeable.  Company even upgraded shipping at their own expense.

<Title>Broken

<Content>I used the Cebrax MP3 play less than 5 minutes and its display quit working.  A few phone calls later we found out that we needed to return the player and get it replaced.  Maybe the replacement will last longer...

<Title>Didn't Work

<Content>My experience is exactly as the other reviewer.  I used the i.Beat Cebrax FM MP3 player for less than two days and its display quit working. I was able to get a hold of the manufacturer and several phone calls and emails later was told that I needed to return the player and get it replaced. Hopefully the replacement will work!!!

<Title>Good Mp3 Player

<Content>I also experienced the problem that two other reveiwers of this product did.  Namely, my screen would flash on and off. I tried replacing the batteries and that didn't work.  Finally in desperation I turned the device on and pressed the menu button several times in a row.  This fixed the problem and I haven't experienced it since!  The sound quality on this prodcut is good.  With the volume being (for me anyway) more than loud enough.  The radio and voice recording are both decent.  Overall this was a very good buy for the money.
