<Content>This product fits my Samsung mp3 player like a glove.  And it provides easy access to the headphone and usb cable jacks.  Also none of the buttons or the lock switch are affected in any negative way.  That being said, I bought this item hoping it would provide some protection for my player and it truly disappoints in that category.  It's too thin to help out at all if I were to drop my mp3 player.  And it doesn't even have a cover for the screen or navigation buttons.  Well, I suppose it does, the screen protector is sold separately.  Whose idea was that?  So unless you buy this sports jacket and the screen protector, you won't even be able to carry your player around in your pocket without scratching it.
