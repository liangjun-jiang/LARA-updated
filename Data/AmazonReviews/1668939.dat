<Title>the best mp3 player I've used.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the third digital media player I've owned.  I had a Creative Zen Tough 40 gigs, and a Creative Zen Vision:M 30 gigs before this.  I loved them both dearly but they became unusable a few months after I bought them.  I was super disappointed with the customer service for Creative, so I decided to get a Zune.  I've never had much of an interest in an iPod.  It's not a "I want to be different from everybody" thing so much as Apple just isn't my aesthetic and I wanted all my software to be of the same company.  The packaging is a winner.  I never really thought much about the packaging for a product.  The box it came in was sturdy and attractive and I still have it after two months.  The updated software runs kind of slow but it's still faster than any of the Creative softwares I used.  It helps a lot to not run any other program while you're using it.  Syncing songs to the player takes about one second per song.  Super fast.  The Zune Marketplace is also a winner.  I purchased the Zune Pass and it's really thrilling to use.  All the music I want for 15 dollars a month is a winner.  DRM protection's kind of a drag, but I think it's worth it.  I don't know anything about iTunes so unfortunately I can't compare the two.  You can't put the downloaded songs on a CD or play them on anything else but the Zune software and the Zune, but that doesn't really affect me.    I really love the hardware.  The double shot effect is really neat!  The device feels really nice and substancial in my hand.  It's actually kind of small compared to the huge Zens I used to have.  I honestly don't understand how people say the Zune's too bulky.  There's not too much to say about the firmware.  It's really easy to use, and I like how the letters on the main menu are really big.  It's easy to read, even if you have a lighter background.  It's really nice though, to have the firmware update automatically, because with the Zen, you had to go to Creative's website and download it yourself and put it on the player yourself and the whole thing took about two hours.  It was crazy!  I've always been impressed with Microsoft's customer service.  A couple weeks ago none of the media would play and they walked me through everything and the person I talked to was super nice.  There are a few things that keep it from being completely perfect.  These are pretty minor details though for the most part.  The least minor thing is the quality of the video.  With my Creative Zen V:M, the video was absolutely superb, crisper than a TV.  It was so impressive, and I kind of miss it with the Zune.  I really really don't care about video though, so it doesn't matter much to me, but if video is important to you, consider the Zen.  Another big thing for me is you don't have the ability to turn the zune to the other side so the controls are on the left when viewing pictures and video.  I'm left handed and it's incredibly awkward to use my right hand to control it.  Also, a clock would be such a convenient addition.  Voice recording and the ability to use the device as an external hard drive would be nice too.  The ability to record FM radio like you can with the Zen would be super.  I don't care at all about accessories but that's a huge factor for some people.  There's a company called Vaja Cases that make really super nice custom leather cases for the Zune 30.  I'm not sure they make them for the 80, or the flash drive based devices.  You can find plastic cases at like Best Buy too.  There's an A/C adapter too but I heard that it kind of sucks.  I have a radio adapter that plugs into any headphone jack and I like to use it in the car and whatnot.  Overall though I totally recommend the Zune 30.  It's super sturdy, and the software and everything is awesome.  Definitely consider it if you're looking at hard drive based mp3 players.

<Title>Amazing, Better than Ipod!!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is very Good, Great Sound, and if you buy the premium headphones, you get great sound, plus noise cancelling, great for the gym, or traveling.  Definitely you must get the membership on zune marketplace, were for $15 bucks a month you can download EVERYTHING you want. Rather than Buying from Itunes.  Zune beats Apple in about one hundred ways.  Tip:  You get three accounts for one membership, so you might get 3 friends, and each will pay only $5, for unlimited downloads, podcasts, videos, etc.  Very Cheap!!

<Content>I've had this Zune for a while now before bothering to write a review, but it's definitely worth buying.  The new Zunes are out, and I can't attest to their functionality myself, but microsoft keeps coming up with better and better ideas.  This thing is easy to operate, syncs easily, and is more durable than anyone should probably need.  I've dropped it plenty of times, and it's still kickin'.

<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Content>I owned a Zen portable media center, and while the screen was bigger, it was not nearly as sharp as the Zune screen. With Zune, both my kids can watch it at once since the viewing angle is so wide. I'm glad I have one.

<Title>Unlike many other reviewers, I actually own a Zune
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Many of the reviews here are from (and will most likely continue to be from) people who neither own a Zune nor have they ever touched a Zune.  A majority of the remaining reviews are commentary on the Zune vs. iPod battle without regard to a legitimate compare and contrast of the players themselves (possibly legitimate discussions, but discussions that shouldn't really be regarded as reviews).  My review is intended to be my first impression of my Zune along with a bit of compare and contrast as I make a switch (possibly permanent or maybe temporary) from an iPod to a Zune.  The Zune is a great player.  A large bright screen that presents a great user interface when navigating through your library or settings.  The screen is also beautiful for watching video and in particular works very well with pictures.  Despite it's slightly bulky look and large dimensions when next to other players in its class, the Zune feels just right in your hand.  Maybe a bit large to cram into a pocket, but seriously, it fits your hand like a glove.  Pre-release, many have knocked the brown, but it's a real nice color.  It has a subtle green accent that runs around the edge of the player and the contrast adds a lot of class to the player.  The software is not quite up to iTunes, or in reality maybe it's just that I'm used to iTunes.  The software is simply a better looking version of Windows Media Player (I guess that should be taken as a compliment to the Zune, because it really is a nice looking piece of software).  So, if you're comfortable with that you'll love this.  If you don't like Windows Media Player, you may not like this much more.  The wireless capabilities of the Zune has been a huge push from Microsoft.  This feature has been implemented quite well, but it will take some time for enough Zunes to be out the for the sharing to really take off.  Sound quality is no better, no worse than other players.  Overall the Zune is a welcome departure from the category leading player, the iPod, if for no reason other than it's something new in a category that has gotten a little repetitive over the last couple upgrade cycles from Apple.  The software though not as refined as iTunes, is a bit of a warmer looking alternative and it's UI differences may even grow on me enough to eventually like it more than the competition.  The player's menu navigation has every other player in the market beat.  Picture and video viewing is also at the top of the class.

<Title>Big screen and good design
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've tried out all the iPod competitors.  In general they have all disappointed me, but this is the first one that I really like.  The only downside is that it's not as thin as the iPod, but the iPod scratches so easily that it requires a case which adds extra thickness anyway.  (+) 3" screen is GREAT.   44% bigger than iPod video.  For the first time, showing a friend my travel pictures over coffee, etc. is an enjoyable experience.  You can even zoom into pictures to see details.  And now I can actually enjoy watching videos while sitting in a cafe.  My iPod video's screen is just too small.  I also like seeing the big album art while a song is playing.  (+) It plays ALL my songs and videos iPod won't play any WMV videos, AVI video, WMA songs, etc.  The Zune plays everything I have. iPod video doesn't.  (+) Landscape mode   When playing a video or watching movies, the Zune automatically switches to landscape orientation.  (+) Controls I really like the control layout.  Easier to adjust the volume than on the iPod.  When you switch to landscape mode, it's smart enough to automatically rotate the controls so that pressing "up" always scrolls up.  (+) No scratches. The case is made out of scratch-proof, matte finish material.  It looks and feels good.  My iPod video with it's high gloss finish looked great for the first month, now it's covered with scratches and looks like crap.  That's why everyone's obsessed with keeping their iPod's in a case-- which only adds cost and thickness and keeps you from seeing how shiny it is anyway.  (+) Music Sharing You can listen to your friend's music wirelessly.  And even take it with you for a few days. No need to plug into a computer.  You just stand in front of each other and transfer the music wirelessly.  (+) FM Radio. I didn't think I'd use it, but I do. Cool interface.  (+) Menu design makes sense.  Easy to use.  (-) Thickness The Zune is .58" thick.  The 30Gb iPod is .43" thick. Of course, you have to buy a case for your shiny, scratch-prone iPod and that will add more than the difference in thickness.  (-) Looks like a scroll wheel. It looks like the Zune has an iPod-like scroll wheel, even though that's not how it functions.  They should have done something to make it look different.  Now people will probably think they just copied the scroll wheel, even though they didn't.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As I write this review I am listening to some classic Hendrix tracks through my home-stereo via my brand new black Zune. I've had the product for a few hours now and I've been nothing but impressed. The zune software is very similar to WMP 11 and it was a breeze to set up. In fact, within 3 minutes I was syncing all of my exising MP3 and WMA tracks with the Zune and downloading brand new content from the Zune store for free with my 14 day trial pass. The interface is very user-friendly, and I prefer its look to the increasingly cumbersome interface of the itunes music store.   The Zune itself is just ridiculously cool. The screen is as nice as I've seen on a handheld device, and the interface took me all of 10 seconds to master. Everything about the product makes wonderful sense. The ability to use this with the zune subscription music service is a fantastic feature as I am an avid fan of all-you-can-download music.   So let's recap: Fast, easy, problem free installation of software.                 Ingenius user interface                 Beautiful LCD screen                  Zune store allows subscription downloads   I'm still undecided about sound quality, but so far I can't complain. I also can't comment on battery life because I've only had the zune for maybe four hours now. This product kills all other hard-drive based MP3 players in terms of over-all end-user experience. I've owned an iriver, ipod, and zen nano before and this is my favorite player thus far. I-Pod could compete with this only if they put a larger screen on gen. six ipods and allow subscription based downloads in itunes.   Okay, the wireless sharing feature will be a gimmick as far as i'm concerned because the chances of me meeting many people who also own a zune seem quite remote.. let's face it, not that many people are sporting 250 dollar MP3 players at my apartment complex or my college campus.

<Content>Got my Zune this morning and I like it a lot. Installation is very straight forward. The interface is intuitive and responsive. However I am going to return it because it does not support Unicode. My Chinese and Japanese song title becomes a bunch of squares. It also does not support any lossless format, not even WMA Lossless.

<Title>Does not work with Macs, iTunes, or your new car
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Crazy. Everyone uses iTunes because it rocks, excuse the pun, and has the exact same features on PC as it has on Macs, but this Zune does not work with iTunes, even on the PC. Doesn't work with my Mac either. Nor does it work in my car which has an iPod connector as most do these days. Not really a viable option beyond some marketing guy's white board. Maybe the next one will address these bugs.

<Title>Dear Santa...
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While holiday shopping this afternoon I got a chance to try out the new Zune.  The user interface is extremely easy to use - perhaps even more intuitive than the I-pod.  I'm not as enamored with the "wheel" motion of the I-pod player as some, so I was pleased to find the Zune's D-pad style controls responding as I would expect. Everything had that familiar feel - even for a first time user.    I liked how the menus went both deep and broad - I had the option to drill down into a specific category, but then I could also scroll across song options within that category.  I had a good sense of direction throughout the experience.  The music sounded good and crisp.  The video seemed fluid - I didn't notice any pixellation.  I liked the radio feature too - something I'm more likely to use than the alarm clock or calendar feature on the I-pod.  The addition of games would be nice - perhaps something to purchased off of the Zune Marketplace down the road.  I would have liked to see a Zune player without the wi-fi at a cheaper price point, but we'll just have to wait and see if the wi-fi music world that Microsoft is promoting really takes off.    All-in-all, a good player.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked to have seen a AC or car adapter included in the package - you're looking at an additional $40 for the official Power Kit.    This one is going on my list to Santa (or in my case - Mrs. Claus).  And yes, I'll probably ask for the brown.

<Title>Do not buy first generation of Zune.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well...I know I would regret it and I did. I got myself a Zune and it's going back tomorrow. I wanted to like the Zune because I think Apple needs a nemisis. (competition is good as the saying goes) But, the product feels like a prototype. I placed the Zune next to my IPod. The Ipod looks sleek and elegant and the Zune looks like it's ugly cousin. It's bigger, heavier and chunky.   OK! So it has wireless but so what. How many Zune are you going to find out there. Let's say you want to use it to tape a lecture or a meeting and you want to pass it along with your Zune buddy. Well that lecture or anything you created also dies in 3 play or 3 days. And let's say you play 30 seconds of the song and decide to stop, well counts as 1 play.   The Big screen...Well the screen is bigger but the resolution is the same. The test shot I did didn't look good and the album covers look fuzzier and not as crisp as it did not IPod.   13 hour battery life is not true. If you want 13 hour battery life you have to listen to in default volume and play the same album over and over and turn off the wireless.   It may have an OK interface and the guest sync is good but if you are in the market for a MP3 player, don't go for the Zune. While it has feature Ipod doesn't you won't be sharing anything with anybody because they are not going to be popular. There aren't that many songs, the marketplace doesn't have podcast, tv shows, video and host of other things you can get from Itunes.   In short if you really want a MS product wait for the 4th generation and maybe then you should get it.

<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this item for my 14 yr old son as a birthday gift.  He really wanted one and I was happy that I could get last year's 30GB for so much less than the newest 8GB.  My son used it for about a week and the system crashed.  I called Microsoft and got nowhere on customer services.  After waiting about 3 weeks for a return box to show up, I contacted Amazon customer service and had it shipped out the next day.  Then a replacement arrived just a couple of days later and we were back in business. He absolutely loves it and I was impressed that it was so versatile.  He's got music, pictures and even episodes of his favorite television shows on it already.  I buy on Amazon all the time and the customer service is simple and incredible.  I would recommend this product and Amazon to anyone.

<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Zune 30G as a Christmas gift for my son. Of course, I had to load the software and upload about 100 CD's to it for him. All of this took about a day or so. I didn't have any of the trouble that I see some others have listed on their reviews.   In addition, I bought the PQ DVD to Zune converter ($29.95) online from their site (searched for it by name with Google), and uploaded about 2 seasons of his favorite TV show for him. That took about 6 hours. The screen is perfect for TV shows, but the widescreen movies don't look very good on it. I don't recommend trying to watch those. If you have full screen DVD's at home, those look fine when uploaded.   He used it for about 2 weeks (all day every day) before leaving it behind one day when he went to school. That's when I had the perfect opportunity to use it myself. I took it to work out and ended up watching TV shows through about a 2 hour workout! I loved it so much, I bought one for myself. My second son was so jealous of our new Zunes, that I ended up buying a 3rd as a gift for his 8th grade graduation. Now when they want me to hear their latest "favorite" music, they just wirelessly share it with me through the click of a couple buttons.   I'm a HUGE Zune fan! However, I recommend the following items for optimum enjoyment (which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5):  Book - How to do everything with your Zune Software - PQ DVD to Zune Converter and Windows Vista Charger - I am buying a charger of some sort today because we can only charge the Zunes on our computers. I want to find some way to charge them in the car or just with a typical wall outlet. Battery life is really good on them though. (I only charge them about every 14 hours unless we watch a lot of video.)  Oh, one last thing, don't buy the Zune pass or anything like that until you actually start using the Zune. You may decide you don't really need it. I bought a $25 card to give my son with his Zune at Christmas because I thought he needed it to buy music online. So far, he's only bought a couple of songs. We have so many CD's that he just doesn't take the time to surf for extras.

Any way about the zune it's self it's decent. Like everyone else say's the software is horrendous. I absolutely hate it.  The only reason I got this is because my Creative Zen broke from me dropping it. And It was the cheapest at 99 bucks.  Also Check around for the new Zune's the 80 gigs one's on other sites are selling them for $249. So do shop around.  That's all

<Content>Poorly designed, poorly executed. Is too bulky, is riddled with bugs, and does not work near as well as my 30GB iPod. The wheel is not as easy as iPod's, the battery life is not as good as they state, you have to buy from their store (which is DEFINITELY no iTunes Store!) Overall, I was not impressed with this effort, and would not recommend it to anyone. If you bought it, take it back, quick! Let's just face it, this is yet another so-called "iPod Killer" that falls on it's face. Mr. Gates, give it up. Ande besides, who listens to the radio anymore? This product stinks, and is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

I picked it up, and I must say, The interface is extremely easy to use and well designed. Sure it uses proprietary computer software, but so does apple. The screen is a good deal larger than the vidio-ipod's, making up for the slight increase in size. The finish is a scratch resistant feeling rubberized plastic, much better than the ipods. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this device. This deffinatly will be a true contender for the ipod.

<Title>Looks awesome. Can't wait to get mine for Christmas.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I'd like to remind everyone who encouraged others to buy an ipod that this is the place to review a Zune. We all know what an iPod is and we all know that iPod and Zune are competing.   I went to go see the Zune today instore and I got a chance to play around with it a little. I read a lot of reviews beforehand and going to see it hands on was the last of my research to see if the Zune is really all that it's cracked up to be. Some reviews from different websites stated things such as:  "You can't view your now playing song"        -Yes you can. Whoever didn't notice this didn't take much time to figure it out.   "You can't shuffle the songs"        -As soon as you click on a catergory (songs, artists, etc.) the first option is to shuffle all.  "The album artwork looks bad"       -No, it really doesn't.   Overall, the Zune is very easy to control and a very nice mp3 player. The pictures and movies looked really good, the radio sounded good, songs sounded crisp and clear, features such as setting pictures to the backround, viewing movies in landscape, etc. are really nice..

<Title>Very nice
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't listen to people who own iPods and write reviews like the previous ones to try and convince themselves that they got the better deal. The Zune is, like I said, very nice. It's extremely easy to use, the software is good, and battery life is good. I've been playing with it all day but had to stop so that I write this review to try to dispel the previous inaccurate and flat out dumb reviews. About the size: It's the same width, 0.3" taller, and 0.15" deeper. I'm ok with that seeing how as the screen on the Zune is 20% larger. The Zune has a built in FM tuner, the iPod does NOT. The Zune has wireless capabilities, the iPod does NOT. The ONLY thing the iPod has that I wish the Zune had is the scroll wheel. There aren't too many accessories out there for it yet, but once word gets around that it's a lot better than the iPod there will be a lot more and they'll be a lot easier to find. So don't listen to these bitter people who have recently spent the same amount on an inferior product.

<Title>Not even close
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I checked out the Zune today at Best Buy. I already have two ipods so was just wondering how the Zune compared. I tried to keep an open mind but this thing isn't even close to the refinement of the Ipod or other MP3 players. They had the black and brown Zune on display. Yikes, that brown is uuuuuugly.  The wheel and buttons felt cheap and the over all look seemed cheap. The only nice thing is the screen.   Size wise the Zune is too big in my opinion. It is the size of my original 5 Gig ipod that came out in 2001. The 30 gig ipod is so much thinner and feels more refined.   I can't speak for the music store but Itunes is so good I can't imagine it being any better.   While I was there nobody even noticed the Zune. No big MS marketing materials pointing people to the Zune. Just two lonely Zunes that didn't stand out at all to the other many MP3's, let alone the Ipod. In fact, one of the Zunes had an error on it and wouldn't turn on. It just kept flashing a battery icon as if the unit did not see the battery. MS has a way to go before people will even look at this thing. When I was there a lady came up and said the the Best Buy guy, I'm looking for a 30 gig MP3 for my son's bday and he wants and Ipod. The guy never even suggested the Zune and so she bought her Ipod and went on her way. I think this will be typical of this holiday season. Most consumers want an Ipod and that is about it. Some people will get it for the screen size but for me, I'd rather wait for the larger screen Ipods to come out.

<Title>What was I thinking!!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While I'm not very techy person, I like owning cool gadgets and admit to have spent a good chunk of money on them in my lifetime. So with all the hype around this Zune thing, I had to get one. Close to 300 bucks later, I have my gadget, sitting in my home office desk. But did I get any cool-factor joy for the price?   No sir. For starters, here's my quick findings:  Its huge. What sort of baggy-pants were part of the group testing this product? And you get the same 30G for that extra bulk - where's the progress? Screen seems less brighter/sharper than I expected, especially in unfavorable lighting. Center button looks like a circular scroll wheel but isn't - its a fake (just a cheap 4-corner version). Installation is slow and has a lot of steps with corny pictures of people I don't care about. I still don't understand why I can't use American dollars to buy songs, instead of these "points". Seems like its a ploy to make me spend more money, like casinos with the chips that don't feel like real money.  I could go on and on, but I don't think its worth the effort... I'm sure I'll find some glitches and more gripes over the next few days. Or maybe I'll just put it back in the wrapping and wait for a "re-gift" opportunity.

<Title>Redefine Refined.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Rarely do you see a product from Microsoft that isn't subject to a barrage of heavily (and I do mean _heavily_) biased reviews, comparing it to other products and services that typically doing whatever Microsoft's products do, only better.  Look at the so-called "credible" reviewers working for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Whatever happened to journalist standard of forming and supporting a credible and unbiased opinion?  Perhaps if you set the competition aside (or look at it on less subjective and comparative scale) you will be able to grasp a fair review of a product.  But may I say that even the Zune does not require this formality, for it is a capable, stable, and solid product in nearly every regard.  Having been looking forward to the November 14th release date for a while now, it was safe to say that I was overjoyed when the day finally came.  After getting up in the morning, eating a quick breakfast, showering, and heading off to my single class for the day, it finally hit me that today would be the day that I would experience the Zune first-hand.  Certainly the harsh words put out by the big-league review columnists couldn't be completely true, right?  Come 10 AM, and there I was standing at the local Circuit City, eager to finally get my hands on the product.  After corralling a service rep to fetch one from the display case, making the choice of Black for color, checking out, getting back in the car, driving home, and getting upstairs to my computer, the time that I had longed for finally came to fruition.  The first thing you'll get with Zune is the brown package.  The box itself is fairly small, and is opened by pulling the top off from the bottom.  Once open, you will be greeted with the phrase "Welcome to the Social," on the side of the inner box.  Open a the flip-out side panel, and you will see your Zune for the first time, nestled in an indentation in the packaging.  A brown cord allows you to dislodge the Zune from the packaging, and two more flip-out panels to the left and right of the Zune house the magnetic black ear buds, and the sync USB cable.  Another opening at the top houses a small instructional guide, software, and other papers, along with a carrying pouch.  Overall, the packaging is nice, and allows you to get to your product fairly quickly.  The instructions are very simple, and you won't have much of a problem figuring them out.  The carrying pouch, however, is too small and tight-fitting, and seems to be provided to prevent damage from scratches, rather than impacts.  Installing the software doesn't take too long, and after a restart, you are prompted to plug in the device.  You will be given the opportunity to name the device, and you will then be guided to setting up a Zunetag account.  I haven't yet set up any online service with the device yet, so I cannot comment on how well the Zune store functions.  The device will automatically synchronize your music the first time out, with the option of synchronizing your pictures and videos as well.  The process went fairly fast, and any additional syncs after the initial load are quick.  The Zune software itself seems to be derived heavily from Windows Media Player 11, as the album-based libraries and options dialog will suggest, and everything fits well and is laid out in a practical manner.  While some may be turned off by the fact that you can't just use Windows Media Player for adding music, it should be noted that you would require a new piece of software anyway if you want to upgrade your devices software when it is updated.  Once all of your media is loaded, it's on to the Zune itself.  Physically, the device is tall, as to accommodate its 3-inch QVGA display, and is semi-thick; no thicker than the size of a small-medium cell phone.  The device is finished in a rubbery matte finish that feels very sturdy and lays true on a flat surface.  The button layout and functionality is well designed, and the only problem you will have navigating the exceptionally streamlined and intuitive menu system is accidentally pressing the center button instead of up on the directional circle, as they are both finished smooth and shiny.  The portrait-based display is very efficient for displaying lists of albums, songs, or play lists, and the album-art centric Now Playing screen also features an thoughtful layout, showing you the pertinent information to your current song.  Video and picture playback forces the device into landscape mode, rotating the screen 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  This allows you to take full advantage of the large screen when viewing said media.  While the Wifi's state in the device is virtually crippled, it is reassuring to know that it may very well be taken advantage of in a more practical fashion through future software updates.  The sharing feature is nice in theory, but the limitations that are imposed even on non-copy protected music seems a bit excessive, especially for elusive tracks that won't be easily found on online music stores.  The FM Radio feature is a very nice addition, and the display of track and station information is incredibly nice and useful.  Reception won't be without occasional static, but overall it is very consistent and distortion-free.  While you cannot record live radio as you can with other players, the ability to view track information is a near-exclusive feature and is very valuable.  Overall, playback is smooth and uninterrupted by jostles and bumps, and the menu system is responsive and polished.  Audio quality is top-notch, with all levels of audio -   bass, midrange, and treble - reproduced accurately and crisply.  The unit allows for several equalizer presets, and each one has a unique sound to it.  The absence of a bass-boost feature may seem like a loss, but you'll be surprised by the amount of kick you receive by the default settings that you'll learn to not miss such a feature.  Video playback is also smooth, but while I haven't encountered a problem yet, you may be prone to skipping or momentary pauses due to excessive bumping or movement, since the device is not solid-state.  The device, while larger than other players on the market, holds a presentable, professional and refined look.  The physical integrity (yet curiously lightweight construction) of the case only bolsters the units longevity and standout power.  The semi-transparent case with a "double-shot" of color looks very cool in person, and the unit definitely stands out among the sea of white-colored devices.  It is also a magnet for popularity at the office, as one person tells another person, who tells two other people about your new Zune...and they all try to use the directional-pad as a touch pad for some reason...  My only gripes about the device come from the people who brush it aside under the veil of being a Microsoft product.  Microsoft isn't printed on the device for a good reason: it's unlike any other Microsoft product you will have ever used.  The intuitive interface is easy and fun to use, the synchronization is fast and seamless, and the product's longevity through software updates gives you reassurance that even though it is a first-generation product, you won't be sorry when they announce a software breakthrough.  I personally recommend the device for those seeking a competent, well-rounded media player.  The combination of easy-to-use software and superb playback is a major strong point of the device, and the Wifi feature, while limited now, will most definitely come into play in more useful ways in the near future.  The only shortcomings of the device are limited format support, and the need for separate software and drivers to make the unit work on a computer.  In the end, the product is a positive mark for Microsoft's Zune initiative, and if the goals of the product are anything like that of the Xbox, then we may have a product with some serious competitive power in a very short time.

<Title>I just got one!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off i want to start off by saying that i have owned a creative vision m mp3 player as well as numerous other ones, but none have compared to the zune that i just picked up. I like the fact that it doesn't get your fingerprints all over it like the creative or the ipod video does. Also downloading and transfering music and videos with the software are easier than any other program out there. Also you can subscribe to download as much music as you want without having to pay a dollar a song like itunes, thats a big plus for me. Add in all the accesories coming out for it, theres just no competition in my book.  To all those saying theres bugs and stuff are full of it. mine works great and looks awesome as well. Plus no ipod user can compete with this screen. Two thumbs up in my book!!!

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm no tech-genious and I'm not a MS fanboy either, but the Zune has been a good buy so far for me. Sure it's a little bigger than a fraking ipod, but it's not that noticeable. Another good thing is the screen. It's bright and crisp(from what I've seen so far). The earbuds are the most comfortable I've ever worn...I dont know if anyone else cares, but I sure do. I'm not sure how it compares in weight to the pod, but its NOT THAT heavy. The software worked flawlessly for me, in that it automatically imported all of my music, vid's and pic's during the initial setup. I can't compare it with iTunes, because I've never really worked with it. Overall it's a good product and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good player.

<Content>microsoft is trying, but they still have a long way to go. the zune is noticeably thicker than the ipod and the 4 way control pad is a real step backwards from the ipod's touch wheel. i like the bigger screen, but not enough to suffer through the pain of a 1.0 software release. no thank you.  after criticizing apple for making a closed ecosystem, microsoft abandons it's own "plays for sure" partners and ditches the whole "choice" argument in hopes of making an end-to-end solution that doesn't suck.  keep trying, guys. i'll check back at version 2.0

<Title>Good but not GREAT!
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this primarily because it has a built in fm tuner. For some reason it seemed really galing to me that other brands had the nerve to  make us get an attachment to listen to the radio. That being said here goes the pro's and con's for me.  Pros-   Attractive- Some find it a bit bulky, but as someone who grew up carrying walkman cassette players or portable cd players, the size is not too much for me. I like the matte texture because it gives the player a soft look and makes scratches less likely.  Large Screen- The screen is very nice, I would not want to spend hours and hours watching it, but it is crisp and clear with great color.  30GB- This is plenty of space for me to keep all of my music and then some. I also find it handy for carrying images to show to friends and family members.   Headphones- For stock headphones, they are great. They almost never get tangles up on me and they are magnetized so you can stick the buds together.  CONS-  All of the cons, for me, are software related. I had no initial trouble with the software, it was not until the November upgrade that I started having all sorts of problems.   One is that the albums, album images, and artist don't match one another. I can be listening to NIN and an image of an ATB album will show but the album will be a third artist.  Another is that for a time I could not use the Zune software due to errors in installation. Then there was an error where the software was not recognizing my Zune.   My last con is that it does not support much of my music files, which are   WMA. I think their idea in that is trying to create a Monopoly in the way that Itunes has but it just does not make sense to me. If they are not beating IPOD in design(they aren't) then they should try by beating them by being more inclusive.   Overall I am glad I have my Zune, even with all its little quirks and irritations.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>Like the Zune, but not the program
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I personally found i like the Zune better than the previous mp3 player i had which was an ipod. However as for the program with my music library i cannot say the same. It is so difficult to use. Much less convenient and harder to sift through all my music. And as far as putting new music in, it is much more difficult. The titles of songs and artists get all scrambled. I love my itunes library, i just put a cd in and the names come in fine and if i want to change it i just edit it, the Zune program does not work this easily. It's quite a hassle to where i haven't even bothered putting new music on it.  So basically i wish i could have the Zune player with the itunes library setup/software. I do love the Zune itself, the color, thickness, sturdiness.  So if you are a person that either has all their music organized, no burned cd's with unknown or misc. artists or someone who doesn't mind disorganized music, then this might not be a bad choice for you.

<Title>WOW and Meh at the same time
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for $140 to sell off to someone else for $200 but while I connected it for him and showed him how to do things, I found out a lot of disturbing tidbits.  First, It can't even connect to a computer easily.  It gets the famous "ipod  errors" in which if you disconnect it without removing it safely from the PC it'll act funky for a while.  Though this is something I should have known previously (also not having a MSC connection type either), still...MS should have done a better job of making this more friendly for any and all computers.  It sucks that I can't use 30 GB's worth of space to store anything.  Another issue was turning it off.  The manual didn't really elaborate on that so I was extremely confused.  It seemed to be in a "stand by" mode instead of "off".    All of those pitfalls have sold me on NOT buying this product BUT there were definitely upsides to this device.  The screen is HUGE and vibrant.  The design is groovy and great.  Everything about the player and its features is great.  Only problems were connecting to PC's (just imagine a PC that has a non-commish account...how do you disconnect it then???),  no MSC mode to drag and drop  any files you want, and having to use software.

<Title>Love my Zune
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After using a Sony High Speed Net MD Walkman recorder (with mini disks) for a couple of years, it was time to update to a newer player. I now have a Zune 30 GB player and love it. For a female over 40 yrs of age it's so easy to use (I even got more helpful info and tips with the book "How to Do Everything with Your Zune" by Rick Broida). So far I have 1299 songs, 91 pictures & 47 movie videos on my device and still have over 7 GB free. The battery seems to last a long time, easily charges while hooked up to my laptop or a wall charger (faster charge time with the wall charger). The picture quality  so sharp and clear. There is even a built in FM tuner that have RBDS, meaning, some of the stations show the call letters, type of program & even the current song & or artist. The best thing is now I don't have to carry CDs in my car. My Zune plugs right into the car radio (made for MP players) and sounds wonderful. This unit has so much more features that I could write a book about it! My Zune was worth every cent!

<Title>Lots of problems
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had he chance to use one for a few hours now, and in that time I've still not gotten used to the lack of a real scroll wheel.  The unit really shows its weakness when compared directly hand to hand with the 30GB iPod...though that's not my iPod of choice.  It sucks that it doesn't work with the Windows Media Player, but requires yet an additional application to be installed.  I knew it was incompatible with iTunes and Microsoft's own Plays for Sure...so all other major stores and subscription services don't work with it, but not being integrated with Windows Media Player is just mind bogglingly lame.  The possible advantages over the iPod in theory weren't that was in reality.  I found none of my favorite radio stations where able to get any decent reception, and even those stations with reception had static when I moved with the unit.  Wireless has no purpose whatsoever other than letting someone else with Zune sample a song before buying...this of course requires finding someone with a Zune, negotiating the transfer, and then waiting for it to occur.  I'd prefer to let someone simply jack into my iPod, burn them a CD or point them to the iTunes Store.  Yes, the unit is ugly.  Get over it.  I don't care how it looks when it's in my pocket cranking out tunes.  One nice feature that I'd give it is that the display is mirror like enough to actually use as such when turned off.  This is like using the back of an iPod as a mirror.

<Title>Great Performance, But Lack of Support and other Problems Plague this "iPod Killer"
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I do not work for Microsoft, I do not work for Apple. This is a competely unbiased review, and I do actually own the product.  PROS: -Bright, vivid screen - A 3" Screen makes it the largest screen of a device this size. Can be viewed in portait or landscape, this very clear screen has good viewing angles and rivals very nicely with the iPod. -Great Sound - This is what REALLY matters right? -Design - With a durable rubberized surface, no fingerprints or scratches will be obvious, and feels safer to carry around in more rugged locations. Also, all three colors look really great. -Wi-Fi - Connect to fellow Zunesters to view what their listening to, share music, and all while not drastically reducing battery life. -Great Interface - The internal software interface of the Zune is great. It is actually built on the Windows Mobile CE OS, and the PC Software is built on the Windows Media Player 11 Software. Great performance and quick menus. -Plays Movies: H.264 (Quicktime/HD), MPEG-4, and WMV (native) -Plays Music: MP3, AAC, and WMA (native) -Views JPEGS  CONS: -Mediocre Battery - Music ranges from 10-13 hours, and video ranges from 2.5-3.5 hours. Very poor compared to the iPod. -3 Plays, 3 Days - Absolute bull. When you transfer a song, it only plays 3 times, or you only get 3 days (whatever comes first). That is not near long enough to enjoy a song. -LACK OF SUPPORT: DivX and Xvid don't play, Lossless music doesn't play, and only JPEGs are viewable. Everything else has to be converted in some form of the other. Previous subscription and protected music won't work on this device, and you are restricted to the Zune Marketplace for music. -Zune Marketplace - Although a great start, you can't buy movies on it yet, and you have to buy everything in points, which is a pain, because 79 points is $.99. -Wi-Fi restrictions - No wireless computer synching, transfering, or web browsing. -5 Click Wheel - Nothing innovative. Quite annoying actually; although responsive, it is nothing like the iPod. -Propietary USB - USB to USB-A(Mini USB) cords won't fly, you have to use what comes in the box to connect. It does charge relatively quickly though.  BOTTOM LINE: No, iPod killer, but a great step in the right direction. Microsoft's transition from Software to Hardware will continue to improve and this might be a tough competitor for the iPod this holiday season due to its large amount of hype. Unless you are really keen on getting the device, wait until the next generation. As an MP3 player, it is great; at the top of its class in sound, but still pails in comparison to the might iPod.

<Content>Firstly, our local Super Target is giving twenty five dollars gift certificate with each Zune. So, that should cover the taxes you pay. The offer is valid this week only.  Secondly, the screen looked brilliant and sharp. I don't care what the resolution is, it looked great to me.  Thirdly, the menu and the controls were very easy to use. I could use the whole functionality while I was playing with it in the shop for 15 minutes or so. (Well, I couldn't figure out how to preset FM stations.)  Finally, I didn't but it. I knew before that it doesn't have voice recording or FM recording function. So, 4 starts. I was interested in the device, even with the missing function, but it wasn't so attractive when I looked at it for me to buy it right then. I can wait to see the reviews of other people. My iAudio MP3 player that Zune might replace has VR function, that I do use once in a while. Also, could a real owner post if you can connect this device to any computer (without its own software) and be able to access the hard disk? Another reason, I didn't buy right then was that the white model wasn't on display. I would like to have a look at that before making my decision.  If I end up buying the device, I will update this posting.

<Title>I would give Zune a try; great sound and video
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is a great product.  Its standard Wifi separates itself from the pack.  Also, FM is standard unlike some of its competitors.  It does feel bigger then some other players out there (because it is!) but that shouldn't matter.  Most people put their players on their belt, in their pocket, etc.  The extra "girth" makes it feel a bit more solid.  Plus, the benefits of the bigger size (larger LCD screen for video) is worth it.  Pros  Exceptional sound.  The best I've listened to yet. Exceptional video quality.  The larger screen matters.  Trust me. Scratchless and fingerprintless body Wifi which, today, you can transfer songs to a friend Wifi, which, tomorrow, will hopefully bring more functionality Seamless integration with Xbox 360 Decent ear buds that fold up nicely Software and on-line store   Cons No bells and whistles  No equalizer (hopefully, this will change via a firmware upgrade) Songs you transfer to a friend can only be played 3 times/last 3 days No video downloads from website at launch (not a problem for me)

<Title>I PURCHASED MINE
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased mine yesterday from a local Bestbuy (Opening day) so far I really like this guy. There are a few things that Microsoft should change but the overall device is great. Here are my thoughts.   Positives -  - The screen is very clear... none like it - I purchased the Brown and love the look. - FM radio is very clear and picks up great - Video is sharp  - Menu on device is very easy to use and had great features like adding to quicklist.  - The texture of the device is really cool. It looks like it should last a really long time.    Negatives -  - Its rather big for a 30 gig but its still a good size. Its not too big and bulky.  - HATE! The PC software. The software that you us to move your songs over is HORRIBLE. It needs a ton of work. I am a Network Admin and know my computer software... and this one was complicated to figure out at first look. After playing with it for a hour I started to fugure out how to use it. I understand it now but still do not like the software. If you have a hard time using itunes, then you will have an even harder time using this sotware. This is the only downfall I have really found with this guy. The software automatically starts to sync ALL your music in youe "My Music" folder to your Zune. (I have 80 gigs of music that I do not want on there) Another big mistake with the software.  - It only comes with a USB connection and head phones.

<Title>It's a great product
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got mine yesterday and I have to say that I am pretty impressed. I was surprised at how fluid the menus moved and how well it felt in the palm of my hand. The video quality is very nice, and I like the blue glow that the thick  transparent plastic cover has. I would have gotten an Ipod, but every time I tried a demo unit out I was afraid I was going to break it. No worries about that with the Zune, it feels nice and sturdy.  I see people complain about the thickness, but I don't see what the problem is. Overall I found the software to be pretty self explanatory. I think the people that are nit picking the Zune are probably Apple fan boys, do us all a favor and go back to your steamy Steve Jobs fantasies. Leave the real reviews to people that actually own the device.

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a big fan of Microsoft and what it stands for but I dont know what were they thinking with this idea!!!!!!! I was gonna buy a MP3 player about six months ago but when I heard Microsoft is coming out with its own, I decided to wait..so yesterday I got this "Zune" and tried to put it in to my laptop..I have many friends who have ipods and i have closely seen and experimented on ipods of different generations at the stores myself...and also heard how easy is to use iTunes...so when I installed Zune Marketplace...I was surprised how complicated things were...you have to sign up for this...this...and that..I was so mad..I was like all I want is to pay 99cents and download a song!!!!! after 2 hrs of playing with it I've decided to return it and buy an Apple ipod...very disapointed in Microsoft..This product looks like it was hurried to put in to the market..to compete with an Apple...

<Content>Just when you think that technology surprises have all been used up, along comes the Big M with this bad boy.  Who could have envisioned a small, hard-drive based device that plays music and video on the go?!  Wow!  Just like when they invented the video game console, I can tell that Microsoft is really onto something here.  Plus, it comes in BROWN!!!  My advice - don't just buy this player, buy some Microsoft stock.  It is clear that the technology magic is just not gonna be stopped in Redmond anytime soon!

<Title>Terrible Product
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I tried this last night and it's horrible! The scroll wheel doesn't work as well as the iPod's. It's a cheap immitation. It's basically just 4-directional arrows underneath a wheel! The iPod blows this away. Also...the sharing feature is useless! Nobody else has one. Every time I turn it on there is nobody to share with. The social isn't so social afterall.  Now the major gripe...This thing is "chunky." It's ginormous! The iPod is so much more elegant.  In addition, I had major problems installing the software. None of my iTunes songs would transfer to the player after all the problems installing.  I'm returning my Zune and getting another iPod. I highly suggest if you are looking for an mp3 player that you sing another Zune and get the iPod as well. There just isn't a better player!

<Title>Wait For The Next Generation
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned 2 iPods and now a Zune.  I have always refused to buy the first year/generation of any product.  First year/generation models are always buggy.  I broke that rule and bought the Zune.  I should have waited.  The tonal quality does not approach that of a 5th generation iPod.  The battery life on an iPod is far superior as well.  The wheel does not work nearly as smoothly as an iPod either.  The Zune was a good idea but it was not ready to go to market.  I assume that if Christmas were not fast approaching they would have waited and improved the Zune a bit more before releasing it.  They should have anyway.  I gave mine to my sister yesterday and went back to my old iPod.  When I can afford a new purchase I will get a 60 or 80 gig iPod video.  Buyer beware.

I bought this to put movies on for trips.  I still have not figured out where to buy them.  I hoped to find them on Zune Marketplace but if they are on there I don't know where to look.

<Content>I purchased my Zune about a month ago, had no problems installing the software on my PC.  I am 60 years old and really enjoy using my Zune with the Shuffle All option, 'cause then I am not listening to one artist all the time.  Also, I really like the FM tuner.  I have the option to listen to the radio for even more music.  I bought the 30GB but I really think I could have gotten by with an 8GB.  The Zune 30GB is a bit big and a little heavier but I do like the big screen.

The sound is full, the color sharp and bright, and the software easy to use, though the initial update the Zune goes through when you first install the software is long with very little indication of its progression status.  Still I love it and getting new music on it is a snap.  Plus, the red color is cool!

<Title>zune in question
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have installed a little over 8 gigs of music and 2 gigs of podcast. I find that when music is installed the zune picks the genre(not happy) I have yet to find out how to change it myself if able. the player works well when playing audio quality wise.the exception is when "shuffle all" is used the zune will move to a new selection in the middle of a song and this has happened multiple times.   The ability to get podcast from online is great although very slow process. I have not found how to get podcasts from a cd or dvd to install into the zune under podcasts instead of music as zune likes to put it.       I do say at this point in fairness to zune I have not fully investigated cures to these issues however they would not be issues if the software for the zune was more user friendly and informative.

<Title>30 Gig Zune
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have owned both the Zune and Ipod. I ended up with a Zune after my hardly used Ipod stopped working...I had the Ipod for 2 years and barely used it so I was mad when it just stopped working one day. I ended up buying a Zune because I found a deal for a 30 gig for 130.00 and I'm so happy with the Zune. I love the radio feature, how easy it is to find a certain band, the picture function, and the syncing function. My only grip with the Zune is the software. Itunes was very easy to use and I have had a hard time with the marketplace and loading music...I've finally figure it out but I wish they would make it more friendly user...I recommend the Zune over ipod...

<Title>As good if not better than Ipod
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Zune 30gb for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with the purchase.  I caught it on sale for $149 at Amazon and at that price I knew it was a bargain.  But the features and performance are what have really impressed me.  The color screen looks fantastic.  The scratch resistant case is great and it looks handsome.  The interface is very intuitive and easy to use.  The little animated effects when you do different things are a nice touch.  The software is significantly different than Itunes.  But, after 15 minutes of use, you get the hang of it and I actually like it just as much if not more than Itunes.  All in all, this is a great product.  Do not hesitate to buy this over an Ipod.

<Content>I like it.  Had a Sandisk 8gb which was pretty good but wanted more memory so which one: zune or ipod.  I chose the zune for the price. I'm very happy with it.  I can put everything on it. The only problem is with the software.  It locks up on occassion.  You would think Microsoft would be able to find an easier way to program your zune. With a little work, I have been able to do what I want it to do.   I like the player so much my son got one.  He is very happy with it. I would recommend it unless you are tech-illiterate.  The software my be too complicated for you.  For the price vs. ipod, I'll buy the zune everytime.

<Title>My first dedicated media player - a review
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Packaging: I was concerned when I first pulled my brown Zune out of its VERY NICE packaging because I couldn't find a charger or much of anything else.  After a few hesitant moments, I found cool compartments in the package that contained headphones, a little brown soft-cloth baggy and a USB connection cord.  Install: I put the included CD in and it not only set up my drivers, registered and installed an interface/media player for the laptop, but also synced my stuff and upgraded the internal Zune software from version 1.0 to 1.1 right away (claiming to give me more stable and faster network sharing).  It required that I have internet access naturally for this step, but that's cool with me.  Power: It has a lithium ion battery, which means long battery life without the 'memory' problems associated with earlier battery types. No charger!  The battery was showing only a partial charge right out of the box, but I happily found that it gathered its charge from the small trickle provided by the USB port.  Very nice, no more boxy power supplies!!!  Graphics: Wow. Big bright screen (compared to my Pocket PC).  Menus fade in and grow and slide around very much like those in Windows XP Media Center Edition. Synced pictures on it? Then you can use them for your background. Those get faded, resized, rotated, zoomed and all that other jazz for you depending on what you are doing.  Audio: I played with some ripped Mp3s and wma files I had on my laptop (they automatically synced to the Zune for me) and they sounded great with the provided ear buds (the ear buds are magnetically attracted to one another which prevents them from getting tangled up in your pocket). The bass response was VERY nice.  I haven't even bothered messing with the equalizer yet, but I saw it in there.  The FM radio has scanning and presets available for you, and you can set it to which ever continent you happen to be on. No AM though :*( so no Rush Limbaugh for me unless I start recording it.  Video: The included video clips are way crisp with no lag. They are vivid on the screen and the sync even grabbed all of my TaeKwonDo belt test videos and shrank them to be viewed on the Zune.  The Settings show that you can broadcast your videos on up to 5 different XBOX 360s in your home (I don't even have one yet, but it's the thought that counts).  Controls: I am not so certain I like the wheel control yet; there is no tactile feedback (meaning, no little bumps to tell you which portion of the wheel you happen to be pushing on in the event you aren't looking). Nothing on the wheel to indicate which way is scan, volume, select or what-not, but the documentation or push-to-test works well enough. I understood later as I was viewing videos in Landscape mode that the Up-Down-Left-Right was changeable, so its explains the lack of indicators, but not tactile response.

<Title>Death by a Thousand Cuts
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>With Apple having sold 60 million iPods in the last 5 years, it's no wonder Microsoft felt it was necessary to go head-to-head with the iPod. Unfortunately, Zune is largely a tentative, half-baked effort. Despite the vast marketing campaign, prospective buyers should realize several important points about the Zune that isn't readily apparent in the advertisements.  1) Zune does not work with music bought from other Microsoft-backed stores like Napster and MTV's Urge.   2) The Zune's screen is physically larger, but has exactly the same resolution as the iPod: 320x240 pixels. You don't see more of anything - everything is just blown up to a larger size which can result in a larger but fuzzier image.  3) A lot of reviews like to quote how the Zune's battery life is "comparable" to the iPod. Unfortunately for Zune, it's only comparable when you compare it to the 30 GB iPod, which is significantly smaller and lighter than the Zune. The Zune's 14 hours of music playback doesn't look so impressive when compared to the 80 GB iPod, which is still physically smaller and lighter than the Zune. The 80 GB iPod plays 20 hours of music on a full charge and 6 hours of video, vastly outlasting the Zune.   You could play the 80 GB iPod at work almost a full work day (minus lunch) and still have about the same battery life as a fully charged Zune.  4) The Zune doesn't contain a lot of extras that are standard fare on the iPod. There's no Contacts, no Calendar, no Alarm Clock, no Sleep Timer, no Games (Tetris, Texas Hold 'Em Poker, PacMan, etc), no Screen Lock to prevent others from accessing your iPod's information without knowing your combination.  5) Zune does not support Audible Audiobooks.  6) You cannot share videos with Zune, only music.  7) There is no bookmarking feature - Zune will not remember if you stopped playing a song in the middle. The iPod will resume playing songs or audiobooks (see #5) at the point you stopped them.  8) Zune cannot be used as a external hard disk. The iPod can be used as a portable hard drive, which is handy for storing Word documents or other data (even application installers).  9) Songs purchased in the Zune marketplace involves buying Microsoft "points" at the rate of 400 points for $5.00. Since songs cost 79 points (not $0.99 cents), if you buy 1 song, Microsoft gets to hold 321 points or $4.01 of your money in an interest-bearing account until you decide to use them. In effect, consumers are giving Microsoft thousands of interest-free micro loans.  And with songs costing 79 points (a prime number), it is practically impossible to buy songs in a way where you can use up all your points. The system is designed to ALWAYS result in left-over points, which is basically unredeemed cash that Microsoft can take to the bank. It's not enough for Microsoft to make money by actually selling you a song - they need to make money off the money you don't (i.e. can't) spend at the Zune store because they priced songs at such a uneven number like 79 points.  10) Microsoft is giving Universal Music a cut for every Zune sold, on the premise that owners of MP3 players have tons of stolen music that Universal will never get paid for. Basically, even if all your music comes legally purchased from the Zune music store or ripped from music CDs that you bought, you are basically agreeing to pay a "stolen music" tax to Universal.  Given all these compromises, does a Zune's wireless sharing really seem all that appealing to you? After all, in order to share songs, you need to find another Zune user. I suspect that event will occur only slightly more frequently than winning the lottery for quite a while, which basically makes the wireless feature worthless.  To put it another way, it might be cool to be the first person on the block with a telephone, but the excitement will die quickly when you realize there's no one to call.

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had a chance to go through a Zune software install with a friend. OOOOOOOPS, he was running Vista. ZUNE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VISTA. Do not buy a Zune if you are running the Vista beta unless you have another PC or you must reinstall XP.  He had another PC with XP and loaded the Zune software on it. Install went OK after a couple of crashes, it appeared as if it had something to do with being a Guest. (Microsoft really should rethink the goofy pictures and Social references used in the install process.)  He moved some of his music over from the Vista machine to XP machine. OOOOOOPS, ZUNE ISN'T COMPATIBLE WITH MUSIC HE PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED THROUGH MICROSOFT PLAYSFORSURE FOR HIS HIS DELL DJ (That was a showstopper for him).  As far as the Zune player. MP3's he had ripped at 160mhz sounded fine. The volume control is not very linear though, tough to adjust it to the exact volume you want. The larger screen is nice but not as crisp as the iPod. They are the same resolution so that makes sense. The unit is a bit clunky compared to the iPod but overall it felt pretty sturdy. The software on the unit is nice. Easy to search and album art fills the screen.  FWIW - He is returning this Zune and will wait for Zune 2.

<Title>My first dedicated portable media player purchase - a review
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Zune Review  Firstly, I would like to say this is not a comparison to an IPOD. I haven't owned one, though I have played with several other brands of MP3 players.  Most of my media playback experience comes from using a PocketPC and 1gig memory card addons.  Packaging: I was concerned when I first pulled my brown Zune out of its VERY NICE packaging because I couldn't find a charger or much of anything else.  After a few hesitant moments, I found cool compartments in the package that contained headphones, a little brown soft-cloth baggy and a USB connection cord.  Install: I put the included CD in and it not only set up my drivers, registered and installed an interface/media player for the laptop, but also synced my stuff and upgraded the internal Zune software right away (claiming to give me more stable and faster network sharing).  It required that I have internet access naturally for this step, but that's cool with me.  Power: It has a lithium ion battery, which means long battery life without the 'memory' problems associated with earlier battery types. No charger!  The battery was showing only a partial charge right out of the box, but I happily found that it gathered its charge from the small trickle provided by the USB port.  Very nice, no more boxy power supplies!!!  Graphics: Wow. Big bright screen (compared to my Pocket PC).  Menus fade in and grow and slide around very much like those in Windows XP Media Center Edition. Synced pictures on it? Then you can use them for your background. Those get faded, resized, rotated, zoomed and all that other jazz for you depending on what you are doing.  Audio: I played with some ripped Mp3s and wma files I had on my laptop (they automatically synced to the Zune for me) and they sounded great with the provided ear buds (the ear buds are magnetically attracted to one another which prevents them from getting tangled up in your pocket). The bass response was VERY nice.  I haven't even bothered messing with the equalizer yet, but I saw it in there.  The FM radio has scanning and presets available for you, and you can set it to which ever continent you happen to be on. No AM though. Would it have hurt to put AM on it too? Why not?  Video: The included video clips are way crisp with no lag. They are vivid on the screen and the sync even grabbed all of my TaeKwonDo belt test videos and shrank them to be viewed on the Zune.  The Settings show that you can broadcast your videos to the XBOX 360s in your home (I don't even have one yet, but it's the thought that counts).  One video format I would like to have seen supported by Zune is the .dvr-ms format used by Windows Media Center.  I found a plug-in to convert that format to .wmv format which syncs automatically (even if conversions are needed) and plays fine with the Zune however.   Controls: I am not so certain I like the wheel control yet; there is no tactile feedback (meaning, no little bumps to tell you which portion of the wheel you happen to be pushing on in the event you aren't looking). Nothing on the wheel to indicate which way is scan, volume, select or what-not, but the documentation or push-to-test works well enough. I understood later as I was viewing videos in Landscape mode that the Up-Down-Left-Right was changeable, so it explains the lack of indicators, but not the lack of tactile response.  Overall: I am very pleased with my purchase. I chose the brown version because it matches (to some extent) the interior of my wood-grained Bimmer; and because to be `cool' one should be different.  When I hear all of the IPOD bigots saying the Zune sux `cause it ain't an IPOD, I wonder what ever happened to `Think Different'.

<Title>Zune  Vs  Zen  or iPod?
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my daughter a Zune for Christmas to replace her Micro Zen because she wanted something that played video. Now I really liked her Zen, but the Zune is 100% better. I brought it home and installed the software no problem and the Zune synced to her computer and transfered all her music automatically. The Zune sounds better than her Zen in my opinion, very crisp and clear. It is bigger but feels very good in hand. It's sturdy and feels solid. It feels like the kind of device, if jostled around in a book bag, purse, or accidentally dropped, that it would handle the abuse. (Her Zen already has a shaky connection where the earphones go so there is static if the device is moved around.) The controls are very easy to use and it seems to move effortlessly under my finger tips. The scroll layout is such a better design than the Zen. Now I don't own an iPod, but I have tried them out several times in the stores. I like the Zune's scroll better, because the iPod scroll goes too fast for me and I have to back track to get to a song or artist. Again the iPod seemed fragile to me compared to the Zune. The 3 inch screen is wonderful! It is bright and clear and the video playback is excellent...I love to watch it.  You can customize the background with any pictures that you download and watch a slide show while you listen to music. Now I feel she won't need the wireless feature for a while (I don't think a lot of her friends will have Zunes, they all have iPods), but that is not why I bought the Zune.  I cannot comment on the Zune Marketplace for purchasing songs. The Zune will now go back in the box until Christmas. The Software is uninstalled from her computer.

<Title>Wait for next gen or buy an iPod
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've used an iPod and Sony MP3 players for as long as they existed. My first impressions with the Zune:  I hated Sony for cornering me into using their own crappy software and compression, I guess you get that too with the Zune. The interface and software (iTunes) on the iPod is way more polished. iTMS offers incomparable music purchase experience.   Sound quality is better on the iPod (and even better if you invest in decent ear buds.)   The fact that the battery doesn't run that long on a Zune is a big turn off, I need it to run during my commute, and this is not lasting as long as the iPod 5G.   Screen is bigger on the Zune but same resolution so who cares because the video quality (compression) is what makes a difference and I don't want my videos to take more space!   The HD size is 30GB so there is no choice of 80GB model?   And what's up with the brown model? Yuk!  Wireless is useless: sharing DRM protected songs with other Zunes withing 3 feet is a meh for me. I can't use wireless to sync with my PC, why?   DRM on the Zune is also a big turn off. Play4sure incompatible with new software? What's up with that?   With the iPod, I download songs from iTMS and burn them to CDs. It removes the DRM and I don't get stock with Apple if I don't have to (think long term investment.) I can't do that with the Zune. Microsoft by releasing a  DRM that breaks compatibility with previous DRM already showed that we can't rely on them for supporting anything in the future.   End of line: Wait for a better model or get an iPod from Christmas.

<Title>First: Own the device. Second: Realize that the iPod is not incredible. Third: Neither is the Zune, but it is definately good.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the player yesterday, and so far I have only been happy with it. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the DRM issues and because I would've liked a little more battery life. That said, both of those issues don't bother me much at all, and I have been able to work around both of them. Also, no player is perfect.   The player itself is well designed. The interface is well constructed and easy to navigate. So easy in fact that they don't include a manual with the player, and that won't impede your using it. I haven't worked much with the zune software, though from what I have done it seems well designed. The whole marketplace issues don't really matter to me because I buy actual cd's, but for those who live in cyberspace, I can see where complaints come from.  For all of the criticisms against the body design, I have this to say. You are all comparing the zune to a device that is thin, fragile, fingerprints to an abscene degree, and has a nasty habit of crashing on its loyal customers. Apple has marketed the iPod brilliantly and have done a fairly good job designing a player, and as we have seen they develope quite the loyal fanbase. They are not perfect. And neither is the zune.  It's not tiny, but then again calling it huge is a relative term. It's the size of a normal mp3 player from a few years ago, and no one complained then, and I'm not complaining now. It sounds good, and these are the only earbud headphones I have decided to use, and I like to think I care about teh quality of my music. It's comfortable to hold and use. That's the bottom line.  My advice: consider this player if you are on the market for an mp3 player. Go to a store and try a floor model for yourself. Form your own opinion and realize that it is my opinion, not yours, that the player is well designed and has potential.  Also, both Gates and Jobs are full of themselves. In concept I like apple. In practice I admit I use microsoft. Neither should be preached about or have a blind fanbase.

<Title>Finally, something better than an iPod
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The brown Zune looks great and works great too! The software is excellent (makes it easy to pull down album art), the interface on the device is great, and I just got finished watching Garden State on my Zune after converting it to WMV from my purchased DVD (you will need extra, although free, software to do this).   Don't believe all the negative buzz about this product. As a person who has owned three iPods (1G, 3G, and 1G nano), this thing is superior (and FAR less scratchable).   I called Zune tech support to get some help, and I talked to a real person within two minutes. They were actually friendly and helpful, unlike Apple.

<Content>Don't waste your time with this product. It isn't that the device is bad, it's actually pretty good, but the software is the worst and keeps getting worse with every new release and update. To show you how bad this software is, Microsoft has an entire web site devoted to trouble shooting problems!!! Instead of developing the web site, maybe they should should've made a better effort on the software. If you don't mind headaches, wasted hours, and never getting the program to work correctly, then by all means buy this. Otherwise I suggest the iPod. The higher price is worth it.

<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this and the instructions SAY NOTHING about draining the device completely before you try to charge it. I had to call tech support to find this out. You have to do this in order to get it to charge...  then after it doesnt respond (try pressing play after an hour and if nothing happens) charge it on your USB... within about 5-10 minutes you will see the zune logo pop on the screen and start downloading the firmware. I hated this whole draining part.. but I love the product! 5 stars!

<Content>I hate iTunes, so i choose to avoid iPods.  This is the best MP3 player i've had so far.  Much better than previous units from Creative Labs that kept malfunctioning...  Pros:  Very easy to use, fantastic looking screen/menues/navigation, even the software is pretty intuitive.  Compatible with xbox 360 which is kind of neat.  Lots of space.  Cons: battery life kinda sucks, i usually have to charge it at the end of every day so it's good to go for tomorrow.

Kind of wish I had paid extra to get the 2nd generation 80GB because it is not as bulky. But I am very satisfied with the 30GB Zune(1st Gen). I like the screen. Big and colorful. The software is easy to understand and the battery last a long time.

There is no documentation whatsoever to help you learn how to use this; you have to depend solely on online forums all over the internet.  The software is confusing, and I'm fairly tech-savvy.  The Zune is just trying to be too many things to too many people and is failing miserably at all of them.  I received it as a gift; I feel bad that I don't like it but it is AWFUL!

<Title>Great Portable Media Player!
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my black Zune today and have been very happy with it so far. I did not have an MP3 Player before and the only "portable" devices I used for music & video were my Windows Mobile Smartphone and Pocket PC, thus I never bought any music online and did not have to worry about any previous Windows Media DRM protected files not playing on the player.  I do understand why a lot of iPod/Creative/Sandisk/iRiver/Archos owners may want to defend their products by trying to point out flaws in Zune. That's fine, but for someone in the market for an MP3 player for the first time, the Zune is a great product with the hardware (Wi-Fi) to provide extensibility in the future via firmware updates. The menus and song listings are very well organized and easy-to-navigate resembling Windows Media Center Edition.  All in all I've had great experiences with it so far and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for an MP3/Video Player.

<Content>This is a great product. I just love it. I bought mine on the 14th Nov and have been playing with it. I was able to load the software without any problem and the Zune software on the device is really cool. In my opinion its at par with iPod if not better.  The big screen really does make a difference. But small thing like the ability to personalize it with one's own pic is really good. I have a pic on mine which I had taken with my new Nikon D70 and now my Zune screams that it belongs to me. The FM radio is a good bonus.I think it's a really good start and things are only going to get better.  Rohit

<Title>Gets the basics right: excellent sound, easy to use, and fast sync
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love portable music players, (I have a 60Gb video iPod and a Sansa e270), and the Zune is a welcome addition.  Despite all the buzz over its wireless capabilities I find that it nails the basics, and that is the primary reason I am giving it 5 stars:  Screen: Bright, big, and easy on the eyes.  While a touch less sharp and crisp than video on the iPod, I appreciate the larger screen.  Controls: Very easy to use and make sense.  iPod users will want the center button to turn, but once you get used to the fact it's more like the directional pad on a videogame controller, it's just as effective.  Sound: *Excellent* sound.  Rich bass, decent equalizer, and if you want loud, it gets loud.  (Crucial for me so I can hear it over the roar of the subway on my commute)  Menus: Much like windows media player.  Attractive, easy to use and navigate.  A few things seem to take an extra click than expected, but I find the layout and flow intuitive.  Radio: Does the job, and is nice to have.  PC software:  If you've used Urge on WMP 11, then the 'Zune Marketplace' will look very very familiar.  It's easy to use, and I really like that you just start typing in something to search for, and it shows you how many artists, albums, or song names were found that contain what you're looking for, and you can then quickly go through them and find what you wanted.    Synchronization:  FAST!  This is critical for me, since I'm constantly shuttling music off and on my player.  I like having a music subscription service option, and since I am always sampling new CDs and such, having fast sync is necessary.  Wireless: I don't find the option to share songs wirelessly very compelling.  I'm hoping for future enhancements that will let me sync wirelessly, or perhaps even download directly to the Zune and bypass my PC someday (like the Music Gremlin mp3 player).  But, that's not possible for now, so I see this as a feature with lots of potential not realized yet.  Style: About as large as a first generation iPod, but seems lighter.  I really like the grippy rubber fingerprint-resistant feel of it.  Not as stylish, but much more practical.  XBox 360: I have one, and enjoy that I can use my XBox live account with the Zune, and also share music with my Xbox with it.  Capacity:  Would like the option to have more than 30Gb, but 30 is more than enough, since the fast sync makes it easy to swap when needed.  Overall, I'm really happy with the Zune so far.  I think it's going to be my player-of-choice for quite awhile to come.

<Title>The Zune vs the iPod 30gb video
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I want to give major kudos to Microsoft for putting out a very solid, iPod competitor. I purchased a Zune on it's first day out, and I must say that it has some major benefits over the current 5th Generation iPod. Currently, I own both a 30gb iPod Video and the 30gb Zune. I will try and be as unbiased and accurate as possible. This review will focus on  the Zune's strong points vs the Apple 30gb video iPod.  Section 1: External Look and feel  I will be the first to admit that when I first saw a picture of the Zune I thought it still had a ways to go, but the more pictures I saw (and even more once I held saw one in the store) the more I began to love how unique it is. The semi-transparent, rubberish exterior is a joy to hold. I was torn between Brown and Black, but I ended up with Brown because it had a nice vintage, cool feel to it. The Black is very impressive as well. It is very sleek and the blue double-shot makes it look very modern. Sitting next to my Black iPod it looks better, the only thing that I don't like is that the circle cover over the 4 way controls is slightly loose (on mine) and it makes it feel a little cheaper than the iPod. This thing is rugged and durable, though. Something that I never felt about my iPod. When I first purchased my iPod, I immediately put it into a thick case, while with the Zune it feels like it's already to go, whether it be in my pocket, backpack or on the seat of my car. I find it funny that people call it a brick as a derogatory nickname, when it feels very durable (like a brick teehee)  Section 2: Navigation on the Zune  Hands down Zune knocks the iPod out of the park for me. If you have looked around at other players, the Zune uses the Toshiba Gigabeat-style navigation and it's quite seamless. It's brilliant. You use your left and right buttons on the center "wheel" to Navigate through your Artists, Albums, Playlists, Songs, etc. then you vertically scroll to each song, picture or video. It's hard to explain, but it is very quick and easy to use. Once you have a song playing, you press the center button to get a range of easy to select options (5-Star Rating System, Show song list, Shuffle, Repeat, send, and flag). With the iPod you have to pan through these options rather than seeing them all at once. The iPod does not have the quick shuffle and quick repeat options that Zune has readily available on each song you play. The learning curve for using the Zune menus is practically non-existent. Finding songs on the iPod is no less difficult, but these quick options and ease of use are really what sets the Zune apart.  One thing I haven't mentioned is how good it looks while you are navigating your content. The subtle yet very noticeable animations when going between songs are very tasteful. That's not to say that the iPod's menus are not tasteful as well, but the Zune gives you a little more life that makes it better (imho). All in all you will fly through your tunes on the Zune. I found myself listening to 10 seconds of each song just because I liked jumping through the menus. I know, I'm a geek; but hey, they look good! The only thing that I noticed that was bad about the animations is that the Anti-Aliasing (type smoothing) seems to disappear when changing menus. This is barely noticable and isn't a deterrent for me at all. It's just something that I noticed.  Skipping to different parts of Audio and Video is better with the iPod's scroll wheel. The Zune does well though, it seems when holding down the right button (fast forward) it has 4 speeds that it cycles through pending how long you hold it (the longer you hold the faster it goes). With the iPod it's easier to let your thumb pace the speed that you want to navigate.   That's not to say that the Zune's buttons are bad. I prefer the Zune buttons over the iPod's for one reason really. The scroll wheel was just too hard to use while driving. I constantly found myself over scrolling songs. With the Zune, you can easily see that the tack you want is X amount of clicks away. It makes it much easier to keep your eyes on the road.  Section 3: Audio and Video playback  Being a musician and somewhat of an audiophile I can say that the Zune and iPod are on pretty level playing fields when it comes to audio playback. I did a quick switch using the Zune's headphones on both the Zune and my iPod and couldn't notice a difference. I went back and forth at least 10 times on a few songs at and I couldn't tell a difference. The iPod has more EQ presets than the Zune does, but the Zune's cover a decent enough range (not that I wouldn't mind having more).  As for video I'm going to give a little to both competitors. The Zune has bright colors and a very clear screen, but with the pre-loaded videos I saw more grain than I'm used to coming from the iPod. The iPod screen is pretty much perfect besides the size. Videos and photos are crystal clear.  Viewing photos is a more pleasurable experience on the Zune because it seems to be just as clear as the iPod, and the screen is bigger. I'm not sure why viewing video suffers and viewing photos doesn't on the Zune, but with the pre-loaded content that's the way it looks. I still prefer the bigger screen over a small loss in video quality.  Section 4: Zune Features Wi-Fi and FM Radio  I just want to quickly highlight the FM Radio and the Wi-Fi features of the Zune. I'm about an hour away from the Cities and the Zune's Radio reception has been poor so far. It seems pretty inconsistent where I am. Almost to the point of not being able to use it. This was pretty disappointing. The wireless has been so dumbed down that it's practically worthless for me. As of now the Zune doesn't have a big fan base. I'm doing my best to get my friends interested, but as it stands I don't have anyone to share my tunes with. It's disappointing to have a feature with such strong potential and not use it to it's full extent. The Wi-Fi being the thing that's supposed to separate the Zune from the iPod, takes a huge blow right away because of the uphill battle that Microsoft has to fight to get more users.  Section 5: Zune Software and Wrap-up  I'll be brief (for once) the Zune Marketplace is an elegant easy-to-use piece of software. It imported my music seemlessly and is a breeze to find the artists you know and discover ones you don't. I hope their playlists become a little more robust in the future because as of now they are pretty thin. The player handles music and ratings beautifully. It has a pretty straight-forward interface. I do like iTunes way of displaying how much and what type of data you have on your iPod. I haven't seen anything as nice as that in the Zune Marketplace.  In closing, I'll give you one of my main reasons for getting the Zune in four words. All You Can Eat. I am a person who wants to try out as many different artists as I want with no commitment (other than $15/mo of course). With the Zune Pass, I flew through their labyrinth of music files (still 1 million less than iTunes) and found tons of artists to stack my 30gb with. Most people like to own their music and that's well and good, but if Apple had a subscription service, I may not have purchased the Zune.  The Zune is a GREAT player, which I feel is much better than the iPod. If this is your first time buying a mp3 player, get the Zune. It's the hands down winner. More features, bigger screen, beautiful interface, very stable and has a little more personality than the iPod. If you're already an iPod owner and don't need things like wi-fi, fm radio and subscription based music, the Zune probably isn't worth a possibly expensive switch.  I'm lovin' my Zune, though. I've been having so much more fun with it than my iPod, but that's just me. Go over to Target or BestBuy if you can to check it out!  -=Edit=- 11/17/06  Section 6: What the Zune is missing   It has been brought to my attention that I missed a few key points. I am not a 'fanboy' of either Microsoft or Apple. These were mute points for me, but I realize that some people may really want some of these functions. The biggest one is that the iPod can be used as a portable mass storage device while the Zune cannot (currently). With the iPod you just plug it in and you have the ability to create folders. The iPod has a whole extras section that's missing from the Zune. I didn't remember to mention them because I never used them. They are:   1. Clock  I have not found a clock on the Zune. I wouldn't mind having one, I usually go to my cell phone before I go to my mp3 player to check the time.  2. Games The games that come on the iPod are pretty basic, but they beat Zune's wopping 0 games. Personally, I played them about one time.  3. Contacts You have the ability to add contact information ranging from phone numbers to web addresses and home addresses. I didn't use this feature.  4. Calendar The iPod has built in Calendar functionality.  5. Notes This is one that is actually going to be hard to lose. I often would throw directions to new locations right on to my iPod to save me the 'trouble' of printing. It was a nice convenience that you will have to live without. Notes work by dragging text documents to your iPod notes folder. I never had any problems with it. The text rendering is pretty basic.  6. Stop Watch The iPod has a nice little stop watch built in. I never used it, but I'd assume it would be nice for more active people than I.  7. I may have mentioned this, but the Zune Marketplace has about 1 Million less songs than iTunes and currently doesn't have any videos available for download where as iTunes has a plethora of tv shows and movies to choose from. I was always aware of this, but I have no doubt that Microsoft will be expanding it's library pretty fast. They have a lot of catching up to do.  In closing (again?) The Zune is the right player for me because of all of the points that I have mentioned. The iTunes has a lot more of the smaller features that I don't really appreciate as much in a PMP. Most of the extras on the iPod I do on my phone. But the mass storage thing is a pretty huge hit, and even though I haven't sold my iPod yet I already miss my notes. The Zune has some tweaks that definitely could help it out, but it is a joy to use as is. When it comes to listening to music and ease of use, the Zune is the winner imho. I will give the iPod credit for it's larger amount of extra features.   If I could change my rating of the Zune, it would be a 4.  I hope this helped Cheers

The menus are easy and the buttons are right where they should be.  Sound quality is very good. The large screen is large and bright. Movie quality is on par as well.  The only thing I dont like is that the sync is all taged based and does not show up as a drive.

<Title>Zuned Out
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Microsoft is taking on Apple in the multimedia player market. Well, Microsoft is a marketing company. They will sell some units. As this is the first release of Zune, there are bound to be some less-than-favorable problems (features). First, if you own a Mac, forget it!  Zune only works with Windows (and not with Vista pre-release.) Commercial media can only be purchased from the Zune store. (No iTunes support, not even under Windows). A typical song costs 79 points. (Points need to be purchased in advance, in five dollar increments for 400 points.) You can purchase subscriptions, for unlimited music downloads, at a fixed monthly charge. If you typically download more than 15 songs in a month, this option may be appealing. Zune is wireless, which has some interesting potential. You can send a song from your Zune to your friend's Zune. BUT, it will only play three times or for three days, whichever comes first. Battery life is rated 13 to 14 hours (depending if wireless is on or off.) On a full charge, the most I saw was about 9 1/2 hours. Although the screen is larger than that of an iPod, the image quality is not as good as you would hope.  There are a couple of good points... There is a built-in FM receiver. Sound quality is reasonably good. I am waiting to see what the next generation is like. But for now, I'll stick with my Mac and an iPod, thank you.

<Title>Zune is Great!  The Software isn't.
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this the day it came out because I got the urge the night before.  I immediately had buyer's remorse.  I knew that I hardly ever used my last two (now defunct) iPods, and figured that this would be no different.  Luckily these fears have been put to rest for the most part.  As far as the reviews on Amazon right now I would venture to say that anyone who gave this thing 1 star hasn't bought it and are one of the many rabid Apple fanboys that would buy a quarter for $5 if Steve Jobs made it.  I would also venture to say that the people who gave the Zune 5 stars are maybe a little overzealous.  Yes I did give it a 5, but thats only because theres no 4.5.  The actual Zune unit itself is outstanding.  Its close to the same size as the iPod, costs the same, and offers way more features.  Looks are in the eye of the beholder but personally I think the iPods are starting to look old, and they really aren't very reliable.  The Zune has personality.  The menus are outstanding compared to the iPod.  There are nice subtle animations and everything moves smoothly, something you can't always say about the iPod.  Plus when you hold the Zune you feel like it can fend for itself in you pocket, whereas the iPod would get scratched if you so much as looked at it (exageration).  The Zune is almost, but not quite perfect.  Now the software that comes with Zune...  Thats a whole other story.  Its probably perfect for the average user who just wants to get songs on their device, but me, I like to know everything thats going on.  The software doesn't allow you to choose the install directory, and the first time it starts up it will import just about every song, and most pictures and videos it can find on you computer into the Library.  Something I didn't want it to do.  I don't know if there is something wrong with my songs, but most of the ones that didnt have album art were assigned the wrong covers.  Overall the Zune software is better than Apple's first attempt at iTunes, but nowhere near where it should be.  I didn't mark the unit down much for this because its something that can, and will be improved over the coming months.  Summary: Hardware: Outstanding, a true competitor to iPod if it catchs on. Software: Has a long way to go before the entire process is perfected.

<Title># 82 Best Selling Electronics
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One week after launch, the Zune is being outsold by all iPods, two Sandisk media players, and a Creative media player - OUCH.  Falling all the way to # 82 on the electronics volume selling list...  Read the reviews before purchasing - major software installation problems.  Not compatible with Vista currently.  You must buy fake Zune points to purchase music.  The monthly subscription option does not include all music - you still must purchase the most popular songs separately.  Microsoft launched the player before it was ready - no podcasting support, the list goes on...

<Title>a real owner of a zune
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The zune is really hot.  people are trying to say that it doesn't play all formats but if you remmebered the ipod didn't play as much as it do now when it first came out.  If you need an mp3 i would choose this one because i sure that microsoft will release updates that allow more formats and many more goodies to be unlocked on the zune.  The software is a bit confusing at first but once you get the hang of it, it is really nice. when i had my ipod, it kept breaking, glitches ran a muck and please don't forget, almost every time you turn on you computer there was an update.  So please don't be ignorant and complain about it lack of software.  Just give it time and it will be one of the best mp3 out.

<Title>It's not what it looks like
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's not supported in Vista.  The Wi-Fi is not useful So far I cannot get the Wi-Fi to do anything.  I can't get it to connect to the internet, that's not supported. I can't play or download songs directly from the Zune via WiFi. I can't sync to my computer with WiFi. Wi-Fi will search for and find other Zunes nearby.  (no one else has one and I doubt they will for a while) If someone else had one I could send songs for a couple of plays.   The screen and such... The screen is nice but video and images look about the same as they do on the iPod.  To me there's no real difference except the sideways video thing that increases the viewable area minimally.  The navigation button thing... It only looks like a click wheel.  It's a funky hard to get used to button thing.  I'm used to the iPod that has always had an easy natural feel.  This is a "clunky" way to navigate compared to the iPod.  The software and music store is unnatural and confusing. why points?  why not just dollar amounts?

<Title>Nice product
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was amazed how easy the Zune is to operate. Clicking through files was as easy as operating a PC. You can't do a lot with it other than storage, but that is what the Zune is about. Not crazy about the FM tuner reception. It is great if you want your music, pictures or video to show to family and friends without pulling the old photo album or box out of the basement. The Zune holds tons of material and you can take it anywhere so you don't need a pickup truck to haul all your archived material. You can take it to your friends and family and hook it right up to their TV. Well satisfied.

<Content>I really like the Zune, it has a lot more memory tha the other mp3 players, and you pay the same price that you would pay for the other types. Plus, I was even able to get it in my favorite color, so it's a double bonus for me. It's also cool that you can share music with other Zune owners (even though you can only play it three times). I recommend this product for anyone who listens to a lot of (or different variations of) music. This thing Rocks!!!

<Title>I told my Ipod "Say hello to ebay!"
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Within one week of owning a Zune, my Ipod 30 gig was thrown on ebay. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my Zune, and the features are too great for me to ever want anything else. I did keep my ipod nano (the screen has malfunctioned on its own twice) for jogging, because I wouldn't risk dropping my zune. If you want to be a boring nerd and whine on the internet about screen resolution, and you need an alarm clock and notepad on your Ipod, hey, your a loser and maybe the Ipod is for you. If you want the most for your money and you really couldnt care less about pixels, and just want what looks feels and sounds better....get yourself a Zune. put that ipod on ebay!!

<Title>Zune Purchase
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was very pleased with the recent purchase of the 30g Zune. There were a couple of issues I ran into when downloading: First I found that I loaded 800 or more songs from my cd's and after loaded I deleted some of them to find that when I synced it the songs deleted were removed from my Zune. That was very frustrating. A book with directions and FAQ would have been most beneficial then I would not have had to look all over the internet to find out what the problem was. Overall I do like my zune

<Title>Zune meets the mark!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was a little discouraged about getting a Zune at first, but like so often happens, I found it on Amazon for a price that I couldn't pass up. I went ahead and bought it and when I received it I took a little time to figure it out, but once I got it all program up and running I found that it more than met the mark with what I was looking for. With 30 GB worth of room on it, I've got photo album after photo album on it along with about 3,000 songs and I'm down from 27.7 GB to 24.3 (approx.).   The only thing that I don't like about it is that the battery seems to discharge while its on or off, so I'm constently charging it.  Other than that, I have used it about every day since I've had it and that's been about a month. Great product, get the battery situation worked out and it would be a perfect product!

<Title>Finally the killer has arrived. Look beyond ipods. Why you should avoid Ipod.
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have never liked Apple for its over the edge proprietary control over products and services it offers. What is really disturbing is that people are willingly submitting to apples ridiculus controlling methods. For example not allowing your purchased music to transfer back to PC after a reinstallation or in case of getting a new PC.   Having said that, lets take a look at Zune and compare with ipods. First lets talk about features that Ipods lack.  - Wi-Fi. Oh yes, it will probably be on the next generation ipods, but unlike apple fans, we won't go crazy complaining it was copied from Zune.  - Wireless sharing of music. If apple doesn't even allow paid customers to transfer back their purchased music (from ipod) to a new pc or after a reinstallation, do you think they will allow "sharing" of music? dream on.  File Formats : Stubborn apple doesn't support WMA format. Oh man, don't they love to hate Microsoft although Microsoft saved Apple when it was struggling to survive? But why do you want WMA format? It is because nearly ALL the online music vendors except Apple distributes music in WMA format. So when you get an ipod, you are stuck to Itunes, and Itunes only. Zune in addition to playing WMA, MP3, it plays AAC, JPEG,WMV, MPEG-4, H.264 files as well.   Build Quality : Ipods don't even qualify to be compared in this category. Zune is rigid, solidly, very well built gadget. Even without any kind of cases, it is not scratch prone. Ipods need those expensive fancy cases, but even then they are so easily scratched. Zune has round edges with high quality plastic layer to protect the screen.   Display : Zune can be used and navigated in a horizontal or vertical view. Beat that ipod! Oh did I mention Zune has a larger, brighter display than Ipods. Afterall it is no fun watching video in a lilliputian ipod screen.   Navigation : I really loved it. What a slap in the face of Apple fanbase. Now they won't be able to complain Zune stole the navigational wheel as if nobody else on earth has any creativity. It is not a click-wheel like IPods. Navigation is vertical. It is common sense, the shortest distant from one point to another is a line, not a circle. So that means you can navigate faster using a vertical navigation. Zune navigation is fast and works very well than wheel.   I personally prefer something that is of open architechture, that gives consumer more choices, more flexibility. It is true that not many mp3 players have come and gone, but Zune has a good backing. There are of course better digital players than both ipods and Zune, but because many of those companies are small and don't have enough to allocate for advertising, their products remain unknown. I mean you go everywhere, you see ipod ads. That is the sole reason for their success because it lacks in features and substance. So it needs a way of tricking people. Much like they annoyoing PC-vs-Mac guy ads. They say, if you repeat a lie 10 times, it becomes the truth. Apple says ipods are the best, we hordes of sheep say "oh yes allmighty apple, I'm honored to buy an inferior product, I'm happy to be given only one choice, .."   Cowon (iaudio, jetaudio) makes some of the BEST music players. Creative makes great soundcards but its mp3 players have been very disappointing. And finally IRiver is also good choice. Do your research, know what you are getting unless you are one of those blind apple fan who will reject everything non-apple.   It is time to put a stop to Apples manipulation.  WAKE UP people.

<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On another note, it seems that I got a defective Zune (why would this be the case since it's the first batch of devices?). Anyway, the battery status is very inconsistent and moving up and down. I only played the Zune for 15 minutes and the battery is now half and falling below that margin after a fully charged.   Being very nice to the device, I also turn off the Wireless feature, just to conserve on battery (what a joke that was). And yes! It was fully charged before I started using it.   Contacted Amazon for a refund on this thing.

<Content>I actually really love this thing! Everything works as it should and the screen is the reason I bought this. It's great to watch videos and movies on this. I also have an Ipod, but I am giving that to my wife. Videos and pictures look way better on the Zune, and the navigation is easier to use than the Ipod. Surprisingly, the sound quality out of the Zune is better than my Ipod too.   The software that runs with the Zune is good but it will be great when their music catalog is more up to speed with the number of tracks available in Itunes. The Zune software is not as good as the Zune itself - yet. Sync works great for music, video, and pictures.

<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I never owned an iPod, so since Zune hit the market I'd thought I'd check it out. Went to my local retailer and was able to do some hands on comparing the iPod and Zune. The iPod had a much better feel and was lighter. The sound qualty was the same (using the same set of head phones for each). The scrolling was easier on the iPod. The Zune is larger than the iPod, the iPod felt right in my hand. The video screen on the Zune was a little larger but the clarity seem to pale next to the iPods. Now as far as software installation, I don't know. but when I walked out of the store, an iPod came home with me. The iPod software installed quickly, works smoothly with iTunes. I am so glad I compare first! I say get an iPod!

<Title>Why all the hatred?
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What's up with all the animosity?  I can't see why anyone would rate this product a 1 star.  The only thing that comes to mind is the few ignorant Ipod loyalists that haven't really spent the time to figure this out.  I too love my Ipod but I'm also open to new ideas.   For most people, an Ipod is everything they need.  It's in it's 5th generation, it's small, compact, well polished, the software is getting there, and it has tremendous aftermarket support.  But for me, it lacks some features that should've been introduced from Apple a long long time ago.  Apple's market monopoly is holding back and releasing as slow as possible to milk us.  Simple.  Now that Microsoft, with it's deep pockets, introduced their Zune, Apple will have no choice but to get things moving.  That's good for us, the consumer.  So why all the hate?  If you're an Ipod lover, you should be happy that Microsoft got things rolling.  Because, after all the smoke clears, we're the true winners.  In my industry, when I get visitors from competing Japanese firms, they're nothing but inquisitive.  They don't look at my products and stick their noses up in the air and say that they're products are superior.  They want to learn everything about our operation.  Microsoft's been quiet for 5 years.. maybe they've learned a thing or two.  About the Zune.. It's big.  Ofcourse.. it has a protective case already wrapped around it.  All you need is a screen protector.  It has a 44% larger screen.  That I don't really care for too much because a 3" screen is still a 3" screen lol.  Can't wait until Apple or MS brings out a 4.5" or something.  The Zune also has wireless built-in.  And an outstanding digital radio.  I can zoom in on my images too.  And the screen doesn't scratch like my Ipod.   (Why the heck were Ipod's so easily scratched?  Was that Apple's way of negotiating with 3rd party case manufacturers?  That was lame!  Easily the biggest reason I hated my Ipod.  So beautiful yet had to be covered by some ugly cover)   Screen resolution..  Have you ever seen a Sony PSP with it's beautifully large 4.3" widescreen?  It's got a software limited 368x208.  The Zune has a 320x240 resolution in a standard 4:3 ratio.  If you discount the extra horizontal resolution the PSP has due to it's wider screen, the Zune is sharper!  Click wheel.. Ipod's click wheel was neat at first but I got tired of it real fast.  I was never 100% precise with it and would often overshoot my songs.  The Zune scrolls just as fast as any Ipod.  Seriously, why spin your thumbs around in circles when you can easily just hold down a button?  The Zune scrolls just as fast as any Ipod.  I never saw the logic in that.  The button is more precise and less fatiguing.  Hands down.  Firmware.. If you've seen a store model and it's "glitchy," whatever that may mean,  chances are, the Zune was never plugged into a computer and never had it's firmware updated.  If you go to settings>about>zune, you'll see your firmware version number.  As of right now, the current version is 1.1 (322) and released hardware is 2.0.  If you install the CD into your computer, it'll update your firmware for you.  Easy.  I'm not a brand loyalist, I'm a product a fantatic.  And until Ipod can come out with something better, I'm all for the Zune.  But I'm sure Microsoft won't let just stand there and watch.

<Title>like my zune
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a zune in exchange for my i-river H10 that crapped out on me (only had that for 13 months, very little use).  Used the zune when I went running this morning, it did not skip or quit playing (held it in my hand, don't have a fancy case yet).  It was a bit time-consuming to start up the software, with the upgrade, but all my wma files nicely synced.  I stayed away from ipod mostly because I used windows media player to rip my own cd's to the computer--I don't have any music purchased from the internet.  Yes, it is a bit big, but just last year I was carrying a cd player when I exercised, so this is a lot nicer.  I do have a flash-memory player also, but I can just have so much more music with me with the larger player.  I also like the fm radio, very handy to check the score of a ballgame when out on a run.  I am just an average 40-something who is a bit technology impaired, so I was just thrilled to figure out how to play music without have to search out directions.  (Had a Creative Zen--returned it, never could figure out how to load the thing.)  If people are so happy with their ipods, that's great.  If you already have a player that works so well, then why go spend the money on a new one only to bash it?  I'm not a brand-specific person for any kind of items, but when I find something that works, I tend to stay with it--when will there be a zune-mini???  Thanks for the nice product!

<Title>MS may have got it right this time...
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just bought one of these babies and I really like it.  They didnt copy that annoyingly touchy thumb wheel from the Ipod and it is considerably easier to navigate through menus.  It came with a free 14 day trial so I have unlimited downloads from their marketplace. I was admittedly apprehensive about their music selection but was pleasantly surprised that they seem to have all 30 or so artists that I enjoy (from White Zombie, Puddle of Mudd to Hoobastank).  I did have to re-download a couple of songs from the marketplace (free unlimited downloads thank god) that would not transfer from Itunes due to Apple's annoying need to utilize their exclusive m4p filetype. Luckly, it had no probem transferring my movies and pictures. I am very happy to ditch Itunes since it doesnt "play nice" with ANY of my other devices and tends to crash my system.  The Zune marketplace seems to work fine and allows me to do things like download a new song and transfer it to my phone's ringtone. The customization of the Zune Marketplace interface needs a little work, but knowing MS they will catch up fast. Yes, I bought the brown one and it is really not a bad color at all. The green tinge looks cool too. I gave my video Ipod to my husband :) Although after seeing my Zune, he's not really that happy about my "gift".

<Title>Zune Great Job!
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I Just got one and i really  love it. My best friend loved his ipod, but he gave it to his wife after he played with mine. lol. it it's real good. Big and bright screen, I really love the fact that you can put any picture as background, it really look great!. the controls are really well organized, the menu is smooth, really easy to get to everything you need. The radio works good, I like how it give me info of the radio station and it also show you the title and artist of the song currently playing on the radio station, remember when you heard a cool song on the radio and wonder you is it? well now you will know so u can easy get the song later.  One thing I notice after reading some previews here is that a lot of them are misleading. For example, one says Zune doesn't play DivX and Xvid. first anybody that has a ipod knows that ipod does not play DivX and Xvid , even more the only video file that ipod plays is mp4. Zune plays mp4, H.264 and WMV. plus who care if it doen't play Divx , remember that Divx is a old codes, and now days is mp4 is becoming more standar, so Zune is in the right track.  Next, some people says negatives things about the 3 times or 3 days song shearing feature. well remember it's the music industry fault. they are the ones that doesn't want people to share music, The copyright laws are the ones that limit this awsome feature of wireless music shearing , so don't take on the Zune. But pictures are very easy to send from Zune to Zune and those are yours to keep, isn't that great? .so don't let anybody fool you, Apple's Ipod does not even have wireless capabilities, so why people even dare to say something bad about Zune, having something is always better than having nothing.  Also, I read a complaint about the sinc cable saying that u can only use the type that came with the player and not a USB to mini USB one. well ley me tell you that that exactly the same way ipod cable works , u can only the type that came with the ipod.  I'm just saying get info from different places, cause some people say things that Zune lacks but they forget to say that Ipod lacks them too.  and with the Zune marketplace soon the will add video too!!!!!

<Title>What's the point of sharing...
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>...if you can only play the songs you get from other people 3 times within 3 days?  That's right, read the fine print before you buy a Zune for it's sharing capabilities.  You can only play shared songs 3 times in 3 days (whichever comes first), and then POOF... no more song, only a link to the buggy and limited Zune Marketplace to buy the track.  Talk about lame!  The only reason I'm not giving the Zune a 1 star rating is because the player itself isn't all that bad... it's bigger and bulkier than a full sized iPod, but the controls work quite nicely.  However, getting the Zune to work on your machine will probably be more difficult than with an iPod.  I've owned two iPods, and I've never had any problems making them sync with any of my computers (Macs and PCs).  Not so with the Zune.  If during the course of using your Zune with your computer you run into no problems, count yourself lucky; I ran into several.  Another downside is that you can't use iTunes with the Zune, and nothing touches iTunes for easy media organization in my opinion.  In Microsoft's defense, this IS a first generation product, and there were bound to be issues.  But the Zune has a long way to go before it's anywhere near competing with the iPod in terms of ease of use (not to mention the thousands upon thousands of accessories that are available for iPods, the ability to play feature films, and podcasting, all of which are not available for Zune).  The only reason I would recommend this player to anyone is if it were significantly cheaper than the iPod... then it would have at least some differentiation.  As of now, however, the overall user experience with the Zune is not even half of what the iPod offers, yet the 30 GB models of the iPod and the Zune are the same price.  So the real question is... why buy a Zune over an iPod?  The answer...  Don't.

<Title>New 30-gig ZUNE - did not work the 1st time 
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased a new (not a refurbished) 30-gig ZUNE as a gift for my wife.  On receiving the new Zune we tried to charge and play it - it never worked.  After several lengthy calls to Microsoft for their assistance we were informed the device is defective and to send it in for either repair or replacement.  MS had sent a box with which to send the device to their repair or replacement shop.  After being gone for a good period of time it was returned to us.  On opening the original return package we noticed the device was replaced with a refurbished unit.  I had purchased a new device however I received a rebuilt one - likely with a used hard drive, screen and battery, and whatever repairs there were to make it work.  There is no way of telling how old the device is.  Had I wanted to originally economize I would have bought a refurb'ed unit.  After several lengthy phone calls to MS and talking to ten different people we were told it is their practice to replace defective units with refurbished units.  We were not told this before sending it back.  Be aware of this when returning your device for repairs - you may likely get a rebuilt one and yours refurbished for someone else.  Fortunate for us we purchased this ZUNE from Amazon who replaced it on hearing of our plight - Amazon is the place to shop for nearly all your wants/needs.  S.D.

<Title>Zune
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purcahsed 2 of the Brown 30gb. One worked fine the other one did not. I sent it back in one of Microsoft supplied boxes. They lost it and told me it was never received yet I had a signed copy of the person who signed for it. I finally got one back. Not the one I sent in to have fixed. Not real happy with Micosoft and their support or lack therre of. No problems with Amazon they have been great.

<Title>It's Okay
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This device was received in a timely manner.  I bought this as an anniversary gift for my boyfried because he is a truck driver and I wanted him to be able to watch movies when his television is not working properly in various cities.  It is very, very, very hard to download movies to the zune. I am a little upset because that's why I bought.  Zune's music site has a lot of music but you have to pay for them which is a bommer.  But you can sync the music you already have on your computer.  He has two movies on the Zune right now and I can' tell you how long it took or how I did it.  I tried various software conversions, it was very tiresome. I can't seem to be able to download anymore.  Now my computer is now showing the zune screen, and I have deleted and reinstalled the software several times.  But I used my sister's computer and downloading is just very difficult.

<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I gave this to my wife and wow is all I can say.  She wanted a new mp3 player, but I got her a whole entertainment center.  She has several movies on it, hundreds of songs, and enough pictures to last a long time before you see repeats.  With the home a/v package she can turn any of our tv's or computers into giant digital picture frames that play music.  Too awsome to describe, and easy to use.  Had to get conversion program to download movies, but it is simple.

<Title>Nice, but clunky
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this product as a replacement for my Creative Zen Vision:M and I was a bit disappointed.  Obviously any of these devices can play mp3's just fine, but the MS Zune is unable to play just about any video.  There is one video file type that it will natively play and anything else will require you to go through a cryptic conversion process.  The size of this old version is a large pill to swallow as well.  The size of the screen is awesome, no doubt about it.  Unfortunately its inability to play most videos forced me to revert to my Zen Vision:M.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the very few videos that i did get to work looked great, but it took so much work to get them recognized that i was literally angry when I watched them.

<Content>This was an awsome buy and I could not be happier.  I currently have over 2,000 songs on it plus every video and picture I've ever taken of my 11 month old daughter and still have tons of memory left.  My husband plans on taking it with him when he deploys so that he can have hours of video and tons of pictures of us. Really easy to use and organize. Very very happy with this product.

<Title>Zune 30GB...pretty amazing
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I absolutely love this Zune.  I had a Creative Zen Vision:M, but the screen cracked, so I needed to get something new, and this is much better than that, at least in by opinion.  I gave it 4 stars only becuase it could have come with some more accessories...like a wall charger and screen protector.  The only issue that I had with it was the battery life.  Everywhere I look it says that it should last between 12-14 hours for audio play.  I felt like I was charging it every other day, and couldnt figure out why it was dying so quickly.  I did some reading and it turns out that the way that it says to turn it off is wrong.  They say to hold down the play/pause button for three seconds, but that only puts it in sleep mode.  The way to completely power it off is to hold down the back button and the down button (on the D-pad).  That seems to have helped.  The software is a little tricky to figure out, but there is ample information online to answer any questions you may have.  You should have no problems if you take your music right off a CD or purchase it from the Zune store, I am not sure about itunes.    I have shown this to my friends that have ipods and they have said that they like it much better than an ipod.    I am very happy I bought this.  Great Product!!

<Title>LOVE mine. So many people HATE Microsoft...
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Beware many of these reviews. There's a huge sector of the techie world that has a deep-seeded resentment of anything Microsoft, and most hardcore Apple users have an emotional attachment to the iPod as the one thing Apple's done that's really "caught on" in the popular sector. I'm here to say that as an unbiased consumer, I really love my Zune.  I am a careful buyer. I read many reviews after my iPod bit the dust last week (convenient timing) and I was debating a switch. I heard there might be trouble with the software, so I downloaded it from the Zune site and installed it. The software installed with no problem at all. Never even a glitch. It's simple, intuitive, and clean. I had no problem with iTunes, either, for the record. I like Zune's sync with the player better, though.   The Zune itself? Not as big as some reports had led me to think. Very comparable in size to my 30G iPod video, a tiny bit bigger. It seems lighter, to me, and I like the screen much better. My friend Dusty - who very well might write one of those venomous anti-Microsoft reviews somewhere else - had to admit the screen was better than the iPod. He loves the Zune, now. Customization is nice - you can use any photo you have to "skin" the background. Wireless? I haven't had much chance to use that, it wasn't a big selling point to me, but the few people who were playing with the wireless function at the store seemed to have no problem. I hear they're going to open up more wireless functionality with future updates.   Music - well, it sounds great.   Pictures? I love the widescreen slideshow.   Video? Again, the widescreen is nice.   Battery life seems fine, I haven't made a lot of calculation there  the headphones have a neat little magnetic fucntion to hold them together when not in use.   What would I change? Well, the Zune store only sells music. They should add video since it's a major function of the player.   Basically, I'd like to see a genuine contender in this market compete with iPod. Competition is good for innovation, and price. I hear people say "will this be the iPod killer," and I find that ridiculous. Some people drink Pepsi, some people drink Coke. One isn't going to replace the other anytime soon. I hope the same will be true for the Zune and the iPod, and I look forward to seeing what future generations of both bring us.

<Title>I really wanted to like this!
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Zune two days ago and exchanged it for a black 5.5 gen iPod today (I had sold my white 5 gen iPod to buy the Zune).  I was really excited about the Zune, and really wanted to enjoy it. I was looking forward to the large screen, and connecting it up to my 360. But alas, it was not meant to be. The device itself is great, I loved the design, it felt great in my hand (despite being a bit thicker than I would have liked), the screen is beautiful, and the menu system seemed very easy to use. The software loaded fine on my computer, but when I connected my Zune, that's where things went shady.  I disconnected and reconnected my Zune many many times, and got varying results (but never the desired ones). Sometimes niether the Zune nor the software would do anything...sometimes the Zune would start charging, but nothing else...sometimes the the Zune would say "Connected" but nothing would happen on the software side. Once (once!), it actually worked...the Zune said "Connected" and the device showed up in the software and started to update the Zune firmware...then it froze. I even tried removing the software a few times and reinstalling it, to no avail.  I wasted six hours over two evenings trying to get this thing to work, and I had enough. At least I got a new iPod out of the ordeal.  My advice: - If you own an iPod, keep it! Maybe upgrade to the 6 gen when they come out, as they'll likely feature the few things about the Zune that make it appealing. - If you're looking for your first media player, consider the iPod or Creative Zen before even thinking about the Zune.

<Title>Run for the Money
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I posted this in reply to a review then decided to post so everyone could see. [...]    The 3-times/days WECF (Which Ever Comes First) ONLY applies to music that you recieve via wifi from other Zune's. At the very most this could be a bit misleading but you can't even do this with an Ipod. I think I can see where Microsoft is going with this, given there 'Welcome to the Social' add campaign. Maybe your friend has an album you interested in but you want to hear more before you buy it yourself. If you both have zune's he can "gift" (Ipod terminology thievery)it to you so you can decide wether or not to buy within three days or three plays. Maybe instead of standing under those giant 'hair dryers' they call listening stations at your local music store you can walk in there pick up the album through wifi and decide while you shop for other stuff or come back later. Granted these situations and many others like it requires a substantial number of people using zunes but given what looks like a decent first outing I can't say it's beyond the realm of possibility. Microsoft looks to be in it for the long haul and I hope that Apple steps it's game up too. But to knock the Zune for offering a feature that's not even availble on the Ipod semes kind of pointless. You have to remember also that you can't even share Itunes you've purchased with other Ipods at all. The only music you can listen to without any restrictions (except for actually 'owning' it) are through people who have Itunes and connected to your network. For most of us this isn't a plus unless you're allowed to have Itunes at work.  If you own the music you will have no problem transfering to Zune UNLESS you've purchased it through Itunes (Microsoft and Apple should lower that barrier why should this turn into another Mac vs. PC battle). As for the wireless syncing listening to Major Nelson podcast (via Itunes) who is actually an employee of Microsoft interview with Ross Honey who works with the Xbox Live Video Marketplace and Zune software "Hinted" (using qoutes sparingly) that the wifi pc syncing feature along with others would be availible through firmware updates (such as the ipod update that allowed you to show album art while playing the song).  While not totaly convienced that I'm gonna make the switch, the lack of podcasting (a feature I can't live without) is the only negative for ME that I can actually report on. While there are several reviews of software/hardware misshaps, so be careful. Either return it for another Zune or get another Ipod.

<Title>Tune to Zune!
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, let me just tell you....I'm an iPod user.  I do enjoy the sleek look of iPod...and yes...I do enjoy being a part of the buzz surrounding the product.  However, I got a chance to play with the Zune at launch and to my surprise, I was completely delighted.    Things I like:  Twist interface - flows so smooth and fast The build quality - I love the feeling of the zune.  no fingerprints! The brown - I purchased it...I think its very trendy looking FM tuner - Not a biggy, but it's handy I suppose WiFi - I'm hoping MS expands this feature...I feel they will Screen - Beautiful...nuff said Transfer Speed - GEEZ!  This thing is SUPER fast! MarketPlace - Typical, but very intuitive and sleek  Things I don't like  Microsoft - They have a reputation for abandoning things. (DRM) Video - Where's the store guys?  At least have SOMETHING for launch Points System - Lame.  All in all it's a great PMP.  I highly suggest going out today and picking one up!

<Title>A Little Shine in macland
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I work in a pre-press environment (i.e Mac fan-boy land). I myself can take or leave a mac or pc I am smart enough to use both. I had an ipod the 60 GB photo. It "claimed to have features it did not when I bought it and then with it's first update to add the feature mac made my accessory obsolete and started selling their own for only 39.95. needless to say I returned it and got off the i-pod wagon forever. This post is not to bash the ipod though it is a fine player but it's not for me. Since then i have tried several several other players some had ice features but the best ovrall way to describe them is "clunky". a few months ago I noticed the GIgabeat burning up the review circuit and was planning on the purchase. then just before buy date noticed microsoft's offering so I held off.   In the months of development I read teasers and leaks and then reviews of final models. I went to the store yesterday planning on being disappointed by the hype. I picked one up and brought it home turned it on and gave it the once through and everything lived up to expectations. I installed the software without issue it takes some time but without issue. I was happy it wasn't the windows media player software. It's simple but nice. it isn't not quite as robust as i-tunes yet but is a great start. I prefer media monkey for my library and hoping some of the third-party developers will get on board and write plugins to support the Zune.  Most importantly it works well with the Zune. I browsed the marketplace and like I-tune's decided not to buy. I enjoy the freedom of choice i get with ripping cd's.   After importing in about 800 songs to the software I did my first Sync. it took about 5-10 min not bag for 8 gigs each song was a matter of seconds. I then tried to put the zune through it's paces and really found nothing wrong with the way things work. The Twist interface is great and I thought I'd miss the click wheel of my past i-pod but really didn't. I really prefer the controls of this. The changeable background although only a novelty makes my zune personal and is a nice touch. Album art takes center stage while playing and with the time I took tagging my collection it is nice to see my work properly displayed. I played with the features for a number of hours adding video and photos and really was happy with the product. It managed to live up to the hype.   Well the next day I brought the zune into work and thought I'd show it off to my friends at work. I really expected a lot of "it's not an i-pod so I'm not interested" But I was pleasantly surprised. After explaining the controls quickly" It's not a click wheel, Up down left and right. The center button is the enter key, the arrow key goes back." I gave them all a chance for a hands on experience. as they got to the music section I explained the twist interface " ok click on a album, Notice how the menu bar changes so that you can now go from album to album now using the left and right direction." Although I got a few I'll stick with my ipod, I also got several unexpected quotes like  "Apple has got to watch out because this is actually really good.",  "Apple finally has a real competitor", " I actually like this better than my I-pod. The menu thing is really cool", " It's easier to use than I thought it would be.", " This is going to make the ipod better now that they have some competition" I was amazed that I didn't hear all the normal microsoft bashing and there seemed to be some real respect for another media player. I doubt any of the group will make the change and I wouldn't expect them to. But I can bet they may look twice if mac support is added to the Zune.   Well My final part of the review wil be things i can see coming within the design of the zune. With vista just over the horizon and the media abilities of that os you can see the wifi thing possibly taking off more, Also in the video player portion of the zune the "quick" fast forward jumps the video ahead 30 seconds (enough for a standard length commercial), With the announcement of the X-box live store of downloadable movies and TV shows it's only a matter of time til that content makes it to this device, Also syncing via the xbox 360 seems inevitable also. Microsoft has a 3 headed monster with it's multimedia integration so expect a long drawn out fight with the ipod. It'll be tough but fun to enjoy the benefits as consumers. Both apple and microsoft should be bringing their "A" games.

<Title>Accompanying software won't work and wiped out preloaded content
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I opened the box I was excited, and after playing with the device I thought Microsoft might have gotten it right for once.  But when I tried to load the accompanying software, it wouldn't install fully -- it just hung at "Installing software". When I connected the device to the PC, it started the software and the software said "Your device needs to be updated from v1.0 to 1.1 - click Next" -- I clicked Next, and I got "No updates could be found." Wtf? At that point the software wouldn't recognize the device had been connected, so I couldn't sync any content.  Tried MSFT support, but they couldn't help.  The next morning I thought I'd reconnect and try again. When I connected the device I got a screen that said "Removing content" and ALL THE PRELOADED CONTENT GOT ERASED, but it still wouldn't update the device. I could not have been more horked.  Does not increase my confidence in MSFT's ability to develop software. Liked the form factor of the device, but now I'm returning it due to its dysfunctional content-erasing software. Buyer beware.

<Title>I LOVE My Zune
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Firstly let me say that I have no idea why people who don't even own a Zune write reviews about it. Those people should just continue to be happy with their sheep status with the Ipod. The Ipod is an excellent device, Kudos to apple for making the first truly fabulous portable music player. I have owned no less than 5 different Ipods going back to 2001 when most Ipod fan boys did not even know ipods existed, and my first mp3 player in 1998. Alas I wanted something different, and tried an army of mp3 players. When Microsoft announced the Zune i could not wait. I finally have the device and I love it. The sound quality is better than the Ipod. The screen is great, the device is light and pleasant to hold. The menu is easy. I applaud the Zune folks for not trying to be just another Ipod rip off, but to distinguish itself in a sea of mp3 players. I can't wait to start meeting fellow zune owners on my commute and beam songs back and forth. The greatest thing about the Zune, is how the built in wifi is going to be used going forward. It should be exciting. For those who don't own a Zune, no one wants to hear from you, write reviews for the Ipod instead, people over there will care.

<Content>It seems, some PC's front USB ports don't carry enough power to support the Zune. Try the rear USB ports and try not to use any extension USB cables. This should take care of most of the sync problems. I wasted a good 4 hours trying to figure out the problem until I read the solution on a Zune forum.

<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The wireless sharing concept is good, and Apple needs to incorporate it into its iPod, but there are not enough Zune owners to make it work.  Also, once you've shared a tune with someone, you can't share with that someone again.  So, that makes it doubly bad.  First, there aren't many Zune owners,and then, when you do find one, you can only share once.  Microsoft needs to change that.

<Title>First Time Digital Media Player User
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product is fabulous!  I loved it, the fact that it could work with both itunes and windows media player is great.  As a first time buyer/user of digital media players I wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by it.  It has traveled quite a few places with me proving itself to be a hardy product.  My two year old niece got hold of it and even after her onslaught it is working amazingly.  I use it at the gym and even with it's slightly larger size, which some people found undesirable, I find it is still convenient.  The larger screen is great for pictures and videos and is really clear.  What I did find a little irritating was that the player instead of having a wall plug-in charger, had a USB cord that was used both to move media and to charge the battery.  This is not a totally bad thing but I mainly use mine for travel and I don't always bring my laptop along so on my first trip I had to sabotage a hotel computer to get it fully charged for a flight.  Obviously buying a wall charger will solve the problem but I must have missed the USB cord in the product description.  I also, like many others, found the installation of the software to be a little confusing, but not so much so that I would let that stop me from buying the product.  I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend it to any first time user/buyer. Five stars for a excellent product, not bad microsoft, not bad at all.

<Title>Zune 30 GB is great!
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have to admit that I was hesitant to buy older technology. But the fact that I could get 30GB for the same price of the new 8gb Zune led me to buy this unit.   The first thing it did when I plugged it into my computer was tell me to update the software and "BOOM" it looks and acts just like the new models, but this one has an equalizer and the new ones don't.  The only thing that is missing from this unit versus the new models is the touch pad. But honestly, I have tried the touch pad and I would probably disable it anyway. It is too sensitive for my fingers.  My son has an iPod 80gb. He loves it. I hate it. Unless you use iTunes to rip your CDs you don't get the album art. And you HAVE to use iTunes to use your iPod unless you jump through all kinds of 3rd-party software hoops. No thank you. iTunes is a resources HOG! I tried using it as a music player and my computer slowed down to a crawl and I have a 3.0 ghz dual core system with 2gb of ram! I also rip all of my music to a central drive at a very high quality. If you do that, iTunes does not pickup the album art. So he has this cool flip-cover software on his iPod but all of his covers are blank since he is pulling the music from our mp3 library.  Though the Zune software is nothing to get excited about, in fact it is a bit clunky, it picks up the album art and syncs with no problem.  It also has better sound quality than any iPod that I have tried.   Buy this player!

<Content>As you can tell by the title, I absolutely love my Zune!  I bought it for myself (from my husband :) for Christmas.  I don't have anything bad to say about it!  It has soooo much space & I love the fact that it has an internal battery... I was using a small 1GB mp3 player that took AAA batteries and they always died after 2 workout sessions!!  The savings on the batteries alone is astronomical!!!!  The menu is super easy and I just love the "Quick List".  You just add your favorite songs into it, set it to "shuffle" and you get an awesome song every time!!!!  I use Amazon's mp3 downloader and I love it!  The songs go right into Media Player and the Zune program, making this product really easy to use!!  The sound quality is great and the large screen is awesome!    The 30GB Zune is quite a bit larger than the iPod Nano, but that is no problem!  I use the DLO Action Jacket to strap it to my arm while exercising and you don't even notice the size of it!!  The easy to use menu and buttons make it easy to skip a song if I need a peppier one to keep me going!!  I will admit that I was having a hard time deciding between the iPod and the Zune.  I am sooooo glad that I chose the Zune... and you will be too!!

<Title>Good device, terrible software!
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like the 30GB Zune's features. I'm glad I got it at a clearance price from a large retailer, because normally it's overpriced, just like the Ipod. The scrolling display makes it easy to reach any song or any artist very quickly. With firmware version 2.3 I can wirelessly sync with my laptop from across the room: not a crucial feature, but nice. The sound quality seems better than other MP3 players I have - maybe because of the Zune's discrete components inside.   But there are some negatives too.  I'm not getting anywhere near the advertised 13 hour battery life - maybe half that much. (and yes I reset my battery display after updating the firmware).  The short life could be because I usually have the volume set near the maximum 20. I'm using less efficient but better-sounding headphones, not the earbuds that came with it. Or else I'm playing it thru powered speakers, which work best with the highest possible input.   My car and home stereos have USB ports, but the Zune is not recognized. Probably because it does not identify itself as a Mass Storage device. So I have to use the Aux in jack, with reduced sound quality, and shorter battery life.   The worst thing about the Zune by far: the PC software! Once again Microsoft wins the crapware contest hands down. All users needed was an interface like Windows Explorer. Would that have been so hard, Mr Gates?? Instead we get this cutesy full-screen bloatware that doesn't tell us bitrates or any other important information about our MP3's. It makes it hard to see the contents of the Zune or the PC, it syncs without being told to, it flashes random percentages that seem to have no meaning, it can't get simple album covers correct. Thank you Microsoft for showing us that a worse product than Windows Vista can actually be foisted on the public.   I'm hoping some future hacks will give us better sync software, easier Mass Storage usage, etc. I will add a star to my rating if those things appear someday. Come on hackers, let's show Microsoft how to do it right.  I also recommend not buying the overpriced Zune branded extra cables and chargers. There are much cheaper generics for sale on the web that work just as well.

<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm having a difficult time finding words for my disappointment.  Let me start off by saying that the hardware is more than decent.  The Zune sounds great and feels solid, with that said; the software is worse than I ever could have imagined.  If you buy this, make sure your music is tagged to perfection and even then, the Zune's software misinterprets tags and randomly fills in blanks with information it pulls seemingly out of nowhere.  I truly cannot believe that the people behind the software interface still have jobs.

<Title>Great starting point.
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Honestly, this is the second MP3 player i've owned (still have my Zen 8gig microphoto) and I absolutly love it. I was all gung ho about the iPod. my cousin has one and i thought it was awsome, but I figured, id go with something different. I have absolutly no complaints at all. All I need a player to do is organize my music how I want it, and play it, and it does just that.   Sure the wi-fi feature is off, but like i said, its a starting point. Nothing else has that (that i know of), so no reason to cut it down. If I remember correctly, the ipod was sort of boring when it first came out as well. And to compare this first gen product, to a first gen ipod or zen, would be crazy. I love the navigation, the clarity of the pictures, and everything.   And something else peopel may not seem to be thinking about (I see a lot of you have multiple ipods), instead of having to buy a whole new upgraded player (version 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, etc) I think microsoft may just decided to let you download the upgrade.. just something to think about.

<Title>Good Product, Bad policy
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is an excellent player. It seemed to load songs and videos a little faster than the 5.5 gen 30g Ipod (I got this last Saturday, and the gapless play back feature seems really redundant), and the big screen is a HUGE advantage. The movies seem much more better, and really make the video on the Ipod look futile. As a multimedia player, it is really faultless.   However, the fact that it doesn't have text reading capabilites, the fact that it cannot be used as a hard drive; the fact that the "Welcome to the Social" has a fine print which makes it useless; the fact that it doesn't have a searching option is really irritating.  What's worse is that most of these are easy to be implemented. With enough Hack programs coming, it would be an excellent "SOCIAL" player.   Nonetheless the possibilities are a definite edge over other mp3 devices, and as an ordinary player, it is definitely an noteworthy investment.

<Title>An excellent alternative to the iPod
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Even though many will balk at a product from Microsoft this item has many nice features.  The PC interface is very much like Windows Media Player and using it you can organize your selections into playlists and categorize by artist, genre, album title, etc.  The integrated FM radio is very nice and some stations stream the artist and song title.  I find this extremely nice when I hear a song and want to know the artist and title.  I just received this as a gift yesterday so have not utilized the video and picture capabilites but if they are integrated with other Microsoft software they should be just as simple to use as music organization capabilites.  The lack of printed instructions will be a disappointment for some, but the online help that comes with the Zune PC software is very good.  My step-son was envious (he has an iPod) of the wireless capabilites that allow you to share with other Zune users who are in range.  I can see this as a very social device with younger users.  By entering the market later Microsoft has integrated some very nice features into this player and it is well worth a look.

<Title>I like it as much as I like the iPod
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned a 30 GB video iPod for several months before accidentally dropping it into the washing machine, killing it instantly. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to turn what was a tragedy into an excuse to check out the new Zune. My first impression is that the people who bash this thing are silly. To call this vastly inferior to the iPod screams Apple fanboy to me. I like them both.  One of the things I prefer about the Zune is the LACK of the clickwheel. That's right. I never was nuts about the iPod's clickwheel. It's a neat little gimmick at first, but I always had trouble selecting what I wanted to play, often accidentally clicking on the wrong thing. I find the Zune's standard up and down, left and right navigation much more practical and easier to use.  I *like* the heavier, tougher design of the Zune. Like some other reviewers have pointed out, the iPod was very pretty and elegant almost to the point of being a disadvantage. In order to keep it from turning into a scratched fingerprint-laden mess, you had to put it in an ugly case. While I'm not planning to use it as a hockey puck any time soon, the Zune feels much more durable and fit for outdoor use than the iPod.  Another thing I love about the Zune is that I find the menus more user friendly. I like being able to click left and right to fluctuate between artists, albums, songs, and whatnot while keeping the menu on what I'm listening to. Plus, the ability to change the background and add your own pictures is nice.  The sample videos I played looked very crisp and colorful on the larger screen.  Now, a few minor complaints:  The Zune seems to be lacking some features that I took for granted with the iPod: a clock, alarm, and calander. Oh well.  The Zune does not have a "sound check" feature for normalizing the volume of my songs.  It does not yet seem to have gapless playback capability. However, neither did my iPod until a recent update.  The Zune doesn't group compilation artists together like my iPod did. For example, I ripped both of the Nuggets box sets and a couple of soundtracks to my library, and instead of grouping the artists from those albums as Various Artists or whatever, it listed each individual artist on the artists menu of the Zune. So I was left with dozens of artists on my menu that I only had one or two songs by, making it a real chore to browse by artists on my Zune.  Okay, a bigger complaint: I'm not crazy about the software. No one seems to know why Microsoft didn't just make this thing compatible with Windows Media Player. With the software, the synching seems a little shakey at times. For example, getting album covers to transfer to my Zune sometimes requires a little coaxing. However, I should point out that I wasn't nuts about iTunes at first either, so it's likely that I'll grow to like Zune's software more with experience.  There have been quite a few complaints about the Zune Marketplace, but I'm not bothered by that because I've never purchased music online nor do I plan to. I rip exclusively from my own CDs and vinyl, and the Zune handles that just fine. Also, I haven't bothered trying out the wi-fi feature yet, as no one I know owns a Zune yet, and I doubt many strangers would like the crap I listen to anyway.  Now, that may sound like a lot of complaints, but I refer to them as minor for a reason: the room to grow via updates from Microsoft. This is a brand new product, folks. There are bound to be some flaws here and there. However, I'm expecting that a lot of these will be taken care of in the coming months, and the Zune will get better and better as the updates start to become available. In the mean time, I'm quite happy with what I have now. Right now, I'm willing to say that it's a hair below the quality of the iPod for the reasons I listed above, but like I've said, I'm not expecting these problems to stick around for long.

<Title>I love my brown Zune
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wasn't sure what to expect - but I love my device. My husand has an iPod and I've tried it a bit, so I've used both similarly and with no prior experience in either. BTW brown is the new black! Okay, just had to add that. :-) Wasn't sure I would like it but it's very unique and fun.  What's different: The Zune has an up/down/side interface vs. the circle. I personally prefer it because with the circle, I always ended up 5 songs past where I wanted to be. But others like the speed of the circle, so this is a personal thing.  What's cool: Great screen - at least 15+ people have commented on how nice it is. You can set backgrounds with any pictures, it's really easy and looks great. You have album art and you can send photos to another Zune very easily. You can share music with other Zune owners - I don't mind the 3-day/3-listen limit. It gives you a reasonable chance of enjoying the music and the option to go buy it (support your artists!) :-) The relocate feature lets you connect as a Guest to other machines easily. I found the battery life to be good tho haven't compared it to other devices. Sounds really sweet with high quality rips from my CDs.  All in all I'm glad I made the purchase and while there are a few things to figure out, I really like the device. I think its pretty easy to use, makes sharing photos and music really simple, and offers a significant feature set for a music player of its price.  PS: I don't hit the same issues with my software, but I empathize with other folks and hope these issues get fixed soon. The up side here is that these types of bugs can be resolved with software updates.

<Title>Zune: very disappointing!
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just like a lot of us I bought one of these, thinking that it would be better than the Ipod (bigger screen etc.). I use Microsoft Vista, and first of all the device is not recognized, so I try to download the drivers and no luck, it simply doesn't work under Vista. So I go to my wife's windows XP machine and I start fiddling with it, after few unsuccessful tries (hours!) I am finally able to listen to my own songs from Zune.  Zune's interface is clearly not as good as the Ipod, the Ipod does make sense and it's a no brainer, the creators of Zune probably focussed on getting the Zune as cheap as they could so they can hope to make a few sales so they didn't focus on the interface, and/or computer support. After hours wasted I understood that the Zune is completely unusable and I will not wait 6 months that Microsoft releases a patch for it to somewhat make it work. I am returning it to the store today to get an Ipod, it's a no brainer, the Ipod is the same price and WORKS.  If you are thinking about buying one of these, then don't. Get an Ipod.

<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was a bit skeptical at first, but I've been extremely pleased with my Zune.  Right out of the box I was able to install the Zune Marketplace software, download, sync, etc. within minutes.  What absolutely sold me was the way the menus are laid out on the device.  I no longer have to click "Music > Artist > Album > Song" to enjoy a quick tune, and I've used the radio much more than I thought I would (sometimes you just need a break from the songs you've heard time & time again).  Some features (such as being able to sync wirelessly) aren't present yet, but those should be coming out soon as updates.  This is a solid first start, and I'm looking forward to future updates and versions of the device. I highly recommend it!

The Zune is an excellent product, as is the Ipod in its own right. I own both and prefer the Zune for its interface , screen, sound quality and solid form. There are some quirks with the software which should be resolved but are not reason enough to not buy one. Oh yeah .. it also comes with an excellent FM tuner which can be found on almost any gadget you buy except an Ipod.

<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This 30 GB system is even bigger than Apple's 80 GB video iPod.  Hardly any accessories are built for the Zune, no airplanes are installing video adaptors and power adaptors for the Zune, but they are for the iPod.  Same with cars.  Wireless function is severely hampered.  You can get a song "squirted" to you only if the other person gives you permission.  Even then, you can only listen to the song three times or for three days, whichever comes first.  DRM is even more strict than Apple's Fairplay.  Why bother with the Zune?

<Title>5 star music experience, 3 star video
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Disclosure:  I've worked at Microsoft for about a year now, although I am in no way related to the Zune team, nor do I have any info a consumer doesn't have.  I've had mine since this Tuesday and am comfortable with my understanding of it at this point.  So, what are my thoughts?  First off, Zune is an _excellent_ music player.  The experience for music use is nearly perfect.  On this front it has one killer feature compared to the iTunes/iPod combo which is Zune Pass.  Zune Pass is a $15 a month subscription where you can download and put on your Zune nearly any song from the Zune Marketplace (in my experience I have been able to download every song I wanted except for Beatles songs, but those aren't available via iTunes either).  The second is the Zune-to-Zune sharing feature, which is really only appealing in high Zune-density areas (like the Microsoft campus) until Zune becomes more widespread.  There is also a 3 day or 3 plays limitation to shared music, but this doesn't affect anyone with Zune Pass since they can simply download the song when they get back to their computer (shared music is flagged for you when you sync so you can download it [zune pass] or buy it [no pass] if you decide you like it and want to keep it.  Audio quality is excellent and even the included ear bud headphones are a step above those included with other players.  The video experience has pluses and minuses.  The pluses are that the screen is large, clear and bright.  It makes watching video on the postage-stamp style screens on the video iPods seem ridiculous.  Seriously, was it that important to them to have it look exactly the same as the day it came out that they didn't bother reorienting the screen for maximum real estate?  Maybe they could but had battery problems I don't know.  Or maybe they thought the boring iPod shape was "iconic" and didn't want to change it.  Needless to say I'm sure a future version of the iPod will correct this problem, but as of now the experience of watching video goes to Zune hands down.    That brings us to the problem which is lack of content.  Zune cannot play protected mp4 files so you can't watch the video available from the iTunes store and Zune as of now has no videos in the marketplace.  Your only options are any unprotected mp4 or wmv video you might have or can find on YouTube, Soapbox or Google video.  While it is technically possible to rip your DVDs to Zune format, due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act it is currently illegal to do so if your DVD is encrypted (nearly all commercial DVDs are encrypted and while copying your DVD onto your portable device is legal, the Digital Millennium Copyright act made it illegal to break encryption on media without the permission of the copyright holders).  Enterprising users will discover that they can decrypt their DVDs using freely available (though illegal in the US) software and then encode them to Zune format using Windows Media Encoder (available from Microsoft), but there is no US based commercial software available to streamline and make the process easy.  The few companies under US jurisdiction that produced such software were sued out of existence by the movie studios.  On the plus side, if you have a Media Center computer, you can convert your recorded TV shows to play on Zune, but not many people have a Media Center at this point.  As such, the best option would be if the Zune Marketplace had a video catalog similar to the iTunes store, but as of release, there are no videos in the Marketplace.  I'm sure that this is simply a side effect of the fact that the Zune team didn't have the resources to sign up the TV studios and the music studios at the same time and will be remedied in the near future.    In fact, nearly everything about the Zune seems to be geared towards future improvement.  The upgradeable firmware of the device along with it's hardware capabilities pave the road for a number of as of yet unimplemented features which will no doubt be implemented not too far down the road such as wireless sync'ing, wireless purchasing and downloading of music directly on the device, games, videos in the Zune marketplace and more Zune-to-Zune features along the lines of song sharing.    If I had to summarize my feelings about Zune in a few sentences, I would say that what Zune does it does very well.  That seems to be the design choice made.  Rather than throwing in every feature under the sun with lackluster execution, the designers clearly decided to do what they could do well and with polish and leave those other features for future updates. As of launch that means that you have an excellent music player and a store to go along with it, and also an excellent video player, but no videos to watch on it.     If you can live without a video / TV store for your player, or feel comfortable transferring recorded media from your Media Center PC or have another video source, I can highly recommend this player for you.

<Title>Subscription sealed the deal.
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I heard the the Zune Marketplace was going to support a monthly all-you-can-download subscription plan (which iTunes doesn't support) I knew I had to get this player. I refuse to pay to "own" any track with DRM on it, but a subscription plan takes away that anxiety because it's understood that I don't actually own any of the music anyway and that I can consume vast amounts of it for a relatively low cost. Kind of like XM or Sirius satellite radio.  That said, onto the player:  External aesthetics: I have the black Zune, but like the look of all three. It actually doesn't seem bulk in person at all, and I love the matte finish on it. As others have said it's scratch resistant and has a silky and durable feel. Also, it's worth mentioning the the black color takes on a blue hue in certain light. Very cool.  Zune software (on the Zune itself): Navigation is easy and intuitive. No complaints here. The size of the screen is a big plus and everything looks good. Only nitpick is the album art could be higher quality, however, doing so would use up more space. It doesn't look bad, but it could look a lot better. There should be a way to choose high or low res artwork depending on how much space you can afford to use.  My other complaint is that the artists category of the music library gets over cluttered in the since that if there is a contributing artist then they end up in the list. This is EXTREMELY annoying, and the only reason I don't knock a star off the review is because 1) this is subjective, someone else might appreciate that, and 2) the unfair 1 star reviews by people who haven't used a Zune need to be balanced out. I only want the artists that I explicitly chose to download an album or track from in the list. I don't care about some random contributing artist. I am definitely going to attempt to figure out how to stop this from occuring without having to manually edit each track in my library.  Zune marketplace: I've found the Zune Marketplace easy to use and find and download music from. No complaints here. I've never used iTunes, so I can't compare them, but I've been able to find just about every artist I've wanted (including some surprisingly obscure ones) and since I can download an unlimited amount of music due to the subscription thing, I'm as happy as a bear in a beehive.   Misc: One small detail that I am extremely happy with is how powerful the audio output of the Zune headphone jack is. It goes up to 20, but I usually listen to it at 4 or 5 with headphones. However, when I connect it to the auxiliary jack in my car, I end up cranking the volume up to 18. This detail is essential because the extra volume really allows the zune to sound GREAT in my car via the aux input. I don't have to over amplify and end up distorting or increasing noise in the music. My previous mp3 player sounds horrible over the aux jack. The Zune sounds as good as if it was built in!  So in summary I love my Zune and the unlimited music feature. The artist list thing really needs to be fixed, but in the scheme of things it's something that I can live with and it's not a deal breaker. The other details that I like make up for it.  So if you haven't made the mistake of getting locked into the iTunes format by "buying" DRMed tracks and want to try out a great subscription based music player (think of it as radio on demand), then I highly recommend the Zune.

<Title>Not as good as I hoped
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a serious gadget junkie. I have more mp3 players than I care to admit - iPod, iRiver, even a Rio. You name a player, I probably have it. I was very interested in Zune, and the fact that I now have one here in Switzerland where it officially can't be bought yet shows to what length I was prepared to go to get it.  First the good:  + Zune's sound quality is good (I did not use the earphones that come with it, though), + Browsing your music is simple. The transitions between menus is slick, and the user interface is quite intuitive.  + It feels solid, and does not pick up scratches or fingerprints as easy as it's direct competitor, the iPod.  + Purchasing songs is simple, and can be done worldwide. + Large color display is bright, colors are vivid. Good playback of videos. So-so display of images. + Plays my unencrypted (DRM'd) WMA, MP3, AAC files  The bad:  - Zune's software (the part you install on your PC) was a mess to install, and did not install on the Vista beta (This will hopefully change with the final release of Vista).  - It looks nice, but the marketplace experience does not hold a candle against iTunes Music Store (neither does the selection). Also, you purchase using 'MS points' that can only be purchased in chunks of 5 USD or more, and it's not easy to convert the points to my local currency. There currently is no video selection, nor can you easily subscribe to podcasts - Zune can't load my previously purchased (DRM'd) WMA files (Plays-for-Sure). Zune, from MS does not conform to 'Plays for sure' by MS. This means you must re-purchase all your songs. - Zune songs can't be played by other players. In this regard Zune is as bad (a closed system) as the iPod. Wasn't Bill Gates on the record saying that 'People want choice'? Well, not if you own Zune - at least for now. - Does not play video formats other than WMV (i.e. no m4v, mov) - You can't use Zune as an external hard drive. I couldn't believe it myself either. Why??? - I must physically connect Zune to my PC to load songs  - Zune currently can't sync wirelessly. - You can't use Windows media player to manager your Zune's content - For some reason I am unable to listen to Zune while it's charging. This may be a fault of mine, though. - The scroll wheel is not a scroll wheel. It integrates well with Zune's interface, but is not as efficient as the iPod's wheel it obviously resembles - The color display's resolution is the same as the iPod's, just bigger. Side-to-side comparison between a video played on the iPod and Zune shows a distinct advantage for the iPod, because the image (even though smaller) looks much sharper. It would have been better if Zune had a higher resolution.  I was unable to try the song sharing feature (for obvious reasons - no-one else has it here).  All in all I am seriously disappointed by Zune. The player itself is nice - the whole package (player, software, experience), however, is riddled with half-baked features, or intentional restrictions that make no sense. Comparing it directly to the other closed-system competitor, the iPod, shows that Zune has a long way to go just to catch up. It fares OK when compared with other mp3-players - until you realize that you'll have to re-purchase your music. If you are prepared to take that step you might as well go with the iPod, which is clearly the better package.

<Title>Zune - not an iPod Killer, but nice MP3 player in it's own right
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The size isn't bad, it's surprisingly small given the size of the screen. If you want to watch movies and videos on a larger screen, a larger device is the price you pay at the moment. The WiFi needs to be de-crippled, it's way to restrictive, but hopefully that is something Microsoft can address in a firmware update. Actually there are a couple other things Microsoft could address with a firmware release, releax the DRM 3 play/3day restriction, turn it into a storage device, add some simple games/utilties etc, and increase what you can do with WiFi. Judging from how they've handled customer feedback on the Xbox and Xbox Live, I expect we'll see those types of changes sooner rather than later. The screen is big, crisp, and bright a nice change from the tiny iPod screen. The star of the device, believe it or not, is the UI. It's quick, intuitive, and attractive. While the iPod is simpler, unless you're a technophobe, you'll pick up the Zune's UI in a matter of moments. The black color is kind of cool, it's semi translucent and has a nice grippy texture to it and unlike the iPod doesn't show fingerprints, and worse get scratched to heck even if you look at it funny. Overall a solid first effort, but not enought to unseat the iPod. Firmware changes would be a good start toward that goal.  I'll be getting an Xbox 360 for the kids this Christmas, so it'll be interesting to see how that all integrates. Not sure about brown though, that's a strange choice in my book, but maybe that's the appeal of it; I'm old enough to remebmer the 70s when brown was the in color. Maybe a Harvest Gold Zune is not far behind.

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an excellent player. Besides a robust marketplace software, that let you easily browse your own selection, I think he subscription concept is a fantastic. You just go there download whatever you like and listen, that simple. Besides, if there is something you really like, then just flag it and then you can come back to the marketplace and downright buy it.  The player is a little bit on the big side for my taste, but the functionality is so rich that it is worth it evey ounce!  On the downside: the earphones are not that good. I plugged it a seinheiser set I own and the sound rocks!

<Title>Attractive Product that Back-Stabs the Consumer in 2 Ways
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Zune is clearly an attractive package in terms of interface and sound quality but Microsoft has, with this product, betrayed the consumer in two ways: First, Microsoft didn't fulfill its promise to allow customers to trade all their iPod songs, for free, for their Zune. Clearly, when the reality of this "trade" hit Microsoft, they back-tracked. Second, a percentage of all sales goes to Universal based on the presumption that Zune owners are going to steal music. This is a horrible precedent, to charge customers based on the theory that they use MP3 players to steal. Now will other companies have a hidden "steal" charge? Such a flagrant disrespect and betrayal of the customer should repel everyone from the Zune. If the Zune fails, the public wins.

<Title>Try it for yourself
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Zune seems to be a pretty nice music player.  I had no issues with software installation or syncing any of my music,pictures, or videos.  I've had no problems with deleting anything I decided that I didn't need.  I did have a problem after installing my 14 day trial code (but I needed to just sign out and sign back in for the code to take) . I've read mixed reviews, but I don't get it - I think many of the extra features  will grow with future updates and make this the only mp3 player you will need.  I'm not a fanboy of any particular maker, I just like what I like, and this something that helps make my entertainment that much easier. I like Zune  (don't get caught up in all the lame fanboys hatred), try it for yourself, you might too.

<Title>Hardware is Great, Software Needs Improvement
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got my black Zune 30gb. I love the interface and the way it looks, because I've gotten so sick of the iPod look. I don't think its bulky, only a little thicker than and iPod. The thickness has no complaints. I love the menus and the photo quality is beautiful, better than an iPod Classic, Video, and Nano. The Zune player is absolutely wonderful! I was so excited to recieve it. The software is really annoying. It has a lot of problems. It took about 2 hours just to get 200 songs on the player. I kept getting an error code and I researched it. Now, I can sync all of my songs...but I have to sync them in small bunches. Sync 30%, disconnect, connect, sync next %30...and so on. It is a drag, but hey, its worth it. The sound quality is good. Hopefully the software will improve.  Zune player 9.5/10 stars  Software 5/10 stars

<Title>Great MP3 player for the money
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I did not own a mp3 player or was in the market for one. However, it was selling for $100 before Christmas so I decided to get one. First, I thought that Brown color will not look good, but since only brown one was on sale, I did not mind. When it arrived and I took it out of the box, I was pleasantly surprised how good my Zune looks. I'm glad that black Zune was not on sale and I went with this one. Everybody knows what it does, so I will only review things that are annoying to me: 1. Files cannot be deleted from the player without a PC. 2. When you mark what songs you like and what songs you don't, there are only to choices. You like it or you don't. I would like to see one more option, so a. I could mark all mp3 that I do not like and I want to delete them, b. mark mp3s that are ok and can be listened to once in a while and c. my favorites that I want to listen all the time.  Besides those two things, I think the player is great.

<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had my zune 30GB black from amazon for over a month now, and to tell you the truth its been an awesome experience using the zune until now.  The screen is crisp and clear and I love the full screen album art when playing my favorite mp3's.  Syncing my music to the zune was a no brainer once i installed the zune software.  Watching movies on it is also really good and comes in handy if your on a plane or in a spot waiting for someone or something.  I would totally recommend the zune to anyone looking for a mp3 / movie player.  I was skeptical at first, but my doubts are all gone now after I've used this awesome device for a month.

<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I recieved the 30 gig brown zune for xmas, I was a little suprised and annoyed that the included software wasn't vista compatable. But after using the update on thier site I had my zune running with little trouble.  Two things make the zune stand out from ipod very well, the larger screen and it's FM radio. I use to have a Iriver and I loved being able to use it as a radio and even though the zune's reception isn't so great (which i can't blame on the device alone my clock radio has trouble too so it probibly has alot to do with then concrete walls.)I was pretty happy with having an option to being able to listen to whats onthe air when i get sick of my music.  The larger screen is great for videos especally for WMV which i had converted my copy of the BBC series Life On Mars and got an average of one hour long episodes onto my zune for only a 1/4th of a gig (250mb)  But still i think it comes down to the hardware being great but it's still limited by it's software. hopefully they'll fix it better but til then i'm content with using my drm free mp3s from amazon and the digital copies of series i made at home onto wmv.

<Title>Zune is good, but How cheap can Microsoft be...
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune works fine, but my question is why does it not come with a charger besides having to plug it in to your computer? Seriously, at least cell phones provide you with some kind of charger whether a home or car charger.  The Zune is not exactly inexpensive so would it hurt Microsoft to provide you with some kind of charger? Preferably a car charger because you can plug it into your computer at home and charge it there for home charging, but that of course means you have to have your computer on. Then, the accessories available for Zune are either dirt bottom cheap junk made in China (i.e. my car charger that Amazon recommended I buy along with the Zune that broke within literally 5 days. The wires came right out of the plug that goes into the Zune in less than a week, NICE. Or you have the choice to buy a Zune car charger for a minimum 40.00 dollars or more. The top of the line cell phone chargers only cost around 30.00 dollars. Microsoft needs to get with it and treat their customers right.  The company is obviously cheap and stingy and doesn't know anything about doing right by their customers.

<Title>Poor design, poor DRM sytem, and limited features
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow.  Aside from the clunky and rather cheap design of the player, I was surprised to learn how poorly thought out the music rights were.  It won't even play songs from Microsoft's own older DRM system and instead has adopted this convoluted system based on "points" instead of dollars.  Which makes you feel like you're playing some game, rather than choosing how to spend your hard earned cash.  Also, while it plays video, there is currently no way to buy any for the player.  And the limited wi-fi "sharing" feature gets old fast and is only usable if you happen to be a few feet away from another Zune player.  It's all very strange and poorly thought out.

<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After 2 days, countless trips to various stores & endless HOURS of tech support I have come to the decision that Zune simply sucks.   First issue I had with the Zune - No power! I bought the player, but could not locate a charger in the store (they were out, being as they only had 4 shipped to them in the first place, but 20 players????). Microsoft doesn't tell you that unless you have a USB port that ALSO has power charging capabilities you're going to need the AC adapting charger... I drove to 5 different stores, no one had the AC Adapter! Meanwhile I see a couple dozen different style chargers, cases, and all the accessories you could imagine & want for an iPod at every single store. Accessories for a Zune = ZERO!  The 'manual' that is included with the player simply has 3 instructions: "Load software, When prompted plug in cable and hook up media player, Enjoy..." Ok... so what happens when it doesn't work? No advice from their manual. I looked up the website, went through all of their troubleshooters... nothing. I called & spoke with tech support, who were very nice & spent 2 whole hours on the phone... uninstall, reinstall...back & forth, right click on this, right click on that, check your device manager. I had the exact same problems as other reviewers on Amazon when it came to syncing the Zune to the application. It never happened.  I saved for a while to buy myself a media player and am very disappointed with the fact that I just bought a $250 brick... I really wanted the Zune. But my time & my money are more valuable. Call me crazy, but when I drop $250 I expect something to work... the first time.  Save yourself the hassle & headache (and gas & phone charges...) Maybe in 2 years when Microsoft nails this whole 'media player craze' down, they will actually produce a quality product and have all the accessories you will ACTUALLY NEED readily available.

The Zune is now much better than the iPod, not only in capabilities but in quality both hardware and software wize.

<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Why does Microsoft feel it necessary to copy everyone? This is nothing more than an iPod ripoff, and an inferior, heavier one at that. If they find it so necessary to copy Apple and their competitors, at least create a device that is backwards compatible with your own music format ("PlayForSure").  Microsoft felt left out by the iPod's success. Unfortunately for them, their PC monopoly isn't going to help them create a successful MP3 player. The Zune is destined to be a failure. Oh, yes. It will fail.

<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned an ipod (video 5g) before, and decided to get a Zune to replace it after i decided to give it to my sister.  Compared to the ipod, it has different advantages and shortcomings that overall make it an excellent competitor to the ipod. design-wise, they couldve slimmed it down a little.  the doubleshot effect gives it a glow effect and the metal trim around the screen and 4 way switch is really nice. it strains my hand a little but after getting used to it felt very solid and sturdy.  its great for holding sideways for video viewing, as it has a small concave spot on the back for easier gripping (great little addition on microsofts part).   on UI, Zune beats the ipod hands down.  its full color and easy to use menu really cut down on effort and time to find the song i wanted.  i was amazed at how easy it was to use! the screen is big, bold an beautiful and it really is the zune's forte (other than the menu and personalization). the 4way toggle switch feels a little cheap and creaks a little when i press it.  the play and back buttons could ve been a little large, my thumb has to search sometimes to press it correctly.   the accessories that came with it actually exceeded my expectations. the heapdphones are in my opinion better quality than the ipod's. they look much more expensive with a metal strip on each bud that actually is slightly magnetic and attaches to the other bud.  even the cable is nicer.  the case is kind of cheap, but serves its purpose.   the radio feature is great and after using it, it was a very nice addition to the player. now, what matters the most is the sound quality.  the sound IS a little more better than the ipod. i tested it with my old video and you can hear a more clearer and crisper sound from the zune than the ipod.  (tested it using speakers)  the ipod is still king, but the zune is probably its strongest enemy and it has great potential to dethrone it. overall, i love my new zune.

<Title>Questionable
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, were to start. The zune is great, to an extent. I bought one when it came out. It looked cool, and I did my research on it. When, I got to my computer, I inserted the CD. Well the software told me I needed SP2. So if you have windows XP and not SP2 you will HAVE to download it off of microsofts website. If I dont get SP2 soon, I will get an IPOD. Another thing, these media players in general need a High Speed Internet, I have AOL    dial-up, so it is going to take a long time for this to all happen. The 14 day trial, sucks, it is only good for 14 days once you use it, and any songs you download from this last 14 days and then stop playing, however I got the bright idea to load the song on to the 360 or burn a cd with it on, hopefull this works and after 14 days it will work and then i just retransfer the song from the cd to the zune. There is no thick direction booklet, all there is is insert cd, download, plug in zune, have fun. That is it. I reccomend this only if you have SP2, high speed internet, a lot of time, a good computer, and if you are planning on buying the apple laptop in the summer that comes with a free ipod. If you dont have any of these do not get it, the ipod is much better and much less hassle, i got one because i will be getting the laptop in the summer, and i want to say i owned one of these things in the beginning.

Actually had a box in my hand, ready to purchase, then read the system requirements (the Zune box was the only place I found these). Windows only! Alas I am a Mac user, and it absolutely does not work with a Mac. Nice planning, Microsoft! Just thought you'd like to know, since that fact is not prominently featured in most reviews and there are millions of Mac users who might have otherwise purchased the Zune. Guess I'll get an iPod after all. It is possible that I am a completely blind lunatic and missed this somewhere. If that's the case, I'm sure someone will point this out to me promptly. But before trudging off to purchase it, I read many reviews and checked the product description and technical details here on Amazon. I didn't see any system requirements listed. Pretty important detail to leave out, don't you think?

<Title>Same reason I won't buy an I pod.
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to say, I really wanted to like the Zune.  The interface is great, the unit is only marginally different from the IPOD in size, the screen is not the best quality available but very nice, and (while it is not as sleek as the ipod) it still has it own style.  I do worry a bit about the coating on the case... seems like something that could wear-out or stain quickly with constant use.  However, my biggest kvetch is the closed architecture.  Fix this and I'm sold.  I'm not a typical end-user but, I , along with millions of others, I'm sure, would love to drag-and-drop stuff into place from my pc and have no other worries. Hopefully one of the update addresses this "down-the-road".  Microsoft has done all they can to stay within the letter of the law with all their music endeavors and they should be commended for that. However, for my money I'd just assume go with something like a Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB Portable Media Player and have a Windows interface that doesn't box me in as much.  It's not perfect either but, for my purposes, it's much more well suited to my needs.  I hope, in the not-too-distant future, I'm proven to be short-sighted and Microsoft updates this product to exceed my expectations and everyone elses as well.

<Title>Greatest MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this MP3 player. I would only change the color I got but Brown works. I am finding new things daily about the player. I've downloaded movies to it and it has great video quality. Recommend for those quick road trips or airline trips.  The kids will love it too. I love having the FM Radio on there.

<Title>Works for me
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like this better than my better half's iPod. The BIG screen is nice, and 30 gigs at a great price. Zune marketplace now supports podcasts. I've had no problems with the marketplace other than it being down the same time as Xbox Live was having troubles during the Christmas season.  My son and I bought the software to rip our DVD's to the Zunes. Works great.

<Title>Zune - it's whats for breakfast
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>so I went through most of the reviews that everyone posted and went ahead and bought the red 30bg zune. I have to say I love this thing! The 1st gen software sucks but that gets updated as soon as you setup and synch the device. I'm not crazy about the video setup for this because it takes quite a while for moviemaker to create something that the zune will accept but overall it did a decent job.   I dont' see why everyone is complaining about these. It's durable, easy to use, ok battery life and holds a lot of stuff.   is it an IPod killer? not necessarily but I will say that for the price, I'll take one of these ANYDAY before I go the way of the Ifool... too expensive and way to easy to break...   For once, good job microsoft... even tho you are the evil empire!

<Title>For those who want a great alternative to the iPod
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The last reviewer really doesn't even know what he's talking about, especially because he's reviewing a product that hasn't even been released yet.  The fact is, Microsoft isn't going to kill the iPod with its 1st generation Zune, but they will definitely take out a big chunk of Apple's market share in the music player industry.  And as they update the device with future generations, it will only get better.  This is going to be a fantastic device with many more features than the current iPods.  Microsoft has created some extremely intuitive software for this device, making navigation a breeze.  Being able to share music, movies, and pictures with friends will be great.  The 3" screen is much bigger than the tiny screen on the iPod, so this is much better suited to watching movies.  And the fact that you can import your music straight from iTunes will make changing over to the Zune that much easier!  In my opinion, this is a great alternative to the iPod.

<Title>Zune has enough unique features to bite into Apple's pie
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Packing a 3" screen, an FM-tuner, and Wireless features into a unit almost exactly the size of a video iPod, Zune is a compelling alternative to Apple's iconic iPod.   While it's hard to match the elegance and innovation of iPod, Microsoft has broken new ground with its "community" features of Zune - which allow wireless sharing of songs from one Zune to any nearby Zune. The shared songs are limited to 3-plays-in-3-days.   With its aggressive pricing, and feature-packed opening model, Microsoft may just turn the portable media player world into a two-horse race.

<Title>Good jumping off point for Microsoft
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's impossible to not compare the Zune to the iPod so I'm not even going to try, but let's get one thing out of the way right quick: Anyone who calls the Zune an iPod killer needs to have their head examined.  Let's not forget that there are many people who have invested hundreds or thousands of dollars into iTunes music, so they're pretty much iPod customers for life(as Zune customers will be if they choose to use the Zune marketplace, but more on that later). And in case you haven't noticed, the iPod is a pretty darn good device.  The Zune doesn't really offer anything that should have iPod+iTunes users jumping ship, but it does offer a compelling option for those looking to purchase a product like this for the first time or iPod users who have chosen to continue to buy CDs instead of digital albums.  The first thing you'll notice after purchasing the Zune is that if they ever gave away some type of award for product packaging, the Zune would probably win it.  The brown portion of the Zune box slips off to reveal a compartmentalized box inside that includes the Zune, the docking cable, stock earbuds, the Zune software, the token cheap felt case, and the documentation.    Onto the Zune itself.  Even at 30 gigs it's a bit longer and thicker than the 80 gig iPod. It is substantially heavier but not to a fault.  Those looking to use an MP3 player for active use will probably want a flash player anyway.  Where the Zune holds a big advantage over the iPod however is the rubbery-plastic finish.  Whereas the iPod's glossy finish is a magnet for fingerprints, the Zune's rubbery plastic feel attracts virtually no fingerprints, and when it does they simply wipe off.  The screen accumulates them quickly, and while a thin plastic film coating is included, it has some large text on it, so you might have to invest in a third-party screen protector.  Bummer.   The control pad has been often maligned for not being a scroll wheel, but I don't understand why.  Is moving your thumb around in circles really THAT intuitive?   Onto the software. It's a bit dissapointing that the Zune doesn't simply intergrate seamlessly with Windows Media Player 11 like most MP3 players now do.  Instead you'll have to install the dedicated Zune software, which is essentially Windows Media Player 11 in some new clothing and with the Zune Marketplace built in.  There have been many reports of hiccups installing the new software, so beware.  It seems I was lucky. Once you do get the software going, syncing your music library to your player is a breeze, with a transfer speed of about two seconds per song.    As I said, the Zune software is essentially WMP11 with the Zune Marketplace included.  The first time you enter the marketplace the software will ask you for your Windows Live ID.  This is where one very cool perk comes into play if you are an XBox Live user.  When you login with your ID, your Zune Marketplace account automatically links up with your XBox Live account, so you can share your Microsoft Points you already have across both services!  Very very convienent.    Unfortunately, that may be the highlight of the Zune Marketplace.  Graphically, it can't hold a candle to iTunes and is pretty darn ugly.  Users can't review albums, and it as of yet doesn't offer anything besides music(this is probably going to change very very soon).  I don't even use an iPod and I like browsing the iTunes store to see what's new and read user reviews.  I couldn't imagine using the Zune Marketplace for anything except buying an album.  But even that wouldn't be advisable, since the music you purchase on the Zune marketplace will work ONLY on the Microsoft Zune and nothing else.  So until it starts offering TV Shows and movies, the Zune Marketplace is a major dud.     This is where the real treat comes in, once you get your music onto the Zune and fire it up for the first time, many of your initial doubts will vanish.  The screen is large, bright, and the background is fully customizable.  The interface is a huge breath of fresh air after using the stale Artist>Album>Song system on iPods and Creative players for so many years.  Instead, Artist, Album, and Song are listed horizontally at the top of the screen, and as you move the cursor over each option all of the items spill out down the substantial screen, with thumbnail album art included!  When you do choose a song, the album art for that song dominates the screen, and the sound quality is excellent.  You can easily adjust the volume by pressing up-and-down on the control pad, and scroll through the song by pushing left and right.     So music playback is a huge "hit", but how about the video?  The format support is pretty limited, and while the Zune software will convert just about anything, the playback format of converted videos is pretty poor.  It was also a puzzling move for the Zune to have a 16x9 screen but only support 4:3 resolution.  The stretching of the picture doesn't really take that much away, but it seems a bit pointless.  One handy feature is that the control pad will re-orient the controls for the Zune when you hold the player sideways.    One last thing, you might have noticed I haven't even mentioned the much-hyped wi-fi feature.  Why?  Because it's practically useless.  Songs received via wi-fi transfer can only be played three times within a three day period, and songs by some artists(such as the Rolling Stones) won't even transfer at all!  The wi-fi capabilities of the Zune certainly offers exciting possibilities for future firmware updates, but they're certainly not present now.    So that's it.  The Zune offers nothing that will have seasoned iPod+iTunes users jumping ship,  and it certainly' won't kill the iPod, but the exceptional physical design, vastly superior user interface, and wi-fi possiblities in the future warrant a serious look by shoppers.

I bought two zunes, one for my wife, and I have to say that the wireless sharing works great and as avertised.  It is also more resistant to scratches.

<Content>I don't work for Microsoft, nor have any intentions to but please let us be fair, after examing and the Zune. Hands down, it is the best MP3 player since the IPOD invasion. With all fairness, the IPOD had its place in History but currently there has being other better Mp3 players since. ZUNE is currently the Editor's choice. Once again pls don't fight Microsft, try the ZUNE on your own. None of us will be happy if we were punished by word of mouth for the sins of our forefathers. Why penalise the ZUNE, it stands on its own. Try the Zune and forget about thoughtless words which stirs up confusion.  THANKS: kObE

<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't know what everyone is talking about. This product is great. Everything about is convenient. Its ridicuously easy to use, simple but yet very good. Half of the people on here that are "dogging" this product haven't even bought one. I was going to get an ipod but then i heard about this and decided to check it out. I talked to didfferent people who had or used an ipod before and did a comparison on the the specs of both products online. It also has more features like the tuner and wi-fi. i love it. The only way i could see someone complaining is that OP system has to be Windows XP Professional. But if you don't have that by now, well what can i say. The main reason i bought this though was because all my downloaded songs are from limewire in a windows media format and i heard(an employee from best buy and other ipod users) that the ipod has problems with windows media format. I also saw that someone said when using the Zune, when listening to music and trying to look at pictures at the same time that the music stops playing. Not true. I am doing it now. I would recommend this product to anyone. But it really all depends what operating system you have or if use itunes or limewire because the ipod's and the zunes have different copyrights so you can't buy itunes for the zune in the zune marketplace. I don't have itunes but i did read that if you already have music downloaded from itunes that the zune will automatically change the format when you upload to the zune. but this product is great. i love it.

<Title>looking good so far with a couple things to fix
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just want to say one thing first: i dont, nor did i ever own an ipod.  this isn't because of any "anti-apple" feelings, in fact, their ipod led the way in the innovation of the mp3 player by having possibly the greatest one available.  I just never felt like spending the money until now.  I chose to buy the zune, and i like it a lot.  Not wanting to get anyone too upset, but if u didn't do your homework and do some research (say, just look up zune on google and read some stuff like the product specs) then u shouldn't complain saying things like "i didn't like how it can't be used as an external hard drive?" or "why don't the songs from itunes work?" cuz i, not the most computer saavy person, in just a few mintues of googling found sites where many people could have found these things out before buying.  (They could have complained first and then choose not to buy it!  however this seems not to have happened as people buy it, complain, return it, and then buy an ipod.  Whats up with that?!)  For the record, I DONT WORSHIP APPLE, NOR DO I WORSHIP MICROSOFT!!!  I believe in competition, though, and found that this was the best mp3 player for what i wanted to do.  in other words, buy it only if u feel like u should and not because of who made it.  To end this review, i'll leave u with the overused and seemingly powerful statement:  The choice is yours! (and yours alone!!!)

<Content>What's the big deal? I looked at it in the store, took it for a test drive. No big deal.   So you can wifi a song to a friend. Big deal, whoopee. They can only listen to the darn song 3 lousy times for 3 days. Gee, don't let me get too excited.  The 1-star is for the 3" display screen, which is nice. And the 30GB is OK.   But we don't get anything new here and are still tied down in many ways to music subscriptions. It's baloney. AND the price is no deal.   Do yourself a favor and buy the Creative Zen Vision:W or Creative Zen Vision:M. I've used both, and an iPod. Creative Zen or iRiver offer the most flexibility and the most features without strapping into a million rules.  What all these MP3 & photo players could use is better calendaring, more like Palm calendaring AND wifi for anything.

<Title>Zune is doomed upon arrival. Don't get stuck with this mess!
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This supposed 'Ipod Killer' will be lucky to even steal market share from the smallest of competitor's in the now over-populated mp3 player market. The problem with this player is that it comes prepackaged with all the arrogance and restrictiveness one has come to expect from Microsoft. Whilst the Ipod has been able to beautifully merge itself from being simply a music player, to a platform within itself, this product seems destined to head in the direction of the 'PlaysForSure' debacle. The problem with Microsoft, as was demonstrated recently by them shutting down their MSN music site, is that they show no commitment to their customers. As soon as sales of the Zune inevitably prove to be too low to justify them even being produced, Microsoft will pull the plug, leaving consumers with a device which will be as useless as a torn plastic bag.  Microsoft certainly have millions to burn, and their campaigns have been quick to point out the social networking feature of the zune. However, the fine print which accompanies this feature far outweighs any usefulness it might have had to average user. Unless Microsoft magically sells 60 million units of this thing within the next couple of years, the wireless connectivity feature will be a useless gimmick which will leave consumers feeling quite duped.  The whole UMG deal also shows just how arrogant Microsoft can be. You see, the precedent set by this deal will have serious consequences on music listeners for many years to come. When the Zune exits the market, Microsoft can take pleasure in knowing that they single-handedly destroyed an entire industry.  Apple may have a near monopoly on the market at the moment, but they have proven themselves to be quite attentive and loyal to their customers. They have constantly improved their devices and services, and have stood their ground in refusing to raise their Itunes prices.  You have to ask yourself, Do you really want a player which will practically hold you captive to gods of DRM?

<Title>Decent Player, Horrid Store
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player is nice, if a little large.  The store is terrible.  You have to buy a package of points.  If you don't spend all your points Microsoft still gets the money and keeps it until you do.  Say you want two songs.  You have to buy $5 worth of points from Microsoft.  Each song costs $0.99, so Microsoft keeps your $3.02 in it's back account until you spend it.  Now say you buy 5 songs at once.  At .99 a song that comes to $4.95.  Microsoft keeps your nickel.  So in reality the price of the songs are more than iTunes, but they don't tell you that.  If you buy just one song, it's $5.  If you buy 2, it's $2.50 a song.  If you buy 5, it's a dollar each.  Microsoft does not tell you about the hidden pricing.  It's this kind of if not downright deceptive then misleading practice that makes me shy away from the player.

<Title>Just as good as the iPOD, if not better!
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I own the third gen ipod that was 15gb and was just an LCD without color. It has the wheel and 4 buttons on top. No click wheel. I then upgraded to the Ipod Video and immediately disliked it and thought it was a step back in terms of usability. Sure, you have less buttons, but that doesn't make it better.  So, I disliked my Ipod video somewhat so I wanted something better. I bought this and connected it and installed the software. It does not ask you where you want to install it. Not only that but it automatically thinks I want to  upload all my video captures to my Zune and does so without asking me once. Of course I cancel that and change the options. It only took a few seconds. I had no problems with installing the software. Microsoft must think everyone is an idiot and just does everything automatic without asking.   The transfer of my mp3 files to the Zune went ok and I never yet had the system crash.   I checked my artist listings after the transfer and several were all named differently, but it's super easy to fix. You can rename multiple track names and artists at the same time.  Strangely, it doesn't download every single piece of CD art it finds. I click on a foreign language album and see art there, but it doesn't update. Only on certain albumbs. 95% of my american CDs had album art automatically downloaded. I just need to figure out if there is a way to NOT display the colored default album art for titles that have no artwork. Probably not.  The unit sounds good, but they need more EQ settings. The ipod has more options for this. Bass Boost or Bass Reducer like on the Ipod would have been nice. I also wish the volume could go a little higher. 20/20 is not enough for some songs/headphones.  I like the button on this. Not having a wheel is no big deal. I never liked the wheel anyway. It takes absolutely no effort to press the button on this unlike on some other units (Philips and those tiny silver buttons). To scroll up, you can hold it down instead of pressing the button over and over again.  I love the design. It's pretty much perfect. It's not a big deal, but I find it more comfortable to hold than my Ipod Video. I will admit though that the interface takes a few more steps to play music than the Ipod.  So far I honestly haven't found many negatives about the unit. I've just had ZERO problems with it and no I don't work for Microsoft! Once I find out a problem with it, i'll update this review. I do think the biggest annoyance is that the volume could be a little louder if needed.  No, it's not an Ipod killer, but it's just as good as the Ipod, if not better. I do think it's better in most ways. It's not as simple and easy to navigate in as the Ipod though, but pretty close.  Battery life was ok. I don't know if my unit was fully charged when I first used it, but it lasted about 6 hours, but I had the volume cranked and wasn't going for power saving.   If you have an Ipod video already and love it, then there is no reason to get this unless you just want something new. I didn't like the Ipod Video, so this is a good replacement.

<Title>Zune Marketplace Store is Really Weird
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am considering getting an MP3 player for someone, but I have something that is making it very difficult to seriously consider the Zune.  If someone could explain what is going on with the Zune Marketplace, I would appreciate it.  Whatever the merits of the player itself, the only place that you can buy anything online is at the Zune Marketplace store and its song pricing policy appears very deceptive.  Zune has its own currency where $.99 in US dollars equals $.79 in Zune dollars.  You must also deposit money in $5 (US Dollar) increments.  If you buy five songs, it costs you $3.95 in Zune dollars, $4.95 in US dollars.  But Microsoft still has $.05 (in US Dollars) of your original $5 deposit left over.  This left over gap actually keeps getting larger for quite sometime.  If you give them $95 and buy 95 songs, you will still have $.95 (US Dollars) left in your account.  If they want to charge $1 (US) for each song, why not just do it.  Of course, if you don't buy five songs for each $5 you put in, the effective price for each song is well over $1.   Adding on the conversion of all this money into Zune dollars is possibly Microsoft's cute idea that no one will figure all this out.  Do people really want to multiply their Zune expenditures by $.99/$.79 to do the conversions or remember the exact number of songs that they have bought so that they can directly multiple the number of songs by $.99?  I would really appreciate someone telling me why any of this is reasonable.  Do I want to give someone a headache dealing with this whole set up?  At least so far, it comes across as Microsoft trying to take advantage of people.  If someone can justify this complicated pricing structure that actually makes virtually everyone pay more than the officially advertised price for songs, I would appreciate it.  Until this concern is addressed, I have to give Zune a single star.

<Title>Extremely pleased...
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After bad-mouthing Microsoft's attempt at even considering entering the cluttered, overcrowded MP3 player market, I have to admit...I'm eating a bit of crow now.  I've owned a few different players, including the iPod, the Sansa, and a Creative Zen device.  Whereas the Zune is the most expensive player I've owned, it shot out in front of the crowd while I was investigating available options to replace my broken Zen.  Firstly, the hardware is actually a modified Toshiba GigaBeat product loaded with a revamped version of Media Center Mobile.  I've always wondered what the GigaBeat feels like and would probably have been prettly pleased had I ever taken the plunge and purchased the Toshiba offering.  The Zune feels great in my hand, yet not like it will crumble if/when I drop it to the floor.  It looks and feels sturdy to withstand the general wear and tear that made my iPod look like I ran it through the dryer a few times a month.  (I didn't.)  The software built into the Zune is truly fantastic.  MUCH speedier than the other players I've owned and also the best looking and most functional.  (I love being able to customize the background with a picture of my kids...'course, that's just me.)  With all of this said, that the Zune Marketplace offers a subscription service is what convinced me to buy the Zune.  I own a TON of CD's, mostly Greatest Hits packages, but love listening to new music, too.  I just find it more practical to get them as part of a subscription to make sure I won't be wasting my $$ if/when I decide to buy them digitally or at the CD store.  The Marketplace is actually pretty cool, but still simple enough to navigate quickly.  And is amazingly fast when it comes time to sync the files to my Zune.  (I'm not sure if I've just used the wrong combination of player/software in the past, but the speed of the sync really blows me away.)  All in all, I am extremly pleased with my Zune (Black).  For the price, I feel like I got a great bargain and am excited to see what's in store for the Zune as MS improves the burned-in software and the desktop Zune app.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is way more than I expected. Sure, it doesn't offer much the iPod hasn't offered before (just the WiFi and FM) but you have to try it for yourself. The interface is great and very intuitive. It took me about 1 minute to figure out all its features. I didn't have any problems with the software or to synchronize it. It's actually very fast! It took it about 1-2 seconds per song. Although the screen is just half an inch larger than the iPod's looks way better. Very bright and sharp image, like an XBRITE LCD. The integration with Zune Marketplace is perfect. Very smooth and easy to use. I subscribed to the Zune Pass option ($14.99 plus tax) which gives you unlimited songs in up to three PCs and syncronization to up to two Zunes. Beware of all those 1-star reviews of people who haven't even used it! You have to try it for yourself. I'm loving mine!

<Content>This is a great mp3 player, and if you are in the market for an iPod or iPod-like media player, do yourself a favour and try it out. The screen is beautiful, and sound quality is very sweet indeed.  Do your research and make an educated decision. Don't write off the Zune just because it's not from Apple!

<Title>Good Product
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted a replacement for the iPod 30gig which I had broken. This was the only logical choice seeing as Apple no longer makes the 30gig iPod. The Zen players I never really liked aesthetically. Great player, does everything you need from a HDD music player. Only thing different from the iPod is the poorly designed Zune software. The software makes editing ID3 tags a pain, but thankfully I still have Itunes for this reason. Only thing I could have asked for was a clock. No installation problems, as of now wireless syncing does not work, haven't found anyone with a Zune to share music with either. These fixes I assume will be fixed in later versions of the firmware updates, I am not worried, I am waiting for the possibilities of the wireless function to open up. Not an iPod killer, good alternative though, and holds up better to scratches and wear and tear.

<Title>Solid Player
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this for my wife and the controls are easy to use. The large screen is also very nice. When the cable is plugged in to the bottom of the Zune sometimes we have to 'jiggle' it a little in order to make a good connection. The battery life is about what we expected.  We use it mostly for playing mp3's and podcasts.  It is a nice way for my wife to show off pictures of our kids. Several things were questionable like being able to play video with an A/V cable.  But once we connected the Zune to the PC and performed a firmware upgrade, it works fine now.  This is a nice substitute for an iPod; costs a lot less too.

Apple may control this product market, but it's not based on quality or value - just being first to market and having no real competition early on.

<Content>I have had the Zune for a couple months now. It was originally bought for my wife, but we both use it quite a bit. Not only have i loaded every single CD I own on to it, but we load movies onto it as well. With the video out cable we hook it up to the player in the back seat and the girls can watch movies while we drive, or we plug it into the car stereo and then we don't care how bad the radio reception is. The wireless has had some issues with synching with our network, but we usually don't use that anyway, so it's not that big an issue. Overall I've been very happy with the Zune.

Well I found everything that I was looking for in the ZUNE!  My daughter absolutely loves it!  I am not a computer techy, but the graphics are vivid!  It is easy to use.  I was not turned off by the size, because it wouldn't be hard to lose it.  The sound quality is pretty good.  It is very easy to download songs.  I made a very good investment!  I would definately recommend this to everyone!  I also purchased the 3 pack chargers, which included: the ac adapter, car charger, and the usb cable.  I only paid $12 for ALL 3 of them, also from Amazon.com.  For that price, you can't go wrong!

The only disadvantage is that, the charging has to be done by connecting Zune to the system. We need to buy the charger seperately, if u need to charge it directly without connecting it to the system.   Other than this difficulty, i find Zune as one of the best items i own.

<Content>The 30 GB ZUNE is absolutely the best product out there even though the newer versions are out on the market, this product can't be beat. You can't purchase any brand with the equal amount of space and features as this model for the same price, heck even the 4 GB model is more than what I purchased this one for. It was purchased as a gift, so its going to be even harder finding the 30GB ZUNE at a reasonable price. I'm glad to have been able to get one.

I really like the fact that everything I had in my Windows Media Player quickly converted over onto the Zune Player(minus some of the videos which through conversion software I have done) much nicer than Itunes.  The screen on it is beautiful and much nicer than the Ipods.  Have not had a chance to try out the wi-fi on it yet, but the fm radio works great.  Would recommend to andybody I know to purchase.  Worth the money, don't consider these other reviews from people who have not tried it.

<Title>Thumbs up!
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My experience so far with the Zune has been positive overall. I will get my only bummer out of the way: the earbuds supplied with the Zune do not fit my ears, but no earbuds of that type do. My ears are just too small.  I know there are a lot of reviews out there dogging Microsoft for this and that, but honestly the only choices MS made that stink are not allowing Plays For Sure songs to run on the Zune, and the crazy points system on the Marketplace. I haven't purchased any tunes from them, so it doesn't apply to me. I also don't plan on purchasing many songs from the Zune Marketplace (if at all), as I like to actually own music with CDs. Thus no loss of starriness in my review. Your mileage may vary.  I should note what kind of consumer I am. This is the first mp3 player that I've owned. I plan to use this at the gym, at work, and at home on the speakers. I was never looking into iPods heavily, mostly because I really wanted an FM tuner built into my player. I have no personal issues with Apple, in fact I'm no Microsoft junkie either. I also wanted something that could hold my CD collection. The Creative Zen Vision:M and the Zune were the two front-runners; about the same price for most of the same features. I chose the Zune for the ruggedness of its case--the Zen was scratched to h@ll at Best Buy--and the interface. I wasn't a fan of the vertical touch pad (just to add: I also am not fond of the click wheel of the iPod; I tended to end up stopping past my chosen point). The Zune just seemed to make sense as I went through the menus. I also chose the Zune partly for its looks; the Zen looked like a boring variation of the iPod, and the Zune's screen looked better than the Zen's.  It's been very hard finding comparisons between the Creative Vision:M and the Zune, as most compare both to the iPod but not to each other. For those unable to decide, though, it may all come down to the players' sizes, the potential of the Zune's WiFi (kinda nerfed now, but the future is promising) and minor cosmetic or functional preferences, depending on the person. I really wanted to like the Zen more, because I don't think Bill Gates needs more of my money, but the Zune really won me over on the intangibles.  Software: some are reporting problems. I loaded it up with no crashing and no confusion. Rips my CDs just fine (needed to load album art a couple of times, but that's all). I have had zero problems and can figure out how to do things with it quite easily. I'm not a computer whiz either, just so you know.  Overall, I'm thrilled with my Zune, the sound it produces is super, the screen looks great for video (if that's what you like, I won't be using that much), and I'm looking forward to the growth of Zunedom.  Before you buy, you might want to check out the software for yourself and see how the Marketplace and interface works. Just go to the zune site and click on the download software links.  Happy shopping!

<Title>OK but sure is not an ipod. Doesnt work 
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an ok thing. I had to get one because i am a huge ipod fan and had to test one of these ipod killers as they say and see how great it was and what everyone was talking about with it. So i got one. The first thing i noticed is the wheel is not a wheel its actually a d pad desquised as a wheel. The screen is larger but when you set it side by side with an ipod its not relaly much bigger its a very deciving thing. It looks bigger till you put it next to an ipod then you realize the screen is not really that much bigger.   Tried installing it the zune crashed and then would not see the OS. Then after unplugging it and replugging it several times it finally say the OS. Then it was such a pain to install it wanted several different places for me to sign up for a live account and i didnt want that. I only wanted to see how it works to purchase music. NO such luck i coulndt get around it. THis is not user friendly so far.  After getting it all installed (took 2 hours) i logged in to the zune store. THis place is a mess no album reviews no movies, podcasts, videos or anything like that. The music selection is very basic mostly top 40 stuff. Well i for one dont listen to that garbage and it seems MS thinks we all do so therefor lets only put this music on our store.  Its not user friendly at all it just is not click and download like the itunes/ipod. I dont like the subscrption idea i want to own my songs i dont want to pay someone $15 a month just to rent some songs. I rent movies i OWN songs. But to buy you have to buy ms points and then MICROcrap will keep whatever you dont use.   I just cant see anyone who is not a geek wanting this thing. Its think it heavy and its weird it just doesnt work right it is no where close to the the ipod. I dont like the interface its ok but nothing special. I also dont like that microsoft refused to put there name anywhere on it. Makes me think as a business person the only reason i wouldnt want to put my name on something is if i think its crap or junk.   I dont see these selling very much and if you have never owned an MP3 player DONT BUY THIS ONE!!!! Get an ipod or if you have a thing against the ipod then get anything else but not a zune. I have several different players and this one would come in dead last as far as functionality and form. Im not baised i think everyone deserves a chance but im sorry zune is just not worth the money. why would i spend the same ammount on the zune as an ipod when my ipod will do so much more?  THis will not play podcasts, videos movies or games. It has wifi but i dont know anyone who wants a zune let aone would buy one so who am i going to wifi with? i know tons of ipod users but wifi is not a big thing i would rather just share headphones and jam right along with my friend. The FM radio well not even an issue i could buy a fm for my ipod but i didnt buy a mp3 player to listen to the radio. If i want that i will turn on my radio in my house or car. FM is dead anyway XM and Sirius are the future of radio.  Think before you buy if you want this because it has wifi well first you have to find someone who will wifi with you. As steve balmer put it i could squirt something to you. NO THANKS KEEP YOUR SQUIRTING to yourself. It just sounds sick and nasty.  Have you seen the commercials to these things? They make no sence and if anyone watched them i see nothing in the commercial that makes me want one or even after words knowing what the thing is.

<Title>Zune Raises the Stakes
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I fly several times a week, so portable entertainment is a must for me. I bought the black Zune; white's a summer color and brown just doesn't go with enough of my wardrobe. But, color is not important - all Zunes are created equal. I won't go into the elegant packaging, which felt very reminiscent of opening my year old iPod. I hope you didn't think I would write a review of the Zune without comparing the two. I'm typing it in Word on the plane, so it may be long.  Fresh out of the box, the Zune felt warm, as in comfortable. Its blue edges glowed in all their double-shot finish beauty. The next thing I noticed was its size. It's noticeably heavier than my iPod, and slightly too big for my dainty hands. I guess that's the price of a bigger screen, which is not as grainy as reviews made it out to be - though it's not as crisp as my iPod side by side.  Holding them up together, I can use the Zune a little bit further from my face when viewing, an inch or two. But honestly, neither of them is comfortable enough to hold for too long. The iPod definitely wins when it comes to watching for long periods but I like the sideways viewing of the Zune. I'll take them both on flights now in case one dies, but I usually use my laptop on flights over an hour anyway.   I have a photo of my doggie set as my background. It's a nice feature but I don't see it much since the players are always in my bag on shuffle or playing a video. I know the more I view it, the more the battery dies.  Of the two, my iPod has got more use over the last five days. I'm a huge fan of podcasts like National Geographic's Atmosphere, Science Friday and NPR. The Zune menu doesn't have a podcast selection and it doesn't support podcasts that well. I don't think any company should make a player without podcasts. As a frequent traveler, they're my news and entertainment. I'm not used to having to go find my podcasts. They've always been right there on iTunes.  After I figured out how to download a few audio podcasts manually, I realized it's not worth the effort.  No wonder people say iPod made podcasts accessible to the world.  If this is what it was like before iTunes managed podcasts, I would have never spent the time to discover them. I was troubled several times when I had to search for where I left off in the middle of a podcast, apparently the Zune doesn't store that information if you stop and listen to some music. I started pausing my Zune and switching to the iPod to avoid losing my place. Now I don't use it for podcasts at all.  Some of my videos were automatically transferred, but my Good Eats episodes stayed behind. It's a shame; those were my favorite time passers and I'm behind by about a hundred episodes. Alton Brown is so nerd-cute. They don't play on my iPod either though. But, I was hoping I could view them somewhere other than the laptop. After I checked, many more of my videos had not got transferred. I don't know why. I guess it won't matter when people legally buy their videos from the Zune Store, but Zune doesn't have them yet.  Then there's listening to music.  I knew my iTunes purchased songs wouldn't convert but I don't plan on getting rid of my iPod anyway. The first thing I noticed was how easy it was to navigate from albums to artists to genres to songs.  The Zune navigation is great. This is the first thing I hope Apple learns from Zune. There's no reason to back all the way out to the main menu to switch from songs to albums. Shuffling was a breeze; it's only a click away. I don't know why iPod doesn't use the center button more effectively. Another beauty was discovered in album view. The Zune shows tiny album art right beside the album name.  I disabled album art on my iPod because all the storage is filled with video, but I know it doesn't have this tiny album art feature. I'll probably disable them on my Zune if I can. The only problem I had with music was that when listening to music I was constantly changing the volume. I think the iPod takes care of this so that all songs are equally loud.  I keep my wireless off because I'm afraid I'll forget to do it on the plane. I don't know what it will do, but I'm not going to be the one who does it. I've also read wireless off will give me more battery life. The Zune seems to last at least an hour less than my iPod but I've never timed them. I don't think many people would like my music; that's why I got an iPod in the first place. So, without sharing, I don't really have a use for the wireless. As I mentioned, I always have the wireless off so nobody would see my Zune anyway.  Not that I was going to start talking to people in the airports.  The Zune Store just doesn't compare to iTunes. I've only looked around but it doesn't seem as easy or well organized.  Maybe I've just used iTunes too much. I was going to buy a song to try it out but I had to advance pay with Zune Pass. So I'll stick with iTunes for now. I can't look at it from up here, so I won't comment.  From what I've read there is no way to store documents on the Zune, which I do with 1 gigabyte of my iPod. Most of them are on my company laptop because they're confidential and our IT department said iTunes screen lock wasn't secure enough. I also can't sync Microsoft Outlook with my Microsoft Zune, weird. I find that strange since my Outlook calendar and contacts sync with my Apple iPod. Because of that, my Zune has no contacts or appointments on it.  I guess it's not required but I don't always have my laptop and have become quite used to checking my iPod for contacts, flight times, and other information.  I think my favorite feature of the Zune is tagging. I can tag any song so that I can do something to it later - usually delete it. Sometimes on my iPod I want to add the song to a different playlist, like the one I use for waking up.  All those songs start off soft and pick up the intensity slowly - a great way to wake up. I can't tag on iPod so I have to use the menu to find the song and hold the center button to add it to the iPod's to-go playlist. Tagging on the iPod takes two clicks of the center button. This is another thing Apple could make easier.  Overall I like my Zune, but it just doesn't do enough to replace my iPod. Actually, not near enough as it's missing everything I've come to rely on. The two will work together for the foreseeable future unless I decide to give the Zune to my nephew. This desire to write a Zune review has sparked me to write one for my iPod as well. I'm rating the Zune a three and the iPod a four.  There are too many important features missing from the Zune. Neither gets a five-star rating because they both don't do things I wish they could, like recording our board meetings. I wouldn't switch from iPod to Zune for anything and I wouldn't recommend it over an iPod. Depending on what you want to do the Zune is nice, but if you like features over the latest buzz I'd stay away for now.

<Title>Great Gen1 Product
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>No, it's not an iPod killer for most people, but it is for me. Having attempted to use the klunky iTunes interface and having to buy third party products to avoid the 3 day (yes...days!) WMA -> MP3 / Apple conversion time iTunes said it would take - I've had enough. I can't even remember when the last time was that I tried to synch it. On the contrary, the Zune was installed, configured correctly and all of my music (with album art correctly associated), pictures and videos were on the Zune in under 10 minutes. And as an FYI - this isn't "substantially" heavier as some people have noted. It's a whopping 1.25oz heavier - I know, I weighed them! I think that's easily attributed to the extra hardware that's inside, not to mention the larger screen. Then again, what do I care? My bag is filled with a laptop, portable hard drives, an Origami and so on...an ounce doesn't mean much to me.  I'm a little confused as to how people are having difficulty getting this up and running. Aside from some of the stupid text, e.g. "welcome to the social" - the installation is very smooth and the transfer is moron proof. My only regret in purchasing this was the wasted money on iPod accessories, but hey...I suppose I can put them all up on Amazon or another auction site!  All and all, good experience - looking forward to seeing future updates to maximize the potential here, particularly with Media Center and XBox 360 - nothing Apple will be able to touch.

<Title>Waste of money
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>1.	For every Zune you buy, $1 goes to Universal (why?). 2.	Confusing method of points to purchase music. 3.	Thick and heavy. 4.	The wheel is fake. Apple owns the patent for the click wheel. 5.	WiFi only for songs, not for PC Sync, downloading music, etc. 6.	WiFI transferred songs will delete after 3 plays or three days,       whichever first. Even songs ripped from CD's or songs from       Kazaa,etc. 7.	Songs with any DRM (other than zune-drm), even MSN-DRM (playforsure) will not work on the       Zune. 8.	Short battery life (you get less than 8 hours of audio playback). 9.	Has plenty of problems when you sync to PC.  10.	 Even though the Zune's screen is depicted in press photos as being sharper than the iPod's, both have a resolution of 320x240. The Bigger screen with the same resolution means FUZZIER resolution. The Ipod delivers a crispier image.  *** And oh yes, I do have both here, an Ipod G5 and a brown brick zune, which I won in a bet. I am giving it away though. I do feel responsible to tell other people that if you are going to get one, watch out. At least I did not pay to use this garbage.

<Title>Simply Amazing
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a new "chocolate colored (brown) zune" today. It is a little thicker than the Ipod (a little less than twice the ipod's thickness), but feels as light as ipod. The brown zune has a shiny green glow across its borders due to the doubleshot effect and it looks wonderful.   These are advantages of zune over ipod  1. 3 inch screen compared to a very small ipod screen,  that makes video viewing more enjoyable than the ipod 2. "All you can eat" zune pass. My zune came with a 14 day trial of the zune pass and I am already enjoying the pleasure of renting as many songs as I can for a small monthly fee. 3. A tough and sleek look and feel. The photographs do not do justice to how zune looks or feels in your hand. You have to hold it to notice the difference. It is very smooth and looks like it can take a beating. I am more confident with handling my zune now, because it seems more resistant to damage or scratches. 4. "Software" - I have read all kinds of software reviews that installation is painful, buggy, software is not usable etc.... but it was a very smooth experience for me. I did not have any problems and I love the software. The zune marketplace has "search as you type" feature that makes searching for a song so easy. All my songs look so lively in the software because of the emphasis on album art. I like the slideshows too. 5. "Software inside zune" - I love the horizontal navigation which eliminates having to go into levels and levels of nested menus. Handling zune's like a breeze. 6. I can set a " wallpaper"  7. Zune looks colorful and lively - both the device and software inside and outside of it. This is unlike ipod - a very dull and boring interface. 8. Radio is awesome. 9. Wireless is good, but I wish MS should have done more with it  It imported all my music, videos and pictures very nicely and very fast onto my zune. It looked like much faster than ipod.  I am very very satisfied and I think its a 5 star product.

<Title>It's Fantastic!
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After two Ipods, Iriver, and a couple off brand MP3's, I've found the one! This device is a little bulkier than others, but comperable in size where you won't notice the difference. The Screen is SO CLEAR. The sound better, and buttons so much simpler to understand than it's rivals. I truly love the Zune Marketplace, and am happy they're supposed to be offering movies as part of the standard monthly rates. That alone may be an Ipod Killer. The unit itself is comparable to an IPOD. There's only so much they can do to better or worsen it. the pros of this item to an IPOD is the Sound, Screen, and Zune Marketplaces. The negative if you'll call it that, is the size is a 1/4 inch larger tall, but still smaller width. I love my Zune and several friends are enjoying theirs and the WIFI file swapping. Real Cool device! Great battery life! I'm real happy with my Zune.

<Title>You would be better off with something else
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A friend of mine bought one a zune. You've probably already read that it is larger than other mp3 players in size but the real problem is the difficulty of installing the software and getting it to work with the PC. My friend has a Dell that is only about 3 months old running Win XP and we had a hard time getting the PC to recognize the Zune. Just to see if it was his port we tried my Ipod (he already had itunes installed) recognized it just like that. After about an hour fiddling with the zune he took it back and exchanged for an ipod and is quite happy with it.  The ipod is just a better thought out device, the sandisk player is also supposed to be pretty good but I would stay away from the zune if I were you. Lots of money spent on advertising this device, doesn't look like much was spent developing it.

<Title>Zune? Whats a Zune?
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is so light years behind the iPod it is laughable. Sad really because Microsft has said it will go broke trying to make this player go top MP3 player. It says it will lose money for years on it. It has hopes on beating out iPods but the problem is the internal structure of the iPod is just light years ahead of it and MS has little to no chance to catch up with this one.   Using the Zune for the first time, my recollections are this; -Its way to heavy. Considerably heavier than the heaviest iPod. -Battery life is abysmal, absolutely terrible when WiFi is enabled. -Sharing songs is more bugged than useful. It takes a full 15 minutes to send the song and by the time youve transfered it, the batteries are 3/4s gone. -Marketplace uses points instead of dollars. In a VERY MS move it is trying here to disguise the fact that youre spending money. Instead of telling you that a song is 1.99 it tells you how many "points" you need. Very sneaky and very Microsoft. -MEnus within the player are buggy and very sluggish. Things move in a jerky motion and nothing is fluid about the navigation.  -this player is just not even an average player in a market that has been dominated by the iPod. The iPod has done so by listening to what people want in their MP3 player. Didnt someone tell Microsoft that the iPod maker Apple has a bit of information on what to do and what NOT to do in a MP3 player?! Im guessing not.

<Content>Not at all reliable.  SW does not install properly and is not compatible with other media software.  Store's "points" system is very confusing.  Round control thing is really just up/down and left/right.  Been waiting for something other than an iPod worth my money, but the zune is not it.  Maybe I should try SanDisk or iPod next.

<Title>What Is Brown And Stinks?
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>....a DOA brown Zune.  I was given a Zune as a gift and was excited to own my first MP3 player. Unfortunately it was the brown one but oh well, it was free. It took awhile to figure out the software as it was confusing. I have Windows XP Pro and am no slouch with the computer but it was still confusing. They really need to make everything a bit easier to get up and running. Finally I loaded some songs onto it. Decent sound. Ok, maybe this is gonna work out. Then I turned it off. 30 minutes later I went to turn it back on and NOTHING. It would not turn on. Where is the QC from MS?  I called a friend of mine who is a bit of a MacDroid. One of the reasons I never considered the iPod is because he constantly raves about it and sometimes he drives me nuts. He always says he likes to reward innovation, not imitation. I was hoping I could "one up him" with something new.  So I called him and he brought his iPod over and we put the players side by side. Then he showed me iTunes. The Zune did seem clunky and awkward after sitting next to the iPod. And that software, MS has a long way to go to catch up with iTunes. Yea, it was impressive and looked easy to use.  At this point I am done with the Zune. I gave it a shot and it died out of the gate. I am taking it back (hope there is a warranty) and buying an iPod.  I have no choice but to give anything DOA one star.  Without the backing of the corporate world it will be interesting to see if the Zune sinks or swims.

<Title>No iPod killer (why would you want to kill it anyway) but works great!
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, let me tell you that I have been using iPod/iTunes for last 4 years and I think iPods are great music players. That said, Zune is a very impressive first attempt by Microsoft to gain an entry into the mp3 players market. I have been using the player for last couple of days and I have been nothing but impressed with this player.  Pros:  1. Works with mp3, aac, wma etc. It had no problem importing my entire iTunes library using the zune software. It also preserved all my playlists and order of songs (impressive). I didn't have any problems with the software as some people of reported - there is a firmware upgrade that you need to install right when you install the software from the CD (that comes with the zune). This could be painful to some - but hey iPods do not come with any CDs at all and you have to download the entire iTunes software anyway. So overall the installation was pretty straight forward.  2. Zune is fast. I mean blazing fast - when you browse through the playlists/albums and select a song/playlist to play - its instantaneous. The album art appears instantly, the song starts playing instantly with absolutely no lag. I tried using my friend's 5.5 Gen iPod (30 GB) and it had visible lags of 1-2 seconds between pressing the center button and the song starting to play.  3. Up/down, left/right click - works better and more intuitive in my opinion. The circular click wheel is good - but to me this is *much* more intuitive and easy. Add to the fact that there is circular scrolling in the menu. In iPods when you reach the end of a list (playlist/menu/settings anything) you have to go back up - it doesn't just go from bottom to top in a circular scroll.  4. Integrated FM tuner. Always a plus (apple charges $50 for it).  5. More customizable interface. You can choose/create your own themes, wallpapers etc. Adds a little personal touch.  6. Big screen. Its only a little bigger but looks like a huge screen in front of the iPod. The resolution may be same - but makes watching videos/pictures that much more comfortable.  7. Sturdy construction. No fingerprints/scratches.  Cons:  1. No podcast directory. I am going to miss that.  2. No games - c'mon microsft - at least solitaire/bricks etc.  3. Zune software needs a lot of improvement. Microsoft's own money system where you buy "points" in a chunk and then buy songs for 79 "points" each (comes to about a $1 per song) sucks. Thats very stupid and needs to be made simple like iTunes.  4. A little bulkier than iPod. Well I guess thats a part of making it more rugged and scratchproof. Not too bad for a HDD based player as most people who need it for workouts etc. will get a flash based player.  Overall a great start by Microsoft. From a hardware point of view, Zune is excellent. The software needs improvements (lots of it).   The iPod, zune rivalry is good for the consumers as this can only lead to improvements in both the iPod and the Zune, with us being the winners. I would like to give it a 4.5 stars (same as I would give the iPod). Depending on your preference you may like one over the other - I like both.  On a whole - a recommended buy!

<Title>Don't do this to a loved one
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I usually don't get involved in making a point known like this, but to anyone who is looking to buy a Zune because you believe it to be a good option to the iPod your loved one wants, please reconsider.  This is not even close to the same thing.  It's not cool, and education wise, doesn't even support pocasting.  Making a kid use one of these Zunes is akin to making them ware high-water pants.  There is also some doubt as to whether this product will even be on the market half a year from now.  If you still feel inclined to purchase this product, I'd encourage you to read Andy Ihnatko's (he's the personal technology reviewer for the Chicago Sun Times) November 23 article on the Zune.

<Title>So Far So Good
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have own a zune for  about a week and half now and so far its great. I was extremely happy that it automatically loaded in all the songs on my computer in about 20 minutes(about 3500 songs) to the player. The best part of this is that it takes ipod format stuff.Everyone in my family owns an ipod so its all in that aac format. The screen is perfectly clear and is better than the ipods screen by far. If your really that crazy about size its a bit chunky,but to me itsthe perfect size. Its actually not that ugly at all(if you dont get the brown)and doesnt have the stupid scroll of an ipod where you skipping over songs. The videos are pretty good.It wont take ipod videos because they are protected which made me mad. Im not a computer guy but it wouldnt take some videos i downloaded off of youtube and google video but got about 75 percent. I dont know much about the software because I dont use it that much(installing it went fine and was not confusing at all--step by step tutorials). The sound is very good,im not very technical on this so cant be too much help. The loading time is great. It takes no time to boot upat all and switching on long playlists is fast as well. Now the reason Ididntgive this five stars is because it scares me a little bit. Sometimes when i know i lock it thebattery stillseems to drain which really annoys me.Also I suggestyou get some external charger because the computer takes forever,almost two and half hours. It sometimes loads in music i already deleted(automatically installing music is great and annoying at thesame time.)there are ways around thisbut i havent gotten into that far.Exceptfor the sometimes funky battery and it not excepting some videos(even though its in the right format and the right size and all that stuff)I cant find anything wrong with it and would recommend it over the ipods which all break in less then a year anyways(hopefully in a year the zune still works).So far happy with purchase four out of five stars.would have given 9 out of ten.

<Title>A Good Player
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ive had the zune for about 4 days now and i used it on a 6 hour trip over thanksgiving, so Ive been able to mess around with it. First off Ive owned the 4G Ipod (which i consider to be one of the best mp3 players ive owned) a creative zen vision M, and now the Microsoft Zune. I liked my iPod but it was black and white and i kind of wanted something to play movies and for it to be in color. I also hated paying .99 a song, thats why I decided to get the Creative Zen Vision M. With the creative I could use Rhapsody and it played virtually every video encoding. But i decided to sell it and buty the Zune.  The zune is a great music player, the user interface is phenominal and in my opinion is better than the iPod. Despite what most people will lead you to believe it's very simple, most of my friends figure it out within 30 seconds. The thing I like best about it is that when you are say in artists at the top there is a horizontal view that lists genres, albums, songs, ect. and instead of going back to change sections you just press to  the side on your d pad. It makes things go faster and makes it feel as though you save time by not having to keep pressing back. What I dont like is that I sometimes forget about it and accidentally hit the back button and it takes me to the main page. Perhaps the biggest thing that gets to me is that when I do this there is no "now playing" option so i have to wait until it goes to the song thats playing screen after a few seconds. Overall the controlls are great and along with the user interface makes the zune great.   What I despise the most is the short batter life. Usually I dont really notice the battery life but on the trip it was going down at a phenominal rate. With the Zune, if you like to manually choose songs then it dwindles your battery life: fast. I think after five hours I only had about 1/4 of batter life left, which is totally unacceptable for a 250 dollar mp3 player. But if you use shuffle then your batter life lasts quite long but still I didnt buy the zune to shuffle my songs, if I wanted that I could have bought an ipod shuffle.  The screen is great and it really makes a difference. Ignore those who state that with the larger screen the picture looses sharpness. This may be true in a technical sense and if you look especially close, but for a regular person its great, and personally I can't see any noticable fuzziness.   The Zune itself is great in terms of durability. Although I haven't dropped it, but compared to the iPod with the scratches and fingerprints, the Zune is virtually incappable of leaving makrs from your fingers. The matte finish is great too since it provides a nice feeling service instead of a metal background. The size of the zune is perfect, although I have owned a Creative Zen which is quite big, but its roughly the size of 4G 40GB iPod. The weight is great too. By looking at it and because of its size youd think it would be quite heavy, but its not. It feels very light and feels very durable in your hand. I also liked the double shot finish on it. When you hold the black zune up to the light the sides turn slightly blue and make it a nice addition to it.   The installation of the software took me forever. I installed it and it said there was an error so I called microsoft and they told me to update something. So I did and then it worked. After you get going they make you create a windows live ID to download songs, so I did that and purchased the Zune Pass. But all of a sudden it kept importin all of my tracks on my computer into the library, and i did not want that. So I went through and deleted them all and started downloading from marketplace (marketplace is great they had all of my 2,000 song library from rhapsody and itunes so dont worry about them not having all of your songs, they mine at least). Then I plugged in the Zune and started to sync my library but lo and behold there were all my songs from my computer still there. It seems that microsoft has this thing where if you delete a song that it will come back. So to save you the trouble and time Ill tell you what you need to do. When you install Marketplace it will ask you if you want to make marketplace the main media player or you can choose custom. Choose custom. Then go to options then click on Add Folder To Library and choose the files you want to ignore. Then on that same box it will say at the bottom Advanced Options click on that and then uncheck the box that says "add files previously deleted from library". now it wont import some songs and it wont keep adding songs from your computer.   Overall the zune is great. I havent used the wifi yet but Im sure when more people start buying zunes thatll Ill have someone to share it with. If you have an iPod video then I dont think that this is something that you need to switch to, but with the firmware updates coming it may be in the near future.

<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't personally own one of these, but I have messed with them in the stores. I don't believe all that bad stuff thats being said about this. Like for instance, one review I have read, was that the people who have perviously used Ipods would have trouble with the Zune. Actually the zune is easier to navigate with. Instead of missing your song every time on the ipod you can just click down... My cousin has a Ipod and I couldn't get to the song I wanted very easily. The only ones I have played with are the brown.. Thats a CON, When your looking at the brown Zune you can see a green border like thing on it. If you go up and look at it you will notice it too. Yet, I don't personally think Apple has much to worry about. For christmas its either been the Ipod(which has games), or the Zune(which has a big screen). I have now got to mess around with it and its easy to use and the picture on it is great.. This is one thing thats a awesome gift idea!!

<Title>Microsoft does it again with buggy software
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> After ripping CDs for 6 hours Zume software deleted about half of my files from the Zume AND my hard disk and didn't even put the deleted files in the recycle bin. After spending a couple of hours trying to figure out how the poorly documented Zune PC software works (I have provided you with almost as much documentation as Microsoft does and I haven't really documented anything), I began ripping CDs. I moved about 1.5 GBs to the Zune and all went ok. I ripped another 2 GB and moved the music to the Zune. When I looked at the Zune, I was missing about half of the first load and over half of the second load. I figured I would just reload the missing files, but they were missing from the PC hard disk also. I tried more down loads, reloaded the software and nothing improved. It seems about a third of the time some files get deleted. There doesn't seem to be any pattern as to which files get deleted. The hardware is BEAUTIFUL and the graphics are second to none, but the software is about as bad as I have seen and I have been this business for 40 years. I got my first RCA MP3 player 10 years ago so I am no spring chicken. Wait for the next release. My mistake was buying ANY thing on the first release.
