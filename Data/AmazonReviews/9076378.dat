<Title>I love this thing! It does everything it claims to do
<Date>Wed Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing! It does everything it claims to do, except for the limited viewing angles it perfect. I have a canon digital rebel all I have to is pop in the CF card and dump all my pics and keep shooting. This process doesn't even take 5mins, and that's a 512mb card.  	 The video is amazing, it's flawless, I haven't noticed any jerkiness in the playback. The software is pretty slow but I use another freeware program to convert video.   Excellent Sound quality, it has a customizable EQ and Bass boost, what else do you expect from a company that makes high end sound cards? The navigation is SOOOOOO easy and fun to use. Battery life is great as well. This has to be the best thing Creative has ever produced.

<Title>A very feature rich media machine
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the new iPod video when it first came out, without the benefit of being able to preview it. After buying software upgrades, I spent quite a few hours trying to convert my movies into the proper format, then the proper size, only to realize that my images were now too small to see. I returned it. I was going to give up when I saw a link that led me to the new Creative Zen Vision. It was pretty new too, with no real reviews. I figured I would give it a shot.  First impression is that it has twice the screen size of the iPod. It's the options within the Vision is what sets this apart. While Apple has sold us the puzzle, one expensive piece at a time, Creative Vision has given us the whole picture. This is a VERY feature rich media machine! It has an external memory slot! Can you possibly believe that the #1 competitor doesn't have this? I have 2 other iPods and now I wonder why I ever bought them!   Those 2 features alone are what sold me, but then it does much more. It has an external speaker (so you are not completely lost if the headphones are mutilated by car door). It has a built in microphone (you can record directly to the hard drive without having to buy anything else). It has a built in FM radio. It has Video/Audio Out so you can port your media to another computer or television (how about carrying a bunch your DVD quality presentations/movies in your pocket, plug them in, and you're up and running)! Finally, it even has a basic Organizer with Calendar, Tasks, and Contacts.  The low points; Yes, the view straight on is not the best. But I usually don't hold the screen that way, just a few degrees down is fine (the picture doesn't distort, and I don't get any reflections). I would like the Power Connector to be readily available. It's under the same rubber flap as the A/V Connector, which is to say that any time you leave the power connected; you have to expose the AV connection to the elements too. A simple tethered plug would be better. Next, the Compact Flash slot is outdated. A simpler, and smaller, Secure Digital slot would be better, especially as most PDA's, phones, and Digital Camera's tend to go that way now. Creative does sell an adapter, but it's another piece of the puzzle to buy.  This thing could easily be 5 out of 5, with just a little more tweaking.

<Title>What a shame: Photo lovers beware!
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this from Amazon last week. It's really a beautifully built device with one enormous flaw. The screen is a disaster. I ignored the advice of some previous reviewers who warned about the viewing angle issue with the screen. Boy were they right! If you are buying this device primarily to view photos then steer elsewhere (see my recommendation below).  First this is a nicely designed device. It has such a solid feel, with a slim form factor, a tightly engineered, elegant interface and button set. It feels great in the hand. Creative's engineers should be congratulated.  Except for that screen.  It's simply unusable. Sure it's big, and dense with pixels and color. On paper it seems incredible. But it's not incredible to look at. Just as previous viewers said, at best when you view pictures you must hold this thing at an ridiculously restrictive angle, and with one eye closed or the image will distort and shimmer badly. Essentially incredibly narrow viewing angle and the binocular nature of human eyes will be enough to create shimmering with this frustrating screen. I showed it to my wife and she agrees.   Video playback suffered a similar effect though not as dramatic.  One other smaller issue was that you can't zoom photos so if you want to preview to look for blurring and such you can't use this device.  What a shame. I really almost considered keeping it because it's just such a nicely designed piece.   Anyway I sent mine back and with some reluctance ordered the Epson P-2000.   The Epson arrived a few days ago. The screen is wonderful. Everything the Vision should have been. Clear, sharp and easily viewed from a much wider angle. No shimmering at all. Same size, same dimensions (640x480) but has a zoom feature that works very well.  The Epson doesn't have the same tight build and the device is a considerably bigger in size, with a slightly cheaper, plastic body. Slightly bigger hard drive. Also has an SD/MMC card slot in addition to the CF slot. Essentially the same functions as the Vision but no FM radio. I didn't buy the Vision for the radio.  That said I'm really happy with the way pictures appear on the Epson and will certainly keep it but still miss the build quality of the Vision.

<Title>Barely Better Than The Previous Version
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had my Creative Zen Vision for all of about 3 hours.  Having previously owned a 20GB Creative Zen Portable Media Center and being completely unsatisfied with it I was really hoping that Creative had gone the extra mile and learned from their past effort.  Well, 3 hours into things I discovered they did a few things right but one thing horribly wrong.  The screen quality is just plain awful.  If people are finding a decent angle at which to hold their's then that's great, I couldn't find one at all.  You'll spend more time fidgeting, trying to find an optimum angle than you'll ever spend actually enjoying a movie on the thing.  It's simply a cheap lousy screen.    The rest of the unit is fine.  The construction is solid, the interface very easy to use (though the included software isn't all that great), and even the sound is pretty good - but let's face it, we buy these things to watch movies on and if they can't handle that then what good are they?

<Title>Great product - read the manual
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I started looking at items like this one because I wanted a device I could use to store my photos while traveling without lugging a notebook computer around.  When I picked this one, I think I made a great choice.  Mainly, in this review, I want to address some misconceptions found in other reviews.  First, the screen:  The viewing angle is not an issue at all.  I was amazed to see what is said in some of the reviews.  It is a one-person device, but I can move my head several inches in any direction without problems.  The screen is amazingly sharp and clear, and easily visible even in bright sunlight.  Second, you CAN use this as a removable drive.  You simple set that up under the extras menu, make sure you have navigated to the removable drive screen on the Vision, and then plug it into a computer.  It will come up as a removable drive under My Computer.  It works fine.  All I had to do to find out about this was read the manual.  It also works fine to store my photos.  It's easy, fast, and SMALL, being about the size of a deck of cards.  The 30 gigs is enough space for even a pretty long trip, and I take a LOT of photos with a 7 MP camera.  I had no trouble transferring my movies to this, either.  I have a very large collection of DVDs, and I wanted to be able to watch them while traveling.  I am using a program called Magic DVD Ripper to convert them, and it is easy.  It does take about an hour for my computer to do the conversion.  The battery is removable, so you can, if you like, carry a second one.  Try that with an Ipod.  All in all, I haven't found much of anything to complain about.

<Title>nice but buggy
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved my Zen Vision for Christmas and initially I was quite impressed.  The screen, although it has restricted viewing angles, is impecible.  The viewing angle wasn't as much of a problem for me as many people made it sound, it's actually quite easy to find a comfortable angle.  The sound quality is far better than an ipod, although I don't like the equalizers so I just shut them off.  The product is smaller than I imagined even though I knew the dimensions, which was quite a nice surprise.  My problems with the device lie more in the video playback.  Even though it claims to support many formats you are very resticted, I have yet to find settings to encode divx or xvid so that playback on the device has properly synchronised audio and it only supports wmv up to 320x240 with a constant bitrate which still looks beautiful on hte devices screen but if desplayed on a TV is inadiquate. I have yet to experiment with mpg or mpg2.  The firmware is VERY buggy, I have experienced several "freezes" during video playback where the device simply stops responding and the battery has to be removed, if this happens the device then needs bout 2 hours to "rebuild" next time you turn it on.  Creative claims this will be fixed in the next firmware update.    So overall I enjoy the product, it's fantastic as an audio player and does wonderful with wmv video playback, just watch out with your other formats as they have caused nothing but problems for me, and if you check the support boards at creative's site, tons of others.

<Title>so far so good
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since I bought this Creative Media Player I have nothing bad to say about it. First of all the sound quality is wonderful. Sounds just as good as my stereo, maybe even better. The removable battery is cool and so easy to replace, plus placing songs in this thing is so easy. And you don't even need to load the software into your computer. All that you need in a media player. But the software that does come with it is cool. You can rip an entire cd right into it without having to go into your computer. Plus you can lower the compression rating all the way down to 48 kbs. Works great with Napster and Rhapsody...no problems.....well just one....battery lasts about 4-6 hrs on a full charge...otherwise it's great...even plays movies too...still haven't figured that one out yet...I'm just a novice so when I do you better believe I'm gonna put a movie in this thing. One other thing...there's an a/v jack so you can plug it right into your tv or vcr...which is so cool I'm speechless. Can't wait for the new model which will hopefully have more GB's. 30 is just a little small for me. Highly recommended. Screw the ipod...get this instead...why pay 99 cents per song.

<Title>Get This Forget IPod
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you are looking for a great PVP (portable video player) with great sound you need to get the vision.  The Zen Vision is outstanding.  Way better then the Ipod.  I have had three Ipods in my time since they have come out.  The first Ipod was buggy and the battery always died for no reason.  Even when I was not listening to music.  The second Ipod i got was the third generation and didnt ahve video yet.  Still the battery died out and I had to send it in to get a replacement.  From what I know they still ahve not resolved the issue of people having to send in Ipods to get them fixed when the battery doesnt work right.  The Zen Vision does not have this problem for the battery pack is removable.  Also it has loads of features, screen is as large as the Ipod itself.  Its great for Videos.  I don't see why people are having so much trouble with the importing of video files.  I have had some problems with some files but mostly everything is going smoothly.  Everything does not have to be converted but if you want to conserve space then you should.   The FM radio is awesome.  It is clear and I have no problems with it so far. Firmware has been updated so some people who complain about some of the features may have their questions answered and complaints resolved by now.   The screen is not bad.  Yes there is some glare but its not like I am going to be watching the movie from ten different angles.  its meant to be in your hands while you watch it.  If you want people to see it..Plug it into your TV.  People complain about the view but what kinda view would you get from Ipods tiny screen ?    I love this device its very nice an well worth the price Creative has listed.  This price on Amazon for the Black version is too steep.

<Title>Zen Vision is very Creative!
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The creative zen vision has great features. Personally i think its a great product. I recommend fully. However there are a few things that may bug a few that did not bug me, here are some.  1)Viewing angle isnt as terrible as people say, but it is true that you have to tilt very slightly to the right to make the color right. But this didnt bother me.  2)Doesn't work under linux or mac. But it will once linux+mac support MTP. (microsoft transfer protocol).  3)It gets a bit choppy during playback of high resolution videos.  4)no album art.  5)its a big clunky. meaning that it is definetly not a one handed device. Not as portable, but what do you expect its a 3.7 inch screen.  But the pros are obvious -high resolution screen -cf slot -30gb hdd (about 28gb actual size .) -sleek magnesium case  And come on guys, the screen issue isnt that bad!!! Unless your reviewing movies for hours at the studio, in that case you would have a 40inch screen, not 3.7 .. its a portable player .. not a portable home theater.  Hope my review was helpful!

<Title>Probably the best portable media player  out now and for a while!
<Date>Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, let me start by saying that I am a picky guy.  I send stuff back all the time if something is not what I expected or how it was advertised.  I am keeping the Zen Vision.  I am glad that I decided to ignore the "crappy screen" comments.  I did a lot of comparion shopping before deciding on the Zen Vision.  Creative is a solid company and I have never been disappointed with their support in the past.   FIRST IMPRESSIONS The screen is excellent.  It's bright, vibrant and a joy to look at.  It IS true that if you slant the thing off to the right more than a few inches or to the left a little more, the screen is more difficult to see.  IMHO you have to be trying to find the angle that doesn't work.  Normal viewing is NO PROBLEM AT ALL.  Have not had a real problem with the small-ish navigation keys, although I have hit the &lt;OK> (Enter) center button occasioanlly while navigating. Big fingers, small buttons,  natural enemies.  PROS The sound is great (what else would you expect from Creative?).  Menus are intuitive.  PC software does what you need quite easily. USB 2.0 transfer is blazing fast.  Included soft case (bag) is thoughtful. Included AV cables are great.  CONS Connecting AV cables disables screen.  Good in most cases, but when I tried to play through CD system using headphone jack and did not have enough audio level.  When I then used the AV cables the screen blanked and I could not see what I was doing.  Maybe I am missing something?  So far after 1 week, I have not found anything else I did not like and do not expect to.  Everyone I have showed it to thinks it is VERY cool and better than any iPod out now.  SUMMARY If you are in the market for a portable media player with video I can't imagine finding a better player, especially considering the price.  Enjoy!

<Title>Good product for the price
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:    A lot of features such as Video Playback, MP3, Organizer, Alarm Clock, Voice Recorder, FM Tuner.  Using their software is basically like opening up explorer in Windows.  Resolution and sound quality are nice.  Having buttons instead of a touch pad allows for more precise control.  Removable battery pack is nice.  There is an additional extended battery pack available for purchase.  Has a speaker so you can blast ghetto music in a fancy restaurant if you'd like.  Can take a CompactFlash card to transfer data.  Many other fun features.        Cons:  OMG is it HUGE!!!  I honestly wasn't expecting it to be THAT big.  I thought "hm... maybe a little bit bigger than the Zen Vision M...?"  This thing is almost the exact same size as my Nintendo DS!  I just can't get over how HUGE it is.  It's a bit of a turn off for those who might want to use it to exercise and walk around with.  Think super old school Walkman but significantly heavier! When the delivery guy dropped it off, I was shocked that the box was so HUGE!!  I thought they had sent me the wrong item!  And then I opened it...!!!  I was almost repulsed by how prehistoric it looked!  More cons...  The thing LAGS.  It definitely doesn't operate nearly as fast as the iPod when switching menus.  I guess that's because of all the things it offers.  It does get to be a little bit tedious and frustrating.    Even more cons...  Lack of accessories.  I guess I probably won't need a toughskin or protector for this thing, because if I drop it, it'll damage whatever it lands on, purely by its size.    Overall, as far as the functions of this player are concerned, I'm happy with it.  However, I'm still trying to get over the ridiculous size of the thing.  Do I dare bring it out in public?  What would my friends say?  Would people stare?!  I highly suspect that they will laugh.      Oh well...  I guess I was really only going to use it to play music in the car.  I must remember to hide it in the glove box before I let any passengers in the car.

That is great in anyone's book.  Still getting used to the player, but it works great!

<Title>great for the plane
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this 1 year now. It's great for air trips. I watch a movie, then put on songs. I have about 10 movies, 80 pictures and 400 songs loaded. The batery lasts about 4 hours for video or 2 hours of video and 5 hours of music. I use DVDshrink (freeware) and CloneDVDmobile to copy movies to the viewer. It does occasionally lock up but if you remove the batery and reconnect it the veiwer always restarts. The fast forward and rewind are difficult, you don't see where you are while rewinding. Because the viewer has regular TV resolution the picture when plugged into a regular TV is amazing. This is a great way to carry several hours of movies and music and a great way to watch and listen to them.

<Title>Screen Issues Nonexistant
<Date>Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a Creative Zen Vision for Christmas and I'm been sold since.  First off, Apple's iPod (I have a second generation version and I just sold my Nano) has a great design and easy-to-use interface but honestly, I don't think the sound quality is all that amazing.  Reading about Creative's products, I was interested to hear if the sound quality really was better than iPod.  The reviews were true - sound quality on this PVP is simply amazing.  iPods lacked bass, this player thumps on my Bose QuietComfort 2's.  The screen is large enough to watch videos on (I watched several when I flew back to school).  The player is meant to be held in your hand and as mentioned... it's meant to play portable video, not to as a replacement to the home theater.  Check this player out (or the new Creative Zen Vision: M) before you drop money on the new iPod.  You won't regret the decision.

<Title>Perfect for frequent travelers and those looking to have fewer wires snaking around the house
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent buy. It's easily my favorite electronic device. Some thoughts on the various features:  I tend to travel a lot. I usually lug around my digital Rebel and take a lot of pictures. A 6.3 megapixel camera tends to fill up memory cards quickly. On my last trip I brought along my Zen Vision and used it to back up my digital pics right from the CF card. I didn't need to carry around my laptop to download the pictures, and I only had to bring two memory cards with me. My back appreciated this change.  The built-in screen far surpasses my expectations. It will not replace a laptop screen for some applications, but the resolution is FANTASTIC.  I already used the Creative MediaSource Organizer to manage my music collection, because I had a Zen mp3 player. This software is superior to the offerings of any other vendor I am aware of. It's neat, fast and powerful. It's multiple panes and intuitive interface make it easy to organize and transfer content.  The Media Explorer is used to transfer pictures and video. The transfer is amazingly quick and painless. When viewed on the Vision's screen, the video is bright and clear. The pictures have excellent contrast. I wish there was a rotate feature so that portrait-oriented photos could take up the whole screen. Then again, I haven't read the manual yet so maybe that feature is there somewhere.  The interface used to navigate between the photo, video, music features is ridiculously easy to figure out (like I said, I haven't read the manual yet and I have used all the features successfully).  One previous reviewer implied that you cannot charge the Vision with a USB plug only. This is not the case. The unit comes with a charger that can be plugged in to a standard wall outlet. However, the Vision will also charge while connected to your computer with the included USB cable, even if if is not plugged in to the charger. If you travel with a laptop, you don't need to carry your charger. I find that plugging in the Vision to a USB port will fully charge the device in a few hours - a bit slower than if you plug it in to the charger.  When at home I plug the Vision in to a Bose Wave Music System. The combo is absolutely amazing. It fills my apartment with fantastic sound, and there is no need to mess around with CD's. It's nice not having to have my computer connected to the speaker system to listen to MP3's.  One reqret - I purchased a white unit. In retrospect I would have chosen the darker color. The white unit tends to stand out while watching movies in dark environments - like an overnight flight.

The slideshow w/music ability is great. It supports plenty of file types and comes with converter software if not supported. Another plus is the ability to record radio. The only draw backs I've seen are two. One the speaker is a good quility but not as loud as it could be. Two is sometime it make freeze up but extremely rare. Just take the battery off and it rebuilds yours files without flaw.

<Title>Beware of Creative Labs Products!
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>No matter how good the design of this product may be, and no matter how good the features are, there is an underlying problem with this corporation's treatment of its customers.  I have had a really nasty experience with the Creative Lab Zen Xtra 40G, which convinced me to stop purchasing any of the company's products. Unfortunately most of my computer sound related accessories are Creative ones.  The problem arose when one of the company's new firmware release bricked the player. After this there was no way to reset the device in any of the ways accessible to owners, it had to be sent back to the labs to restore it.   I exhausted every possible way of getting the Tech support department to take responsibility for this bad piece of software and wave the fees associated with the restoration. Even the supervisor I talked with refused to assist and insisted on referring to the warranty, which in my view has nothing to do with a companies responsibility to wards it's clients.  An owner should not be responsible in regards to the breaking of hardware due to buggy software by the manufacturer itself.

<Title>When it worked it was great... But...
<Date>Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item for a trip to South Africa (from Virginia, USA) for two purposes. To alleviate the misery of the 24 hour plane rides there and back, and to use it as a photo storage device so that I did not have to worry about running out of room on my digital camera.  On both accounts it failed miserably. And I have to say that it is a software issue that Creative still needs to work on. On the plane ride over, I was literaly listening to the second song on one of the CDs that I loaded into it, when the unit froze. I shut it down, started it up, and nothing but a "safe mode" sort of screen would load. I took the battery out, and let it be for an hour or so, and then it fired back up. Only to freeze once again, about an hour later. This time it took several hours to reload. Then it froze again. Solid, for the rest of the flight to South Africa. (And it is a LOOOONG Flight!)  Upon getting to S.A. I took the battery out for a whole day, and then charged it back up, and tried to start it again. Nothing but the "Safe" screen, and no options but to Reboot (which did nothing) or reload the operating system, which I could not do because I had specifically bought this item so that I did not have to bring my laptop with me on this trip.  So the upshot was that I did not have the ability to store pictures on the unit, nor did I have the ability to use it as an MP3 player, for the flight over, or the flight back home. This was terribly dissapointing, because I had done a huge amount of research prior to my trip (not to mention the entire weekend I spent burning all of the music into it that I wanted to bring along!) and thought that I had settled on the perfect answer for what I hoped something like this would be capable of.  I can only think that Creative has yet to work out all of the bugs from the system that they have come up with for this unit.  Interestingly enough, while I was boxing it up today to send back, I turned it on for grins, and much to my surprise, it fired right up.  But I just cannot justify the cost of the unit, given it failing for me as it did on my trip. I have no faith that I could trust it to work once I got it away from my house, and the computer with the software! And I would be even more dissapointed if I were to use it for a photo storage unit, only to have to have it fail, loaded with all of my precious pics! I saw several comments in the reviews for this item that touched on issues like this, but decided to buy it when I saw that Creative had issued patches on their website just a couple of days before I ordered the unit. I will say that when it did work, it was a wonderful little player, sounded far and beyond anything else of this ilk that I have ever listened to, with great graphics, and a great interface.  I just couldn't seem to get mine to work for more than an hour at a time! And as an aside, I thought that the software that came with the player was a bit lacking as well, as it had many problems keeping the tags for songs and albums straight while loading them from my computer. (Windows XP Pro) I cannot help but think that this will be a great player sometime down the road, but from my experience Creative still has some work to do on the operating system and the interface with your computer.

<Content>I looked into getting a mp3 player for some time!  After weeks of googling products such as Ipod 60GB and Iriver pmp 20GB, I made my purchase, and I picked the creative zen vision.  I was pretty on edge purchasing somthing for $400.00 on-line, but I really did'nt have any other option seeing that they don't sell it a best buy or anything. When I recieved my package it had very impressive packaging contents, and came with some very cool extra's.  (Unlike Ipods) After playing with it for some time, I was impressed with the recordabe FM-AM Tuner, and the mini speaker.  I've gotta be upfront because anybody and evreybody that reviews this product mentions the screen.  If creative could do anything to improve this product it would have to be the screen.  Altough large and crisp, it does have to be held at a certain angle.  I belive some people find this a bigger deal then others, as for me I'm not thrilled, nor am I upset.  It's an amaizing product, and if you can get over the fact it's $400.00 I would suggest buying this over a Ipod any day   Erik  Chillin in Wisconsin

<Title>Great Product / Terrible software
<Date>Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this product after cristmas and since have had no problems except for it freezing once. The FM tuner is great and i love that i can record live radio. I did buy the extra battery with twice the battery life which i only need if im going on one of my many trips. The only problem is the creative media software it is so complicated for me. I prefer Windows media center. Now unless you have A MAC just dont get an IPOD because they dont mix. IPOD + Windows = A horrible Not MP3 Player but an ITunes player. Creative MP3 + VooDoo Computers = Great. I have uninstalled the media software and now i have no problems all my IPOD using friends try to bad mouth it and i just sit there and go back to watching my much sharper and larger screen or i will listen to the better sound quality. I also have a question on the AC power source there is another power connecter. It looks similer to what was on my dell DJ which i sold 19 days after i got it. If you know what its for could you email me Jamesbond00792@alol.com thanks.

<Title>A Sweet and Versatile Machine
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, a word of caution.  This is a totally non-techie review, and applies only to my personal experiences with the Zen Vision.  Your experiences will undoubtedly be very different from mine.    	The Zen Vision is a great little machine, but not without its minor flaws.  It plays videos on a 3.7" diagonal LCD screen.  And since it has a 30GB hard drive, it will hold a lot of videos.  It also displays .jpg photos, and of course, it plays music too.  The unit does all of the above quite well in my non-techie opinion.  There's even an FM radio that sounds very clear when the earbuds are attached, since they act as the antenna.  Some FM stations can apparently be recorded if desired.  The unit has a built in microphone for making voice recordings.  I tried it, and the sound quality is more than adequate, although there's no way to adjust the settings.  There's also a cable included for playing the Zen on a TV set.  It does other little things, too, such as a Contact List, Task List, and Calendar, but don't expect miracles from these latter features.  	The unit is small but heavy, and does indeed feel good in the hand.  You just know that Creative has packed a lot of technological punch into this very solid little package which is slightly larger than a deck of cards.  It makes sense that the bulk of the heavy but compact circuitry is for the operation of the videos, since that is the main selling feature.  Still, if I may get psychological for a moment, when I'm using the machine I have this continuous feeling that the Zen Vision's screen will be destroyed by heaven-knows-what in the next few seconds, simply because the screen is so large and so vulnerable and works so well.  There is also an expectation that the battery will die in the next few moments because no electronic gadget this good can possibly run too long, even if the battery's just been re-charged.  I'm certain these feelings are caused by guilt from enjoying the machine so much.  But here come the flaws.  First of all, the software that came with the unit sucks.  Creative provided the basic Media Explorer software, plus some kind of Yahoo music software that wanted to take over the world.  Also included was a trial version of something called Video Vault.  I installed these latter two applications, because like Mount Everest, they were there.  However, they were quickly deleted because I found them to be less than useless.  Creative's Media Explorer software wasn't much better but I've left it intact because I need to use it for downloading photos.  For downloading videos and music, I find that Windows Media Player 11 is superior, in that I don't get the continuous error messages of Creative's software.  However, WMP11 goes through a slow "conversion" process (why that's necessary I don't know), followed immediately by the "sync" (why can't they say "transfer"?) process.  But at least WMP11 works much better than Media Explorer.  	As for screen quality, it's not bad for an LCD screen.  It's about what you'd expect to see on the LCD screen of any quality digital camera.  When viewed outdoors, it's a little difficult to see the screen and the colors, but I guess that's also to be expected.  But when viewed indoors, the screen is sharp, and the colors are more than adequate, though not consistently brilliant by any means.  Colors seem to be more pronounced in photos than in videos.  The viewing angle is indeed very narrow.  Looking at the screen from the left, it looks like a negative photograph.  Looking at it from the right, it looks washed out.  Suggestion:  Don't use these viewing angles.  Three major sore points regarding the video:    1.	Apparently the video "conversion" process mentioned above reduces the file size, and thus it reduces some of the quality in the content, because any quick movements on the screen appear blurred or pixilated.    2.	There is a slight distortion on all of the videos using widescreen, wherein the viewing area on the Zen screen appears more elongated (wider and flatter) than the original video.  Although this minor distortion doesn't diminish the viewing enjoyment, it is still somewhat annoying.  3.     Creative claims that the Zen battery will last 4 hours for playing videos.  Wrong.  It's closer to 2 hours.     However, the video sound is great and in perfect sync.  	The Zen Menu System is a trifle cumbersome, and uses a lot of buttons to navigate.  Another complaint:  Creative's Media Explorer software utilizes the same user-unfriendly folderol  that Windows Media Player does, namely, the utilization of Playlists, Libraries, Albums, Artists, Genres, etc. etc.  All these unnecessary options just complicate things in my opinion.  		For some unknown reason, my PC didn't recognize the Zen when I "docked" it to the USB port, so I'm not able to remove it "safely".  This is only a minor drawback as far as I'm concerned, but I have no idea why this should be the case.  Still, while I was docked I was able to transfer files OK, and I could view the Zen's files under "My Zen/Storage Media", but it was not given a separate Drive Letter like my other Portable Media Player.   I consider this, along with a few other problems, as minor annoyances which should be expected and tolerated with the purchase of any new electronic gadget.    	Bottom line:  Is the unit worth its hefty $400 asking price?  After due consideration, I would have to say yes.  The pros far outweigh the cons.  Despite its flaws, it is a sweet and incredibly versatile machine that provides a lot of pleasure, and I hope it will last forever.

<Title>Treat this review as your bible to MP3 / multimedia shopping
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I did too much research on these devices ... so I am here to share :  I will break down Pros / Cons / General Advice / Why Creative over an IPOD.  OK ... giving this 5 stars, not because it is perfect ... only because *all things being equal*** it is best in its class.   Pros  - SMART drag / drop (which is HUGE if you were an 'old time original napster dude, where you downloaded everyone song you ever wanted, and still have the collection).  SMART means this ... if you drag / drop music, pictures and video in one folder, it will ask you if you want Creative to put the files into the appropriate folders.  And it does this well.  Nice feature, if you have digital pics, and digital movie footage (from the same camera, in the same folder) ... you don't have to do the sorting yourself ... as it handles it for you.  - long battery life  - nice little speaker for 'preview' without having to block out the rest of the world with your headphones (useful if you   are sharing family pics w/ your kids and don't want to depend on the headset)  - nice HD screen BIG screen  - nice wow factor  - beautiful design  - HUGE format replay support (like AVI, which none of the other players support, even the Vision M).  AVI for me is huge, because I take a lot of digital camera movie clips, which are in AVI format.  I wanted to be able to play these back, without having to convert, and this unit handles it.  - removable battery  - option for EXTENDED 28 hour battery life  - fm, voice recorder  - tv outputs  - Can manage with what ever software you so desire ... (see cons on IPOD below).  Cons  - had to reset unit (remove battery, put battery back in) as the unit froze on me within 72 hour period (however, it is   possible that I had a corrupt MP3 that caused this ... and I did fill it up to 30% capacity and did a lot of moving of files   around.  Like any hard drive file system, this can cause some confusion to the underlying OS, so I am less concerned about   the freeze problem ... but will be keeping an eye on it)  - headset does not make sense ... should have come with a right angle plug (minor, and a $20 fix ... just buy a pair of nice   headphones).  The plug and its location is prone to become damaged (as it is right by the finger controls, and sticks   straight out ... very annoying).  I replaced with a nice pair of Philips right angle plug headphones, which comes with a wind   case, for easy travel (without the tangle).  - like everyone said about the screen ... it is tough to view with 2 eyes ... let me explain ... (which by the way ... if   you change the underlying skin to SILVER, versus the standard DARK BLUE, you will be in much better shape).  Now, for the   explaination ... If you look with your left eye only ... you will notice a sweet spot when viewing.  At that sweet spot, the picture will look   like a picture ... when out of that sweet spot, the black becomes 'shiny'.  Now, when you are infocus with your left eye,   close it, and open your right eye ... you will notice that your right eye sees the pic a bit shiny.  If you adjust the view   angle with your right eye, your left eye will see that bit of shinyness ... and so, on.  I am NOT sure what the folks of   creative were smoking when they designed this screen, but it is tough on the eyes.  NOT NOT NOT designed to watch a move, but   definately has the WOW factor, because when you look at it, at a glance, the screen is NICE, almost HD.  - If you use polarized lenses, when you are driving, don't even think of looking at the screen, because you wont see   ANYTHING.  Somehow, the polarization cancels out the view ENTIRELY.  Not sure why, but it does. (Despite the screen flaws,   - expensive (but only $80 more then the Vision M, which is a nice alternative, but does not have the replay speaker, the bigger screen or the extensive format repaly support.    General Advice Don't rely on MP3 tagging, because your songs will always be out of order.  Create Playlists ... this way you can go to your   group of songs and can pinpoint any song you want in SECONDS, versus having to sort through incorrect Genre, mislabeled album   titles, etc.  It comes down to this ... label your songs yourself, don't depend on these unreliable MP3 tagging services,   which will completely destroy the existing tags on you songset.  I have a huge collection of howard stern comedy clips, and   mp3 autotagging had these songs in ballet, soul, etc.  And the funny thing is that these services claimed to have completed   100% accurate tagging to my songs.  B*&&S%$!.  Stick to your own labeleing, and use playlists.  I had over 1300 songs   organized in about 1 hour.  Why Creative over an IPOD :  OK, here is why.  IN MY LIFE, I purchased 5 songs through IPOD.  Notice the workd PURCHASED, meaning I OWN THEM.  Would you   believe that when I went to play those songs on another computer, I WAS REQUIRED TO LOG INTO ITUNES, to ACTIVATE THE APPROVAL   OF THOSE SONGS BEING PLAYED!!!!!  Is that insane?  Talk about big brother keeping tabs on the S&#! I purchased.  I hate to   say this, but APPLE is for people that don't have brains.  They are for people that don't want to think, and don't care to   ask questions, and don't care to understand.  For those ... there is apple.  For everyone else, CREATIVE understands your   personal needs, and also has a talented bunch of engineers that understand what an enthusiast REALLY wants.  The CON however   to buying the Creative is that you will have to use 5% of your brain.  If that is OK with you, then this is the device for   you.  If you don't want to use your brain, and want APPLE to do all of the thinking for you, buy an IPOD ...but beware when   you 'upgrade your computer', and APPLE says there is a limit on how many computers you can play your 'PURCHASED' songs on.  ALSO, why this over an IPOD :   - built in speaker  - nice HD screen, especially if you are a PROUD parent, and want to keep every digital picture of your kids in your shirt   pocket, as well as your full MP3 list.  - TV output, to share slideshows with your family  - EXCELLENT support : Creative picked up the phone BEFORE I purchased the product, as well as after I purchased the product.    BOTH times, I was treated fairly, respectfully, and was helped.  STELLAR.    - bad replay support on the IPOD, as it isn't a generic multimedia device.  - IPOD doesn't have FM tuner, doesn't have voice recorder (which is awesome by the way), doesn't have TV output, doesn't have removable battery  - With IPOD, you better love ITUNES, because you have no choice but to be married to it.  Not very American, is it??  Kind of like a fixed marriage.  With the Creative unit, you can use what ever you desire (its own software, drag / drop within windows, Mozilla firefox, Windows Media Player, etc.)  Got to go folks, there are probably more items, but my fingers hurt from too much typing.

<Title>Good quality, inexpensive portable video, music and photo storage/viewer
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Works great! First of all it syncs with Windows very easily. Unlike my iPod 3rd Gen with XPlay which takes ages to connect and change folders, this guy connects quickly and without hassles. The screen is incredibly sharp. It allows for great detail when you rip a DVD to your CZV or when you watch subtitled videos, eg anime fansubs.  Video is smooth even when many things occur at the same time. No jerkiness. Wide range of video formats supported - wow - just about every format. Just download DivX or xVid and encode your DVDs to  these formats, then copy them across.  Great colours, especially for anime fans - wow! Copies and deletes CF cards easily. Allows you to view the copied pictures. Shows album art with updated firmware. The BAD: Creative has rather poor customer support. Their original software is also pretty buggy. [...] Overall - really worth the money and very durable. High res screen and wide range of video formats beat all other players out there.

<Title>Like the idea, but product has issues
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the look and the idea of the Creative Vision, but I've had quite a few problems with mine, and it's only a month or so old.  First, the device kept freezing up when I plugged it into the computer.  I finally figured out that the USB cable was faulty.  So then I got another USB cable that's OK.  So then it worked fine for a month or so, at which point, now it's started to freeze up for no reason.  A few days ago, it just froze when I was viewing photos on it.  Today, it froze when I plugged it into a computer under its flash drive function.  When it's not having any problems, it's a beautiful device, and I love it.  But it's flaws are disappointing...

I've just compared the two below   Zen vision:Resolution 640x480 with a huge 262k 3.7inch lcd screen ipod video 30gb:320x240 with a 65k 2.5inch lcd screen Zen vision:It's got a built in preview speaker which is great  if u have to get a preview of the song  ipod video 30gb:no previw speaker Zen vision:Has a really good FM radio and an awesome microphone ipod video 30gb:Don't know of any feature of that sort Zen vision:u can upload music from any site imaginable ipod video 30gb:only the itunes crap which is 1.00$/song.....?? Zen vision:can play almost every video format including DivX ipod video 30gb:sorry mate look somewhere else!!

<Title>Definitely Worth the Money!
<Date>Wed Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I asked for the Zen Vision for my birthday.  I chose this one versus the Apple iPod because of the larger screen to watch movies, removable battery and built in FM radio and voice recorder.  My parents were a little bit wary of buying it for me - saying that they only say the point of listening to music and $390 was a lot to pay for gift.  However, once I got it, it was definitely worth the money.  First of all, it was a lot smaller and lighter than I expected.  I kind of thought it would be big and bulky, but it was light enough to be comfortable in my hand as well as small enough to fit in my front pocket.  I compared it to my older brother's 3G iPod (40GB and clickwheel), and the Zen stacked up nicely.  It was slightly thinner, but also longer and wider (which is expected because one of the assets of this player is the size of the screen).  As soon as I turned it on, I found it was incredibly easy to use.  The menus are really simple to use, and the buttons are natural.   The software was easy to install, and the nice thing is that the Zen synchs automatically with windows media player.  And, within an hour, my Zen had all my songs, videos and photos.  The sound quality is superb!  Not to mention the video and picture quality.  The screen is beautiful, and my home videos have never looked so good!  The radio reception is a little sketchy, and the voice recorder isn't top grade, but they're both acceptable.  There's really no problem at all.  I've had my Zen for about a day now, and I couldn't be happier.  I'm having some trouble putting movies on it, since the included software doesn't convert DVDs.  (BTW, the included Media Center Software isn't that useful - but luckily you can perform all the same tasks on Windows Media Player, which I do.)  I took another reviewer's advice and am using a third party software to copy the DVDs to my computer.  Hopefully that'll work!  But overall, the battery life is great, and everything Creative Labs promises is here.  I highly reccomend this product.  Much better than an iPod Video!

<Title>I Love This Thing!
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am very impressed by the Multimedia player, especially with the image (video) quality. It is a little heavy to carry around, but it has worked great for me using it in rental cars with a cassette adapter, and in various hotel and cruise cabins with the portabale speaker system. I have found the controls and menus to be easy to work thru, and easy to see. I am not sophisticated by any means, and still learning, but this unit is easy to use, and maintenance is a non-issue. Battery life isn't as the company predicted, but I got at least 6.5 hours of driving time out of it, and that was enough.  Storage of music is tremendous, and quite possibly more than I would ever be able to use, but as a portable storage device for transferring pics over a long vacation, it fills the need in me.  The problems with the unit are that it does freeze up at times, but very, very rarely during playback. Mostly it hangs up when I am downloading to the unit, or is not recognized by the PC, which has happened frequently. Once I retry, after a day or so, it loads up as though nothing had ever happened. This is disruptive, especially when you are under the gun and trying to load up before a trip, and has occured at those times, 3 times in a row. Still wouldn't give up the unit though. The biggest problem I have is not really with the unit per se, but with how the music is loaded and displayed in the folders. I guess it is related to the Tagging of the music, and needs to be cleaned up (which is really labor intensive, so free music really isn't free).  Tried to purchase accessories from Creative but, they fell down on the job because of relocation of their warehouse, or so they said. Other than that, they were pretty good at explaining any issues with the unit within the first 30 days.  Would I purchase again? Yes. But would like the pricing to be more competitive. But I have to tell you, the video quality is superb, and if you are going to load quality video, then, this is the unit to get.

<Content>Have had this for almost a year now.   Pros: The battery life is good.  FM radio and recording. Video out. Removable battery Can also double as a portable hard disk for photos during travel (bought the flash card adapter for SD card use)  Cons: The video angle can get irritating as you have to look straight at it but when (if) found, its very good (but not as good as PSP)  I would recommend this over the iPod as I've used both. Its also easier (and MUCH faster) to transfer videos to the Zen than to the iPod.

<Title>The Vision does it all
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been very pleased with my vision.  I got it as an alternative to the iPod Video which has way too many restraints on what types of media it will play and the screen on the iPod is much smaller.  The Vision plays just about any video that I have on my computer (some problems that can be worked out with AVI videos).  It comes with a velvet case but you may want to buy something more protective.  Creative.com has a leather case available but it's not very useful.  I recently bought a very nice leather case from France (noreve.com) for it that has a kickstand attached to the back for easier viewing (e.g. on a plane).  The 30GB of memory is plenty and it comes with software similar to iTunes to manage all your media.

<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my new Zen Vision. I received cash for Christmas and spent the last few months researching the different products available. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't find a local retailer since I would have liked to see it before I purchased it, but since there weren't any local retailers I took the chance and ordered it through Amazon. I already had a Zen Nano and wanted the Vision primarily to store and view all my pictures. I had no problems with the software and it was very simple to load my music and pictures onto the Zen Vision. I agree with the other reviewers about the picture needing to be viewed from a certain angle, but if you hold it or set it at the right angle the pictures are great. I love the larger screen, it is much better than the Ipod. I solved the viewing problem by purchasing the optional docking station. I can set the docking station to the correct angle and can see everything clearly. I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it to anybody!

<Content>I was really nervous after buying this poduct that it wasnt going to be that great. After all, most electronics arent nearly what they say they are once you actually have them in your possesion, having said that....this one is great.  I love everything about it. The LCD is HUGE and crystal clear, however, as im sure you have read, the viewing angle is very limited. but thats why they call it a PERSONAL video player. The interface is very easy to navigate, everything is at your fingertips. The weight is incredibly light for the size, and in a general sense it blows any Ipod out of the water. The battery life is really good for both video and music. (see creativelabs.com for actual specs.) overall i would rate this pvp as the best on the market right now. i have used many ipod, and i find no comparison between the two.  the only downside, is that it is larger and bulkier than the ipod, so if you want it for everyday use, maybe an ipod would be better for you. secondly the calendar option only lets you create, add, or edit information from your computer and then sync the info to the zen.  but dont get me wrong, this thing is amazing.

<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Vision for about 3 months now and I use it almost daily at work.  The audio is great, the graphics are very good for a handheld device, the UI is easy to get around.  Every now and then it will just sorta crap out on me and I have to pull the battery to get it reset, but that's only been two or three times (I think that some of my audio files might be corrupt).  The fact that it has a radio tuner (which works great), plays audio files and video files was a huge selling point for me.  Plus, if you get the extra card reader, it will read a ton of different cards and allows for easy storage of data files (I use mine for pics - this holds a lot more than my SD card for my camera).  The pictures never can do justice on a small screen, nor are the videos 100% quality.  But if you want that, use your computer.  I've also found that the normal battery doesn't quite stand up to what I use it for.  After 8+ hours of use at the office listening to audio files, the battery tends to die before I pack up and head home for the day - and that's even with adjusting the settings to be power conservative.  When using the tuner most of the day, this isn't an issue.  I haven't tried to watch hours upon hours of video on it yet, but I'm assuming it would die even quicker than it does with audio files.  Overall, it's been great for me.  Just what I needed - with some very minor adjustments on my part.

<Title>Player rocks, software is terrible
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player itself is wonderful. Holds tons of video and audio. Best part is the beautiful color screen. BUT, the software program used to load songs & movies on the player is TERRIBLE. Takes 4-6 hours to load 5,000 songs. And videos...don't get me started. Must encode all videos to a format that is compatible with the player and each small video file takes 1-2 hours to convert! And just when I started to enjoy Zencasts (video podcasts) on the player, the software program shut down on me and now I can't load them anymore! Sheesh!  Creative must change their software if they are going to oust IPOD. The programmers/designers must not be talking to the public b/c this design is NUTS.

<Title>i really wanted to like VIDEO player
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i just got back from the USPS where I had to return this PVR.  I am a techno-geek girl and my husband owns the other "leading brand" player with a 4 inch wide screen but a bit less resolution.  I was so wanting to like this Creative product because my friend owns the Vision: M. The critics did point out that this products down fall was a limited viewing angle...THEY WERE NOT KIDDING!  Seriously, come on its a PVR and to me that means, its first job is to be a Personal Video Recorder/Player...its second job is to play MP3 files.  I downloaded using Video Vault PVP...RevengeOfTheSith...IMPOSSIBLE to watch dark scenes.  Even when the viewing angle was held almost PERFECT...real world sitting means you might be leaning back or on the arm of your chair...to describe the video distortion is like a "negative film reel" that you get from 35mm pictures. Seriously i am a regular buyer to Amazon electronics and really kinda mad that i paid express shipping for a product i had to return because it was such a dissppointment.  Yes the VGA 640x480 resolution is really beautiful but...real world viewing does not mean you sit STRAIGHT UP TO WATCH video.  If you want a bad ass MP3 then get that...but you are buying this for the video and the music secondary...or in my opinion should be. I cannot recommend anyone buying this...the video VIEWING ANGLE IS ATROCIOUS!!!UNBEARABLE, SHAMEFUL, FRUSTRATING, DOWNRIGHT TERRIBLE...i really am a very logical reviewer...and believe me...i really wanted to like the product...but its flaw for me was too great...i give it 1 star because i would hate for the next person to waste $20 bucks for all the shipping costs of getting and then having to return it...i think i might even understand why Creative does not stock this in store...anyone who picked this up could see how the screen is so bad...look this review is harsh but i know if i had read anything this to the point about the suspecting screen...i totally would have clicked that mouse and moved along...thnks

<Title>Great multi-purpose device
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> I've done quite a lot of research on this device before buying it.  I must say - I actually purchased this device twice :(.  The first time was when it first came out (many months ago) and the second time was about two months ago.  When I first purchased the device - my driving requirement was an MP3 player and watching videos.  I didn't want to go with the iPod since I didn't like the fact that it was only compatible with iTunes and the idea of watching videos was cool - since I spend at least two hours on the train to go to work.  Unfortunately, when I first purchased this device, I had to return it about a week later, because somehow, I had managed to 'crash' the device and it developed a firmware problem.  Instead of ordering a replacement model - I decided to get a refund.  My first experience was not all that great :(  Since then, I've occasionally monitored various postings and comments (online) on the device, and with my getting more involved in digital photography, decided to purchase another one :).  Since my purchase of the this device the second time, I haven't had any regrets.  It has worked (almost) perfectly, cause in the world of software, nothing ever works perfectly, and it has definitely met all my expectations.  Here are some of the things I use my ZV for:  1. Storage device for my Compact Flash cards for my Nikon Digital SLR - so I don't need to lug around so many cards.  Whenever I fill up one card - I just dump the pictures to my ZV.  And yes, it handles RAW and NEF files (although you can't actually view them from the device). 2. Storage for backing up my documents on my computer (a portion of the ZV can be configured as an external drive - so no more USB key fobs for me). 3. A MP3 media player (for my CDs I've ripped). 4. A MP3 media player for my Napster to Go subscription. 5. Watching TV shows that I've transferred from my Tivo.  Although this device is not small, the cool thing is that I only need ONE device, and because it's so versatile, if I'm bored, I can easily entertain myself by either listening to music or watching a show.  The only disadvantages I've had in using the device:  1. The screen isn't bright enough in direct sunlight (but then again - most of the times when I'm watching video - it's not in direct sunlight). 2. A bigger hard drive - more of a feature request - because once you start to use this device - you're hooked.
