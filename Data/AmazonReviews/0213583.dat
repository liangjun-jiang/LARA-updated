<Title>MP3s OK, WMAs a joke
<Date>Sat May 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 player a couple of weeks ago. It was at a good price and has 512 MB storage. It's a good device for playing MP3 files. I have had few problems in that area. Navigation through the contents of the player is easy.  What has really ticked me off is playing WMA files. I've bought several songs from MSN music stores. The device is billed as playing these files, but it's quite the exaggeration. I don't know that any WMA file I have bought plays cleanly. Few actually even play. One that does causes the player to hang at the end, forcing me to remove the battery to shut the thing off and then keep pushing the controls to try to get to the next file when I start up, otherwise it will just hang again.  I emailed their customer service to find out what's wrong. All they would tell me is that the file must be protected and can't be played. That one file actually does play apparently does not contradict this statement that the file can't be played. That the files play perfectly on other MP3/WMA devices also apparently fails to contradict this claim that the files cannot be played. (The files can't be played. The fact that you can play them does not contradict the fact that they can't be played!) I have repeatedly pointed this out to Coby, but have been totally ignored. I've even tried to help diagnose the problem by pointing out that the bit rate indicated on the LCD is quite a bit lower than the rate actually in the file.  So my conclusion: If you are in the market for a pure MP3 player, this isn't bad. But take their claim that it plays WMAs as the joke that it is.

<Title>Basic MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is basic MP3 player. I use this for listen to music till I fall a sleep at night. For that purpose, this is good.  You may able to buy a better MP3 player for similar price. Like Sancdisk Sansa - very good player with radio inbuilt.  I kind of like the earphones came with this.

<Title>cheap and easy

<Content>This Mp3 player isn't packed with a ton of features, but a solid choice for the price. It just does what it says, plays MP3 and UNPROTECTED (non-subscription) Windows Media. The sound is good for the price range, and it has a preset eq function that works nicely. Navigation is fairly easy, with one button controlling most functions (press to turn on, press again to play, press once more to pause and hold to turn off). You don't have an FM tuner, and you can't play subscription media (no napster, audiogalaxy, yahoo music, etc), but pay-per download services (Emusic, Wal-mart) will work just fine.  There is an SD card slot, but the "playlist" is just a folder that the player can limit itself to, so storing 1-2 gigs could get messy. The construction feels slightly flimsy, but you could buy two of these for the cost of most other players in this feature set. If you're looking for a starter MP3 player or something to use on the go (do you really want to carry a $100-$200 player around town?) this is a good choice.
