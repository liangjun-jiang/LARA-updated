<Title>Excellent alternative to that other "high end" portable MP3 player.
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Originally written July 24, 2005.  Well, this is the 3rd Creative product I have purchased and I'm just as satisfied. I was pondering getting this, the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 Player, or the Creative Zen Touch 20GB MP3 Player. I actually slept on the Zen 40 gig when it was under $200.00. Not this time, I got the 30 gig for $180.00 and I'm very happy.   Other than not having a Radio, it has the features that make or break a MP3 player. I can create Play list on the fly if I desire, import playlist from the computer. There are a zillion EQ settings with the ability to customize my own.   The sound is great, even at 64 kbps WMA format. For hundreds less that the so called leaders, this is a true value and I'm so glad I finally made the purchase. I know I'm forgetting some items, but I'm listening to it as I type and load my CD's onto my computer. This MP3 player is everything I'll ever need.   Recommended: Yes   Amount Paid (US$): 180.00 Recommended for: Music Lovers - High Capacity Storage for an Entire Album Collection   Update: June 15, 2006. Well, a year later and my review is pretty much the same. I can say that I have had a couple of instances where the unit has frozen completely and I had to either reboot or remove and replace (same battery) the battery. This has been a great product for me and I have moved on to the Archos AV500 (sorry Zen Vision M, not enough features to compete). Now the 40 and 60 gig units can be purchased for much less than what I originally paid. Great device, Monk....

<Date>Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i liked it.  it was good for a year and a half... then crashed a few days ago.  i bought it for under $200 instead on an ipod.... 10 gigs more for $100 less...good deal to me.  one thing i hated about it was that it's so huge and bulky... somebody actually asked if it was a walkman.  it was my prized possession... i had 2500 songs on it and lost them all....so for that i'm pissed.  i plan on staying with creative and getting a 20 gig Zen Sleek Photo.

<Title>Still works great after 1.5 years
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Creative NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra 30GB player in May 2005.  I have used it constantly since then - at home, in the car, traveling, camping trips.  I have nearly my entire CD collection - over 10,000 songs.    The fidelity is excellent and the battery life is still 12+ hours.  The replacable battery feature is great - I bought an extra battery and fully charge both before going camping where I won't have electricity available.  I have had the problem some have mentioned where the unit freezes and needs to be reset - some times it takes 10+ resets to get it working again.  The problem seems to be with the AC charger, and I found I can completely avoid it by never turning the player on before connecting to AC and disconnecting the AC before turning off.    Another tip: a company called Red Chair Software sells a "Notmad Explorer" interface program that I highly recommend.  Makes organizing, downloading and playlists much easier.  Best feature is a SQL database function that allows you to export results (lists of songs, albums, playlists etc.) to Excel and print them out.

<Title>Batteries Need UpGrade
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This unit is great for meeting storage needs,30GB. This player has huge, unacceptable flaws. The bad news starts with the lithium battery. The battery(fully charged) does not hold charge longer than 70 minutes at a Volume setting of 19 or higher. What's worse, is that you cannot hear audible sounds under a volume setting of 16 through headphones. Even at full volume of 25, it is difficult to hear sound in outside environments. One more thing_If you shutdown the player after a full charge, and leave unit alone for anytime longer than 48 hours:the unit will need to be manually reset. In closing, this MP3 player is definitely not worth the hassle. Note:I bought two replacement batteries only to get the same disappointing results.

<Content>I have owned a Zen Xtra since they were first put on the market and have encountered few problems. I still have the original battery and the unit only needs to be reset occasionally. Its 30 gb storage is as much as anyone needs in a mp3. Though this model is probably dated by today's standards, it has been very reliable and has none of the battery issues of the ipods.

<Title>Maybe worth the cost!
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a Zen Xtra 30G player.  It frequently needed to be reset, which is annoying.  I have owned it just over a year now (just!  bought it just before Christmas for my son, who chose to pass on the gift in favor of an iPod) so it's out of warranty.  Although it worked OK, Windows Media Player 11 said I needed to update the Zen software.  Using Creative's instructions and downloads, the player ceased to work; the computer sees it, but Zen's firmware program does not.  It cost me several hours of struggling with their web pages and downloads, and I finally gave in and PAID $13 for them to tell me that apparently the card went bad, just as I was updating (of COURSE, it was not their fault, nor caused by the software, just a coincidence, he said)  They'll fix it for $95-135, or the rep suggested that I just buy a new one.  I will.  It won't be a Creative player--the rep estimated 1-2 years of lifespan.  If you decide to buy one, I suggest that you pony up the forty bucks they charge (on a NEW one)to guarantee their product at least two years.  UPDATE:  I again contacted Creative, and they identified Media Player 11 as the cause.  They provided complete instructions to roll it back to Player 10, and to reinstall the firmware.  My Zen is working again, and is back to being full of my favorite music.  I must commend their Tech Support for not just leaving me to swing in the wind.  You can feel my frustration in my original posting, but my opinion of Creative improved considerably, thanks to the extra effort of the tech and the tech's supervisor.  I would change my review to three stars, but it won't let me.

<Title>It's mostly fine for me
<Date>Thu Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I give it four stars 'cause I've had it for a few months and the harddrive is fine and I've dropped it [many times] and it still works. One big problem I have is not with the machine itself, but with the program that came with it. A couple of weeks ago, the program you use to load CDs into the player stopped working, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it a few times, and then it wouldn't recognize the driver that is needed to connect the player to the computer. I just learned that you can download new drivers from their website, though, so hopefully that will work when I try it later. The whole program-not-working thing might be because of my computer, which is old and has a tendency to mess things up, hence the reason I didn't give it lower than four stars.  Overall, I love this machine. I have 2,278 songs in it [and many more still need to be loaded in] and it's so much more convenient than carrying around a bunch of CDs. I'm one of those indecisive people who used to leave the house with one CD, only to end up wishing I had brought something completely different. This is a godsend for people who have way too many CDs and want to listen to a diverse mix of music on the go [even if they don't have a CD burner to make mixes, which was my problem before I got the jukebox player]. Plus, its cheaper than an iPod, it's battery is replaceable [unlike the iPod, where Apple charges $100 for a battery replacement], and it holds more songs than the cheapest full-size iPod, which is actually more expensive than the Nomad Jukebox player.  It's a good buy. But I'd get the warranty, 'cause you never know what'll happen.

<Date>Wed Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 60GB player in December 2003. The headphone jack immediately failed within the 1st month, even though I took extra care in handling this unit, always had it in its protective case, and never dropped it. I received a replacement unit from Creative and wouldn't you know it, the headphone jack once again failed. Thanks for the previous review from &quot;seleniumdream&quot;. I will be doing my own maintenance on the headphone jack since it is now out of warranty. Bummer that I didn't stumble across these reviews on this unit earlier. Now I only wonder if the hard drive is going to fail like so many other reviewers have experienced. The only good thing that could come from buying this unit is that hopefully it malfunctions within the 90 day warranty. If you want a good MP3 player buy any other unit except this one.

<Title>A few downsides, but still one of the cheapest HD mp3 audio 
<Date>Fri Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this player for some time now. It's biggest downside, is that the bundled software didn't work for me, it was very unstable and would crash frequently, which was very frustrating, but thank God there is another software called &quot;Notmad Explorer&quot; which does the job all right, although you must pay $25 bucks for it. CD-Ripping and MP3 compression can be done much, much better by other free software like EAC and Lame.  The players physical aspect is not close to that of the nice iPod, but mine came with a nice carrying case that let's you see the screen and use the controls.    The player does what it's made to do: play mp3 and wma. There is not much more in it, no recording microphone, no games, no text... but it can be used as an external hard drive, but only for moving/copying files. Its database system is not fantastic, but it works.     Pros:  -More than $150 cheaper than the iPod of 20GB (July 2004)  -Li-Ion battery lasts about 12hrs.  -Fast USB 2 into 30 GB portable, for $200    Cons:  -No remote control  -No microphone  -Not recognized as an external drive in My Computer by Windows XP  -Bundled headphones or worthless  -I don't love the Quick Scroller    It has freezed a couple times, and I have dropped it, but it still works fine.    So the player is not fantastic, I had to buy some Sony MDR-EX71SL headphones and the Notmad software to use it decently, but after that it has worked well and I feel pretty satisfied with my purchase, the iPod is a lot nicer, fashionable and expensive... So I'll get one when I don't care much about money.  I only want to enjoy music and listen to some audio books, and this player does that very well, so I'm happy with it.

<Title>Great Product!! But buy the new Zen Touch!!
<Date>Sat Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ok, i kinda know you "adults" won't listen to a "kid" but I'm dying to say this. This product is great, considing the price, comparing it to the iPod (I'm saying this becuase I had to pay for it myself). I LOVE the EAX Audio features, with the virtual environment and smart volume. The sound qualities great! I personaly don't really like the iPod because it's feels like Apple wants to suck up all your money with all the accessories and iTunes. The removable battery is a great feature for the long term, because eventually the battery will die. The advertissed battery life isn't as long though, it's only about 6-7 hours. The case is real cool because it look nice and you can actually access the buttons and see the screen. Although, the size and weight compared to other Mp3 players is that lovely, it's kinda bulky. It's a pain in the neck trying to navigate through 30GB(about 1000 songs) with a small scroll wheel kinda thing with one hand. And too sad it doesn't have a remote though, it would be a lot better since I bike with it in a bag. And when you try to switch songs you have to take it out. Overally, this is one of the best mp3 player i've ever owned. I'm returning it though, becuase the new ZEN TOUCH look and probably is better (it's smaller too). To conclude this is a great product overall. Buy it if you want a high capacity mp3 player and is restricted by money.

<Title>Beware
<Date>Sat Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My hard drive failed at seven months. I knew that dealing with Creative was not going to go well as they had already scammed me on the rebate. The technical service is horrible and unprofessional- Creative does not stand behind its products and treated me with contempt and disrespect. And that's if you can get them to answer the phone. I purchased an Ipod after that and even though there is the battery issue, Apple has a totally different attitude towards its customers and technical support. Especially with the recent decreases in ipod prices, drop your coffee habit for a month or two and spend the additional money it takes to get a truly great product- the Ipod.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Sun Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my player for almost 9 months now and so far so good.  There have been a couple of downsides, the ear buds they supplied hit the trash right away as did the cover they supplied. The ears buds were junk and WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU SUPPLY A COVER THAT COVERS THE DISPLAY SCREEN????  The only other irritating item is the battery switch.  It's on the bottom of the unit and always pops the door open.  Obviously, the engineer who designed this had no intention of ever actually using the player himself.  Since this is my first player, I'm relatively happy with it as I've learned to work around the above items.

<Title>Bad Support, Short Sighted Design
<Date>Thu Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I received a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra for Christmas last year.  It worked fine for six months and then the headphone jack malfunctioned.  It was out of warranty, but it certainly wasn't time to pitch it a get a new one.  I returned it to Creative to have the jack replaced.  This cost $20 for an initial evaluation.  After a couple of week Creative called me and said that the unit would have to be replaced with a refurbished unit at a cost of $200.  New units can be purchased for $239.  I thought this was stupid since the harddrive is completely detachable from the rest of the unit (surely half the cost).  It made me wonder if they can't fix a bad headphone jack, what on earth could they fix.  Seems like they scammed me for $20 in addition to their bad product.  Since the unit was completely functional except for the headphone jack, I chose to have the unit returned without repair and use it as a portable harddrive.  I had also hoped that I could listen to the music through my computer.  It wouldn't be completely portable, but I could take it to work.    I then made two painful discoveries.  First, the headphone jack on the jukebox is the only audio output, even though you can control the unit from your computer using Creative's software and the software appears to have functionality to change the output.  Secondly, there is no way to access the jukebox as a generic mass storage device, so you can use another media program.  Consequently, I have to drag files over to my computer harddrive to listen to them.   The jukebox will also not let you copy protected files to a computer.  Pretty short sighted when you consider that there is no way to backup your protected files.  Jukeboxes are great and I will buy another one.  It won't be a Creative product.

<Content>Can't help feeling that another reviewer's comments about Creative's business plan might be accurate. Looks nice, performs well but the headphone adaptor seems almost designed to break. I suspect the 30 day warranty is because Creative knows this.  I'm certainly not an Apple freak and would rather buy something else, but feel MOST reluctant to buy anything from Creative ever again. Oh - maybe that wasn't such a cool business plan on their part after all ...

<Title>Good price for a good mp3 player
<Date>Sat Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had it for about three months now, and it has been working very well. Size and looks don't really matter for me, so I have no issue with it being big or bulky. It's lighter and smaller than a cd player, at any rate.   Positive things: - Good price - Excellent sound quality - Replaceable battery; the lack of this feature is a major drawback of the ipod. Li-ion betteries always die sooner or later, and its nice being able to replace it instead of buying a new mp3 player. - It supports non-latin alphabets, which is good for me because I have a lot of foreign music.  A few drawbacks: - The software that it comes with really is crap. - Short warranty; although I haven't needed it yet - I still have not figured out a way to sort my music by folders and not ID3 tags. A friend with an older version of this player tells me that its possible, but I did not discover it yet. - I wish it had more accessories to go with it. - Every once in a while it freezes up and you have to take the battery out or press the reset button. - Battery life is actually not that long, especially if it is not depleted completely before recharging.

<Content>Battery life sucks big time!  It's always on low.  The iPods are nice, but overpriced.  This unit gives you a lot of storage, but creative doesn't put too much thought into their products.  Their software always sucks... For example you cant just use windows explorer to copy files, music over.  You have to install a large software install which then gives you an explorer "like" interface.  Why didn't these bozos just make this thing plug and play and act as a hard drive?  It's not very convenient that way.  They do however give you a leather case which apple charges too much for.  I wouldn't recomend this unit.

<Title>A thousand times better than an iPod
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went shopping for MP3 players when I found out I was getting sent to Iraq.  I had no desire to lug my 200+ CD's around the desert.  I, like others, was thinking iPod.  The guy at Circuit City changed my mind though, this thing was $90 cheaper than the iPod and 10GB more!  I like the interface better than the iPod, for example if it ever stops responding there is a little reset button on the back.  The first time a friend had a problem with his iPod it took us hours to figure out the reset key sequence.  I like that it has a replaceable battery and that you don't have to use iTunes.  An earlier review states that you *MUST* use Nomad Explorer ... this is simply NOT TRUE.  I did NOT install the Nomad Explorer software at all, I use MusicMatch Jukebox to manage it, but I can also just open it in Windows Explorer and treat it like a folder.  I repeat, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE NOMAD EXPLORER, all you have to do is install the Jukebox driver.  I HATE how Apple FORCES its customers to use iTunes and iTunes only.  Anyway, I have had it for about a year now and it works PERFECTLY.  I have been trucking around the desert with it now for about 6 months with NO PROBLEMS.  I listened to it almost non-stop on the flight from Indiana to Kuwait and it kept on trucking (of course I had it in sleep mode because I knew I would fall asleep, so it turned off every time shortly after I fell asleep).  I think some of the previous reviewers haven't read their manual.  You CAN create playlists on the unit, and you can create multiple playlists.  You can play random tracks by genre, artist, album, or (my favorite) play any track.  I have seen several guys have their iPods go bad over here.  My commander saw my Zen Xtra and liked it enough to go buy one himself.  I have almost 3,500 songs on this thing and PLENTY OF SPACE TO SPARE.  I don't even buy CD's anymore, it's all electronic.  BTW, this thing sounds AMAZING with my Bose Quiet Comfort II headphones.  At this stage in the game Creative has successor products out there, but in my opinion the Zen Xtra is still a great buy.

<Title>This really is a good player
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm in high school, and I see EVERYONE with an iPod. So when my birthday came rolling around, I naturally asked for an iPod. However, my dad ended up getting me this instead, and I was very disappointed with its appearance. It looked huge and I was embarrassed of it. I've had it for over a year now, and I am now ashamed that I used to be ashamed of it. It plays all my music really well and putting music on it is really easy and fast. I don't carry it in the case it comes with because then it just looks amazingly HUGE, but I've dropped it several times and it still works fine. I have more songs than I can listen to and still lots of room for more. And even though it's slightly unattractive compared to some other MP3 players, it is worth the price and can easily be hidden in a bag ;) But, honestly, the most important part of any MP3 player is that it works well and plays well, not how pretty it looks, and this Creative definitely does both. I highly reccomend this to those who want to save money and can still easily enjoy their music wherever they are.

My only complain has always been it's uglyness, it's so large and ordinary, but to me price and performance is more important than trendy devices disguised with eyecandy, so I've managed. But it did cost me $240.00 and for such a price, I've been more than happy with its performance. Great deal.

<Title>Good quality, long lasting
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player for a year and a half now. I have to say, it's more long lasting (and tougher) than I thought it would be.   Size: This thing is pretty big. I have not had a problem carrying it around- I mostly use it around the house (I recently boxed up all my CD's and only use MP3s), in the car, and at work when I'm not moving around much. I have recently orgered a small 1 gig flash memory player to use when I am more active, and I think this is a nice compromise.   Interface: The buttons are on the sides, and I love this. When it's in a pocket or bag, I can reach in and control the volume or skip a track without looking at the player. This is also nice in the car- I put it in the storage slot with the skip buttons facing out, so it's easy to control without taking my eyes off the road. There is no lock switch (you can access a lock feature through the player) but the buttons aren't that sensitive so I have not had a problem. The jog dial on the side is pretty small, but since I have small hands, this has not been a problem. The downside to this method of control is that it can take forever to cycle through a large numbers of albums.  You can download an update to the firmware that lets you use Windows Media instead of the software that comes with the player. I did this because I found the software that came with the player was having trouble with my 20 gigs of MP3's.  Durability: I have dropped my player, sat on it, and generally beat it up, and it's fine. I thought it would be flimsier- the entire front comes off to replace the battery, but it has not been a problem.   Battery power: When I first got the player, the battery lasted as long as the rating. Now that I've had it for a while, it's down to 6-10 hours.   Sound: I don't really have much to compare the sound to, but it sounds good to me. The sound presets are great, and it's plenty loud enough to play through my home stereo. I can't comment on the earbuds that came with the player, as they were too big for my ears- this is a problem with almost all earbuds for me, though. I ended up buying Sony's Fontopia in the ear earbuds,and those work quite well.   In the end, this has been a good player. There are better players out there now, but if you can get a good deal on this one, I would reccomend it.

<Title>Design Flaw in Headphone Adapter - Steer Clear
<Date>Mon Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content> In comparing the price of this player to others, be sure to factor in having to pay an additional $175 every 60-90 days of use.  That's how much it costs to have the headphone jack fixed by Creative.  Unless you're good with a soldering iron and don't mind fixing it yourself, this is a product to be avoided.  Sad too because it worked great for the first 60 days.  Shame on Creative for not fixing this defect free of charge.

<Title>Works Great!
<Date>Fri Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen Xtra for about 7 months now and have had almost no problems with it. I read the other reviews and I haven't had any of the same problems. I found both the player and the software easy to use. My favorite thing about my player is the EAX sound effects. You can listen to songs in fast forward or slow motion, without distorting the pitch. You can turn it on night mode which stops sudden increases in volume making it easier on your ears. The buttons and the scroller are at the sides of the player, so you avoid accedentally pressing buttons while the player is in your pocket, and it makes it much less awkward to use them. My only problem with it is the headphones, I couldn't get them to stay in my ears, so i just bought some different ones.

<Date>Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this item in May of '04 and it worked perfectly...for ninety days. I tried my very best to take care of this expensive piece of equipment and the headphone jack STILL went out on me. You're lucky if you purchase this and don't have a problem with it. Sure, in my opinion its the best MP3 player out there- that is, when it works. Luckily, I bought a 2 year protection plan on it and I'll get my money back. There's just no reason to take yhour chances on whether you'll buy one that has a faulty headphone jack- you're better off going with the more expensive Ipod, or maybe even the new Sony Network Walkman.

<Title>Great MP3 Player at a good price
<Date>Sun Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player from Amazon.com about 4 months ago, and i only have good things to say about it. It has great storage and a good design. I have used the ipod, and i prefer using this player because of how it was made for computers with windows and it allows you to play wma files (which i havent tried yet) but its nice to know you can play more than just MP3's. Also i love how it comes with a case. I know a few people with ipods, and the ones who didnt buy a case now have a very bad looking ipod. This comes with a nice (fake) leather case that protects it, and after 4 months of hard use, it still looks and works brand new. The batter has great life and i hardly ever charge it, i just leave it in my car all the time. Transferring files onto it is very fast and simple. I would recommend this player over the ipod to anybody wanting a player with lots of storage capacity at a great price. Buy it!

<Title>Best thing I've bought in a while
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am in the Navy and I bought this right before I deployed for six months. It was by far the best thing I took along with me. I don't know what I would have done without it. On a ship there is not much storage space, especially for hundreds of cd's. This fit right in my pocket or hung on my belt and was with me everywhere i went. I don't know what I would have done out there in the ocean without my music! I had no problems whatsoever, and was able to upload music from anyone that had something I liked on the ship. For those of you in the military, this is definately the toy for you! I used it often while jogging and working out, I dropped it many of times, and I have never had a problem yet. My favorite feature was the play random song because with over 200 cd's worth of music, you never know whats going to come up next. I recomend this to anyone who wants a cheaper but extremely reliable mp3 player.

<Title>The best reason not to buy an iPod
<Date>Thu Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When I first started looking for a portable jukebox, I--like everybody else--was drooling for an iPod. Then I did my research, and here's why I decided on the Zen Jukebox Xtra: (1) the iPod battery is not user-replaceable, you have to pay $60 for a two-year Apple plan in order to get it replaced, and you have to send the unit back to them to get it replaced (evidently it starts losing its charge about six months into ownership); (2) huge storage space--I have my entire CD collection on it plus a whole bunch of downloaded tracks at high quality and I've still only used half the space; (3) sound quality is fabulous, especially if you spring for a decent pair of headphones. As far as durability goes, granted I haven't passed the dreaded 90-day-warranty mark, but it goes with me trail-running daily (because of other reviews I've read, I hold it in my hand over rough spots so it doesn't get jostled too much) and in the car on long drives a few times a week. I've also dropped it from a pretty good height with no damage. My one complaint? No support for MP4. BUT...you can upgrade the firmware to be Real Player compatible (their downloads are only 49 cents) and I've found the process easily done. Good tech support as well. I just don't think there's a better value for the money.

<Title>Great product-- for a little while
<Date>Mon Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was my second Nomad Jukebox, and I should have learned after the first one.  The first was a 10GB player that I bought in June of 03.  It lasted EXACTLY 6 months before freezing up on me.  No amount of tech support would bring it back to life.  I said, well, I guess i will just spend the extra cash and get an ipod.    The low price of the Nomad 30GB seduced me.  I picked one up instead of the pod, and I loved it, for about 6 months.  Then the headphone jack stopped working.  Luckily, this time I got the service plan, so when my refund check arrives, I am off to buy... an Ipod.

<Content>I've had this guy over a year now and i'm totally satisfied with it. It has crashed a couple of times, but there is a nice little reset button that takes care of things in a flash. The software is a little klunky to say the least, too much of stuff bundled in something that's meant to be real simple!   Other than those 2 quirks, works like a gem, one of the other reviewers had concerns over durability, i think it has survived me pretty good! great features and it looks great, personally i don't like the iPod's plastic look. I much rather would have something like the Creative. Controls are great easy to get used to. A nice add on is the FM wired remote.   One thing that could have been useful is a sleep timer or something, but that's probably included in the later versions

<Content>this is by far the best deal for hard drive based mp3 players. im extremely satisfied with my purchase, its an excellent player at an amazing price. ipods are a total rip off, if you want to pay $400 for a nice case then go ahead, but you'll be getting one of the worst players on the market. a 15 gig ipod retails for $250. thats half as much memory, much lower sound quality, and a shorter battery life for $50 MORE! ridiculous! this jukebox has excellent sound quality, long battery life, huge storage, and all for less than some crappy flash based players. do some research and you'll see this is a great player. the only thing better than this is the iriver hp120, but it costs a good deal more. the fact of the matter is, if you dont care about price get an iriver, if price matters get this player!

<Content>I've had my Creative Jukebox for over 1 year and have so far had no problems with it and the review that says you can't use the Janus thing from some services might be true but you can get around that by transferring the music to your computer and then transferring to the creative.I haven't had any freeze up problems with my unit so far but I think all ipod devices freeze at some point.I've even heard about people reporting that apple ipods occassionally freeze up.The only negatives I've found with the creative jukebox is the battery life isn't that long between charges and you can't transfer video from your computer to your creative zen.I've got some game trailers on my computer that won't go to my zen it's just for music.The big plus in this product is the much cheaper price than apple and the battery is replacable.I highly recommend it.

<Title>Great player!
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, I bought this player way back in June this year, and since there were plenty of reviews of bad happenings with this player, I waited until now to submit a review.    So, this player is pretty big.  That really doesn't bother me though, I think its great, compared to the CD and cassette players of yesterday.  I bought this player because it offered the most for the cost, including the size.  Making electronics small tends to be more expensive, except TVs, unfortunately....  If size is not a big deal to you, this player is perfect.  If you want something small, maybe this one ain't so great.  I live and work on a farm, and I bought this player because I like my music, and dislike a lot of the stuff on the radio.  This unit gets a pretty good gauntlet run on it in my job: dirt, bouncing, and all the stuff you would expect.  I am not saying I don't take care of it, I just am pointing out those little things that just happen no matter how hard you try to protect it.  I have put it through a lot of that sort of thing too, and as of this time, I haven't had even a little bit of trouble.  Battery life is a big issue too, I know, and my experience is that on full blast (FM transmitter), it will run for over eight hours, probably around nine or ten, I just started a little down, and stopped a little before dead.    All in all, its a great player.

<Content>I absolutely love my Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Ztra 30 GB.  I initally had a problem because it didn't seem to hold a charge.  Fortuneately I had a pocket pc that used the same power adapter so I plugged in the unit without the battery and it worked fine.  Not the end of the world to get a working power cord.  This works with audible.com books but you first need to update the driver and firmware.  You can't create folders but can play based on genre, artist, album so forth.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a really cool gadget.  I have had the nomad jukebox zen xtra for a year and it's still just as good as the day I got it.  First of all, this player is about the same price as an ipod(depending on which product your talking about), and it has freakin 30 gigs!  That is a whole lotta songs!(for those of you who are technologically challanged)  Yes, it's true, this player is kinda big as far as most mp3 players go, but as long as it can fit in my pocket, this doesn't matter to me.  Some people have said that it is difficult to find what song you want on the player, but I figured it out in a few minutes.  It's not difficult at all.        Another thing I like about this player is the EAX audio options.  If your in a car, change the audio to CAR.  If your on a plane, change the audio to PLANE, etc.  You can also speed up the song, or slow it down(which can be quite hilarious if your listening to a rap song).  There are many other audio options that I won't go into.        The software that comes with the player is good.  Creating playlists is easy, and you can play the songs you have on your player right on the computer(but you have to put them on the computer first, of course).     One minor problem is that occasionally,(4 or 5 times ever) the player freezes up when I turn it on.  But this can be fixed quickly and easily by reseting the player.  The headphones that come with the player are a bit odd(you will have to see them to know what I mean).  But you can always buy new headphones.       This player never skips, which is cool.  I've shaken it as hard as I can and the song continues to play flawlessly.  This is great for jogging or working out with the player.     Last of all, don't listen to the reviews complaining that their players don't work.  This only happens with 1 out of a couple hundred.  I understand that they are upset, but there is no need to dis an mp3 player of which you've never seen it's full potential.    Buy this player for Christmas, Hannukah, a birthday, whatever.  You will be a happier person.

<Title>After a year Creative's Nomad still proves to be a great buy
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was given this MP3 player last Christmas and over the year it has peformed great for me, which silenced all of the doubt about this player that other reviewers spoke of. This player has some nice features such as the EAX audio, quick song or artist search, and great easy to use software. I dont really like the Media Source software much for playing audio and video on my computer, but I love using it to manage all of the music and files on my MP3 player. The only thing I can complain about as far as features is the fact that this player doesnt have an AM/FM tuner built in, which the new Creative 30GB out this year has. However, with all of the songs you can load onto this puppy, finding something to listen to wont be a problem. If you are interested more in great storage, sound and value, then check out Creative's line of MP3 players. They will definitely beat out anything that Apple has to offer.

<Title>If it does have problems, it's easy to fix yourself!
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my Nomad Zen Xtra for over two years now. I had dropped it several times without problem. One day it fell from about  18-20" and that killed the hard drive. I didn't keep it in the sleeve it came with but I do now! Since my warranty was already expired I took the chance and cracked open the case as I had found instructions online on how to swap out the hard drive. So for the fraction of the cost of a new player of any brand, I bought a new, even larger hard drive and replaced it. It was incredibly simple.   And yes, the headphone jack does come loose, but I really used mine very heavily (almost daily for 6-8 hours per day) and would remove the headphones from the socket to plug the player into my car or stereo at home. However, if you have a friend w/ a soldering iron, this is some what easy to fix too - online instructions galore.  I think it's a great player and the sound, capacity and price are far better than that of the ipod. I don't give this 5 stars because I do think the buttons are a bit clunky and not intuitive. The software that comes with this devise isn't very good, but again, for a few bucks you can get some really, really good third party software that works via Windows Explorer. And the fact that you can change your battery (I bought a spare when I was going to be travelling a lot and couldn't be sure I'd have access to recharge my battery), I can change the hard drive and I can make other repairs if necessary because I can get into the case which is not the case w/ an ipod!   I'm considering buying the newer version of this and giving my sister this one.

<Content>I've owned one of these 9 months, but about 2 months ago the power jack started getting screwy.  It basically refuses to charge unless I fiddle with it for an hour.  I opened it and it needs to be resoldered in a very hard to reach place.  I finally broke down and bought an iPod instead, and I can say for an $80 difference the change in technology is astounding (much better screen, interface, less annoying software).  I far recommend the iPod to this nowadays (at the time it was a good deal for 30 gigs)  The design is pretty ugly, it's larger than it needs to be, easy to break, the interface is irritating to use and the software is *horrible*.  However, it *is* $220 so if you can live past these problems it will get you by.

<Content>If you want a lot of storage and a basic mp3 player, this is the way to go. However, I do wish I had gone with the Ipod and plan to upgrade... but its all personal preference.  PROs ~Its not picky about file types; you can download just about anything (labeled/licensed or not) and it will play it.  This is not possible on Ipod.    ~Ease of use;  just plug and play.    ~Creative music software; this is a really convienient program and I actually use this over Windows media player.   ~Can use as a external hard drive.  I have about 15 gbs of photos stored on it.  Can't view the photos, of course, just store them.    CONs ~Somewhat heavy and bulky.  I can't workout with it.  Then again, it does have a 30 gb hard drive, so its a tradeoff.  ~The metal case.  Mine doesn't fit exactly right, and makes getting to some of the buttons difficult.    ~The battery is iffy; sometimes it doesn't hold charge.  ~Cheap headphones/case.  Overall, if style matters to you, pass on this.  If it doesn't, you will like it!    ~This might be glaringly obvious to everyone but me, but it is Windows/PC only, not compatible with Macs.

Since then I have upgraded the firmware twice much to creatives credit, including the now playforsure compatibility. It now stands as an equal to the ipod as far as portablity. Its a little bulky compared to the mp3 players available now but I'm not ready to trade up yet. My gripes are the travel case doesnt have a window so its pointless, and you'll have to buy one if you want one.  also the buttons are clumsy and the headphones are uncomfortable. as far as purchasing a new mp3 player now i would get one with the color screens and possibly video player but thats yet to be seen.

Instructions on how to use the player are vague and navigating thru the nomad can be a chore.With all the said, however, i can say that after you get used to the way it works and how to retreave your songs, it really works great. i am sure there are easier mp3 players to use out there but the quality of the music cant be beat. i am buying 3 more for my family for christmas this year

<Title>You take care of it, it takes care of you--Great Product!
<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my Nomad Jukebox since the end of June with no problems.  I was at the checkout with an iPod, watching it and all its accessories for a PC add up to nearly $600 and gulping.  Before finishing the transaction, which was rubbing me wrong anyway, I went back to the small electronics department at Best Buy and happened to run into a Creative rep, who showed me the Zen Jukebox and how to use it.  It came with everything for only $240!  The reason I hadn't seen it before is because it wasn't displayed with all the Apple products.  I'm SO glad I bought it.  It has replaced the 6 CD changer in my car because I use an old tape player adaptor with it from an old portable CD player.  I bought some Creative speakers for $50 and mounted them in my bedroom with which to use the Jukebox, so it has replaced a huge boombox I used to have in there.  I used it in the car for a 980 mile x 2 trip to Oregon and the battery never ran out.  It is a VERY GOOD PRODUCT, but you must handle it with care.  Yes, the headphone jack is a bit touchy and not great for jogging, but this is NOT A WALKMAN, this is a mini hard drive and needs to be treated with care.  AND, LAST PIECE OF ADVICE....if there is the option to buy a service plan wherever you shop, BUY IT--whether you buy a Jukebox or an iPod.  It isn't because they are destined to break, but they are delicate, and getting the service plan is just good sense, good insurance, and you'll kick yourself later if something does go wrong and you don't have one.  Happy shopping--buy the Zen Jukebox if you're money conscious.

I did have a sligh problem with the headphone jack - about 4 months after purchase.  I didnt have my recipt and I had paid in cash.  I sent my player into the tech support team with no recipt and they fixed it for free and sent it back to me at no charge in less than a week.  Great customer support which would give me great confidence in buying from Creative anytime.    I dont particulary like the software that is shiped with the player.  I dont think it is as useful as it could be.  It will not sort the songs in a particular play list by name.    But overall its a very good player and a great company.

<Title>Works well, for however long it works
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm in college and I don't have enough money for an iPod, but it would have probably been worth the extra money if i had it.  I treat my Jukebox like it cost me half a month's pay too.  It worked great for a few months, and when the headphone jack broke, I assumed it was just my bad luck.  I paid the $20 service charge because it was a few days out of the three month warranty, and went back to rocking when they returned a replacement.  Now, just out of warranty again, it stopped working completely.  I've sent it back a second time and when this is over, I will have paid at least $300 dollars total for the thing.  It works well when it works, even if you hold it while jogging or working out, but you better be prepared to pay if you want to keep it working.  Looking at the other reviews on here, I guess my case is unique, but I surely would have gone with the Dell DJ or even shelled out the beans for an iPod if I had it to do over.

<Title>If you are bouncing, don't get a hard drive based MP3 player
<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Benjamin Young's review states that he's had problems while using the Zen Xtra while working out and jogging. Well, any hard drive based MP3 player -- including the iPod -- is going to have problems if you bang it around (think what would happen if you took your laptop with you while jogging). There are memory buffers in these devices to preload content from the hard drive so that if the hard drive skips you won't hear it in the headphones. The Zen Xtra uses a laptop-sized hard drive. Smaller hard drives such as are found in the Zen Micro, Zen Touch, iPod Mini, the Rio Carbon are less prone to skipping, but they're still fragile. These jukebox models aren't really meant to be treated violently, despite what Apple's marketing might tell you.  If you're going to be bouncing around while using an MP3 player, use a flash memory based unit. They're lighter, cheaper and can take almost any amount of shock short of actually damaging the case or buttons.

<Title>excellent product for the price
<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got a NOMAD Zen Xtra 30GB and its really cool. It has worked flawlessly , without any problems for last 2 months. Software is also great to keep it in sync with ur PC. Or if u want to save space u can directly manage the mp3s on the jukebox. Battery is long-lasting, haven't tried to run it for full 14 hrs though. Have to try it out... Only thing that is missing is FM tuner and a line-in to record mp3s directly like some other expensive players have. That would have made it 5 stars. The wake to alarm feature is cool, you can wake to your favorite soothing songs, rather than a wake up beep.

<Title>Purchased 2 weeks back, not bad
<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hi, I bought one from best buy, just 2 weeks back, and have been compairing it to ipod since then. but my perticular player has some problem for adding songs to playlist, Or may be i am doing someting wrong. If i am in say Music folder, then Artist, and then Song, if I select a song and say "Add to Play List" the song does not get added to play list, and the highlighted option on the previous menu shifts one position down !!! apart from this , it is a very good player. I think the biggest disadvantage is the Size.. these things are going to get smaller and smaller , so in next 4-5 months this is going to look like the thing of 80's.. Biggest disadvantage of Ipod was If i am browsing some menu and want to reduce/increase volumn of the currently playing song..I CANT !! thats pathetic.  In this aspect Zen is much better because the volumn buttons are seperate !  the other options that zen have (and ipod does not) are just TOO cool.. like virtual sound etc (EPX settings)  I guess its a choice between saving $100 or looking cool !!  will keep compairing the 2 till zen touch or micro comes out

<Title>Could be better
<Date>Wed Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I would prefer the iPod as my child and I live a very physically active life and would like to take music with us everywhere.  But overall, if you can't afford a more expensive unit (maybe because your ex is a deadbeat parent), this unit will do.  Add it to your wishlist--a great Amazon feature--this is how my son receives gifts nowadays.  But, as in many things in life, your expectations for this product cannot *warrant* what they should.

<Title>Pretty good for the gym
<Date>Fri Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this to reward myself for 6 months of daily workouts, and I am very pleased with it. The software and user interface took a couple of tries to get used to, but now, I can sit down to my computer and rip my favorite cuts from CD (at my chosen quality level of 192) as fast as my system can process.   At the gym, I have no problem whether I am riding the bike, bouncing on the elliptical trainer, or lifting weights. I've dropped it a couple of times, but it hasn't missed a note.   Two minor points: the included earphones were useless, as I could not get them to stay in my ears. $9 at Wal-Mart bought me a great pair of Sony's  The other is that I haven't seen the battery actually go for 14 hours without charging. 9 was more like it.  Other than that, I have been very happy with my Zen Nomad.
