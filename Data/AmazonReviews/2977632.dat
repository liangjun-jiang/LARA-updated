<Title>Upgrade from Micro Zen
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First let me say this, no subscription service Apple, no dice.  I want a choice and ITunes does not cut it.  I really don't care how "popular" and "cool" it is to have an Ipod.  I owned one and after using subscription music services I won't go back.  I have used my Zen Micro with Napster and Yahoo Music Service, both are excellent.    Decided to upgrade to the new Vision:M and I must say Creative has done a wonderful job.  The user interface is improved, mostly due to a larger color screen.  All 4 buttons are now real buttons, not a touch pad.  They also added Forward and Reverse buttons on the side of the scroll bar.  Addition of accessory port on the bottom is a huge plus, even though there are not many devices yet.  Battery life is very much improved, watched 2 hour video and listened to 3 hours of WMA protected files and still had half the battery life.    Software could be improved, Creative needs an all in one solution.  I had to use third party programs to download album art and convert video for the player.    Video looked great.  On the down side, dongle required for USB and charger.  There should be more accessories available in a few more months and I would like to see better cable options for video and audio output.

<Title>Great Player, A good choice.
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>  I would first off love to say that I respect apple and the ipods are great. But, when a better product comes along lose the fanboyish attitude and open your eyes. THough its all based on opinion. Anyway the Zen vision:m is an amazing player. Its got a beautiful screen and amazing video quality. The navigation system is quite interesting and takes a couple of days to master. Its touch pad is sensitive making scrolling easy. ALso in my opinion its a sleek player. The smooth black with the white backplate is elegant. Also, the blue lit buttons add to the effect. The earbuds were comfortable and the audio quality and the amount of sound impresses me. It is bigger than a 60g ipod but I have become used to the feel of 3rd generation ipods and this one feels comfortable in my hand. The software was basic enough and I found it easy to use. Also what I like about this player is the ability to set backrounds. I don't know if the ipod does it but this is one of those little features that I have come to love.   A note to those who like to make the ipod and non-ipod arguments like its life and death. Calm down creative has been making jukebox ipods before apple and ironiclly holds the patent for the touch technology for the two. Also there mp3 players generally recieve positive reveiws. Its all opinion, this is a place to review not to bash things.

<Title>Wonderful except for the touch pad
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After having done about 20 hours of Internet research and then going to a vairety of electronic stores, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision M (Black) because of its features and sound clarity. This is my first MP3/Multimedia device, and I am amazed with how easy it is to "rip" CD's and video. I strongly recommend this one for beginners because its variety of  features, including using it as a "flash drive".  The video playback is as good as any newer computer monitor or the handheld TVs which have recently come on the market. It is much better than the Portable Play Station.  However, and here is why I gave it 4 stars, the touch pad and button controls are extremely hard to get used to. The first thing a new user needs to do is change the sensitivity from "high" to "low". This is no easy feat because the instruction booklet, at least the English version that I got here in Tokyo, does not do a good job at all of explaining how to use the pad. It was very annoying and frustrating to learn that to go from the vertical menus to the horizontal menus that I did not need to tap the pad, just glide my finger over to the left or right. Even now, I have not figured out how to use the keyboard to input my name into the owner information.  Honestly, Creative could have come up with a much better designed touch pad and button system. If this were a first generation MP3, or if touch pads were a new item, this one's problems would be acceptable; however, since this is not a first generation concept, what were they thinking?   I asked a few friends and family members to try it out and they said they would not purchase it until the touch pad is improved.  For me, and I am the principle user, I hope that I will get used to it and figure out how to use it. In the meantime, I'll just do without using the keyboard.  Of course, I must learn how to navigate between menus.    The touch pad aside, the battery life, the picture and sound quality, the voice recorder, the FM radio, the organizer, and the really easy way to load music and video make this a pretty good product.

<Content>I just bought one for my brother in France. It is really cool! Smart screen and amazing video quality. But some concern comes to the adapter. As Amazon's description says, 'Power Adapter with 2 interchangable plugs'. But there is only one US plug in my box. I thought there should be another EU plug. Have I missed sth or I got this missing-part box from amazon unluckily? Feel free to contact me kangtong61@gmail.com

<Title>The Amazing Mp3/Video player 
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an amazing gadget. After waiting for more than a month, (I just got it today) I couldn't believe how innovative this toy is. Indeed great things come to those who wait. 262K Screen, beautiful if you see it for yourself. You can view photos while listening to your music, which has great sound quality. And the customizable wallpaper is an awesome extra. Support to multiple video format is fantastic. And I won't get stuck to using iTunes.  I just had to adjust on how to handle the touchpad, quite annoying at first but you can adjust to it pretty quickly. This is not even available in our country yet, and Ipods are abundant here but the only reason they are selling better is due to the good marketing strategy of Apple. Well, I'm a smart buyer and I won't buy to marketing alone. Overall, regardless of the minor issues, this is a great buy. Try it. Ipod is great too, but this one's greater!

<Title>Great player but set touchpad sensitivity to low
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This a great player.  Buyers might be put off by the touchpad the Zen uses because its so unwieldy to use at first but just know its the same technology laptops use with their touchpads except this one is shaped like an oval that's up on its end.  But as another review mentioned, one of the first things you should do is change the sensitivity of the touchpad to 'low'.  A touchpad on **normal** sensitivity setting is great for navigating a big laptop screen but for the Zen's relatively tiny screen (great screen btw) you'll be all over the place.  But trust me once you buy this player, one of the first things you should do is to set the sensitivity of the touchpad to low.  Everything I've tried with this mp3 player is great, good interface, fast, long battery life, the Zen is just very well designed.  Although the interface/buttons on the player are good, there is a little bit of a learning curve to figure out what all the buttons do but with some practice and consulting the user manual (which is kind of meh in my opinion), it can be mastered in a few hours.  BTW, don't get the Toshiba Gigabeat mp3 player.  Its a total piece of crap compared to this.  I bought the Gigabeat, found out it **couldn't** play mp3's compressed at 64kbs, 44khz (even though the product description AND the user manual says it can).  I'm returning that POS.  But the silver lining is that I would have never discovered the Zen if I hadn't tried out the sorry Gigabeat.

<Title>I love this MP3 player
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research before I ended up buying the creative zen vision m.  After my research it came between the iaudio and the zen vision m. I didn't even consider the ipod video since these two players had better video quality play back then the ipod video.  They also had more features and more formats when it came to video.   I ended up getting the zen vision m because for 30 bucks more I thought it was great having the extras.  The audio is great, and video playback is great.  What I love the most about it is that I can click and drag my video files into my zen vision m not having to convert it first.  The only thing is that I wish battery would last longer.  I've read reviews that made the zen vision m seem really big, but in all honesty it is bigger than the ipod video but it can easily fit in your pocket.

<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M is an excellent player.  I prefer Windows Media Player to iTunes, so I'm glad there is an alternative to Apple.  The Creative software that comes with the player is very good for those people not in love with Windows Media Player.  The sound and video is of the best quality I've seen in any player.  The controls and usability are of the greatest design. I highly recommend the Zen Vision:M

<Title>Same as iPod, but more versatile
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a 60GB Ipod video for x-mas, and almost opened it, until I read that this was coming down the pike. After a bit of inverstigating, I realized, that I would be spending a lot of time converting video to have it run on the Ipod, but that wouldn't be the case with the Vision:M.  To get video from my Tivo to my Vision:M is a breeze. Only 1 very quick conversion is needed using DirectShow Dump (about 2-3 minutes per 1/2 hour of video) to strip the Tivo code and leave a plain MPEG-2 file that can be viewed on the device.  The screen is phenomenal. It's why I got this instead of the original Zen Vision (I wanted the bigger screen, but heard lots of bad things about the Zen Vision's screen).  Album art works pretty well, but not great.  The headphones, I thought, were pretty darn good, but I upgraded anyway b/c I had the $$$ available.  It's does everything I wanted/needed a device like this to do. I have a few complaints though:  - THERE ARE NO ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR THIS THING!!!! - 30GB goes quickly with 192kbps MP3 files, and video and pictures. - some videos build audio sync problem as time progresses, but this is easily corrected with a quick Pause/Play. - it scratches just as easily as the Ipod, so do yourself a favor and order an Invisible Shield at the same time. - the little adapter is a bit of a pain as I'm probably going to have to order at least one more to be my "travel adapter".

<Title>Wish I'd bought a video Ipod
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Vision:M is a decent little player - except for the "little" part.  30GB for a video/mp3 unit is not enough, especially when the Video IPOD offers 60GB - 2x the drive space - for $50 more.  After loading my average size song collection of 15GB, my Vision M has only enough room for about 2 - 3 hours of MPEG-2 (TIVO) video.     Creative would have been better off leaving out the seldom used FM and digital dictation functionality, and putting a properly sized hard drive to serve the core MP3/Video purpose.

<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Allright, I don't normally review things I buy, but I think the purchase of a good music player is important to everyone's mental health so I'll consider this my good deed to the world for the day...BUY THIS THING!  Everybody is looking for different things in their mp3 players.  Here is my situation - I decided to switch from minidisc to mp3 because I have a huge music collection and I wanted to be able to take it all with me wherever I go.  I was one button click away from buying a 30 gb ipod when I saw this online and researched it.  I have had it for a couple weeks now.  I'll make it simple since there are lots of reviews on here already:  -the most important things to me are sound quality, battery life and overall quality, which is why I chose this over ipod.  I tried out some ipods and the Creative killed the ipod in all of those things.  I bought some decent headphones and the sound quality on this thing is INCREDIBLE, I am a musician and my life has now been blessed with new listening experiences daily.  The battery life is great and I have watched full videos and music and photos (I put 10,000 of my digital photos on it as well as 22 gigs of music).  The overall quality is great, it feels well built and the screen is simply amazing. I haven't encountered much scratching at all but who cares about that outside of the screen?  Just cover the screen with a little screen protecter you can buy anywhere and you are fine.   I am also easily putting podcasts on here and you can use any podcasting service if you link it to the zencast software that comes with it!  The downfalls I have encountered have to do with the occasional difficulty I have tranferring everything the right way from one place.  I am able to get EVERYTHING and every video and song format I want on the player (including Quicktime files) but sometimes I have to try the different softwares that come with the player...there isn't one central place to do everything.  I am going to try to do everything from Windows Media Player now cuz I hear that's the way to go. In general, it just takes some patience to figure out the software and controls.  I continue to laugh at all the ipod owners jumping on here and smearing the Creative Vision, but I have to admit that if I had dropped all that cash and got sucked into Apple's trap, I would be pretty angry myself after seeing this come out.  With this player I have full freedom and consider it an extension of all the files on my computer and subscription services, rather than only what I can pull through itunes.  I have no problem with the size and I take it skiing with me.   The bottom line is it's a sweet player, great quality, with the player's positives much outweighing its negatives.   It has so many little details and options, making it that much more fun than what ipod has to offer.

<Title>Spiffy gadget
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was actually waiting for the pink one to be released, but I couldn't wait to get my hands on this, so I went with the black one. It didn't disappoint me at all. The video quality is really quite astounding. I was worried that movie subtitles would be hard to read, but that isn't the case at all. The sound quality is pretty good, though I don't know how everyone else rates it--some are satisfied, others seek something better. Since I'm not really looking for super crystal-clear audio--as long as it doesn't sound crackly or like it came from the bottom of a well, it's all fine by me.  I don't know why some people have issues with its thickness and like to compare it to the thinner iPod, but it's a nice and light little thing, in my opinion. I've tinkered with some Creative players before and always found the touchpad a bit fiddly, but it's really all right once you get used to it.   I've also checked out the reviews and saw that some people have had issues with the software. Perhaps I'm just easily pleased, but I had no problems with transferring data or media to my player, and I can even transfer my stuff without installing the software.   And yes, to corroborate earlier reviews, I have also had some problems with the earphones, since they don't stay in my ear very well. I'm not sure however if this problem applies to everyone. The shiny surface also tends to scratch easily (I kept my player in the included pouch and it still got some scratches), so it would be really cool if something like the iSkin were developed for the Zen Vision:M.  Overall, this is a pretty nice gadget, guaranteed to keep you entertained for a long time as well as turn some heads.  Edit: Ah, it seems I was lucky to have bought this player early on, since I got it with the included AC adapter. I've been using this player pretty consistently and I must say I STILL don't have major problems with it, apart from a fairly slow start-up, and for some reason, the clock sometimes resets to a different time, so I have to adjust it all over again. Also, it froze on me once, and that was around four months ago. And that's about all the wrong I've found with it after six months of use.

<Title>This thing is fantastic.  It's not hype.
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, so I've had this thing for a month now.  I've got the hang of it and I'm impressed.  Here's the deal...  I looked for about 2 weeks researching every possible mp3 player out there.  I looked at Ipod, I looked at Creative products, Philips, ect.  I decided on the Creative Zen: M.  I'm not sorry.  I'm in Iraq and since I'm not home I can't speak for the way Ipods act back home.  But I can say that almost EVERYONE over here has an Ipod due to having absolutely nothing to do on down time.  The sand is just eating these Ipods up.  EVERYONE's Ipod freezes up, they have to clear them out, or they just stay frozen.  I've heard (just a rumor) Ipods' customer service on the phone is 49.95.  I just didn't have the scratch to risk having them refer me to their website for almost 50 bucks.  I read all the reviews and here's what i get: Ipod vs. Zen pros and cons the thing is the pros of Ipods are rediculous More stylish, more popular, the wheel thing, itunes (not a pro in my book), wow, allow me to catch my breath. Is this all? Zen pros 14 hr battery life, 10 hrs voice recording (very nice for putting comments or stories on cd's), awesome music management software (not exclusive to one format), (if style is an issue) 5 colors to choose from, video playback is awesome (also a pantload of formats for compatibilities sake), theinvisibleshield.com offers a film that's just unreal to protect the screen (Ipod too) I say dodge the Ipod like the plague(sp?) because people are just not happy with them.  If you think I'm biased that's ok, but Ipod owners told me not to get one. Buy one, the product speaks for itself.  Creative's track record is pretty good too.  They've owned the CES show for a while now with Best In Show products.  Zen: M was this year's, and for good reason. Peace.

<Title>Hands down the best
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all [i] was sucked into buying an ipod (the fourth generation click wheel) and loved it. I used limewire for a while(it was illegal though), but when i got a new computer i decided to stop and use iTunes. Well to say the least iTunes has a TON of songs, but i hated the fact that there was other music stores that didnt charge .99 cents a download. So that was the major facor into me deciding to switch to a new mp3 player. Basically all the kids in my school have an ipod video or an ipod mini, so you know i kind of wanted to be different. So i did some research and stumbled upon this CNET thing on the best new mp3 player and the vision M was there. Now the first thing that came to my mind was the fact that it looked similar to an iPod, but after i did my research I realized that it was far from it. The PROS: Best screen quality for videos- has something like 265,000 colours while the ipod has 64,000. Also you can change between 6 different backgrounds, which is a small but yet cool feature.  Long Battery Life- I used to charge my iPod every night but with the Zen I only charge for two and a half hours every two or three days, which is great if I forget to charge it one night i dont really have to worry about "Is it going to die on me" factor. By the way its amazing because you can plug it in for around 45 minutes to charge and its halfway full when you pull it out. 2-2 1/2 hours to charge fully.  Controls- I peronally love the layout of the buttons and ill exlplain them to you too. The one on the upper left with the arrow touching the dot is your "short cut" button. What that means is you can set it to on your setting and set it to bring you to a certain page in you player ( I set it to "Artists") so that when you are listening to a song and dont want to go back you just press that button and BAM you are there. The button underneath it is the back button which is just to go back. The button on the top right is the Play/Pause button, and the one on the bottom right is the small menue type button. You can use this to delete a track from you player(+)at any time. The controls are pretty basic to get used to, I picked them up in around ten to fifteen minutes. By the way on the long touchpad button there is to little small buttons to the left and right that is the Forward and Back buttons used to cycle through songs.  Navigation- When you are in any of the sub folders for music you can hit the side button next to your touch pad and access a small side bar that has all of the letter in the alphabet. You just scroll down with the touchpad while it brings you the beginning section that starts with that letter. Which save you all the time of scrolling through thousands of songs.  Video- I used windows media player to transfer music videos onto there and it transfered in about 10 seconds for a 3 minute video.   Programs- I use Window Media Player to transfer songs, which is basically like a more advanced version of iTunes, and its pretty easy to get used to.  Sound- Better than the iPods in my opinion. I played the exact same copy of a song on my ipod and on my zen at the same time with a different headphone in each ear (the song opened wiht a slow but loud drumming) and the zen beat it by a mile. To describe the sound its  basically like your watching T.V in a way its sort of all around you and right next to you.  Size- I don't see why everybody is complaing about the size. its basically about the size of the 40g 4G ipod. It feels comfortable in your hand. The front is pretty scratch worthy, but not too bad. I ordered an invisible shield from www.shieldzone.com and i could rub a coin all over it and just wipe it off and it looks brand new. The best part is you dont need to worry about the back getting scratched up because its like a sand blasted back. On the back the zen logo is indented with a ripple effect which adds some nice touch. Here is a website that shows a comparison to the ipod video (but if youve ever held an ipod video in your hand they feel somewhat uncomfortable, the zen feels sturdy but light) (...)  THE CONS- Album art- O.K i have strived to get the album art onto the Zen but to me its literally impossible. Its not like itunes where you can just copy and paste a picture from amazon if you dont have it. I went to creatives online support and followed the instructions, which include, deleting a hidden folder on you zen, saving the picture, resizing it, import it, open it and choose the cover style. Its just crazy for creative to do everything practically perfect and screw up on a small thing like album art  Customer Support: Not really part of the zen but I called the technical support (for the album art)and i had to wait on the phone for 45 minutes, which is far from reasonable for a technical support (all the while listening to some sort of Japanese techno) and when the guy answers he reads me the thing from the website and says hes not to familiar with the vision M. So i called again (another 45 minutes) and the lady sends me a software up date for the wrong player. So i call back again (40 minutes) and now im really mad, and that lady puts me on hold and talks to her supervisors about how to do it and just redirects me to the online website which didnt even help me in the first place. So you get the picture on why the technical support stinks.  Forgot to add i subscribed to Rhapsody for 15 dollars a month and now have unlimited downloads ande everything so that made this purchase all the more worth while. All in all the Zen is a great produc, and in my opinion kills the iPod video. BY THE WAY IF YOU DONT HAVE WINDOWS XP DONT BUY THE VISION M BECAUSE IT WONT WORK ON ANYTHING ELSE. Just wanted to let you guys know how much I love this little gadget

<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a techie geek, and I rush out to buy the latest gadgets.   Here are my observations about the Zen Vision:M  30GB  Positive +  It probably IS better than the video iPod overall.  It has twice the video battery rating, and it supports many more video and song formats than the ipod.  Also, it is Windows SurePlay compatible, so just about any online mp3 store's files will work on this thing.    +  it supports many video types including my home mpeg2 and avi videos from my home movies.  +  EXCELLENT customer support at Creative.  I had a couple technical questions and they were very attentative and gave individual care.   (I dont have experience with Apple's service)  +  Years from now, youll be glad you have this device, vs an ipod..  because once you buy an iPod and iTunes files...  youre STUCK using an iPod for the rest of your life to play those files.   Stay away from proprietary products if at all possible...  so those thousands of music files you have from Itunes, will ONLY play on Ipods...  youre locked in.  Negative -  I'm dissapointed there arent ANY accessories out for this thing yet, besides the basics like charger, battery, a/v cables.  I would like to see some of the cool accessories the iPod has.  -  it's a little pricey and costs MORE than a Video iPod.  For the extra money, they shoudl throw in the a/v cable to connect the Zen to y a tv or home stereo.  -  As far as useage, the only frustrating thing about the Zen is the scroll button....  its way to sensitive, even on the lowest setting...   it gets easier with practice, but I still occasionally hit the wrong button or select the wrong song, because of the scrolling feature.  Overall, its a good product and I have no regrets.

<Title>Good Grief
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Simply put, this device is amazing. Before buying, I read dozens of reviews from users and tech sites and tested out friends ipod videos. And still, when I got my hands on the Zen Visoin M, I was amazed at the picture quality, radio performance, ease of use, sound quality, album art display...good grief....it is just an amazing product. Yes, there are minor annoyances (such as black version collects fingerprints like crazy), but overall it is well worth your money. 95% of you will be super satisfied with this product. I sure am.

<Title>Why this rocks the ipod...
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Man. Where to start. Reasons why the zen rocks the ipod. 1)the color screen is simply AMAZING. 2)all high quality movies gotten off bittorrent are 90%  divx and xvid. meaning you dont have to go through the  demeaning process of converting videos. 3)And for the ipod, if you do convert your videos, they are restricted (quality wise) to the point that apple forces you to buy their videos off itunes to avoid stabbing yourself. 4)Battery life. Conpared to the Original Zen PMC (12 hours of video life!) the zen sucks. But against its current opponent, the ipod, the zen wins by 2 hours. Thats one more movie/4 more episodes of family guy. 5)The shortcut button is an excellent idea.  P.S. Sadly the only reason people find the ipod as a excellent mp3 player is that apple advertises the hell out of it. The ipod is actually a good mp3 player, it just isn't excellent like all of apple's herd of sheep think it is...

<Title>Why Would You Buy An iPod???
<Date>Sat Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Simply put, this is the PERFECT device for users of music subscription services like Napster to Go and Yahoo Music Ulimited.  For subscription support alone, this device is the hands-down winner versus the iPod.  At less than $10/month, you have access to over 1M tracks, versus $0.99/song with iTunes.  Game Over!

<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As far as storage space is concerned, the iPod is a better bang for your buck. While Creative claims to have a 15,000-song capacity, it is making this claim based on a 64kbps audio file. I don't know of anyone who has a file lower in quality than at 128kbps file. Apple is up front about their capacity. For their 30-gigabyte iPod, they claim 7500 songs at 128kbps (to get 15000 you need the 60gb, something Creative doesn't offer). Your Creative player would have the same capacity since it also has a 30-gigabyte drive. Cost: $299 for a 30gb Video iPod or $329.99 for a 30gb Creative Zen Vision: M. Take your pick.       to clear that up  it holds 15000 128kb WMA files, which are evedently half the quality of mp3, but i can tell no difference.

<Title>BETTER Than IPOD by far
<Date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's see..., you can get the Ipod for "less" because it doesn't come w/ the AC adaptor($40),the integrated FM radio($30+),a pouch and other stuff included with the Creative Zen Vision. It also supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. The quality and feel of the Creative Zen Video are better, not cheap, it is sturdy. You can record directly from the  integrated FM radio. 32 station presets let you switch stations whenever you want. You can also select from a myriad of online music stores - Napster To Go, Yahoo! Music Unlimited, Rhapsody To Go, and many more. With PlaysForSure support, you will always be able to play any digital music you purchase. You can even download your favorite TV shows.  ZEN VISION:M supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. Ipods are for people that get things because everyone has them, not because they do quality research. The battery last longer on the creative and it is replaceable, on the Ipod after 18 month you have to send it back to them and have it replaced and pay over $150. If you want an excellent quality product, go with this one. They had started to come down on price (I got my for $289 here)and you don't have to spend money on extra stuff already included. Do research, Creative had been around for many years and they had won many awards for their MP3 quality products, Including this one.

<Content>Had the player for a few weeks and love it.  You cannot beat the clear videos.  I bought mines in Baby Blue and get stopped everywhere with people asking me questions.  The only complaint I have is the album pictures, but I keep it in my pocket while listening to music so it's not a major problem.  Don't fall with the majority (IPOD), be an original and get something that's worth the money.

<Title>Better than I thought
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recently bought this player and i have to admit it is much better than i thought it would be. I know it's lame to compare everything to Ipod but since it is the most popular player i will compare it to Ipod. Sound - way better than ipod (Creative have more experience with sound than Apple do) . Battery - lasts twice as long as Ipod (this is why it's thicker than Ipod). Screen - resolution is four times higher than on ipod 5G. Video Formats - supports Divx and Xvid  among others, unlike Ipod where Apple force you to use their stupid mpeg4 format. Interface - same. Navigation - once you get used to the touchpad, it's fine In my opinion these are the most important things to compare. i also noticed that the price for this player has just dropped down to $300.00. GREAT PLAYER!!!!!

<Title>Nice, solid player
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros:   --Great capacity and media abilities --Stable environment --Good controls (takes a little while to get used to but very flexible once you do) --Easy software as well as many software options (not limited to iTunes) --Reasonable battery life (8+ hrs. just playing music) --Very crips, clear display --Excellent sound and flexible audio controls --Shortcut button is customizeable Cons:   --Screen scratches and smudges easily --Lack of accessories --Proprietary charger/USB interface (also meaning you can't charge in the car until they make such an accessory)  I use my Vision:M daily in an industrial environment and have even dropped it twice, but it did not even stop playing.  I purchased a "Marware SportSuit Sleeve" (says it will fit all iPods including new 3G iPods but easily fits the Vision:M) and it is a great case for those who will use thier player in a variety of conditions as it has padded sides and plastic inserts for impact protection, repels water, and has a removeable belt clip.  The only downer to the SportSuit is the headphone jack location, but the flap closure is flexible and can easily be secured by going around that once your headphones are plugged in.  All in all I am very pleased with my Vision:M and highly recommend it.

<Title>Truly amazed!
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Vision:M for about 2 weeks now and I can't get enough of it.  The first time I turned it on, it had a crisp, colorful, and bright screen.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how bright the screen was at only 50% brightness.  So far, I have 2 complete movies, 4 episodes of my favorite show, hundreds of songs on it and I'm not even close to filling up the disk space.  I use my Vision:M at the gym almost daily and it's kind of fun seeing people next to me on the treadmill look over and their eyes widen a bit when they realize I'm watching a movie.  Sound quality is more than you can ask for with its customizable EQ.  Battery life is great.  Like I said, I watch movies on it frequently and so far, I've watched 2 full movies without having to recharge it.  Only thing that can bum me out (but not much) is that it already went down in price.  I bought it for $329, and now it's at $299.    As time goes by, more accessories will be available.  I'm sure of it.  Accessories I plan to buy as they become available:   -A/V cable (to connect and view media on TV)   -iRiver fm transmitter (heard good reviews on Amazon.com) Accessories that I've purchased already:   -Boxwave Flexiskin case (silicone case that fits well)   -Boxwave screen protector (doesn't completely cover the front and sides, but combined with the Flexiskin, does its job well)  All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this product.  iPod who?

<Title>Another reason to want the Creative Vision: M
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is awesome! Sure it's bigger than an Ipod, but in this case, Bigger IS better...  There's even more reason to love this thing, the price.  I usually buy from Amazon.com, but found a promotional code from another source and was able to purchase this for $249, no tax, free delivery! For that price, there is NOTHING out there which can touch it.  The only recommendation I have is to pair this thing with a some Sennheiser PX100 headphones. You don't know what you are missing until you do...  Get this thing while it's in stock. Many places don't have it on hand!  PS - Do yourself a favor and download Total Video Converter ver 2.52. Free for 15 days of use and it converts EVERY format, including flash and shockwave video (GoogleVideo & YouTube) into ANY format you want, including Ipod! You will be thanking me!!!  PSS - http://home.comcast.net/~othastar/Music.html = TONS of music videos already converted to MP4. ENJOY!!!

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great looks, great sound, great software. It can take any video file you try to put it, even if you have to convert it with the included software, unlike the other big named mp3/video player. I have seen the ipod video and was shocked when i saw the menus. No images, no color, no nothing, just simple text with the options. Zen Vision:M at that aspect is 10000x better looking with it's wallpapers, decorated menus etc (for those that say the ipod is much better looking than the Zen). I'm very glad i bought this one, unfortunately it was only available in black, which is where it comes it's biggest problem. The Scratches!! i can say i couldn't be more careful with it, and yet its all scretched up. No big deal if you're looking at it turned on, because you can't notice them with all the beautiful colors of the screen. it's when it's off that you can see it. The other negative point (and i really can only find 2) is that against the sun, you can't see the screen very well. maybe i should tinger with the brightness level, since it's at 50% as it came from factory.   Overall it's one hell of a good player (music/photos/video). Every friend that i showed it to, was amazed with the quality of the screen and the movies.

<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent product and great alternative to Ipod. Ipod's are "horrible" for licensing. The Creative product works great with all media except Apple's, of course. Great menu and controls. Fantastic playback ability and picture quality (brightness, contrast etc.) Took a little while getting used to the slide bar, but much better control that the ZEN touch, my previous media player. Battery life is pretty much what they report. Accessories are starting to catch up as well. The screen scratches easily, but I hear this is the case for all players. The case included with the device is on the cheap side...looks like something a 13 year old Dungeons and Dragons player would carry around.  Biggest shortcoming is the inability to check file sizes in a Windows explorer type window. I've used up 28GB and can't figure out what's takin the space without wiping out and recopying the device.

<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Zen Vision: M in order to replace a Sony PSP which I was only using for music.  I was going to get an iPod until I saw that the Zen Vision:M had received the Best in Show award for the Consumer Electronics Show.  Not knowing enough about technology to rate the specs myself I relied on that rating.   Overall I am happy with it.  What I like the best is that the Zen Vision does not inhabit your computer like iPod.  I don't have any unintended software popping up because the Zen software was installed.  Loading music , pictures and videos is simple enough and it's easy to control which files do and don't get loaded.  With my daughter's iPod, MP3s get loeaded automatically which they don't want.   The only thing I'm not as happy with is the control pad.  It's not as intuitive and user friendly as iPods.  Once you get use to it, it's easy enough but I still like iPod's control touch better. Overall, B+.

<Title>In a Zen-Like Place
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Zen on 2/9/06 and have been extremely pleased thus far.  I would give it 5 of 5 stars, except that I have not had it long enough to truly test its durability.  If I haven't broken it in a year, I will concede the last star ;)  Good: + Works flawlessly with subscription services.  Unlimited downloads for $15 per month beats other pay-per-song services hands down.   + Easy software interface, easy to rip, store, move, and create play lists from your media. + It seems very durable (I've dropped it once).  + Software interface structure is fairly configurable.   + I've downloaded photos but no videos yet.  Visual quality is pretty good given the size of the screen.   + Excellent sound quality from the audio mini-jack.   + Sounds fabulous in my truck - I hooked it directly into my head unit by buying an IP Bus cable (for my deck) and an RCA to mini-jack cable.  The result is awesome static free listening.  Bad: + Software is included, but very average compared to others. + When ripping CD's, you cannot play the tune to hear if it's one you really want, so you have to keep another "media" player open. + Music is not sortable by anything other than artist, which is clunky - however, you can use Media Player to rip and synch. + The included ear bud headphones are awful, although maybe it's just my ears - be prepared to buy your own.   + The touchpad slider is a royal pain to operate - after a month, I still haven't mastered it.  + It comes with a "flannel-like" pouch that will protect it, but is not conducive to easy use.   + At date of purchase, Amazon did not carry a compatible case.  None of the "mall-type" electronics stores carried anything to fit it either, but I was able to find one via an Internet search for about $30.   + The owner's manual is pretty weak (very basic), but after a few hours, I had most of the features figured out.     In all, I am very happy I went this route and would recommend the product to anyone who is looking for this type of player.

<Title>My honest opinion...
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't worry, I'm not a nine year old who just got this and just thinks it's awesome. I'm almost 13 and know more about computers than most adults. Music is my life, I love it. And I wanted the best mp3/video player out there. I didn't really want an iPod; I heard the battery isn't that great and it felt really wide and too think in my hand. Anyways, everything about this mp3 player is great. It looks pretty ugly in the picture, but looks better in person. The screen is great, I love watching movies on it. It is kinda bulky, but I don't mind much, especially while I'm watching Law & Order. The only reason why I'd ever get an iPod is to download all of the Law & Order episodes easily. My pictures look great and the music is awesome. I use Napster, and it's all quite easy to use. I've even been able to put album art on it using Windows Media Player. For the tech geek, this is a must-have. The only thing I don't like is how easily it gets scratched. It's horrible. But you can't notice them while you're watching something. Hopefully, ZENcast will start soon, then I'd be set.

<Title>Best Mp3 Player! Video Ipod Killer
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Best Mp3 player on the Market!  Yes it does look similiar to the video ipod and a little thick but its got WAY more feature than the Ipod.  Do you really think they designed, developed, and put this into production all since the launch of the 5G iPod.   Clearly they have been working on this for quite some time and I doubt all you Apple fanboys will give Creative the credit of being, well, creative enough to steal Apples design before it was released.  -- The screen is just awesome, Ipods screen looks Washed out and its only 65k colors compared to the Creative Zen Vision M 256k colors. Thats a Big Difference!  -- Its only .3inch thick. Its not that thick, its an average DAP thickness - the iPod is just anorexic, almost too thin to be comofortable/natural/ergonomic.   -- The battery life is definitely better than the ipod. 4hrs compared to 1.5hrs in a video ipod! One of the reasons why its a little thick.    -- Well Lets look at this the video ipod 30GB is $299 but do you get an FM tuner? Voice Recorder? Power adapter charger (not the USB cable charger)? Pouch?  -- If you add all that, it will be more than $399 and the Creative Zen Vision M comes with all that.   -- The creative definitely does not feel like cheap plastic, Its really well built and Solid!  -- Lets compare the video features Creative video playback easily handles MPEG, DivX, XviD, WMV9, and Motion-JPEG. Ipod is limited to Quicktime and Mp4  -- Supports Tivo To GO! Ohh Yea!  --Light-up Buttons  -- Organizer syncs with outlook > Calendar, Contact, Task list On the Go!

<Title>Best mp3/Video Player Out There!!!
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i'll keep this short and just explain what i like and don't like about the Creative Zen Vision:M 30GB mp3 and video player.  what i like: ~~it has great color display, more than the video ipod. ~~video quality looks excellent, even with small subtitles, you can see everything perfectly. ~~i like the fact that it actually plays mp3s, and not the proprietary formats that ipod converts to. (important because you can use your zen vision:m as a flash drive for importing and exporting videos, pictures, and mp3/wma) ~~IT PLAYS DIVX!!! i watch a lot of anime and other TV shows, so it was very important that it plays divx formats (avi), and it does.  and it also plays windows media video (wmv).  where the video ipod requires you to convert these formats to mp4 or quicktime movie files (they suck!). ~~and for any other audio formats or video formats it doesn't support, the software it comes with allows you to convert it into a playable format, such as converting audio to mp3 or video into wmv formats to be playable on your player. ~~battery life on the zen vision:m is great.  roughly 2.5 hrs of video and 14 hrs of audio. ~~has the fm tuner, voice recorder on it, and displays still pictures.  not much to say about those features, other than the zen vision:m does a good job with it.  what i don't like: ~~some picture displays are pixelated. ~~the wheel on the ipod is a lot better for searching through music and video files. ~~a little bulkier than the video ipod. ~~organizing playlists and searching through files can be somewhat troublesome, but not really a big issue. ~~lack of accessories available for purchase for the zen vision:m, but not directly related to the playability of the zen vision:m.  ...so that's it.  my quick review of the Creative Zen Vision:M mp3/video player.  and my recommendation: GET IT!!!  you won't regret it, i know i haven't.  as you can see from my review, the pros far outweigh the cons, and it's just an overall excellent player.  well, i hope this has been helpful.  and good luck with your Zen Vision:M player purchase.

<Title>Not a massacre, but gives the Video iPod its 1st loss (albeit split decision)
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this device a couple weeks ago and have been very happy with it.  I have not yet exhausted the battery, with moderate to heavy use from full charge.  The video quality is VERY good - at 2.5 inches, you'd be hard pressed to find anything better.  The breadth of formats available for video is spectacular.  If you try to pop something on it that is not compatible, it will attempt to auto convert.  Here's where the first chink in the armour is found - conversion takes FOREVER!  Not that conversion is a simple process, but it does take significantly longer than external conversion applications.  This is price we pay for convenience I suppose.  Audio quality is very good, I would suggest that you purchase a decent pair of headphones to replace the buds included in the package - they are no more than sufficient.  Accessories are not redily available yet, but they are out there for the diligent searchers.  I have not used the microphone functionality, and I doubt I ever will; so I have no comment to make to its viability.  The controls consist of a touch pad style scroll pad, with left-right momentary contact buttons, and four other buttons.  There is a great feature here that you don't find elsewhere - one user customizable button which you can set to any function available from menus.  If you want to Randomize All Tracks at the push of a finger, set it to that feature.  If you need to see videos right now, you can set that too.  The tactile buttons are very responsive and feel solid - a lot more useful than the kludgy pressure sensitive ones on prior Creative players.  The software for adding and removing files is pretty good - iTunes is better, but it's not a runaway.  The one thing that almost was enough to shave off the fifth star - there's a dongle to recharge/transfer/connect to external vid.  I hate dongles.  No dock, just a little dongle that I am sure I will lose.  I can get over it, but it does not make me giddy with delight either.  Using this device for heavy bouncing activities - running/jogging - may be less than spectacular.  It's a hard drive, not solid state.  I lift weights, bike, and treadmill/stairstep machine with it, mostly without incident, but running might leave you underwhelmed (have not really even tried, but occasional bumps lag it.)  That's what you get for this capacity, so I don't fault it for that.  Overall: GREAT device, highly recommended if you don't have to walk lock-step with the prevailing iPod masterdom.  Pros: Beautiful video display.  Sexy blue on black backlighting. MANY video codecs supported!  Very good battery life.  Good button response.    Cons: Dongle!  Lag time when changing menus can get frustrating when you want to grab something specific while shuffling all. Slow vid conversion.

<Title>Better than Ipod!! and cost less
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's see..., you can get the Ipod for about $10 "less"(?) because it doesn't come w/ the AC adaptor($40),the integrated FM radio($30+),a pouch and other stuff included with the Creative Zen Vision that you don't get w/ the Ipod, actually I believe the Ipod only comes with a usb cable. The Creative Zen Vision also supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. The quality and feel of the Creative Zen Video are better, not cheap, it is sturdy. You can record directly from the integrated FM radio. 32 station presets let you switch stations whenever you want. You can also select from a myriad of online music stores - Napster To Go, Yahoo! Music Unlimited, Rhapsody To Go, and many more. With PlaysForSure support, you will always be able to play any digital music you purchase. You can even download your favorite TV shows. ZEN VISION:M supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use.  Ipods are for people that get things because everyone has them, not because they do quality research. The battery last longer on the creative and it is replaceable, on the Ipod after 18 month you have to send it back to them and have it replaced and pay over $150. If you want an excellent quality product, go with this one. They had started to come down on price (I got my for $289 here)(the white and the pink are $280ea. today) and you don't have to spend money on extra stuff already included. Do research, Creative had been around for many years and they had won many awards for their MP3 quality products, Including this one.

<Title>DOA products from Creative, buyer beware
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this for a present today, purchased from another website, and it came to me dead. I get a blank screen and none of the buttons work. I get a charge on the battery, and I'm able to get to the recovery screen, but none of the recovery methods work. Looking at Creative's discussion forum, it looks like a good percentage of others are experiencing the same problem. What's bothersome is that it's an official Creative forum on the product, but Creative does nothing to address the problem at all. If you're feeling lucky, go ahead and make the purchase.

<Title>Zen Vision M Black
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this product. I was wanting to get an ipod a long time ago but never had the money, then the ipod with color came out and I began saving money. Not to long after the ipod video came out. I was not sure what to do, get the ipod video or wait for apple to stir up something even greater. So I waited and waited for a few months. I was at Amazon about to buy the ipod when I saw the Zen vision m. I read loads of reviews on it. After reading reviews it was easy to decide that the Zen vision m was the way to go. It is way better then the ipod. It has longer battery life, better screen with more colors, supports a huge amount of video and audio formats, has a built in radio and voice recorder. It can even record radio. I have has it for about a month now, and I love very thing about it except a few things. I strongly recommend getting new headphones ASAP. The headphones it comes with are pure garbage. They do not block out any noise at all. When I sat in a hallway full of people, it was almost impossible to hear the music even at full blast, plus you are hurting your hearing. Another bad thing about it is that the front of the device scratches very easily. Within about 5 minutes of handling it I got a few scratches. It also smudges very easily, and when I tried to wipe it with a t shirt it got rid of the smudges but it added more scratches. I strongly recommend getting a case or an invisible shield for it. You can get one here http://www.shieldzone.com/ Besides that the product is amazing. You can use it as a hard rive. When you put it into hard rive mode, and you plug it into a pc, the pc recognizes it as a USB mass storage device, and not as an mp3 player. I think that is very cool and useful. The screen is much brighter then the ipod. It is not as easy to use as an ipod at first but with about 10 minutes of messing around with it you will be a master. The voice recorder is very good also. I use it sometimes to record lectures at school. The quality is very good. the only down side about the voice recorder is that when you play it back there is a continuous humming sound which is caused by the hard rive in the player spinning at high rpm's. The mic is very sensitive and catches that sound, however it does not bothersome and the lecture can still be heard just fine. The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because it is prone to scratching and smudging. I don't quiet understand why a $330 device scratches so easily.  I tried to include the most aspects about the product as possible, and I hope I was helpful in making your decision of whether to buy it or not.

<Title>Anyone for a lemon?
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product with high hopes after having had a 5GB Zen Micro for a while and loving it, until the contact point for the earphones became loose.  I wanted a bigger MP3 anyway, and the early reviews for the Zen Vision:M seemed so positive.  And for some reason, I was leery of having an IPod on my Windows PC.  But now I am sorry I every bought this.  First, it took about 5 weeks for Amazon to finally ship it to me.  This was frustrating.  Then, when I finally received it at the end of February, I eagerly loaded it up with music.  That went quickly and seemed to be fine.  But when I tried to play it, the touch pad controls would not work.  I could only get Album of the Day to play.  I contacted Creative by phone, and I must say they were helpful (I give them 3 stars for service).  The tech person agreed that the product was defective and instructed me to mail it back to them for fixing or replacement.  I was somewhat dismayed to learn that it was likely I would get a refurbished (like new, he said) replacement.  In any case, I spent $12 with UPS to send it to Creative and, to their credit, I received it back within 14 days.  I again loaded it up with music -- although I found that my Dell MusicMatch Jukebox software worked better for this purpose than Creative's software.  After a few false starts trying to get the touch pad to work, I finally got the hang of it and I was happily up and running.  I really like the screen, btw.  It's large, colorful, and easy to read in even low lighting or bouncing on the subway.  All went well for a day and a half.  Then, on my way home from work the other night, the player just locked up on me.  Refused to jump to the next song; the touch pad would not respond; and I couldn't shut it down with the on/off switch.  It just glowed eerily inside my purse.  When I got home I took a pin, inserted it in the reset hole at the bottom, and, again to its credit, it "rebuilt" and once again was working.  I've yet to try it again and will on the way home tonight.  Bottom line is that the player looks good, has a nice hefty, quality feel to it, and sounds great.  But the electronics don't seem to be of the quality I expect, not for that price. I will see how it goes before I insist on another replacement.

<Title>Not up to mark
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A lot has been written about this player. However, I find the materials used sub-par and of poor quality. The screen and front face scratch so easily that within 10 days, the player already looks like 2 year old. I have a three year old Dell pocket pc which my kids use all the time to play chess and solitaire. After three years, its screen is much better than Zen's screen after 10 days. I always carry in the supplied pouch and even use it in the pouch still there are so many scratches.   Creative sells this player for $329.99 ( at least this is what I paid). Does this kind of price justify such poor materials? No. Looks like Creative is keeping all the money while putting nothing into product quality. Had it not been for Amazon's poor return policy (in case you haven't noticed, Amazon now refunds only 80% or less on opened products), I would have returned this player.  There are other problems also. I subscribe to Yahoo Music Unlimited service. If I create a playlist in Yahoo music engine, I can sync the player and can see this playlist fine. Now if I need to transfer any other video/music to this player using Windows Media Player, I have to put that file in sync list and sync the player. This erases the playlist created by Yahoo music engine.  The outlook sync requires installation of Creative software. As per company policy (which is almost universal in all companies), I cannot install any personal software on the office PC. There goes the outlook sync.    Albun art does not show up correctly for some songs though it displays correctly on Windows Media Player. I tried the fix given on the Creative support site but it does not work.   No support for synchronized lyrics and DVD closed captions.  Do not waste your money on this one.

<Title>Amazing mp3 player!
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've only had this thing for a week but I can't help myself from writing a review right now.  I am still awed by the crystal clear resolution of the screen and the smooth playback of videos.  I've always liked Creative's sound and the Zen doesn't disappoint.  The player is easy to navigate as well; though there are many menus to go through, that just shows that the player gives you many options to work with.  I'll never buy ipods because sound (must have custom equalizers, boo Apple), screen quality and battery life are most important to me in an mp3 player, and the Zen Vision: M beats the Ipod Video in all aspects.  Not to mention the Vision includes an FM tuner and a microphone recorder as well.    As for the complaints about the player scratching easily, don't worry too much about it.  All I did was slap two Belkin PDA screen protectors over the entire face of the player right away, and so far I have had no problems with scratches.  You can hardly tell there's anything over the screen either. I bought the screen protectors as a pack of 10 at a dollar store a long time ago. They work great for all my mp3 players.    I've had the muvo2, ipod mini, the zen micro, and the iaudio X5, but the Zen Vision:M is the best buy at the $250 I paid for it.  This player exceeded my expectations.  And if it lasts for more than a year, I'll be completely satisfied with my purchase.

<Title>Buy it, but get a case before you touch it.
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>FOR: memory; multi-functional (radio); battery life; uses MS media player and you don't need to load any of the provided Creative software.  5 stars for the device  AGAINST: Butter is more scratch resistant; lack of case with the product (comes with some silly little sock thing); lack of accessories available; Software that comes with it is poor and overly complicated (but you don't have to use it). 2 stars because of the lack of accessories, even direct from creative there is a poor selection  I'm giving 4 stars overall because I believe the device itself should carry more weighting than accessories.  If you choose to buy this product, buy a case and a protective film for the screen, as soon as you take it out of the box, put the film on the screen and put it in the case.  The screen scratches extremely easily. The screen is very soft and even cleaning it with a soft lens cloth instantly scratched the heck out of it.  This is my first MP3 video player, I'm frugal so never want to buy anything twice and try to get things that are ahead of the technology so they last longer.  Hence I stayed open minded and I researched MP3 players for many months before committing to buy this one.    I travel internationally a lot by air and wanted something small enough not to be burdensome and at the same time multifunctional to reduce the amount of other unwanted gadgets, this has video, music, talking books, pictures, radio, clock, organizer, contacts.  Also I wanted enough memory that I did not have to keep changing data before/after each trip.  The better battery life for video also helped me in my choice of the Creative Zen Vision MP3 30GB player.    If you want a multifunctional device as I did, I recommend you buy the creative Zen, it is a very good player.  The issue I have with it is the lack of accessories.  Creative, please provide a decent case, and use a harder more scratch resistant material. Amazon, if you are going to stock this product please give me a decent range of accessories to choose from.

<Title>An Amazing Video/MP3 Player****
<Date>Sun Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've bought 2 of these babies. One for myself and one for my best friend's birthday.  It is one incredible player!!!  I love it.  It is so easy to rip your CD's to this player with the Creative software that comes with it.  It also plays Video with amazingly clear resolution.  Even at the lowest Video transfer the picture is still incredibly clear.  The only negative thing I could say about this player is that it does scratch easily.  I purchased the Applesauce Polish and Refiner and it cleans up the scratches very well.  I would definitely purchase a third party case to keep it in to avoid the scratches.  Creative needs to sell more accessories for their line of MP3 players.  They are missing the boat on that issue.  All in all I'm extremely happy with this player and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Video/MP3 player.  It also has a built in FM Radio Tuner, which works extremly well as well as Voice Recording and Photo Slideshow feature.  It is simply AMAZING!!!!!

<Title>Creative Zen Vision: M 
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am overall very impressed with the Zen vision M.  I like the user interface and overall performance.  I love the built in radio and voice recorder.  I would choose the Zen Vision M over the Ipod any day.  But I will be fair with this review.  Here are the problems I have run into.  The screen scratches easily and the leather cases are not yet sold in the USA.  I just used a stick-on screen protector for a palm pilot (Clear packing tape will also work.)  I had to cut the tape to fit but it has worked great.  If you push too many buttons too fast when it is thinking (Like loading a movie or fast forwarding etc.) It sometimes freezes up.  Not a problem though.  Just use a paperclip click the reset button at the bottom.    Only tech geeks will find this next one as a problem.  Computer system requirements say windows XP SP1.  But there are no drivers for SP1. I had to upgrade to SP2.  For any NON-tech person reading this don't worry, windows automatic updates probably fixed that for you months ago.

<Title>Best Media Player I have ever owned!
<Date>Fri Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was torn between getting an iPod video and a Cowon iAudio X5. The iPod had superior video, but the iAudio played numerous formats. The iPod also required the use of iTunes. Then my answer came. The Creative Zen Vision:M. It actually has a higher resolution than the  iPod video. The device converts almost any video or audio to a format supported by the Zen as long as your PC has the codec installed (Quicktime to Windows Media for example).  I owned two previous non-video iPods and had a hard time adjusting to the Zen's control scheme. The menu system, after learning it is very intuitive and the best I have seen. The menu's are stylish and can be skinned.   USE: I took this with me on a trip with the military. I was able   watch videos on my flights without any problems with my eyes. As for sound, the audio sounds as good as, if not better than, the iPods without the EQ on. Turning it on makes it even better. The battery life is amazing as well. I was able to go 5 days on all commutes listening to music and only spent half the battery.  The only drawback to the player is that it does not support podcasts that use Apple's native video format. It must convert the files first on the PC during transfer. This can take, at times, hours. Creative really needs to add native player support for that format in an update.

Also the battery life is 2 times more durable then the ipod video.  Con: They should sell Bigger capacity of Zen. ( 60 or 80GB for my videos).

<Title>I'm addicted...some advice for novices
<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a late-comer to the the whole MP3 thing.  I've been putting off buying one for a variety of reasons (cheapness, techno-phobia, my CD Walkman never broke) but my tax return came in, and what else am I going to do with $300?    I've never owned an iPod, but many of my friends do and have, and I was hesitant to get one based on their problems with it (notably, as everyone else has said, battery power).  So, I got this one and I'm quite pleased with it.    The Zen comes with everything you need to use it (e.g. a charger, headphones, etc).  I bought new headphones because I hate ear buds, but the ones included had decent sound quality (typically, "freebie" headphones are awful).  Other than that, the only other investment I made was protective film for the screen ($15 for 12 sheets).  If you want to get a cover for the whole thing, buy one on line.  I tried at least 4 local stores (big chains) and NO ONE carries accessories for Zens.    The screen has pretty amazing resolution for a 2 1/2 inch screen.  I haven't watched any videos on it yet, aside from the sample ones that are loaded on the player when you get it.  Maybe I'm easily impressed.  But the picture is sharp and clear and the colors are vibrant.  I'm currently in my 13th hour (literally) of ripping my CD collection onto my Zen and I've only used 4 GB of memory.  Each CD takes just a few minutes, even less if you already have them saved on your computer (you can drag and drop them from your My Music file).    The only complaint I have has to do with the software that comes with it.  After about every 10th CD, it had some sort of error (again, I have no idea what kind of error as I'm lucky to have gotten this far).  It's not a big problem, because it takes about 3 seconds to get around it, but it's kind of annoying.  The player itself couldn't be easier to operate.  So far, no problems (knock on wood).  UPDATE!!! The Bad News: Okay, so five days after I got my Zen, after 36 hours burning my entire CD collection onto it, it died.  Yeah.  Fried.  Everything gone.  Heartbroken, I called Creative.  I didn't have to wait for someone to pick up, and I received instant, helpful and friendly assistance.  Unfortunately, I had to send it back and was told it would be 10-15 business days before I would get another one (or mine if they could fix it).    The Good News: After only 6 business days, I have my new Zen.  So, that's awesome, except that I now have to reburn everything (TIP:  burn your CDs to your computer, if you have the space, and then copy them to your Zen...it's a good idea in case this happens).  Creative's customer service was great.

<Title>A superb portable entertainment device
<Date>Thu Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The only drawback with this player is its sensitive navigation key. Should have followed some of the Samsung mobile phone navigation key instead. Everything else it has a superb audio quality especially if you pair it with the senheisser PX100 headphone. I was able to transfer all my 800 songs without any hitch. Transferred most of my home videos and digital camera photos without any problem at all. If it can't handle the bit rate, it has an automatic conversion program. It can also be used as an effective contact manager with seamless integration with outlook using its media explorer software. Also have tried to transfer some dvd movies such as family guy and the eagles farewell concert, again using decrypter and autogkt software, it was a piece of cake. My son didn't notice any glitches in the video quality. You can also create easily your own slideshows by just drag and drop method. I am very happy with this device and I just wish that the built in battery would last a number of years. It is also practical to buy the wired remote so you can skip songs, adjust the volume and change to FM radio while the screen is locked thus saving you battery life.

<Title>Living with my 6 Hr old Zen Vision M!!
<Date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>1) Amazing...just one word to describe the screen... Video resolution is dependant on what video quality u throw at it...  2) Battery charges up fast...i charged for 15 mins...and used it for 3 hrs...(playing videos and songs)  3) I donno what is all the talk abt the navigation...it is VERY easy to use.  4) I havent had issues with installing the software...installation was easy...and importantly transferring files is just like transferring to any USB flash drive. Its that easy.  5) Way too many features to even compare with an ipod...                 *****FIVE STARS*****

<Title>Truly an amazing gadget!
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Zen M for about 2 months now so I think I have a good feel for what it's pros and cons are. Here you go:  Pros: Beautiful and Bright Screen (displays thousands of more colors than the Ipod video by the way). Even at 50% brightness (which is default setting out of the box) it looks bright!  Ability to Customize most of the features. This includes being able to set your own photos for the wallpaper, custom equilizer, custom brightnes setting, custom shortcut button, organization of folders(audio, photo, video folders)...etc.  Great Sound! This isn't a surprise because Creative develops sound hardware/software like soundcards.   Good User Interface: The thumb scroller interface takes a few days to get used to, then it's pretty user friendly. You can customize the sensitivity of it too.  Ability to play lots of different video files like Divx and Mpg4. This was a big selling point for me. The screen is perfect for watching cartoons and anime on.   Good Size. I'm refering to it's physical size. It's actually the perfect size and feels great in your hand. Still pocketable and still feels rock solid and not fragile.   Displays Album cover art! I had trouble with this function in the beginning only because in order to get it to display the album art correctly, you need to rip the Cd album with a program that automatically downloads album info including art. One program that does this is Windows Media Player.   --For the techies that don't want to re-rip everything to get the album art to display, just download a small jpeg image of the album cover that is about 150 by 150 pixels, rename it folder.jpg, make it a hidden file and place it in the folder of the correct album. When you move it to your player it will ask you whether you want to move it to the photo folder, make sure you select "no" and leave it where it is.  Cons: There isn't a lot about this player that is negative. But one aspect which is really annoying is that to charge it or plug it to the computer you have to use this tiny seperate adapter that comes in the box. It's the white adapter/attachment that looks like a dock connector. What the heck were they thinking! I have to carry the separate item everywhere I go just in case I need to charge it or upload music. It sucks man! Why the heck didn't they just build all of the ports into the player itself!! Also, they should've included the video output cable instead of selling it separately! Or at least made it use a standard video cable! Also, the battery is not removable... at least not meant to be.   These are the only reasons why I gave this player 4 out of 5 stars. Otherwise I would have given 5 out of 5! All in All this player really rocks and is worth every penny! ... and is a much better buy then the "other" competition out there.   Hope this is helpful to you guys. If it is, please give me a vote.

<Title>Movies to go!
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So far I have 300+ CDs, 1800 MP3s, 3 full-length movies, and my entire picture collection on this thing, and I still have PLENTY of room left.  For those of you who want to rip your DVDs to one of these, I would suggest downloading DVDFab Decrypter and Auto Gordian Knot.  With these two (free) programs and a little trial and error, I have been able to copy any DVD in my collection to the Zen Vision M.  I wasn't able to get the Vision M to load movies that were ripped at the default settings of AutoGK (which is about 1.2 gig), but if you save them at about 355 meg (the 1/2 CD option), they will load just fine, with acceptable video quality and above-average sound.  I hope this helps some of you who want to watch movies on your Vision M.  It took me a while to find the right software to do the job, but now that I have it I couldn't be happier.  You'll just have to buy one of these things to see how amazing they really are.

<Title>Best Player Available Today
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you own this player, join the best fansite available for it: epizenter.net. The features packed into the Vision:M is better than any other player you will see today. Forget ipods, they can not even compare with this player. Ipods have a subpar screen that is only capable of getting 65,000 colors, the Vision:M has one with 262,144 colors! Not to mention the video playback and sound quality blows away ipods. Plus you can do tv out at much higher resolutions. Add the Best looking GUI, extra features like FM radio, Voice recording, etc..all for the same price as an ipod and you'll see why this player one Best in Show at the most popular Consumer Electronics show. Get one now you won't regret it.

<Title>Beautiful
<Date>Fri Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband is in the military and we live in Okinawa, Japan. We don't get a lot of the US TV shows here, so my reason for purchasing the player was to download shows to the player and then connect the player to our TV and watch! To do this you HAVE to order the Zen Vision: M Video Cable. I received the Vision M yesterday, and have since downloaded and watched 2 TV shows-it works great!   After I had first received the package and charged the player, I tried to look thru the menu on the Vision M. I got stuck in a song and couldn't figure out how to get out. The navigation system is horrible-the touchpad is too sensitive. My player froze up and I had to reset it within the first 30 minutes of use. After I reset it, the player didn't go to the main menu, but was still at the song I got stuck in the first place. After several hours I finally got to the main menu. After I connected to the computer and downloaded the shows, it took another 30 min to get to the right screen to view the shows-I was so mad I wanted to send the player back. Once I was able to get to the right screen and connect to the TV, it played beautiful on the screen. I am much happier since it is doing exactly what I bought it for, and it is doing it well. I am just going to allow myself the extra time to navigate to the correct screen every time I watch a TV show.  I read so many reviews about scratches that I ordered a protective shield from shieldzone.com. It hadn't arrived yet and I was so anxious to use the player that I left it in the plastic casing that it was shipped in, and it has worked out great (just for use at my home). The plastic casing has an opening at the top so you can power the player on, and an opening at the bottom so you can attach the piece that allows you to charge and hook up to the computer. You can also use the touchpad thru this casing. I haven't been very gentle with it at all, and still no scratches. I will leave it in the casing until the one I ordered arrives.  I do like the player now and do not regret that I bought it, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the touchpad and navigation.  I usually download avi files, but some shows I'm just finding in mp4 format (ipod) which the video converter won't handle. Does anyone know what software or codec I can download to convert to a file I can play on this machine? If so, please let me know!!!!! ** ** This is an update, after spending a few hours on the net, I found a zen message board epizenter.net that suggested you convert mp4 to compatible formats with software called Super-it's free, I just converted an mp4 to an avi file and now it plays on the vision m. You can download the Super software at erightsoft.com

<Title>So much better than the IPod.
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>All of my friends who have mp3 players have Ipods except for one who followed in my footsteps.  This has a radio, microphone, longer battery life, more compatible formats for music and movies, and more.  Does the Ipod have that included?  Nope.  I have the pink one which I bought the second week of March and I love my mp3 player.  I wish it had a removable battery though like the smaller Creative mp3 players.  I also wish it was pink all the way around and a little smaller like the Ipod.  Like the Ipod though, the screen scratches easily so just be careful with it or buy a protective cover thing.  I'm listening to my Zen Vision:M now and decided to stop buy and leave a little review.  I do alot of research before I spend money on something electronic or such and I know I got the better product.  I researched Dell, Sony, Ipod, Creative, you name it.  Even my cousin who used to be an Ipod fanatic and has an Ipod studied my player with his and was like "Yeah, I'm gonna switch and get one of those.  They are better than the Ipods."  I was way impressed and proud of him, lol.  That is all.

<Title>5 Stars+dongle=4
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just the dongle kept it from getting 5 stars. To be fair this is probably how creative managed to beat the Ipod's battery life and still maintain a similar size. But the dongle is needed for charginging, syncing, using the optional AV cable or any other accessory. So if I want to use the optional car charger I have to bring the dongle.I have the ac charger by my night stand, but I have to get the dongle from the usb cable on my computer and visa versa. I'm planning on ordering the video out cable, buts thats yet another place to bring the friggin' dongle.    But let's not be so negative. There are 4 other stars.    It's played every avi file I've loaded on it. The fact it doesn't have to come from the itunes store or some other proprietary format is a huge plus. If you know how to go about creating and obtaining your own content this is definitely the right choice. I record shows with a huappauge pvr-150 card, which means my shows are free.(if you don't count the 100$ capture card,you can find others for 40$ and up) If you plan on doing the same you won't be able to play your mpeg files. Despite what creative says you can't play mpeg unless you use a very low poor quality bit rate. However I record with sage tv which automatically converts recordings to Divx at night. I suspect and hope creative will improve mpeg playback in future firmware. I wouldn't use Creative's converter. Too darn slow. "SUPER" is a great little free program. It converts to and from just about anything. For 20 bucks Divx sells a fool proof dragndrop converter.    Music playback sounds great. Has EQ settings preprogramed, and custom. The included earphones seem fine.(I'm not an audiophile) A tip here, when playing music switch it to lock, this way the screen goes blank and improves battery life. No support for Audible books yet, but Creative says it's coming. It does support drm. I wouldn't know as I only by CDs and rip them to mp3. They have somthing called Zencast, a podcast client, it does make navigating podcasts easier, but I still prefer IpodderLemon.    At first I thought the scroll pad and interface would drive me nuts. But after a day our so I got the feel for it. The interface is also quite customizable, allowing you to add or delete menu items, and change wall papers. There is also a custom shortcut button which is really handy.   Battery life does't  come close to my "AA" lyra that I was used to, but it does seem to match Creative's claims. It will be better when i get the car charger(friggin' dongle!) I've never had it go dead yet.     The picture quality is superb. The size is very watchable. People have written they wouldn't watch a 2 hour movie on it but I have. My wife loves it(she has no idea how much it cost,thank God) Now she can watch LifeTime while in bed and I actually am there happily watching Underworld. It does have feature wich lets you stretch 16:9 to full screen to make watching easier on the eyes but if thats a problem for you I would recomend cropping the original.     No accessories accept through Creative right now, but that will change.(There selling a gazillion of these) But definitely get some screen protectors. I don't know if it scratches easily but don't want to find out.    So if you can survive without Itunes, live with that extra .25" thickness(oh please people), and deal with the fact it's rectangular like an Ipod(The chief complaints of the ipod users in these reviews) I would highly reccomend the Vision M. (friggin dongle:)       Update 4/28/06: Creative is now selling the dongle for 9.99. So for me that lessens the impact of the dongle in my review. I'm ordering an exrtra dongle to make life easier. I continue to be impressed with how cool it is to carry around my favorite shows.

<Title>excellent device
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my ZVM for a couple of months now.  It's awesome.  I bought it from amazon for $[...]with free shipping so they seem to have bumped the price up a bit ($[...], which is still less than MSRP).  My girlfriend has the 30GB Ipod, so i've gotten to do a good side by side comparison.  It's a pretty even match once you consider all the pros/cons (check out Mario C.'s review).  I think i actually prefer the vertical scroll (e.g. rapid scroll by touching the bottom/top edges instead of 40 swirls around an ipod scroll wheel).  The included software's a bit lame right now.  A few improvements could make it good though (nudge, nudge Creative).  For now, just use "auto playlists" in Windows Media Player 10 for syncing (works fine).  The front scratches easily (so does the Ipod), so get one of these first thing:  [...]  My biggest complaint is the lack of decent accessories.  I'm sure that'll come with time and popularity, but i'm ready now for some decent options for protective cases.  I'm also ready for some deals to be made so that we can easily buy movie/tv-episode downloads for the non-ipod crowd.  Overall, a great product.

<Title>Great quality and ease of use
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M is my first MP3 player and I am delighted with it. Despite its hefty price, all I can say is: it's worth it. I researched a lot before choosing it and do not regret my selection -- the reason I am writing this review is to hopefully help out other MP3 player neophytes who may be as confused and overwhelmed as I was with all the new info and the apparently infinite choice of models. Sound quality is stupendous, navigation between functions is intuitive (I barely skimmed the manual), the screen has great quality, the player's software works well (and you can always resort to Windows Media Player if you prefer). I have no problems with the navigation buttons despite knowing of other users' issues with their sensitivity. I love it that I can use a portion of the 30 GB hard disk as an external drive, sparing me the extra expense of a pen drive. The only "but" I have, after a few weeks, is that the earbuds' foam capping keeps coming off. It is true that there are few accessories available for the model, but hopefully this will change as it becomes more popular. But then, I've no plans to spend another $289 on gizmos for the Vision:M anyway.

<Title>I returned the Ipod 5G for this
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I put 40 dvds on this thing, rip my cds and create play lists all within a few hours. the usb 2 just blows away the ipod slow connection it's not even funny.  The only thing the ipods got for it is the easy controls but very short on features.  One thing I really like is the porn files/ videos that I dont want my kids to see, just hide it and lock it. And the short cut button is just so great to have, need more buttons like this. Ipods need to learn how to do that.  When the lights is out on the Ipod, you cannot see any thing, not this Zen, it's dim but u can still make out the screen. Those are the things that I have not seen anyone mention. Anyway, these things are selling like hot cakes, look for it at 6 diffent stores before I found the last one at bestbuy...it's so good I bought some stocks for CREAF too, at 52 weeks low.  Already made enough to pay for itself.

I just want you people out there to know that if you want to get this item through Amazon, it will take a long time. I like Amazon.com and usually get my item by the time promised. I guess this item is going to be out of stock for a while. Do not put your hopes on the promised 1-2 weeks on the add. It will take far longer than that. I'm still waiting for mine. Hope this helps all of you who plan on getting on through amazon. Again, amazon.com is great, but this item will be out of stock for a while and they will not update their add to show that.

<Content>I can't believe that the world hasn't caught on to this device yet. It blows the iPod away on all fronts: - The best user interfact imaginable. Simple, quick, intuitive. - Battery lasts forever - Screen is awesome - The overall feel of the thing- it's hard to describe how good it is. - FM radio - It opens in windows using a simple Exlporer window- what could be easier? This may sound like a paid ad- (I don't even like Creative Labs that much). But the product is truly worthy of all this and more. Finally someone beat Apple at its iPod game, with an open-arcitechture product, but no ones knows about it yet.

<Title>Fresh out the box
<Date>Fri Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just received by Creative Zen 30GB today (I'm very excited).  I just unpacked the unit and it looks very sleek (I purchased the black one). It's a little bit taller than my palm.  The first thing I had to do was upgrade my QuickTime as versions 7.01 and 7.02 interfere with the Zen.  That upgrade on line was easy enough.  Next, I plugged in the until to charge it up.  It has to charge for 2 hours.  During this process I had to power it up and down.  During that I was able to see a very crisp and clean screen.  I'm looking forward to watching videos.  I purchased this product mainly to watch videos while working out, on the train, etc.  Anyway, installation was a breeze--popped in the setup disk and it walked me through the entire install without a problem.  The unit comes with a felt bag to store the unit--for the price, it would have been nicer to receive a more protective cover.  I think if I drop it in this bag, the unit will suffer damage. So, the first thing I must do is go out and purchase a better cover for the unit.  I should have ordered it when I ordered the unit.  WARNING-I thought this was interesting (and scary) on the second page of the instructions it states "THE CORDS INCLUDED WITH THIS PRODUCT MAY CONTAIN CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM. Wash hands after handling"--what the heck is that!!!  California is wacky, but I decided I was going to wash my hands anyway--I don't know if this is common to all electronics, but I don't understand why they would use accessories that require this disclosure...Anyway, you now know before you buy that this is in there.  Back to the install.  The directions say that versions 7.01 and 7.02 of Quicktime will halt your Creative installation, but version 7.03 has fixed this problem.  I could only download 7.04 at apple.com, and it appears that my creative installation halted.  However, I x'd out of it and it asked me if I wanted to reboot in order for my computer to accept changes.  I did that and it seems to be working.  I have my unit plugged into the USB (docked) and I am attempting to copy a video from my external hardrive to the unit.  The directions are a bit skimpy on how to do this.  However, I dragged and dropped the file and hit the conversion button.  It walked me through the conversion, which was pretty simple. I keep getting a busy message requiring me to hit the swich button.  If you get it, just hit it and it will continue with the transfer.  My first transfer of 1.12 gb was pretty quick (only a couple of minutes).  My second download, about the same size, (in "good quality"--you have a choice--the better quality probably taking a bit longer) was done in around 2 minutes--not bad for a full movie.   OKAY--I undocked the unit and hit menu button, found videos and saw that my transferred movies were there--AWESOME AND EASY. My headphones are in and they are comfortable plug ins (with little cushions on the outside--unlike my ipod).  I turned on my movie (Chronicles of Riddick--I know, not the best, but some good special effects to test the unit).  The picture is crisp, clear and excellent...I'm loving it.  The sound is awesome, a bit too loud, but I haven't found the volume button.  So, in less than a 1/2 hour I'm up and running watching movies on my Creative Zen.  I am totally digging it.  I will continue to test the unit and learn how to fully utilize it, but for now--this is a five star for me (I am so excited about being able to copy my movies to this unit!!!!)

<Title>Don't Hesitate...
<Date>Fri Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me admit right off the bat that I don't like anything Apple makes and my brief experience with the iPod click-wheel only reinforced that feeling.  The Creative Zen Vision M has it all! One of the best things about this device is that you don't have to install ANY of the Creative software that comes with it! If you have Windows XP, just plug it into a USB port and browse to it through My Computer.  You can use Windows Media Player to sync media files or simply drag and drop media and photos using the standard Windows interface.  The adjustment/learning curve for the controls on this device is pretty easy and I am comfortable using it.  There is still one button (upper left) that I may have to consult the manual on because when pressed, I get a result that I was not expecting.  In addition to playing Windows Media files, this bad boy plays my TiVo files without any special conversion necessary.  I just transfer the TiVo files from my TiVo to my PC, then use Windows Media Player to sync my TiVo files to my Creative Zen Vision M.  The FM radio tuner/recording feature is nice, but I admit that I am probably not going to get much use out of that, except during football season.  This is a wonderful device and I am highly impressed.

<Title>At $300 you want to get it right... Zen gets the job done.
<Date>Fri Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I work in technology and have tons of digital music, DVR television shows and DVDs. I wanted something that could hold all of this so I could easily move content from my different Media Center PCs and have good tunes and shows to enjoy while I'm on the road. Despite all I know about technology I still almost went with the iPod. They're marketing people are brilliant! I am very glad I didn't do that now. With the Creative I don't have to worry about converting anything. I already have so much music on my Windows Media Centers and copying those over to the Zen was a breeze. The included software even converts video for you if in the wrong format. It's truely plug and play and works great!  300 bones isn't a small purchase for me so I am thrilled to be so happy with this product. Feature rich and the sound is great! I would recommend this as the very best alternative to the iPod. If you are running a Windows based PC this is the product for you.  Now, after a gushingly positive sales pitch for a company I don't work for, I should point out where I see room for improvement. After only a couple of days I have found that the screen scratches fairly easy so you may want to leave the film on it or get something to protect it. I also found it odd that it doesn't support the format in which Microsoft records shows. These must first be converted (the software does handle this nicely though). The interface isn't quite as intuitive as I would have liked, but is very easy to learn.  I am still amazed that they packed 30 gigs into something this size! I hope that this review helps you with your decision. After doing the research this is what I got and I am happy that I did.

<Title>Buyer beware - major hardware problems
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Those considering buying this unit should check out the official Creative forums first. It appears a large number of people are receiving units which are either DOA (Dead on Arrival) or die shortly thereafter. I personally have gone through three dead units from 3 different vendors, all with the same symptoms. Too bad, this would otherwise be a great unit.

<Title>Great Features!
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before purchasing the Vision, I had a look at the reviews I found online and they played a large part in going with it over the IPOD 30 GB.  I thought the features offered were right up my alley including the FM radio, microphone/radio recording capability, access to MSN Outlook email/calendar features.  I must say after opening it and trying it out, it didn't fail to impress!  I tried out the microphone to record and found it to be of good quality, the video was sharp enough on the little screen (and my friends were impressed by the video highlights I had of Ronaldinho), and the FM radio was able to pick up most of the channels I liked.  Last but not least, the sound quality is just superb - it is after all Creative Labs and thats their forte but its still impressive!  There are a few things that could be improved on.  It would be nice if I could select a whole genre of music or album or artist but Vision forces you to select the actual song and add it to the currently playing list.   The FM radio forces you to use the AutoSelect to find all the channels in range but it would help if there was an option to allow the user to select/scroll to a particular channel even if the signal is not so strong.  Also, it is somewhat more bulky than the IPOD 30 GB so it might be tiresome to go running with - and you have to buy an accessory with a belt clip or armband/wristband.    But hey, these are all minor things and I have probably missed the easy way to get around it - overall a worthy buy!

<Title>My best MP3 player yet. A winner!
<Date>Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Elegant, small and fun, the Zen Vision:M does many things well. Perhaps its user interface is not as intuitive as the Ipod, but the sound is outstanding. This is especially evident in playing opera recordings, and the M will please those very particular music types who favor accuracy over sheer volume (although this one can crank up too, so protect your ears!) I have also used Archos products (no tech support) and the Sony Network Walkman (quite good with terrific battery power, now discontinued) but my fourth Creative player (2 jukeboxes and an earlier Zen) is the best ever with a superb screen that can be used on the go by middle-aged music lovers without perpetually rummaging for those reading glasses. The button layout is not as obvious as one would like, but after a few hours, I'm getting with the program, and loving it. Be the first on your block to buy the green one!

<Content>i know that this will be the prototype for the next generation of mp3 players.  the creative zen vision: m is versitile, useful, and amazing for all the reasons everyone else has said.  the most surprizing thing to me is the screen quality.  the images are so translucent and lucid that it's easy to be amazed by the video and picture display. it's a great interactive lil gadget that's sure to delight me for hours upon hours. i've been trying to drain the battery and it lasts way beyond what creative states.  also, putting the mp3 player on hold turns off the screen!  sound quality: 9/10 video quality: 10/10 video battery: 9/10 audio battery: 10/10 revolutionariness: 10/10 overall: 9.9/10

<Title>Worst customer service
<Date>Mon Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen Touch 20 GB MP3 Player for my daughter as a Christmas present. It worked fine until the screen developed a big black spot right in the middle of it. It looks like it's burned. I called technical support (405-742-6622) and had to wait for about 20 minutes before someone finally answered. This clown told me I had to pay them $10 for tech support. I told him I just wanted an RMA# so I could return it, I didn't need to go through any nonsense. He told me my 1 year warranty wasn't going to cover replacing a defective screen and that I had to return it with $25 and that the repair department would probably charge me $100 to replace it. These guys suck! This is a $200 MP3 player that's going to cost $100 to fix a defective part.

<Title>Amazing...
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My last playerr, an Archos jukebox, bit the dust after only a few months and now they tell me they already don't make parts for it, so I decided to look for a new one from a better company. This one has exceeded my expectations!  Sound quality- OMG! Sounds like 3D. Crisp, clear, good volume. BIG improvement over the Archos, and I had thought the Archos was good, but this one blows it away.  Ease of Use- The software, despite what others have said, is really simple. I was able to copy all the music from my hard drive into the Creative Zen in 180 seconds (1 second per song), and then I copied 16 gigabytes of music from my old Archos into the Zen in about 15 minutes. For ripping new CDs, you just put the disc in, click rip, and it goes right into the Zen.  The only tricky thing is that the controls are REALLY sensitive. But they all make sense, and you really don't need to look at the book to figure them out. But the book is really clear and simple.  Battery life- I dont know yet, since I just got the player yesterday.  Size- a deck of cards in size and weight, almost exactly!  I highly recommend this player. Although, I do not know how durable it is, again since i just got it yesterday.

<Title>former iPod owner says: Blows iPod away!!
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As a two-year owner of an iPod, i got absolutely sick and tired of my mp3 player becoming increasingly incompatible with just about everything.  The more time that passed, the more times i lost everything on the iPod and the more i found myself shaking my head.  i bought the zen vision:m about a week ago, and i have been amazed by it since it's been in my possession.  i like to refer to it as an iPod without the bull****. i think the fact that people complain about its size, its menu interface and its reliability is a complete joke.    I find the size to be just right for this device, very comparable to the 20 GB iPod i have owned for the last few years.  it's a solid piece of equipment (scratches easy, don't even mess around just buy a case for it. there are plenty now.)  The menu interface is quite reminiscent of the ipod's (which is a good thing), with a few excellent updates. it has a feature while browsing the media library that enables you to scroll to a specific letter rather than scroll through everything...very handy for large libraries. the touchpad that for some reason people are complaining about in their reviews has given me no trouble. it's not a click wheel...so what? get over it folks.  it functions almost exactly the same, except it has a rapid scroll function which comes in handy.  it has three sensitivity settings, so there is really no reason to complain about its sensitivity.  also a clutch addition is the shortcut button. randomize all songs? one touch.  whatever you want. one touch. great stuff.  the screen itself is just what it advertises. it's awesome. i find it playing back videos at exactly the quality they should be, colors are right on. no fuzziness or lines in the video. i haven't had a compatibility problem yet, something all you iPod clowns (i can say that because i have been one myself) can't say.   good luck getting a DivX video onto your ipod without going to nerdcentral.com to figure it out, and then you're still going to have a decreased quality video. apple is shooting itself in the foot by purposely not making their great product compatible. the zen vision:m is compatible with just about every music service there is...iPods don't have a chance with anything besides itunes.  not to mention the zen is compatible with just about every media file you could want to put on your mp3 player.  the one complaint i have with it is that you can't play the files directly off the player when it's plugged in. however, this is on the other hand an extremely smart security measure they have taken because it prevents your files from being mistakenly deleted, which is something that EVERY iPod owner goes through at least once. it sucks, and this prevents it. i still wish i could play them through winamp though...  IF YOU WANT AN MP3 PLAYER, STOP WHAT YOURE DOING AND BUY THIS ONE NOW. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. meanwhile, i'm going to start an anti-apple movement... see ya.

<Title>Creative Products:  Buyer Beware!!
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After several attempts to own a functional MP3 player from Creative, I gave up. It should not be this hard; iPod, here I come. My first Creative Player broke within three months of opening the box. I returned it (a small but manageable hassle). I received an entirely new one about two weeks later, no charge. Two months later, had power management issues with the new one; Creative recommeded an upgrade to the firmware. OK, fine. Three months later, the thing completely crashes -- no music, no connectivity to my PC, nothing but a permanent splash screen. I tried the restore mode, but none of the restore functions were working. The thing was dead dead dead.  I called Creative to see what they could do. For $25, they could tell me what I already knew: it wasn't working and needed to be fixed. Then, they made it clear that they would be charging me for whatever it took to fix it. All this despite the fact that THEY sent me this lemon and it was less than a year (read: still within warranty) since I had received it. Great customer service, eh?  Bad product + bad customer service = doomed company. Don't buy a Creative Product.

I don't have mine either and it's not Amazon or Academic Superstore's fault. You can't even get them on the Creative website. It's gone....everywhere.

<Title>Very nice, but...........
<Date>Tue Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my 16 yr. old daughter and she loves it. It's a little tricky setting up but you should expect this from such a high tech. product. All I can say is be patient.   Many of her friends own ipod's but when they saw this they ALL said they would rather have one of these. The sound quality is better along with the picture quality. Plus, they liked other features the Zen Vision has that the ipod doesn't have. The biggest complaint about the ipod from her friends (and their parents) was the cost and hassle to replace the battery.  My only gripe, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, Is with CREATIVE for not coming up with their own line of screen protectors and silicone cases to protect their very high priced product. They couldn't figure this out? Come on, the name of the company is CREATIVE, isn't it?  We are forced to buy overpriced accessories that cost too much and don't do the job.   It's still not too late CREATIVE.

<Title>Most Frustrating MP3 Player for money !
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>How come there are no 'Zero' Stars for Review ??.   If you are buying MP3 player for first time, Don't start with this. This is most frustrating player you will ever buy for money. Menu's are so frustrating and buttons are sooooo sensitive, My blood pressure went hign trying to figure out how to get to the main menu. I have spent over 6 hours on this and read so called 'User Manual' 3 times, but this is worst pain I ever had with any electronic item.    Worst product I ever bought in my life.  I am not sure if these reviews are Genuine but I heard similar experince from a friend of mine. I was told that I should stick with Ipod Instead..  Manual is very very poorly written as it assumes that you owned many MP3 players before. What's wrong with Creative ?.  Keep Away, I would recommend you go to some store and try this out before buying from Amazon and you will Thank me for this..  I am returning this ASAP, if Amazon does not take it back, I will give to my 2 year kid to play with it finally to avoid the headache !.

<Content>I previously bought a creative zen micro from amazon and i absolutley love it.  I cant get enough of it.  I listen to it every possible minute i can.  Ive had this for about a year and a half, and i saw that creative came out with the vision m.  I did hours of research on it.  I compared it to the IPod video, and decided that the vision m was the mp3 video player for me. My dad has an IPod video and he loves it, but recently the hard drive crashed on him. I ordered the vision m in white because the black really shows finger prints and scratches.  I ordered this product on March 28 and today is April 28.  Amazon still hasnt shipped this product, and I payed extra for express shipping.  I am getting extremely impatient, but from what i hear "good things are worth waiting for"

<Title>Awsome media player!
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Without restating all the technical issues, this player is wonderful.  The video, which I didn't intend to use, is sharp and simple to load using the included software or WMP10.  Screen bright and battery life strong.  Works great as a storage device.  But most important, it is easy to use, and sounds great as an audio player.  My wife has, and loves her iPod, but I did not want to be tied to the Apple software, and this supports more formats.  Could have better headphones, but replacements are available.  I haven't discovered the optimal file format and bit-rate for this, yet.  I use 128kbps and my entire music collection and several long videos fit with room to spare.  Would have preferred a flash memory player, but the capacity is not there.  Not a lot of accessories, yet, but I use a Samsonite camera case with a small external pocket for the dongle and headset.  Also, I purchased the invisible shield at shieldzone.com and this protectes the screen and body beautifully.  This is my favorite new toy!

<Title>Amazing Player--Best in Class
<Date>Mon May 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to tell you, I did my research on this one and even had some bad experiences with other players before being completely satisfied with this little versatile player Creative came out with.   It's got amazing audio fidelity (which is helped by providing earbuds that aren't worthless) and a immpeccable visual display to boot.  I bought an iRiver and had to return it due to bad crashing problems, so I went with this and couldn't be happier (listening to it right now!).   The only issue I've had is that Windows wouldn't recognize it until I downloaded a patch from the internet, but I think this is due to the fact that I run service pack 1.    Pros: Sound quality.  Very clear Visual quality.  Little pixelation, incredibly clear Album art shown with song Syncs with Microsoft Outlook (great if you live by to-do lists) Picture viewing (zoom and rotation functions) Flexibility with software (use with WMP, or two of their very nice little programs) Good battery life, short charge time  Cons: No manual volume control (scroll bar works Vertical scroll bar (it's OK, but hard to get used to) The "pouch" they give you.  BUY A CASE (and never take it out) Odd controls--a bit hard to get used to the shortcut buttons Gaps between tracks (I can't figure out how to fix this--the iRiver had a feature that would, but this doesn't seem to  Basically, the good seriously outweighs the bad.  I highly recommend buying this over the iRiver and especailly the iPod.  If you have the connectivity problems I did, search on tech forums for a patch and that should fix it right up.  Good Luck!

I am guessing the reason is so the could fit everything inside the player. I am happy with this so far. The product was also not in stock.

<Title>Good partner with a Media Center PC
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got one a month ago.  If you are one of the many people who have a new media center PC and you are recording TV on it (you have plugged your cable into it, etc.), this is a good device in that you can easily sync it with the MCPC and put your recorded TV shows on the player.  You can't do that with the iPod device, which is incompatible with Media Center.  Then to get music you can just rip your CDs or use a Windows oriented digital music service like Rhapsody or Yahoo or whatever....  The device is handy, it's cute, the sound and video are good.    Basically, if you have a Media Center PC, this is clearly a better choice for you than the iPod.

<Title>The real shipping only takes one day; so don't be frustrated, it will arrive soon!
<Date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>More than one month after ordering, Zen arrived yesterday. It doesn't disappoint me even though I was a little bit worried about its thickness. The size is perfect, the weight is perfect and the FEEL is perfect! The white Zen is very good looking!  I transferred all audio/video files I was having access to immediately to Zen. All audio files were taken without a problem, so were most videos. Several video files were, as the Zen told me, out of its playing capability but can be converted with a couple of clicks -- the converting time is a little bit long maybe because I picked the "best-quality-longest-time" mode and I was notoriously impatient, :). The image quality is amazing! So colorful and fine-grained. The sound is awesome too. FM works nicely - I'm listening to it right now after having watched all the videos on Zen.  The battery charging is fast, less than 2 hours for a full charge. It's still running with more than 60% left after about 2 hour of video playing, 3 hour of mp3 and more than one hour of radio in addition to half an hour of recording and countless menu operations.  The microphone gave me some hard time, though I think it will be better after I get more used to its buttons and touch pad.   I only installed the simplest media explorer. Maybe that's the reason I can't drag and drop files between two Zen folders, even though dragging and dropping between Zen and computer are smooth.  The acompanying pouch is cute, however I still want to buy an armband pouch. Then I can enjoy the music whenever I want, even on a treadmill.  Two more little nice things to say about Zen: -The blue screensaver LED can work as an illumilator in the dark, tiny but better than nothing, eh? -The screen can be used as a mirror once the screen saver is on.  All in all, I'm very happy with my Zen.

<Title>Great Peice of Equipment
<Date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M is a great peice of hardware.  After purchasing it and rushing to open the box (and oohing and aaahing for a while) I pluged it in to begin the initial charge. Then I turned it on... First thing you notice, the screen is beautiful. I can't reiterate that enough, it is unbelievable how clear and vibrant the screen is.  I sync'ed a few CD's to it, and listened, the sound quality is superb. The headphones they give you are not-so-great, but thats become an unwelcome precedent in mp3 players.  Next I tried to sync some TV shows to it... I had a little trouble with this. If you are expecting that this is gonna be a flawless video sync, think again. Your video may and probably will need a lengthy conversion process. However, once they are on there, they are incredible. You'd think watching shows on the 2 inch screen would be ridiculous, but the quality makes it a very enjoyable experience.  The playforsure software is great too, just plug it into any computer with WMP10 and you can synce music/vidoes/pictures.   If there is one thing Creative did right, it was custimization. My background is currently an ominous picture of Emperor Palpatine. Different colors (both the external and the display) and many other things.   All in all, it is worth my money. It wasnt painless, but nothing is. If you don't like Ipods, get this.

I'm not a tech person at all, but the organizational features all seem pretty intuitive to me.  I've had no problems importing my music and pictures, making playlists, changing menu option, etc.  And my husband, who is a tech person, was blown away by the color quality on the screen while watching an episode of South Park.  I'm not a sound snob, but I think the quality is really good.  Only thing that is hard to get used to is the sensitivity of the controls...but there is a menu option to fix that too! LOVE IT!!!!

Why don't they provide an adapter?) or you need to charge thro the USB port of your computer. ** For iPod, they say, when the battery dies, you have to spend another 100 plus bucks to get new battery installed.  ** Vision M: works as a true USB Flash drive with upto 10GB plus capacity. By 'true USB', I mean, you don't need to have Zen Vision drivers installed on target computer. You just click few buttons on it and then connect it any computer the way you would connect a Flash drive. Then drag and drop your files. (I am using this to create an additional back up of my important files!)  ** You have a nice FM tuner built in so I don't have to worry about paying too much for songs.  ** There are multiple ways to move media/files to Vision M. Being Windows user, it is pretty intuitive to work with Vision M  ** I think Vision M is little bulkier but I think that is the right size that fits well in your hand. The control buttons are also comfortable to work with.  ** This is also going to hold all of our digital photos and some family videos. This, and iPod Video both, can be hooked up to any TV to share your pictures and vidoes to any friend, family or relative when you are visiting.  Problems?  * It is difficult to get choices while buying accessories for Vision M. * You must have Windows XP *****SP1****** or higher otherwise it just does not work with your computer.  The last but not the least, why I let him buy Vision M- is to encourage competition. I don't want Apple to sleep like a monopoly (It seems to me that they are turning into it, otherwise why wouldn't they include an AC adapter with iPod Video! It would not cost them more than $2 per piece! There is no point for making iPod users pay 15 plus dollars for it for buying it separately!!)  In short, this is a preety good hand-held media player.

<Title>Unfortunate Shipping.... Phenomenal Device!!!
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yes yes yes they shouldn't be selling them before they can stock them, however IT'S WORTH THE WAIT!!!! SO WHY GIVE THE PRODUCT A BAD RATING WHEN THIS ISN'T A PLACE TO REVIEW THE SHIPPING!!!!!!!!  It's unfortunate that idiots come on here and write a review NOT on the PRODUCT but just to complain about slow shipping!  I ordered mine on April 8th and it didn't ship until May 3rd, it arrived on the 5th.  I was excited I got an InvisibleShield fullbody cover for mine!  HIGHLY recommended, it's literally invisible and only takes maybe 10 minutes max to perfectly get it on the player, when it dries it's never going to let your expensive investment get a scratch on it!  but that's off topic, this mp3 player ROCKS!!!!  I have about 16gb of music on my computer and I put about 10 gbs onto my Vision:M it couldn't have been easier!!!  I must admit I haven't figured out how to get zencast videos to transfer onto it, and I had to update my Codecs and Quicktime to convert videos onto the little thing.  DonnieDarko in DivX format took about 20minutes to convert and transfer onto the Player.  the screen is beautiful!!!  you can easily click your way through your library and strike up a playlist (Much like you would on your computer in windows media player)  and save that playlist if you feel the need to do so.  A beautiful feature I LOVE LOVE LOVE is you can take a picture from your PICS Folder and if you'd like to you can APPLY IT AS YOUR WALLPAPER!!  That's a great little creature feature that I love, Jimi Hendrix is hanging out on my screen at the moment.  The battery lasts a long time, with all my fidgeting and playing around for the day I'm sure I'll only get 10 hours out of it, but if I was on a long roadtrip (I.E. put the player on shuffle and on hold so the screen is completely black) I'm sure you can easily get 15 hours out of it.  I do recommend getting New headphones I have a pair of SPRKPLG Ear Plugs from Koss, they're cheap($20) and they almost completely shut out outside noises.  I've also set up my Radio tuner, it scanned and created presets and you can label each radio station too if you feel like it.  The equalizer is a godsend too! In normal it was still too bass happy for me I like my mids and highs so I put it on vocal, or jazz both are a good setting for rock or jazz etc, the bass boost would be more for the Rap crowd, not my taste but to each their own.  Lets seee, yeah it's pretty simple click and drag from MY MUSIC to the creative zen Music folder, quick transfers! lightning fast, faster than my MPIO and Sandisk FlashDrives!  I must admit when I add afew folders to a playlist at a time it takes a little pause to complete, and when watching a movie it pauses for up to 10 seconds before it plays again.  That is a little bothersome but patience is a virtue and if you're watching a movie you'll probably be watching it all the way through anyways.  It feels solid in my hand, it's thicker than the Ipod which I actually like, I don't feel like I'm going to break it.  beautiful design and hopefully when Creative reorganizes their priorities in the next quarter, they'll supply more stores and online stores, with more than enough Vision:Ms they could KILL IPOD if they just get on the right track with Distribution!!!!  Thanks for reading and remember, if you're patient you won't mind the wait, it's really a trip playing with this thing!  I'm in love with it!

<Title>Dude this is a great player
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have just got this player and I will say right now that is awesome. It is able to pretty much everthing that an I-Pod can except for games.  If you dont mind not having games, then this player is twice as good as its sister player the I-Pod. The main object that sets it apart is the fact that it has a built in FM radio and microphone. The recording quality is amazing. The screen is the same size as I-Pod's but it is clearer. another great function is the way you dont have to use I-Tunes. It uses windows and any MP3 formated song. Video playback is awsome. compatible formats such as: WMV9, MPEG1/2/3/4-SP, Motion JPEG, DivX and Xvid. The battery life for video is about 2x lnger than that of the I-Pod. Photo campatiable also and able to compose slide shows. With an Audio/Video out cable (comes with most new DVD players) you can easily plug the player right in to your TV. Simple and easy to use and not to mention $50 less than the 30gb I-Pod video it is a great player that can hold all of you media.   Amazon.com seems to be the cheepest place to find one at about $250.

<Title>NICE!
<Date>Wed May 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Around x-mas time i wanted an MP3 player, a good one, i did a little reasearch and found the Toshiba gigabeat, it was great and sound quality improved after awhile, it was a little flimsy, but over it was great, until the headphone port broke after 4 months, i proptley bought it to Bad(best)Buy and replaced it with the video iPod, thought i try, i was not happy with it at all, it had crappy sound quality, and i didnt like iTunes.  That same day i found the Creative Zen Vision:M and loved it. did a little resarch no immediate problems.  Bought it yesterday and synced everything to it, videos and all.  no problems except i accedentally unplugged it  while it was syncing and it caused it to freeze alot but i reinstalled it and everything works great. Sound quality is da best, screen is also da best, FM radio with great reception, Voice recorder is also great if ur into that kinda stuff, u can password protect ur (dirty) videos to keep from snoopers, and i love it and its muy better than igay.

<Title>Creative Zen Vision:M
<Date>Thu May 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since most of the reviews of this product are either a) out-of-date or b) really more of a review of amazon's shipping techniques, I felt it necessary to write a cohesive, up-to-date review of this product.  Summary:  The Creative Zen Vision:M is a multi-award-winning mp3 player for good reason. CNet, one of the market's leading reviewers, gave this the award for Best In Show in the Mp3 and Portable Video Category, as well as the Best of CES and Editor's Choice award, all for 2006. The Apple iPod Video was one of the other products reviewed. Overall, the Creative Zen Vision:M is a better product than anything else on the market. And while it did cost more than the iPod originally, the price has come down to equal, giving you few reasons not to buy it.  The Interface:  The interface of the Vision:M is extremely ergonomic and easy to use. The touchpad's sensitivity is easily adjusted and comfortable to navigate through any menu. Holding down on the top or bottom of the touchpad will activate fast scrolling and smaller movements are controlled by running your finger up and down. Selections are made by tapping the touchpad. In addition, the Vision:M has six buttons: One for play/pause, a next/previous arrow on either side of the touchpad, a menu button, a back button, and a customizable shortcut button. In addition, all the menus are fully customizable so you can maximize your own browsing preferences.  The Performance:  The Vision:M's screen is incredible. With six times as many colors as the iPod, the difference is easily visible. I compared the same video clip on my Vision:M to my friend's iPod and could easily tell which screen was better. In addition, the battery life when playing video is up to four times that of the iPod, meaning you can watch feature-length films without charging, and still have enough battery life for hours of music. To test it, I charged the battery fully and then watched The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Extended Edition with the maximum brightness settings. When the movie was done, I listened to an hour and a half of music before the player ultimately died on me. The sound quality is also supurb - something you can expect from a company that specializes in digital audio equipment (chances are the sound card in your computer was made by Creative).  The Features:  In addition to the features offered by the iPod Video, the Vision:M offers a radio am/fm tuner and a radio/voice recorder. While these may not sound that useful, I've used them more than I thought I would, especially the voice recorder. Another incredible feature the Vision:M offers over the iPod is complete compatibility and integration with Windows. You can transfer songs, tags, and album art from your Windows Media Player library as well as sync a calendar with Outlook to carry with you. It also comes bundled with its own software for transferring files. Unlike the iPod, the Vision:M offers support for a large library of filetypes - where the iPod only supports its own formats and has to reformat your files to make them compatible, the Vision:M rarely (if ever) has to do so - even Xvid/DivX formats will play! Unfortunately for you Mac users, Creative has yet to release a set of drivers for Mac OS, but reports say they're currently developing them.  The Quick Review:  Pros: Ample battery life Clear, bright, colorful display Customizable menus Ergonomic interface Comes in five colors Excellent sound quality Same price as iPod  Cons: Slightly thicker than the iPod Not Mac compatible Only comes in 30GB - iPod offers a 60GB model Few accessories (can find more on eBay, ship from overseas)  The Bottom Line: The iPod comes with a huge culture identification behind it that the Vision:M just doesn't have, so if you're looking to be a part of that culture regardless of the quality of the product, there's no reason not to buy the iPod. It's still a good product. Also if you're looking for a massive library of accessories, the Vision:M isn't for you. But if what you're looking for is a high quality, affordable media player that won't let you down and will consistently outperform the competition, the Vision:M is your best choice.

<Title>great value mp3 player
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is my 2nd mp3 player from creative. THe first was a zen xtra 30gb which I spilt milk over and that was that. I was torn between this and the Ipod video but the radio and voice recorder along with the battery life for video sealed the deal, not to mention the lack of a charger with the IPod?? I also like to use this device to stream svis to my TV, I can download movies on the PC and then watch on the TV, you will need a cable for this, my old one from my Sony camcorder did the job nicely. The touchpad takes a little getting used to but it's easy enough and the software is simple and responsive. It's a perfect size, I would not want anything smaller to be honest. The only thing I don't like is to dim the screen ( to save batteries ) you have to lock the device which is a pain cos then you have to unlock again to skip a song and then lock it once again. Apart from this minor issue, I recommend this highly and it appears to be much better value than the Ipod when you take into account all the extra features.

<Title>Amazing MP3 player
<Date>Sat May 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of debating between the iPod and the Creative Vision: M before deciding on the Creative.  With the prices now equal, I think there's really no reason not to go with the Creative.  The player is gorgeous, feels solid, doesn't have the stupid scratchable chrome to worry about, it has a very intuitive and simple to use interface, the sound quality is amazing, and what comes in the box is way better than the iPod (better headphones, a wall charger, good documentation).  I think the only thing you give up is the ability to sync with iTunes.  If you don't care about this, then it's a no-brainer, go with the Creative.  I'm very happy with my player, an alternative for those who don't want to say baaaa when Steve Jobs touts the next big thing.

<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was going to title this review "Amazing MP3 player", but I realized that this is much more than that.  This product blows my mind with how good it is.  First off, the sound quality is amazing.  It has a custom EQ, which is something I love, and the earbuds it comes with take a bit of getting used to, as in how to put them in, but once you do, you will be amazed at how great everything sounds.  Secondly, the screen.  It is absolutely gorgeous, and shows amazing color.  Watching videos is terrific because of how good everything looks.  It's nice and bright, and is very slick when it fades to darkness.  When you put the Vision M on hold, the screen actually turns off to conserve battery life, which is great.  Speaking of the battery life, it's great.  I don't see why anyone could pass this product up, it's amazing.  If you're not interested in the iPod, pick this one up.

<Title>Thank you Vision M (The Destroyer) **UPDATED**
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i'am one of those who seek the best product in its category even if i have to pay more. The ZEN VISION M is one of those best products in the MP3 field. when i first decided to buy an mp3 player, first of all like everybody and without thinking and comparing i bought the ipod nano. i was looking for a small mp3 player with a descent storage and of course it must be good looking. After, having the nano for two months, i got so bored. the nano can't hold anything else except music and photos that must be seen on 1.5 inch screen therefore you will need a loop if you want to view your pictures. i sold the nano to one of my friends and i got the san disk sansa e260, excuse me san disk but that thing is suck. tha material from which that thing was made can't compete with other mp3 player in the market. the e260 gives you that very cheap look although it costs me 220 USD. i returned tha sansa back to best buy and i decided to spend a little bit more and get something with a video (fully equipped) and a big screen. i started comparing between the 2 most rivals in the market, the ipod video and the ZEN Vision M. finally, i decided to buy the VISION M for the reasons below:  1-the vision M is equipped with an FM tuner with a perfect reception for 70% of the channels.  2-the vision M is equipped with an FM recorder so you can record your favorite radio show, song or game and listen to it later.  3-the vision M is equipped with an excellent voice recorder. i made a test for the voice recorder in Best Buy, i recorded my voice talking in the middle of a crowd and WOW i can still hear my voice clearly  4-the 2.5 inch LCD(high definition)screen is very clear and sharp that you can see your pictures very vivid plus, you have a zoom in feature. so i don't need a loop anymore!  5-the player is customizable. you can change the defalut backgrounds with any picture uploaded on your player. Plus, the player comes equipped with 6 different backgrounds and fonts.  6-the Vision M is not scratches and fingerprints magnet like the ipods.  7-the included software is very easy to use. i got used to itunes and when i used the software included i found it pretty much similar and i dealt with it like if i have been using it long time ago.  8-the player comes with a wall charger!! thank you so much creative for giving the player's buyer his rights. the ipod video doesn't come with a wall charger, you have to buy it seperately for around 30 USD, ipods are charged with the included USB cable which is ridiculous because i remember one time i was in a hotel and i couldn't listen to my ipod because the thing ran out of battery and i had no access to computers.  9-sound quality is pretty much the same, but the included speakers with the creative are prettier than the ipod.  10-the accessories for the Vision M started to show up in stores, DLO company made till now 2 different cases for it. plus, many different cases that you can find online especially on Amazon.com.  11-the Vision M has better battery life, lasts 1 - 1.5 hours more than the ipod video when playing videos and more hours when you play music  12-The vision M has one of the best features that ever came in an mp3 player before..you can search for your song alphabetically. plus, you can click on the vertical touch pad and a keyboard will apears on which type the name of your song using the touch pad and the player will look it up for you whereever this song exists. Isn't that excellen?   Conclusion: the vision M offers you all the Ipod Video features plus the list above. for the same price. you pay 300 USD for both!!!! the Vision M from my opinion worth every penny sipmly because if you want to buy some accessories for the Ipod video to make it with the same features equipped in the Vision M you will have to spend at least 120 USD over the initial 300 USD to add the fm tuner and the voice recorder and you will never have zoom feature or customizable player.  Some Remarks: -they say that the itunes is one of the pros of the ipods, i don't know why, this software can be downloaded for free even if you don't have an ipod!!! -they say that the accessories is on of the pros of the ipods, i don't know who's going to buy all these cases and speakers offered in the market by everybody? -they say that the ipods are easier to use. Feel this one and try it anywhere and you will find very easy to use and even easier. i hope that my review can be helpful. thank you creative for making such an excellent product and saving the customers from this bad monopoly called iPods...  P.S: I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT "I'AM ALMOST SOMETHING" THAT THE BACK AND THE FRONT OF THE SAN DISK SANSA E200 LOOK GREAT,I AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE AND THE DESIGN OF THE THING IT SELF LOOKS PRETTY BUT THE MATERIALS THAT THAT THING WAS MADE OF SEEM TO BE VERYYY CHEAP, THE SCROLL WHEEL MADE SOME CRACKY NOISES WHEN USING IT IN SWITCHING BETWEEN MENUS AND ALSO IT WASN'T SMOOTH AT ALL. THE BACK OF THE SANSA IS MADE OF LIQUID METAL WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO RESIST SCRATCHES WHICH I LIKE, BUT WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS THAT THIS BACK AND THE WHOLE PLAYER GIVES YOU THAT FEELING THAT THE PLAYER IS CHEAP AND CERY CHEAP BUT OF COURSE I AGREE THAT THE SANSA E200 HAS MUCH BETTER VALUE THAT IPOD NANO..  Regarding the accessories i placed an order for an awesome silicone case from DLO.com and i received it yesterday.. the case fits my vision M perfectly and i got the case on time wih no hassles.

<Title>Wonderful player, looks great
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Setting up and charging the player was a breeze.  The included software is quite manageable, but I actually prefer using the plugins that Real has for their player to transfer files to the Zen.  Its nice to have an option of software to transfer files to the player. The touch wheel takes a second to get used to, especially the "tap" feature that functions like an "enter" key when you want to access a file.  But an Ipod "wheel" takes time to get used to as well, and  I believe that the interfaces are comparable.  file access seems to take up to 2 or 3 seconds, possibly longer if its searching for video files. For someone interested in an alternative to the omnipresent Ipod, this is a great item.  You can also blow people away buy playing your videos on this very vibrant screen.  I've shown just the demos to people and they are amazed, watching a show on this tiny screen is not all that tough on the eyes because the picture is quite clear.  Transfering video files is equally simple as transfering songs, something I understand the Ipod isn't as adept at. Personally, i still derive a little satisfaction from  having an enjoyable player that doesn't look like everyone else's.  I love telling people what it is, and showing them how it looks and "handles".  A real treat for those looking to buck trends.

<Title>I'm almost fifteen...
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>IPods are Rip-offs   The iPod's not the only music player you can get, It's just that there are MP3 players people have not met. If they just knew what the other players had in store for them, They'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig's pen.  The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites, But why not get a better player with more gigabytes? Sandisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices, Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices.  The Sandisk Sansa E100 has many, many things, An FM radio, recording, and movies make it the king of kings. Does the iPod Nano have this stuff? No, it does not! The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot.  The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal, It has so much more for so much less that it's basically unreal. Radio, recording, and replaceable battery make it a better player, For less than the Nano...are you kidding? It's definitely a Nano slayer.      There's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space, It's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place. FM tuner, voice recorder, and screen make it a great buy, The fact that the Shuffle doesn't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry.  The Creative Zen Vision: M is better than the Ipod Video, Better screen, more features, and better value make it glow. The fact that the Vision: M is thicker doesn't really matter, The features are what make the Vision: M unimportantly fatter.  So you see, my friends, the iPod is a waste of precious time, The fact that Apple cheats you out is basically a crime. They make their iPods fragile just to make them really "cool", Anyone who buys one is just a ridiculous crazy fool.   Facts  1.	Ipods are MP3 players. It seems like people want to separate iPods from other MP3 players. Can iPods play MP3's? If so, it's an MP3 player. 2.	The Creative Zen Vision: M is pretty much the same thing as the iPod with video, but the Zen has much, much more. It has an FM tuner (FM recording), voice recorder, better screen (262,144 colors as opposed to 65,000-very big difference).       Just don't get the iPod Video...this is so much better it's not even funny  P.S. By the way, that "galaz something" guy is incorrect about the Sandisk Sansa E200 series. The front of the unit is more scratch proof than this, and the back of it is an amwsome metal that is stronger than steel! I like how you say that the Zen Vision: M is better than the iPod Video, but the E200 looks very cool, and is a much better value than the Nano. I so so so so so so so hate the Nano.

<Title>Where's the bass? Then I realised...
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had one of these for nearly a week. The first night I was slightly disappointed with the bottom end on my audio tracks. But I persisted, tried different earphones, listened to the same tracks on different devices, and it suddenly dawned on me... I had the bass problem not the Zen Vision M. I was used to hearing boom - with the Vision M I actually hear bass, and the clarity, and sound imagery is exceptional.  My advice is to give this player a chance to retrain your ears. Couple it with a pair of Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 5 Pro's for a truely wonderful listening experience.

<Title>Zen vs. iPod
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched both the 30G Zen Vision M and the 30G iPod. It came down to the replaceable battery for the iPod or the 10X better graphics for the Zen. The fact that you can get FM radio and the fact that you can get it in other colors (wasn't Apple about colors once?) helped too. I spoke with a lot of people whom had old iPods and said the batteries are still going strong. I figure in 5 years I'll be buying something new anyway, and if the battery does die, you can still always plug it in! Really nice graphics. Really fun toy!

<Title>Simply the best
<Date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i did a lot of research on Mp3 players, becaues i didnt want to just throw 400 dollars away on just anything.  Most people are in the whole Ipod craze, and i knew that there had to be something better on the market.  Well, i found it with the creative 30 gig, it's simply the best.  Not only does it have 30 gigs, and holds 15,000 songs, the screen is crystal clear.  It also has many helpful appications such as calender, contacts, and syncs up with outlook.  You can change your background to any picture you want, making your mp3 player customized for you.  I really didnt know what to expect when i got home, ripped the thing open, and begain to install the software.  Is it going to be fast? Easy? Its was both, not only did it find every piece of music and video on my comp (about 10 gigs) it was on the creative in about 10 min, also converting video files.  This is my first time writting a review, but felt i just had to say that creative whips the dog $^@# out of the ipod.  (my buddies says the same, and he had the 60 gig ipod) so ha, to the followers of the ipod, and i welcome the leaders of the creative!!

<Title>Making the choice.
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While the Vision: M and the iPod Video (5G) both have their strengths, neither is the perfect mp3 player.  A quick rundown: The Vision: M has a better interface, better file handling, and a more vibrant screen.  The iPod is slightly slimmer, and perhaps more stylish, and has more accessories and a wider viewing angle from the top.  The screen on the Vision: M is better looking.  Put the iPod and the Vision: M side-by-side with an identical image and it is instanlty clear that the Vision: M is brighter and more vibrant.  The minor downside is that if you angle the screen down or up a little too far, the colors either white-out or invert.  This means that you have to tilt the player just right for optimal viewing.  The iPod colors aren't as rich, but the wider viewing angle doesn't require any particular tilt to see the screen.  Your hand will get tired from constant positioning if you watch a movie on the Vision: M, but your eyes will be a lot happier with the images they are seeing.  As far as storage space is concerned, both units are exactly the same.  Battery life is similar between the two and you won't notice a difference.   Along with storage space and battery life, something else to consider is the user interface.  Apple's player controls are easy to use and very responsive.  The Vision M: has a touchpad, which is also very responsive and easy to use. The 4 buttons surrounding it require some force to depress.  Hopefully the buttons loosen up a bit with use; otherwise, you'll gripe every time you strain to press them.  Despite the good hardware controls, the software interface of the iPod is lacking.  The breadth and depth of the functionality and options available in the Vision: M are better.  Things like themes, folders, navigation options, shuffle options, etc. that are not available in the Ipod stand out on the Vision: M.  As an example, there is no bookmark function for iPod audio unless a file is a specially created "audio book".  If you have a few long audio files (e.g. recorded lectures, etc.) that you want to pause in the middle and then return to later, you're out of luck.  The Vision: M does have a bookmark feature so you can do just that.  On the downside, neither of them will let you bookmark a movie.  Nor will either of them let you bookmark a song within the context of a playlist, a nice feature if you listen to a long playlist, stop in the middle to do something else, and then want to return later to the same song within the playlist.  Apple's iTunes software is awful because if you plug someone else's iPod into your computer you are likely to wipe out all the songs on their iPod.  Once your files go onto the iPod, its almost impossible to get them back out (it is possible to get around this with third party software, but it is a far from perfect solution).  The Vision: M, on the other hand, not only lets you easily transfer files back and forth, but also lets you organize them any way you want in folders on the player.  Since many people have built up a music collection over the years in their own unique folder structures, being able to keep them intact on the player is important.  The iPod is too restrictive since it requires very specific audio and video formats to work with the player.  With the Vision: M, there is no need to spend time jumping through file format hoops.  Finally, the bundled USB adapter of the Vision M: requires a cable and a second adapter to connect.  This means you will tote two things around with you to connect to a computer when all you really need is one.  The iPod has only one cable.  On the other hand, the bundled adapter on the Vision: M allows you to plug into a wall socket to charge.  The iPod requires a completely different adapter to plug into the wall.  It doesn't even come with the player; you have to pay extra.  In the end, there is no clear winner.  If you like style, small size, and choice of accessories, perhaps you'll be happier with the iPod.  If you like control over your files and rich screen color (with a little positioning), perhaps the Vision: M is better.

<Title>I'm done with the Zen Vision M
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Zen Vision M in early March and received it on March 22nd.  I really enjoyed it...until it stopped working two weeks later.  I sent it back to Creative and they sent me a new one.  I really enjoyed that one...until it stopped working a month later.  In both cases, the unit simply froze up and I was unable to turn it on.  Resetting it didn't work either.  The second one got SO hot while charging that it was honestly too hot to hold.  I really wanted to like the Zen Vision M as I like a lot of the features, especially the FM tuner.  However, after having two fail on me in two months, I am returning it to Amazon and exchanging it for an iPod.  In their email response to me, Amazon noted that the problems with the Zen Vision M "are more widespread" than they anticipated so they are not offering replacements but are instead offerering me a full refund.  The Creative customer service team is very slow in responding to issues.  I must commend Amazon for their quick customer service and by doing the right thing by granting me a full refund.

<Title>I LOVE this device
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got the Creative Zen Vision for my b-day. I have to say that I was holding my breathe when it came to believing everything it is suppose to do. I went beyong my expectations. I love the sound quality. Some people have complained about the earphones, but unless they're actually losing their hearing, they are great. The sound is crisp and clear. And the video. Oh My GGGGAAAAWWWWDDD!!! I swear the videos are clearer and brighter and crispier looking than even on my notebook that I've had for just over a year. I LOVE IT and can't wait to play around with the other features.  As for the sensitivity issue, I figured out that if you make the touch pad to "High" sensetivity, it becomes easier to scroll down. I highly and fully recommend this over the iPod.

With reset button stuck on black logo screen.  Cannot switch off.  Unsure what to do next, probably will be returning to amazon and try to obtain a non-defective unit.

<Title>120 days of shear bliss ! 
<Date>Sat May 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this device since February and it is great. Everything it promises and more. I was an MP3 neophyte and studied and looked around before blindly plunking money down on an Ipod. I think we all know from experience that best selling isn't always the case. I stumbled on a review of the Zen Vision M from the CES electronics show and my decision was made.   The video quality is great. I hadn't anticipated using it much but I am now using the video feature everyday, downloading episodes of "Lost" from ABC's website, then watching them at lunch.   The MP3 player is great. I am using it daily at work where I get miserable radio reception. I download the Don and Mike show each day and listen to it the next day at work. Works like a top for any podcast or video cast as well as most any type of music file (Real, MP3, WMA, etc.)   Creative makes great sound cards for your PC, why not a great MP3 player.    The interface will take about a day to get used to but in a very short time you will be flying through the menus.   I haven't used the Outlook Calendar or memos feature yet.   I have used the partitioning capability to allow my MP3 player to also serve as my USB thumb drive.   I haven't had to test the battery life much. With the included wall charger/adapter, you can keep it powered on all day and not rely solely on USB charging/connection (which it also supports.)   The radio gets great reception.   The recording capability is a nice bonus. It has saved me a great deal of time in staff meetings - being able to capture important conversations and retrieve them easily later is quite nifty.   Scanning the Web, there is ample online support for most any issue you might have.  With four months of daily use under my belt, I haven't had any issues.   Summary, if you need a nice high quality MP3 player and don't have to have an Apple Ipod; if you are able to accept high quality over popularity, I would highly recommend the purchase.

<Title>i-Pod Killer
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Creative Zen for about 4 days and I'm loving it!!! The battery is amazing lasting as long as they say on the box. You can extend the battery life if you're listening to music by "locking" the player. It'll turn off your screen, but still play your music. You can make a slideshow and add music to it! The software included makes it all extremely easy to do. Also you don't have to worry if you don't have iTunes cause the Creative accepts Windows Media Player! You can delete pictures right off the Zen without having to hook it up to a PC. You can create playlists without being hooked up to a PC. This thing is amazing!!! I have several friends with iPods jealous of my Zen!! If you're looking for a MP3 player that plays video and does slideshows here it is!!! Now I haven't used the video feature because I've only had it for a couple of days, but I have a co-worker that says the image is better on the Zen over an iPod. There you have it! The Creative Zen is amazing!

<Title>Much better than my Ipod
<Date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I originally bought an iPod video 30gb. For all MP3s not acquired through i-Tunes, it cuts off the last 15 seconds of sound. After working with Apple support, the only option I found was to edit all my files and add 15 seconds of silence at the end. Not a very practical solution. I returned it and bought the Zen M30. Wow, what a difference.  I love the interface. Instead of being limited to i-Tunes, Creative as given multiple options. I love the fact that I can use explorer to copy directly to the player. I can also use the software included with the M30.   There are multiple options for acquiring music. This player can use Yahoo Music, Napster or PlayforSure. Since I already use Rhapsody, I download the music I want and use the explorer plug in to transfer music. Making playlists is much easier on the M30 as well. The software is very user friendly and the learning curve is short. Without ready any directions, I was able to master it in about 5 minutes.  The bottom line is that I am glad the iPod didn't work out. This is a much better player and gives all the freedom to the user to choose what services to are best for downloading music and videos. I give 5 Stars to the Zen M30.

<Title>Positives far outway the negatives...
<Date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>!!! The screen...awesome.  Just awesome clarity and color.  Photos pop off the screen and nicely encoded movies look great.  Sound quality is quite good.  I like the fact that there's a radio and you can make one selection and have it go through and automatically program the stations that come in strong.  Great if you travel a lot. Voice recorder is a cool option too.  Most movie formats can be played on the player without any conversions.  I'd like to be able to arrange the folders in the player. For some reason, the computer software just won't let you cut and paste inside the player. Once they're uploaded...that's it. Unless you want to delete them, reorganize them on the computer and then reupload them to the player.  The Vision:M is ID3 driven, so it doesn't matter how they are arranged as far as folders and how the player sees them, but it would be nice for other purposes to be able to arrange them if I wanted or needed.  !! The touch sensitive pad is just ok.  It's often hit or miss, sometimes jumping over where you want to go and other times not quite making it.  I might of preferred buttons in place of their touch pad.   The DJ mode seems odd/lacking.  Random play all is the only useful option.  Though "Album of the day", "most popular", and "rarely heard" are interesting, I doubt I'll ever use anything but random.   Now, I realize this point may be asking for a bit much, but it would be a cool option if there would be some way to keep files from being included in the random play. Possibly by putting a code in the ID tag that would keep them out of random.  I have 2 gigs of trance on my player, so every 4th song ends up being trance when I do a random play all. Also, if you have audio book mp3's, you usually wouldn't want these popping up and playing during random.  !!! Sometimes it seems to freeze up for a bit. Especially when looking at pictures.  Then it will all of a sudden "kick-in" and process all of your "touches" which leaves you sometimes far from where you wanted to be.  Maybe some of these are minor squabbles.  But some just leave me scratching my head.  If you can deal with what to me are annoyances...You've got yourself a new player. If Creative did some software revamping and took care of the freeze ups, the Vision:M would get 5 stars out of me.

<Title>You can keep your iPod
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my Zen Vision: M today and have been fiddling with it all day. As my first MP3 player I decided to halt on getting the iPod (like everyone else in the world it seems) and decided to do some research instead on more encompassing players. I wanted one with quality, versatility, a good design and competitive features & price. . . not hype for my money. It paid off. I was incredibly impressed by customer reviews on product comparisons for the Zen Vision (which were better than those given for the iPod) and decided to order it. This player has everything I would ever need. The sound and picture/video quality is outstanding. There is a clip on the Creative site which is exactly the picture/sound quality you get when you turn it on and play it. Brightness can also be adjusted more than how it originally arrives to you which impressed me because it was already great when I initially turned it on. Custom and preset equalizer settings are also a plus. You do forget that you are looking at a mini screen and I can't wait to start downloading movies, clips to take around with me. The Zen also has a strong bass that is a must hear.   I ordered the pink one and it was actually smaller than what I was expecting to receive, which is even better for me. I bought the silicon jacket, which although nice is a bit slippery when you first use it, I almost dropped mine as soon as I put it on while I was talking to someone and had it in my hands. I also purchased the arm/wrist band for exercising or walking about.  The only drawback I can give the Zen Vision is maneuvering through the menus with the touchpad. The touchpad is incredibly sensitive which can be both good and bad. It's a bit slick and quick but that too can be adjusted somewhat. It does take some time to get use to it. Menus aren't intuitive as probably the iPod but if you are a tech savvy person it isn't much of a hinderance but a bit of patience is needed. I am thrilled that the software that comes with it is easy to use and that the player itself is compatible with Napster to Go, I literally drag and drop my songs and go. Transfering other media onto the player is also a breeze.   Overall, I am happy with my player and I am glad that I wasn't hit with the iPod bug and from the looks of it will never get near one thanks to Creative. If you are someone that feels that the iPod cannot be beat I would suggest taking a look at this player. If iPod is the standard for you this would in all likelihood be a strong close competitor but truly a first place all in one player for me.

<Content>I bought this mp3 player after several researches.  I bought it on May 20, 2006 and immediately fell in love with it. It has everythings  that Ipod has and more. One of the nicest thing about this player is FM radio, it has auto scan and sound is great.  It has higher screen resolution than Ipod and the video is also outstanding.  I had downloaded several videos and movies and they have dvd quality outputs.  I would recommend this player to anyone who is looking to buy one. The one downside on purchasing this player is accessory, not too many choice available.

<Content>Have only owning creative labs mp3 players my whole life, I can tell you that this is a great company that values you. Creative labs has been great to me, and i couldn't turn my back on them. This lead me to buy a Zen VisionM over an apple video. The sound quailty is the best on the market, and with more clours to choose from, you can be differnt. The video is crystal clear, and is very bright(can be adjusted). The Vision has better sound quailty, more colours in its display, and differnt color options. Apple only has tons of third party support, but how many accesories can one have? Get the vision.

<Title>Easy to Use
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have really enjoyed my Creative vision so far.  I have only had for little less then a week, but already I think it is great.  The main reason that I chose the Creative Zen Vision instead of the iPod was because I can use any music service and I am not tied to the iTunes.  The rip software that is provided with the Zen is so easy to use (and I am not a tech person at all); I ripped all my cd's (600+ songs) in a matter of a few hours and the synch process was very easy.  I had no desire to throw it out the window and I have had this urge with every other mp3 player I have owned.  The other great feature is that it has an fm tuner; which is helpful if you want to listen to the radio at the gym or somewhere.  The screen resolution and sound quality are great as well.  If found the touch pad very easy to use, although I have no experience with the iPod for comparison.

<Title>Finally, the perfect mp3 player
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I started with a Creative Jukebox many years ago.  I have tried many brands, including iPod.  This is the best yet.  I tried a new 60gb Video iPod.  Returned it, as I was very disappointed.  The hardware was ok, but the software for video stank, and the support and help files for video stank.  iPod is geared for iTunes...in other words, buy their stuff only.  There are the "podcasts", which want to make you think they are unique to iPods...and they are not.  They are RSS feeds, available all over the net.  NPR has great stuff with RSS feeds.  Pros of the Creative Vision M:  Excellent sound Great battery life Great screen...I can see it without my glasses! Excellent design Excellent user interface Good accessory availability from Creative store or eBay Good size and feel Nice "docking" feature...maybe amps or docking stations available soon? Has wide connector like iPod, but uses adapter that plugs into Vision, then you plug in supplied ac adaptor, common miniusb connector, or a plug that enables you to output stereo sound and video (unlike iPod, which does not have that feature). Better video than iPod. RSS feeds can be used (zencasts or podcasts). Firmware upgrade gives you audiobook support from Audible.com. A long list of pros.  Cons: Built in battery....not user replacable. Short warranty...1 year parts, only 90 days labor.  You can go to zencast.com and get software to put RSS feeds into your Zen.  I love this device.  People are brainwashed into thinking that the iPod is the original hard drive mp3 player and the best.  It is neither.  Recommended highly.

<Content>I saw the Vision: M in a store and thought it rocked. I've looked at about 10 MP3s, and this has many more features than most other ones. I didn't buy it right away because the salesperson wasn't helpful. I'm not very technically savvy yet (this would be my first MP3) and can't find the answers to my questions anywhere. I want to know if I can download from iTunes to the Vision: M, and if I can "copy" songlists from my friend's iPod. Also, would I be able to download from NPR or  old Seinfeld episodes?

<Title>I'm free, finally free! Anybody want a used iPod?
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've run the gamut of MP3 players; Muvos, Cowon and finally iPods (Nano and Video). After struggling with iTunes and the crazy things it does to my music collection (like for instance I can't play 90% of my library on my laptop now because its not "authorized"!) I finally decided I was ready to take charge of my own MP3s!  Somebody in a very helpful review mentioned that this was the MP3 player to get if you want to have control over your collection and they were so right.  So here are the wonderful things I can do with the Vision M that I can't do with my iPod:  1) Musicmatch, I finally get to use my beloved musicmatch which I abandoned when I couldn't get it to work with my iPods. 2) Volume levelling... doesn't everybody else notice they have to reach for their iPod on every other song to adjust the blaring or whisper quiet volume?   3) Delete, edit, create playlists; how wonderful that I don't have to remember what I want to do to my playlist til I get home and hook my iPod up to iTunes... I can just make the adjustment on the spot now! I must have died and gone to heaven. 4) Listen to music while recharging 5) Watch my videos in bold crisp beautiful color, I didn't realize how clunky videos looked on the iPod til I saw them on the Vision M. 6) Wonderful bass boost, with the Vision the sound is so much fuller and deeper than the slightly shiny sounding iPod. 7) No more converting to iPod format, many videos will copy over with no conversion at all.  Nowhere near as difficult to get videos onto the Vision M. 8) No more iTunes purchases, now I can buy my music anywhere and still be able to use it on my Vision M. Especially Rhapsody which is my favorite way to buy tracks... after I've listened to them for a while and really decided I like them. 9) Shuffle within a playlist (as far as I can tell the shuffle on iPod will only work on its entire music collection!).  Now I'm not saying this baby is perfect, but its such an improvement from the iPod/iTunes world that I just had to give it 5 stars.  So to be fair, things that are not so hot about the Vision M:  1) Hard to buy accessories in stores. 2) Whats with this weird adaptor/dock thing that you have to plug in the bottom to charge it or connect USB?  It would be so much nicer to just plug the cables directly into the Vision M. 3) I am finding that this isn't easily used as a backup drive, the iPod was really nice in that regard.  I don't really understand why they make it so difficult... you have to format it and then it is hard to find the place to put your data, kind of silly! Maybe I will keep the iPod just for backups, I don't know. 4) Lacks the iPod Wow factor, but then my iPods have lived in their cases for 10 months so they aren't exactly making people drool since nobody can see them anyway!  I'm thinking Wow factor is fun but overrated...   In conclusion, I am a convert and will be using this for all my music needs once the case and skin comes in the mail ;)  This baby is geek heaven and us control freaks love it too!  Fashionistas may want to stick with the iPods...

<Content>I have over 200 CD on my computer that are in the WMA "Lossless" format.  After several emails and finally a long distance call to Creative I find out that they do not support this format and can not help.  They said that "maybe" if I gat a Codec from Microsoft that would help, but they could not tell me which one to get.  The only reason to buy this product is b/c it is MS compliant and in theory should work better with XP and other applications.  However, I have learned it is no more compliant then IPOD.  Since this player is not fully MS compliant like they stated I am taking it back and going with the smaller and more ergonomic IPOD.  Bottom line buy the IPOD it smaller and better!

<Title>My Creative Zen Vision: M is with me at all times.
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned a Creative Zen Nomad Xtra 40GB for about 3 years and still use it for music programming at my office, but my Vision: M is with me most of the time.  I use it in the car, in the office, at the house, and it sits in my suit pocket when I am in Court, just in case I should get a few minutes to finish watching a movie.    The battery life is adequate for day to day use.  The Zen Vision: M comes with an AC charger that is much faster than USB charging.  In practice, you will not run out of battery life during a day of heavy use unless you are watching movies.    The sound quality is remarkable.  I have found myself re-ripping my music to higher bitrates as you can easily detect compression artifacts.  Although the enclosed headphones are OK as earbuds go, you really need some nice headphones, such as noise canceling or in the ear noise isolating earphones in order to get the full effect of the audio quality.  Like the iPod they need to start including some better earphones, even if it increases the cost.  You will need screen protection film or a case with a clear window to protect the screen from scratches.  The player is suprisingly tough as I have accidently dropped it onto concrete or onto wooden floors on numerous occasions without any damage.  I once dropped it down a staircase where it landed with a hard thud on the corner, and it didn't do anything to the player.

<Title>Surprise... High quality recordings!!!!
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got this little wonder, and immediately tested the voice recorder.  As a classical musician, this feature was high on my list for what I wanted in an MP3 player (for recording practice sessions as well as concerts).  Needless to say, I played a few minutes worth of live piano music, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality of the recording was comparable to that of my MD recorder, with which I use a high grade microphone.  Who would've guessed!  This test, however, was at close range... I'm not sure what the recording would be like in a concert hall.   I do not regret my decision to go with the Creative Zen over the Ipod... the Zen actually looks a lot better in person than I thought.  And while it is about a third inch thicker than the Ipod, it is still quite small, and why does that little bit matter anyway?  You're getting this thing to listen to music, not fuss over a few millimeters.  Oh, and the screen is awesome, as the others have said.  Overall sound quality is wonderful.  Controls are easy to use.  There is one soft key for which you can assign the function ... this I really like!  You actually get to decide what is more important to you as the individual!  The only thing I would quibble with is the inability to edit tracks and playlists on the device itself.  But maybe after I spend a bit more time with it, I could figure that out, too.  So far, this has been a really good buy....

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I stopped in my local Best Buy store and inquired a bunch about EVERY different hard drive based MP3 player that they had.  The good reason to get an iPod was for very smooth synching with computer to iPod.  Phillips because it was a little cheaper than the ipod with the same features, except can't play video.  But they did point out the Creative Zen Vision: M because it had the same features as the iPod: video, pictures, etc.  But it also has a built in FM tuner for the same price as the iPod.  Plus when i tried it out, the software is very easy to use and quite fast.  Definately look into this!

<Title>The Winning MP3player - Hands down!
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Regardless of the color you pick, the ZVM is the winning MP3 player hands down.  CNet has already confirmed this with the 2006 best player award. The one aspect that really makes the ZVM stand out from the rest is the video quality and size ratio. By size ratio, I mean the usuable screen area is almost as wide as the player itself making for an incredible image size. I haven't seen any iPod come quite this close yet.  Also what stands out with the ZVM is it's array of features including FM.  Many snicker at the FM, however the option is there whenever the mood hits.  Try listening to FM with an iPod. I would therefore compare this unit with other players in the industry more marketable like Toshiba's Gigabeat and the rest, but clearly not any Apple products.  It IS like comparing Apples and Peaches and all Apples compared have ended up a tad bit sour when matched to the ZVM.  The font choice and clarity of the ZVM will astound you only adding to the incredible video aspect.  It is a pleasure to see as well as operate.  Now about the most important issue...audio.  Compared to most players, it is about the same I must admit however syncs flawlessly with the incredible software provided.  I was a bit disappointed however with the performance of many Musicmatch downloads since there is a hit and miss issue with MM downloads as I have pointed out extensively on the Web in other areas.  This is not believed to be a ZVM issue therefore I will not discredit it for now. The fact it is MS compliant makes it all the more marketable with Windows and other Windows and non iTunes applications (which is about 90% of them).  The only cons I have with this player is the high gloss black panel (on black models only) which scratches easily.  Although this is the most talked about con, it still is better than any iPod black panel. A little protection will however solve the problem. Another negative aspect is the built-in battery.  What is wrong with every manufacturer out there? Don't they realize the user craves for replaceability?  Apple loves to ignore the masses themselves, so give Creative some credit..at least their Micro model and the Vision model deviate from this. The last con is the sync adapter.  It's intuitive, however not practical. It is not case-friendly (except for the Creative cases), its also bad for those with poor memories and lose things.  If you lose the adapter, and don't have the dock, you're stuck! Any adaptor required to replace jacks and ports which should be standard just makes no sense to me.  It's like sticking an adapter in a wall so you can install an outlet. Creative was perhaps a way bit too creative designing this, but definately not practible.  So if this may bother you, it's definately something to think about. Despite these cons, the pros outweigh this product so much that I have no choice but to give it five stars.

<Title>what a downer
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this thinking it would be a much better alternative to the ipod, because i hate itunes...boy was i wrong.  After the first week i recieve the vision:M it froze up and i couldnt turn it on at all, the same problem many have had.  Well, I returned it to amazon for an exchange, and i got the new one.  It worked at first, but the the problems started again.  It freezes quite frequently, and skips, even though an mp3 player isn't supposed to skip.  Well, i've had enough of this bull, im returning my second vision:M and getting a video ipod.  The people that gave this 5 stars seriously dont know a thing about this product...yes it appears much better than an ipod at first, but it give you hell in the end.  Take it from me, just save yourself the trouble and buy something else.

<Title>Creative Zen
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've have my Creative Zen for two weeks now and I love it. I bought it as a present for myself. The one thing I liked over all about it from the beginning was the fact that I didn't have to pay extra to put music on my Mp3 player, like you have to do with an iPod. This is pretty much plug and play and excepts all music files.  So far, I have a little over 1000 songs on there. With features that alowe all music shuffle, or you can select songs by playlists, genera, artist, or album (much like any standard player).   You can store Photos on it, but I have only put one photo on to test it. It lets you take a photo and set it as your wallpaper, but you need to pick a dark photo since you can't change the text color from White. It does show the photos nice and you can zoom in, since 2.5 inch screen is small already.  Video is okay, but I wouldn't really use it unless I had nothing else to use. 2.5 inch makes everything hard to see but it's big enough to atleast enjoy it if you do use it. I had some trouble trying to get it to play a couple of files, but just re-uploading them fixed it.  The FM tuner is cool and I would use that. If you want to listen to a sports game or something like that, it's very handy. Presets up to 30 stations and you can delete others and set new ones. But, if you have your music, can't say how much you will use it then. It's a nice feature, but might never get used.  The battery life is decent. I wish is was longer, but if you just hit play and lock it, it makes the batter last longer. It takes 2 hours to charge, and if you use the ac adaptor, you can chaged it a play it at the same time.  Unlocked Play= 5-7 hours Locked Play= 10+ Hours Video= max of 3 hours if your lucky. Photos= Can't see anyone spending 9 hours looking at photos but it's good for that too.  I didn't use the head phones it came with. They didn't fit my ears and I like my sound blocking one better. If you like the in the ear kind, it comes with them.   It comes with all the cords and software you'll need, except for the video cords, but it has an ac cord for charging in the wall. The nice carrying case doubles as a screen cleaner, but I left the screen protecter it came with on. I don't wanna damage the screen so be carefull. It will scratch easly.  Over all, the price of 30$ then the iPod auctally pays off in the end. You have good battery life and decent video playing ability. The FM tuner is good and so is viewing photos. It comes with the power cords and a nice carrying case.  Note* I rather enjoy mine and I've never liked the iPod to begin with. Do some of your own research and read many reviews before you spend $300+ on something like this.

<Content>The small difference in price is nothing compared to what you get for it.  In addition to including a charger, adapter and cord, the music management software included here is wonderful.  Moving media from computer to handheld is a real breeze.  And the record feature is also extremely useful.  Only quibble:  the record level and quality are fixed.  In a loud environment, the recordings are quickly overwhelmed and overloaded to the point of distortion.  Great value!

<Title>A teenager's review
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>wow, looking at the Creative Zen Vision: M makes me so anxious for it's arival via UPS.  I used to own a Creative Zen Touch and it worked great.  It was a very reliable MP3 player; It never skipped, nice sound, and has a very simple design that works great.  The reason why I'm getting the Vision M is because It's a HUGE upgrade from the Touch.    1.) Color!!! I love color screens, and that's one of the Touch's big downfalls.  2.) Video!!!!! can anyone say "sweeeeeeeeet"? I know video is the new thing in MP3 players, but where can a kid easily get 300 dolars to see it in the works?   3.) Voice Recorder!! this is a nifty feature that I don't see in the Ipod unless you buy yet another accesory for it. On the CVM (Creative Vision M), it's built in and I've heard the playback sounds great!!  4.) FM radio!!!! this is also a nifty feature that I don't see in the Ipod unless you bue yet another accesory for it. On the CVM, there's a built in radio. :D  5.) #3+#4= Record live radio!!!!!! whoa, that's pretty sweet. If you here something you really want on the radio like a song or a segment of news, just choose the record feature and It's yours forever. Great feature!!!  6.) Great Software!!! Since I owned a Creative Zen Touch, I have some of Creative's software. It works sooooo much better than Itunes ever will. No importing your songs every week, comes with a converter, and It doesn't screw up your song list.  The software is very easy to comprehend. kudos to Creative Labs for trying to reach out to the user.   All in all, there are so many reasons why buying a Creative Vision: M is a good idea, but ultimately it's up to you. Almost half the people in my school have Ipods of some sort and complain that is quickly go's out of style, breaks down, or is too much of a hassle to work with. I'm not trying to put Apple down, but people should know what the truth is. Ipods were the "OMG, got to get it" item, but I feel that Creative Labs are going to be the dominent company in the near future. Happy shopping!

<Title>Creative zen vision: m
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased this device, and I was very impressed. It has a number of this that make it better than an ipod, longer battery life, better colors for watching video, extra features such as fm tuner, or microphone. It was also very easy to load and unload music and videos. However just today after having this product for 2 weeks, it froze, and now refuses to work. Although I respect Creative's product and will most likely try to replace my vision:m I would hope that in the future problems like mine would not occur. I hope that my problem is simply an anomally and not something that is likely to any one else's Creative Zen Vision: M.

<Title>I like it better than that pod thingy
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have one of those pod thingies.  It's very nice.  But it is very difficult to operate where I use these things most... while driving.  You must also utilize Itunes to manage your music.  I have thousands of music and audiobooks.  It is no fun to go through all of these and select one at a time to decide which go to the device and which do not.  That said, the pod does let me play by composer.  I do enjoy all kinds of music but I am a real classical junkie.  So this is a pretty nice option.  So on to the Creative unit.  The first thing that I checked for was the availability of batteries for the device.  My Ipod must have the battery replaced by the factory.  I will never purchase one again for this single reason.  The Creative folks have one.  It is pricey but I don't plan on replacing the batteries all that often.  Files can be transferred in various ways.  You can use a couple of applications that come with the unit or just drag files over through your Windows Explorer.  I really like this feature.  While I won't be using the device for video, I do like to carry pictures around of my family and the telescopes that I make.  It's a snap to put any files that you want on the device. And the color display is very bright and easy to see.  I didn't expect that I'd be using the device for this.  I just wanted lots of space for mp3 files.  But it turned out to be something that I will indeed use.  Contacts?  Wha?  This is cool! This is another unexpected delight.  I could never copy my contacts to my pod.  This was simple folks.  And all my contact information complete with phone numbers and addresses are right at hand.  I can fit about 4800 "songs" on the unit.  I rip at 192kb/sec so my files are a bit larger than normal.  And classical music often plays longer than your normal 3 to 4 minute pop song.  This is fine for me.  I would have purchased a 40Gb unit had Circuit City one for sale.  There are two things you should be aware of before you lay down your cash:  1)If you are a classical junkie, you'll not be able to sort your files by composer.  This is really painful.  What I had to do was create playlists for my favorite composers. A utility that comes with the utility allows you to resort your files into folders according to a couple of choices you make. This is a nice feature.  I reorganized my folders according to genre. I really would like to sort files on the fly by composer.  Creative... are you listening?  2) I purchased the unit at Circuit City.  I drove 90 miles round trip to get there and back.  When I returned home, I could not navigate the menus on the device.  I took the unit back the next day and showed the geekie squawed that it did not work. They agreed and sent me home with a new unit.  After I got home, I discovered the new unit would not navigate the menues either.  I'm a techie and I've never been so embarrassed...but I'll lay the blame squarely on the documentation.  The manual says that you need to tap the pad to select menu items.  To me tap, means tap.  I tap my mousepad on my computer and it works.  On the Creative, you have to put significant force and almost hit it.. okay a very sharp tap.  Once I figured it out, I got into the system and found an option to be more sensitive. It is definitely not as sensitive as the pod; it requires more force, which I definitely like. Now I have something that I like.  I purchased the little button extension and can use it in the car at night.  One other minor nit is that there are a left and right button available.  Forward and reverse?  Next and previous?  They sometimes work on things but not where you would expect. So just experiment and take notes.  I just took my Zen on a road trip. It ran great.  I played music all week (charging from a 12vdc adaptor) and it was great.  Get this one.  It's worth it.  Michelle

The Zen Vision is incredible, the screen is so bright, navigation is easy, but could be better, and it plays ALL video not just MP4 (conversion sucks, asks anyone who has to render video)...it has a contact list, calendar, battery life is ground, the sound is wonderful...my only criticism is that you need to throw the Creative headphones in the garbage and get some Shure's, Grado, or Koss PortaPros (at $50, the best headphones for the price in teh world)...  in short - easy to use, easy to navigate, great features, great price, looks good, amazing screen...

<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This creative is awesome, i completely destroys the Ipod, i know from past uses of an ipod. However ,although this item is good i have two downsides to this product. 1. The size of the mp3 is a little outrageous. 2. The reset button on the bottom is a pain, you have to you use a little pin to get it. Otherwise this is an awesome player, all my friends go crazy over it it when they see it. It is a definite buy if your looking for something better than an ipod. Also the music quality is awesome, i havent heard a single crack in th music, but for better quality you should get new earphones the ones the give are not that great sony has very good ones. but anyway also the video quality blows the Ipod video out of the water, it actually feels like you are in the movie theater (kind of). It is a must of your thinkning about buying an Mp3 with video and music capabilities.

<Content>I would recommend the creative player over the IPod.  I found it very user friendly.  It works very well with windows media player, and even allows you to connect to other computers without clearing your media (like the Ipod).  However there are some draw backs, it is very hard to find accessories in your local stores, because of the popularity of Apple.  Also, my player tends to freeze every once in a while.  I must run the battery down, and then it works fine after being recharged.

<Title>A poke in the eye for Apple
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Intro  In today's society the MP3 player has become embedded into our daily lives and there is no shortage in choices of MP3 players.  But why is it that so many companies produce great MP3 players while only one holds a majority of the market share?  Apple has dominated sales since its introduction of its iPod.  Apple is by no means the creator of the MP3 player, as many people are prone to think.  The reason why Apple has grabbed such a huge market share is that it created a trend with their stylish and sleek iPod and its no-brainer graphical user interface (which Apple "borrowed" from Creative, hence the subsequent lawsuit.)  Many companies have tried to create an MP3 player to give Apple a good poke in the eye and one company that might just be able to, is Creative.  With their launch of the Zen Vision: M, iPod fans were suddenly wooed away from their comfort zone because of all the extra features that the video iPod didn't have such as a FM tuner, a screen that displays 264,000 colors vs. the iPod's 65,000 colors, and the myriad file formats that it can play natively.  These features are well enough but are they enough to dethrone the iPod?  Let's look and see.  Design  There is no doubt that the iPod and the Zen Vision: M look spectacularly similar.  They share the exact same dimensions except for the thickness.  The Vision: M is the same thickness of the fourth generation iPod but looks obese next to the video iPod.  There is no doubt that the extra thickness is due to the Vision: M's larger battery and multitude of features.  The iPod is rated for 12 hrs of audio playback while the Vision: M is rated for 14 hrs of battery life and while the iPod is rated for a maximum of 2 hrs of video, the Vision: M is rated for an astonishing 4 hrs of video life.  So the extra cub of the Vision: M is justified.  After lugging the Vision: M around for a week, I did not find it to be uncomfortable to hold in the hand or heavy at all.  It slips comfortably into any pocket.    Creative chose to make the Vision: M in five different colors which include black, white, green, pink, and baby blue.  I opted for the black because it looked the sleekest and classiest.  There have been reports of the black version scratching easily so exercise caution.  The front of the player includes all of the controls, minus the power/hold button, which is located on the top.  The buttons include a play/pause, options, back, shortcut (which is a godsend because it can be customized to do whatever you want) and the FF and RW buttons are located at the edges of the touch pad.  Creative stuck with what it knows best and continues to use its vertical touch strip.  I actually prefer this over the iPod's click wheel but I have to admit it takes some getting used to.  The reason I prefer the touch strip is that you don't have to move your thumb to the center to press the "OK" button.  You can just tap where ever you are on the touch strip and it will respond.  It just a matter of personal preference.  There is a reset button on the bottom of the player but its ridiculously hard to reach and can only be pressed by a thin pointy object, preferably a bent paperclip.  I don't know what Creative was thinking when they put the reset button there because most people don't usually walk around with a pocket of paper clips.    One small issue that I do have with the design of the player is the small extension that is required to sync/charge/display in A/V out.  Though convenient in its own way, it is just another device to lose and to carry around.  Apple has handled this problem better by creating a wall charger that can be used with the sync cable, which means carrying around one less cable.  What irks me about Apple is that they do not include the wall charger with their players.  Creative took the initiative to include a wall charger in their package, which is always welcome.    Features  So the iPod wins in design but where the Vision: M wins is in the screen.  The difference in the amounts of colors that each player displays is breath-taking.  I played around with my cousin's iPod video and though that the screen was good but when I turned on my Vision: M, I was blown away.  The pictures and video positively pop out of the screen, though some pictures are over saturated.  It makes ordinary photos look brilliant and professional on its screen.  Both the iPod and Vision: M display in 320x240 but the Vision displays 640x480 on the television which translates to a crystal clear picture.  Files larger than 320x240 played on the Vision yields some aliasing but it is negligible.  This is applicable for photos too but the aliasing goes away when zoomed in.  One feature I thoroughly enjoyed was the ability to pick any picture and set it as a wallpaper.  The Vision even lets you change the brightness of the picture and add effects such as black and white and sepia to the photo before applying it as a wallpaper.  Pretty nifty.  One thing that irks me to no end is the fact that Creative does not bundle an A/V cable with their player.  I suppose some users will never use the A/V function but they did not have to create a whole different cable just for the Vision: M.  For $18.99, you can pick up the aforementioned cable.  I'll pass because I found that the A/V cable for my father's camcorder works OK.  Sure it only plays audio in mono but hey, it works and it's free.    Other features that may tempt potential iPod buyers include a FM tuner (with a cool reception bar and 32 programmable presets and it can record radio,) voice recording, and compatibility with subscription services, both audio (ie: Napster to go, Starz Vongo.)    One reason why the iPod is such a popular seller is because of the seamless integration with iTunes.  Everything is simplified into one program and opens the user to a world of content.  The iTunes store is simple and beautiful and has been the one defining choice among some users to choose an iPod.  Other MP3 players can not enjoy such seamless integration with a music program.  Or can they...?  With the recent release of Windows Media Player 11, users are now able to purchase DRMed music from MTV's URGE service.  Still in beta, Windows Media Player 11 and URGE are still slowly being improved so the "seamless" integration is not quite there yet but I've had to pleasure to try it out and I have to say it's on the road to taking on iTunes.  Purchasing tracks on URGE is simple because it only asks you for your credit card number once and you can purchase million of songs with a click.  One feature I really enjoy about URGE is way they organize their content in easy to access playlists and charts.  Some pages still will not show up properly in URGE but since they're still in beta, that's forgivable.  One thing I find strange is Microsoft's investment into their own music service after investing millions into URGE.  We'll wait and see how that pans out.    The software that is included in the installation CD is not as pleasurable to use as WMP11.  WMP11 adds simplicity with a lot of manual functions that are easily accessible to the user but the included software is just...blah.  It works and that's about as much as it can do.  It's simplified by the drag and drop method but there's no eye candy and seems very archaic.  WMP11 is the program to use with the Vision: M and all other MP3 players, excluding the iPod of course.  DivX, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, WMV, and XviD formats are all supported by the Vision: M which means less time converting files and more time playing them.  For the files that aren't supported, WMP11 or Creative's own software converts the files into .avi.    A gripe that many people will have about owning a MP3 player other than an iPod is the lack of podcast integration.  Creative takes a stab at the podcasting scene with its ZenCast website and it's ZenCast Organizer.  It works but it's not as intuitive or pleasurable to use as iTunes.  The website especially needs work with the organization of its content because no one wants to flip through 15+ pages of podcasts to find the one they want.  The ZenCast website is a good idea because it does not isolate other players from using the site and subscribing to RSS feeds.    With all the talk of video playback, it is easy to forget what the Zen Vision: M was designed to do: play music.  It is in the DAP (digital audio player, ie: video iPod) class and not the PMP (portable media player, ie: Archos AV500.)  Audio play back is everything someone could ask for.  97dB signal to noise ratio ensures flawless sound and album art is displayed well, though a little aliased because of the smaller resolution.  The included headphones are decent for their price ($9.99) but they lack the bass and clarity of higher end headphones such as the Shures or Etymotics.  I recommend ditching the stock ear phones and purchasing some noise isolation or noise canceling headphones.  You won't regret it, especially if you take public transportation.  The Vision: M supports MP3, WMA, WAV, Janus, and now Audible with the latest firmware upgrade.  One function that I enjoy on Creative players is the DJ mode in which you can select "Album of the Day" which just chooses one album at random, "Random Play All," "Most Popular," and "Least Popular."  It's a nice function to have.    Performance  The Vision is rated at 14 hrs for audio and 4 hrs video but reports from consumers have found that they can surpass these times, which is very impressive indeed.  An improvement over previous Creative players is the startup time which takes about 10 seconds from a cold start but just 2-3 seconds when it's been booted up at least once every 4 hours.  Every 4 hours, the player slips out of "standby" mode and into a fully off mode to spare battery life.  Charging via USB takes a whopping 5-6 hrs but with the included wall charger, that time is slashed to 2-3 hrs.  I have yet to test out the battery life by myself but from normal use, I suspect I can reach the claimed battery life.    The user interface is easy to use and figure out without reading the manual.  This is a good thing because the text in the included manual is sparse, to say the least.  Creative could do with a little more text and pictures in their manuals because there are a lot of shortcuts and features that are not highlighted in the included documents.  I was a little intimidated when I first opened the box because there were 3 installation CDs included with the player.  One was for Creative's own software, one was for Yahoo's software and services, and the last was for the Plays4Sure software.  If I had no prior knowledge to Yahoo's and Plays4Sure software, I would have probably been very confused.    The FM tuner was a great little feature with better reception than I expected, due to the poor reception that I got from my Zen Micro which is now dead from a catastrophic hard drive failure.  In FM tuner mode, there is a little reception bar in the upper left hand corner which I found pretty useful.    Conclusion  It is hard to recommend one MP3 player over the other because each has their strengths and their faults.  The iPod wins in design and popularity while the Zen Vision: M wins in features and many like buying the "underdog" of the MP3 players.  With the release of WMP11, URGE, Starz Vongo, Napster to go, Rhapsody to go, etc., it seems that the underdog has a chance of staging a coup and overthrowing the iPod regime.
