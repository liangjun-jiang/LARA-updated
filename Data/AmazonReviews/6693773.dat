<Title>Zen Nano review
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zen Nano 512 MB MP3 player is a battery operated, inexpensive MP3 player. It's biggest asset is that it interfaces easy with the PC and downloads music with a minimum of fuss. The Zen Nano is durable and reliable which I did not expect for such an inexpensive device. The only drawback is not having a rechargable battery. Fortunately this MP3 runs a long time on a single battery

<Title>Hopefully Helpful... This info sure helped ME!
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me save you some time... if your player starts shutting down, tech support will tell you it's a DRM thing and that you have to use a specific program to transfer files, that you have to upgrade the firmware and drivers off of their site. It all works pretty well, although a clumsy process... but if you want your unit to continue to function properly, you need an older driver. Try to find this version: ZenNanoPlus_PCFW_LF_1_10_03 (it's the version before the current one, so it's bound to be floating around out there somewhere... just keep looking or demand it from Creative) - I just reformatted and flashed my firmware using this version and it now works just fine. GOOD LUCK!!! [...]  I should also mention that this would be the PERFECT player if:  1) the little tooth on the battery compartment sliding door didn't break off so EASILY.  2) The firmware wasn't sush a mess (they blame record labels and DRM restrictions...)  3) and the recording quality was something better than, like about 32 kHz wav. 192 mp3 would be better.  Otherwise I LOVE the unit and the ease of operation.

<Title>Decent
<Date>Sun Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its a pretty good mp3 player overall, no real problems except the little plastic latch on the back that holds the battery on seams to break easy so be carefull with it.  It holds a decent amount of songs and plays pretty loud, and comes with the small inner ear head phones which make your music louder, but can be uncomfterable sometimes.

<Title>JUST A PIECE OF JUNK!!
<Date>Fri May 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>AFTER DOING ALOT OF RESEARCH I CHOSE THE NANO THINKING I WAS PURCHASING THE BEST....BIG MISTAKE!! ABOUT 10-12 HOURS OF MUSIC WAS ALL I GOT BEFORE IT FROZE UP & DISPLAYED THE DREADED "FILE SYSTEM ERROR" MESSAGE!!  I WON'T EVEN GO INTO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE "EMAIL TWO STEP" I EXPERIENCED (DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO ANSWER THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LAND LINE)....ALL THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT NONE OF THIS SHOULD EVER HAVE HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE...CREATIVE LABS OBVIOUSLY HAS SOME SERIOUS QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES!  THIS IS AN INFERIOR PRODUCT, FOLKS (I SEE THAT OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE & OPINION), & IF CREATIVE LABS HAD ANY INTEGRITY AT ALL WHERE THEIR PRODUCT & THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WERE CONCERNED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED PRONTO....INSTEAD I SIT HERE WITH A USELESS PIECE OF ELECTRONIC JUNK.  THINK TWICE, FOLKS, & THEN HEAD FOR A DIFFERENT BRAND!

<Title>Don't buy this mp3
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is a bad product all around. The battery cover broke after just 2 wks. Also, it only holds about 100 songs. The customer service is a total hassel, and very unhelpful. Now, no matter how many songs I take off of it, I can't get it to download any more. You are better off just getiing an Ilo or Lyra.

<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this mp3 player for my daughter and it stopped working less than 5 months later.  Creative labs customer service is bad terrible.  My unit boots up and when I touch any button it shuts down.  I tried firmware upgrades as suggested by creative, but the same problem exists.  I have bought Iriver and Sandisk players for the other kids..... they all still work.  Look for anything but CREATIVE!!!

<Title>THE BIGGEST RIP OFF I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Read it carefully.  DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.  DO NOT EVER!!  I usually do not get to write a review for anything.  I am a "I do not bother to write a review" kind of a person.  For this one though, I wanna make sure I write one, so that there will be no more victims out there suffering w/ this junk & its bad bad horrible customer service.  First of all, the stupid earpieces hurt my ears every time I wear, ok, that's fine, whatever.  Few weeks after the purchase, the battery cover breaks apart, ok, I will tape it, that's fine as long as I can still listen to my music.  Just within 2 and a half months of the purchase, one morning, it just stops working.  It shuts down every time I try to turn on the power, and later, it completely stops working.  I get upset and go to their website, they only take e-mails.  I call other departments, and finally gets the number, but I would have to pay 12 bucks to solve it on the phone??????  WTH!!!  I am still sitting on my desk, waiting for my e-mail response.  Thankfully one of the reviewers here has noted some solutions here, so I am gonna try that.  Much better than paying another 12 bucks for this junk.  Just don't buy it.  Do not bother to buy any of Creative Labs products.  I am about to file a complaint w/ BBB actually.

<Title>I am buying a new mp3 player :(
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well first of all it hurts my ears whenever I listened to it, which was annoying, and they kept falling out of my ears! Then the battery cover fell off 4 weeks after using it. So I taped it back on but then it got all dirty. Then, I took it to school one day, for the end of the day because I walk home, and it started playing during class! And it was in my purse without anything touching it. I would suggest getting a regular ipod mini.

<Title>great MP3 Player, shoddy battery cover
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player. The sound is fantastic and the convenience of having to use only one AAA battery is one of the main features that prompted me to purchase one.  HOWEVER, I am dismayed by how fragile the battery cover tab is. Even hough I was careful, the little notch on the tab keeping the cover in place wore out quickly and then the tab broke off. This all happened within 9 months. When I called Creative Lab's support center about this, they offered to sell me a new one. It would cost me $5 for the cover and $11 shipping to Canada or $7 to my US address! That just seems quite steep to mail such a tiny piece of plastic. I'm not in the habit of throwing my money around like that and would rather invest the $12 - $16 towards a new MP3 player.  Luckily, I always use the rubber cover so the battery cover stys in place. I would have given this player a perfect 5 stars if it wasn't for that infamous battery cover.

<Title>PSHH!!! GET A REAL IPOD!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was excited when I got it, then a few weeks later, its just collecting dust on my desk.  Just get a regular ipod, so it can hold more songs, and it will work better.  Also, the back of the zen falls off, and I can't get it back on without taping it.  Also, when I try putting new songs on it, it deletes the other ones!!! This really gets me ticked off, because then I have to delete every song on the list and re-download them all on the same playlist. This is complete junk. I only did 2 stars because it worked for 3 weeks. Now it just doesn't work, even with a new battery.  Yes, it may be very small and it only costs 50 bucks, but its not even worth 50 bucks!! I rather buy 50 bucks worth of Paris Hilton's albums, and listen to it all day!!! (very bad)

<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>no complaints from this reviewer ;this is the 3rd Creative product which I've purchased;the other 2 are still working good and I got this one because it's small enough to carry in my shirt pocket.  I always keep it in a plastic pouch so maybe that's helped the battery lid from breaking off.  never experienced any problem loading music or mp3 podcasts from my laptop, I just drag and drop the files into my mp3 player & works beautifully.

<Title>Not the Best MP3 Player in the World
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went to Circuit City with my dad to buy this MP3 player after my older sister recieved one for Christmas. When I was researching the quality of this product, some of the reviews were not pleasing, but I'm sorry to say I actually went out and bought it. And I'm also sorry to say this review will not be very pleasing either. The exterior casing of the Creative Zen Nano Plus is merely cheap plastic -- flimsy and pathetic next to the iPod nano 2nd Generation's aluminum casing. Scratch marks and scuff marks show up easily and I'm guessing that the curved part that comes off to allow you to change the battery would also break easily if stepped on, etc. The positively worst part of this MP3 player are the earbuds, which fall out if you barely touch the wiring. In order to keep the earbuds in place I have to stick them into my ears at an odd angle which makes even Sound Level 1 too loud to hear someone speak in an "indoor voice". Sadly, there's more: the backlight doesn't stay on long enough to allow you light to see which song is playing, how long it's been playing, etc. There is a "backlight" section in the "Settings", but the longest it can stay illuminated is only 15 seconds. Also, when skipping tracks, you use the same button to scan within a song, making it much harder to scan within the song than skip tracks. Another disappointment is that two of the CDs I tried to load onto this MP3 player weren't read as "being there", although they work fine when I listen to them on my WalkMan, DVD player, computer, etc. Luckily, I've had this player for about nine months, but it's still going strong, most likely because of the fact that it runs on a single AAA battery. This does get most annoying after awhile though, having to change batteries every two to three weeks, or whatever, depending on how often you listen to this. From the reviews on  this site, I'm most likely going to purchase an iPod nano 2 GB for my next Christmas. So although it's around $90 more, I'm hoping it'll be worth the extra money to have an MP3 player I'm not complaining about all the time.

<Title>Creative Zen Nano
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Low quality, and poor product support from Creative.  Very disappointed with this product.  It worked for about 6 months of light use, then quit working (turned off or wouldn't turn on at all).  Creative tech support recommended downloading new driver, but this didn't help.  So I was going to send it in because it is still under warranty.  However, they require a non-refundable $25 "diagnostic and handling" fee just to send it in (plus I pay shipping), and there may or may not be additional charges for labor.  This doesn't make sense given the value of the player, so the warranty is basically useless.  I expressed my dissatisfaction and they suggested that next time I buy their enhanced warranty.  I think next time I probably just won't buy a Creative product.

<Title>Lots of issues
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item has a lot of flaws, the only reason I got it was the price was quite less and it was a nice techy stocking stuffer of sorts. I have listed some of the issues i have seen with this product here:  1. Battery case - this is a flimsy piece of plastic and the finger that enables the cover to click shut will break with the slightest pressue. I totally agree with the other people who commented on this issue. Yes you can prevent it from breaking if you are willing to spend 5-10 minutes to slowly change the batteries but once you tend to hurry up with this process the end is inevitable!  2. Power off - the power off si the same as play or power on. If you want to power it off you got to press until you see the unit display switch off else it will stay powered on and playing and drain the battery or probably if in recording more might use up your entire storage space.   3. Chord - comes with  chord to hang the unit around the neck while listening to stuff but unfortunately just like the battery case, the groove on the unit into which you are supposed to slip the chord and fasten it, is flimsy as well. It might break off if you have it caught somewhere and try to pull it free instead of patiently working it.  4. UI is bad - the IPOD click wheel is very simple and so is the Zune UI. This one is simple cos there is just one way to use it but its not easy to use.   Go for a IPOD Nano if you will. This one is not worth the investment.

<Title>Good for exercise
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 512 MB player doesn't hold a ton of songs, but is definitely enough room for songs to listen to while exercising. You'll want to purchase the arm strap specifically made for this player. It's available on the Creative site. The main buttons (on/off/pause; volume; and forward/back) are easy enough to work while jogging. The menu system is useless. For example, it let's you skip a folder, but nothing (on the menu or in the online documentation) tells you how to get it back in the play rotation.  I've had this player for over a year now and it has been on my arm while jogging in the elements (snow, rain, heat) practically every other day and is still functioning great. The ear buds that come with the player are pretty sad - they fall out and the foam pieces come off rather easily.  I finally had to replace them with something less annoying.   Bottom line - if you can get this player cheaply, it's a good buy. Just don't expect it to be comparable to an iPod.

<Title>The Creative Zen Nano Plus Rocks!
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Nano Plus MP3 player is very small, not much bigger than a cigarette lighter, but it delivers great sound. From music to audio books, this little gem will not disappoint, especially for the price. The only con is that the battery doesn't charge from the USB port from what I've read, but you can buy rechargeable batteries and a battery charger or an ac adapter.

<Title>Do not waste your money on this piece of junk
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I want to give this product a zero rating! Within one month of purchase, the battery lid got broken and I could not put it back. I made a phone call to creative and was told that the battery was NOT covered in warranty. The replacement would cost me $4.9 plus shipping and package with totals around 30. I argured with the CSR and they just rudely hang off the phone. I will never ever buy a creative product again. Guys, if you want to waste your money and be treated rudely, do not hesitate. Otherwise, choose a more honorabl brand!

<Title>The little mp3 player that keeps going and going and going...
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this little guy a few years ago, have dropped it, scratched it, played it 'til it turned blue. It's amazing that the battery cover hasn't broken; heck, that the whole thing hasn't. Great sound output and battery life as well. This version's suitable for bringing along your favorite tunes, and considering how simple and cheap it is, it's a smart tag-a-long purchase for when, like me, you don't want to drag around your $300 iPod (Touch, in my case). Buy it if you need a small flash player and can get it for cheap!
