<Title>Excellent alternative to that other "high end" portable MP3 player.
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Originally written July 24, 2005.  Well, this is the 3rd Creative product I have purchased and I'm just as satisfied. I was pondering getting this, the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 Player, or the Creative Zen Touch 20GB MP3 Player. I actually slept on the Zen 40 gig when it was under $200.00. Not this time, I got the 30 gig for $180.00 and I'm very happy.   Other than not having a Radio, it has the features that make or break a MP3 player. I can create Play list on the fly if I desire, import playlist from the computer. There are a zillion EQ settings with the ability to customize my own.   The sound is great, even at 64 kbps WMA format. For hundreds less that the so called leaders, this is a true value and I'm so glad I finally made the purchase. I know I'm forgetting some items, but I'm listening to it as I type and load my CD's onto my computer. This MP3 player is everything I'll ever need.   Recommended: Yes   Amount Paid (US$): 180.00 Recommended for: Music Lovers - High Capacity Storage for an Entire Album Collection   Update: June 15, 2006. Well, a year later and my review is pretty much the same. I can say that I have had a couple of instances where the unit has frozen completely and I had to either reboot or remove and replace (same battery) the battery. This has been a great product for me and I have moved on to the Archos AV500 (sorry Zen Vision M, not enough features to compete). Now the 40 and 60 gig units can be purchased for much less than what I originally paid. Great device, Monk....

<Date>Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i liked it.  it was good for a year and a half... then crashed a few days ago.  i bought it for under $200 instead on an ipod.... 10 gigs more for $100 less...good deal to me.  one thing i hated about it was that it's so huge and bulky... somebody actually asked if it was a walkman.  it was my prized possession... i had 2500 songs on it and lost them all....so for that i'm pissed.  i plan on staying with creative and getting a 20 gig Zen Sleek Photo.

<Title>Still works great after 1.5 years
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Creative NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra 30GB player in May 2005.  I have used it constantly since then - at home, in the car, traveling, camping trips.  I have nearly my entire CD collection - over 10,000 songs.    The fidelity is excellent and the battery life is still 12+ hours.  The replacable battery feature is great - I bought an extra battery and fully charge both before going camping where I won't have electricity available.  I have had the problem some have mentioned where the unit freezes and needs to be reset - some times it takes 10+ resets to get it working again.  The problem seems to be with the AC charger, and I found I can completely avoid it by never turning the player on before connecting to AC and disconnecting the AC before turning off.    Another tip: a company called Red Chair Software sells a "Notmad Explorer" interface program that I highly recommend.  Makes organizing, downloading and playlists much easier.  Best feature is a SQL database function that allows you to export results (lists of songs, albums, playlists etc.) to Excel and print them out.

<Title>Batteries Need UpGrade
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This unit is great for meeting storage needs,30GB. This player has huge, unacceptable flaws. The bad news starts with the lithium battery. The battery(fully charged) does not hold charge longer than 70 minutes at a Volume setting of 19 or higher. What's worse, is that you cannot hear audible sounds under a volume setting of 16 through headphones. Even at full volume of 25, it is difficult to hear sound in outside environments. One more thing_If you shutdown the player after a full charge, and leave unit alone for anytime longer than 48 hours:the unit will need to be manually reset. In closing, this MP3 player is definitely not worth the hassle. Note:I bought two replacement batteries only to get the same disappointing results.

<Content>I have owned a Zen Xtra since they were first put on the market and have encountered few problems. I still have the original battery and the unit only needs to be reset occasionally. Its 30 gb storage is as much as anyone needs in a mp3. Though this model is probably dated by today's standards, it has been very reliable and has none of the battery issues of the ipods.

<Title>Maybe worth the cost!
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a Zen Xtra 30G player.  It frequently needed to be reset, which is annoying.  I have owned it just over a year now (just!  bought it just before Christmas for my son, who chose to pass on the gift in favor of an iPod) so it's out of warranty.  Although it worked OK, Windows Media Player 11 said I needed to update the Zen software.  Using Creative's instructions and downloads, the player ceased to work; the computer sees it, but Zen's firmware program does not.  It cost me several hours of struggling with their web pages and downloads, and I finally gave in and PAID $13 for them to tell me that apparently the card went bad, just as I was updating (of COURSE, it was not their fault, nor caused by the software, just a coincidence, he said)  They'll fix it for $95-135, or the rep suggested that I just buy a new one.  I will.  It won't be a Creative player--the rep estimated 1-2 years of lifespan.  If you decide to buy one, I suggest that you pony up the forty bucks they charge (on a NEW one)to guarantee their product at least two years.  UPDATE:  I again contacted Creative, and they identified Media Player 11 as the cause.  They provided complete instructions to roll it back to Player 10, and to reinstall the firmware.  My Zen is working again, and is back to being full of my favorite music.  I must commend their Tech Support for not just leaving me to swing in the wind.  You can feel my frustration in my original posting, but my opinion of Creative improved considerably, thanks to the extra effort of the tech and the tech's supervisor.  I would change my review to three stars, but it won't let me.

<Title>It's mostly fine for me
<Date>Thu Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I give it four stars 'cause I've had it for a few months and the harddrive is fine and I've dropped it [many times] and it still works. One big problem I have is not with the machine itself, but with the program that came with it. A couple of weeks ago, the program you use to load CDs into the player stopped working, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it a few times, and then it wouldn't recognize the driver that is needed to connect the player to the computer. I just learned that you can download new drivers from their website, though, so hopefully that will work when I try it later. The whole program-not-working thing might be because of my computer, which is old and has a tendency to mess things up, hence the reason I didn't give it lower than four stars.  Overall, I love this machine. I have 2,278 songs in it [and many more still need to be loaded in] and it's so much more convenient than carrying around a bunch of CDs. I'm one of those indecisive people who used to leave the house with one CD, only to end up wishing I had brought something completely different. This is a godsend for people who have way too many CDs and want to listen to a diverse mix of music on the go [even if they don't have a CD burner to make mixes, which was my problem before I got the jukebox player]. Plus, its cheaper than an iPod, it's battery is replaceable [unlike the iPod, where Apple charges $100 for a battery replacement], and it holds more songs than the cheapest full-size iPod, which is actually more expensive than the Nomad Jukebox player.  It's a good buy. But I'd get the warranty, 'cause you never know what'll happen.

<Date>Wed Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 60GB player in December 2003. The headphone jack immediately failed within the 1st month, even though I took extra care in handling this unit, always had it in its protective case, and never dropped it. I received a replacement unit from Creative and wouldn't you know it, the headphone jack once again failed. Thanks for the previous review from &quot;seleniumdream&quot;. I will be doing my own maintenance on the headphone jack since it is now out of warranty. Bummer that I didn't stumble across these reviews on this unit earlier. Now I only wonder if the hard drive is going to fail like so many other reviewers have experienced. The only good thing that could come from buying this unit is that hopefully it malfunctions within the 90 day warranty. If you want a good MP3 player buy any other unit except this one.

<Title>A few downsides, but still one of the cheapest HD mp3 audio 
<Date>Fri Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this player for some time now. It's biggest downside, is that the bundled software didn't work for me, it was very unstable and would crash frequently, which was very frustrating, but thank God there is another software called &quot;Notmad Explorer&quot; which does the job all right, although you must pay $25 bucks for it. CD-Ripping and MP3 compression can be done much, much better by other free software like EAC and Lame.  The players physical aspect is not close to that of the nice iPod, but mine came with a nice carrying case that let's you see the screen and use the controls.    The player does what it's made to do: play mp3 and wma. There is not much more in it, no recording microphone, no games, no text... but it can be used as an external hard drive, but only for moving/copying files. Its database system is not fantastic, but it works.     Pros:  -More than $150 cheaper than the iPod of 20GB (July 2004)  -Li-Ion battery lasts about 12hrs.  -Fast USB 2 into 30 GB portable, for $200    Cons:  -No remote control  -No microphone  -Not recognized as an external drive in My Computer by Windows XP  -Bundled headphones or worthless  -I don't love the Quick Scroller    It has freezed a couple times, and I have dropped it, but it still works fine.    So the player is not fantastic, I had to buy some Sony MDR-EX71SL headphones and the Notmad software to use it decently, but after that it has worked well and I feel pretty satisfied with my purchase, the iPod is a lot nicer, fashionable and expensive... So I'll get one when I don't care much about money.  I only want to enjoy music and listen to some audio books, and this player does that very well, so I'm happy with it.

<Title>Great Product!! But buy the new Zen Touch!!
<Date>Sat Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ok, i kinda know you "adults" won't listen to a "kid" but I'm dying to say this. This product is great, considing the price, comparing it to the iPod (I'm saying this becuase I had to pay for it myself). I LOVE the EAX Audio features, with the virtual environment and smart volume. The sound qualities great! I personaly don't really like the iPod because it's feels like Apple wants to suck up all your money with all the accessories and iTunes. The removable battery is a great feature for the long term, because eventually the battery will die. The advertissed battery life isn't as long though, it's only about 6-7 hours. The case is real cool because it look nice and you can actually access the buttons and see the screen. Although, the size and weight compared to other Mp3 players is that lovely, it's kinda bulky. It's a pain in the neck trying to navigate through 30GB(about 1000 songs) with a small scroll wheel kinda thing with one hand. And too sad it doesn't have a remote though, it would be a lot better since I bike with it in a bag. And when you try to switch songs you have to take it out. Overally, this is one of the best mp3 player i've ever owned. I'm returning it though, becuase the new ZEN TOUCH look and probably is better (it's smaller too). To conclude this is a great product overall. Buy it if you want a high capacity mp3 player and is restricted by money.

<Title>Beware
<Date>Sat Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My hard drive failed at seven months. I knew that dealing with Creative was not going to go well as they had already scammed me on the rebate. The technical service is horrible and unprofessional- Creative does not stand behind its products and treated me with contempt and disrespect. And that's if you can get them to answer the phone. I purchased an Ipod after that and even though there is the battery issue, Apple has a totally different attitude towards its customers and technical support. Especially with the recent decreases in ipod prices, drop your coffee habit for a month or two and spend the additional money it takes to get a truly great product- the Ipod.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Sun Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my player for almost 9 months now and so far so good.  There have been a couple of downsides, the ear buds they supplied hit the trash right away as did the cover they supplied. The ears buds were junk and WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU SUPPLY A COVER THAT COVERS THE DISPLAY SCREEN????  The only other irritating item is the battery switch.  It's on the bottom of the unit and always pops the door open.  Obviously, the engineer who designed this had no intention of ever actually using the player himself.  Since this is my first player, I'm relatively happy with it as I've learned to work around the above items.

<Title>Bad Support, Short Sighted Design
<Date>Thu Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I received a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra for Christmas last year.  It worked fine for six months and then the headphone jack malfunctioned.  It was out of warranty, but it certainly wasn't time to pitch it a get a new one.  I returned it to Creative to have the jack replaced.  This cost $20 for an initial evaluation.  After a couple of week Creative called me and said that the unit would have to be replaced with a refurbished unit at a cost of $200.  New units can be purchased for $239.  I thought this was stupid since the harddrive is completely detachable from the rest of the unit (surely half the cost).  It made me wonder if they can't fix a bad headphone jack, what on earth could they fix.  Seems like they scammed me for $20 in addition to their bad product.  Since the unit was completely functional except for the headphone jack, I chose to have the unit returned without repair and use it as a portable harddrive.  I had also hoped that I could listen to the music through my computer.  It wouldn't be completely portable, but I could take it to work.    I then made two painful discoveries.  First, the headphone jack on the jukebox is the only audio output, even though you can control the unit from your computer using Creative's software and the software appears to have functionality to change the output.  Secondly, there is no way to access the jukebox as a generic mass storage device, so you can use another media program.  Consequently, I have to drag files over to my computer harddrive to listen to them.   The jukebox will also not let you copy protected files to a computer.  Pretty short sighted when you consider that there is no way to backup your protected files.  Jukeboxes are great and I will buy another one.  It won't be a Creative product.

<Content>Can't help feeling that another reviewer's comments about Creative's business plan might be accurate. Looks nice, performs well but the headphone adaptor seems almost designed to break. I suspect the 30 day warranty is because Creative knows this.  I'm certainly not an Apple freak and would rather buy something else, but feel MOST reluctant to buy anything from Creative ever again. Oh - maybe that wasn't such a cool business plan on their part after all ...

<Title>Good price for a good mp3 player
<Date>Sat Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had it for about three months now, and it has been working very well. Size and looks don't really matter for me, so I have no issue with it being big or bulky. It's lighter and smaller than a cd player, at any rate.   Positive things: - Good price - Excellent sound quality - Replaceable battery; the lack of this feature is a major drawback of the ipod. Li-ion betteries always die sooner or later, and its nice being able to replace it instead of buying a new mp3 player. - It supports non-latin alphabets, which is good for me because I have a lot of foreign music.  A few drawbacks: - The software that it comes with really is crap. - Short warranty; although I haven't needed it yet - I still have not figured out a way to sort my music by folders and not ID3 tags. A friend with an older version of this player tells me that its possible, but I did not discover it yet. - I wish it had more accessories to go with it. - Every once in a while it freezes up and you have to take the battery out or press the reset button. - Battery life is actually not that long, especially if it is not depleted completely before recharging.

<Content>Battery life sucks big time!  It's always on low.  The iPods are nice, but overpriced.  This unit gives you a lot of storage, but creative doesn't put too much thought into their products.  Their software always sucks... For example you cant just use windows explorer to copy files, music over.  You have to install a large software install which then gives you an explorer "like" interface.  Why didn't these bozos just make this thing plug and play and act as a hard drive?  It's not very convenient that way.  They do however give you a leather case which apple charges too much for.  I wouldn't recomend this unit.

<Title>A thousand times better than an iPod
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went shopping for MP3 players when I found out I was getting sent to Iraq.  I had no desire to lug my 200+ CD's around the desert.  I, like others, was thinking iPod.  The guy at Circuit City changed my mind though, this thing was $90 cheaper than the iPod and 10GB more!  I like the interface better than the iPod, for example if it ever stops responding there is a little reset button on the back.  The first time a friend had a problem with his iPod it took us hours to figure out the reset key sequence.  I like that it has a replaceable battery and that you don't have to use iTunes.  An earlier review states that you *MUST* use Nomad Explorer ... this is simply NOT TRUE.  I did NOT install the Nomad Explorer software at all, I use MusicMatch Jukebox to manage it, but I can also just open it in Windows Explorer and treat it like a folder.  I repeat, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE NOMAD EXPLORER, all you have to do is install the Jukebox driver.  I HATE how Apple FORCES its customers to use iTunes and iTunes only.  Anyway, I have had it for about a year now and it works PERFECTLY.  I have been trucking around the desert with it now for about 6 months with NO PROBLEMS.  I listened to it almost non-stop on the flight from Indiana to Kuwait and it kept on trucking (of course I had it in sleep mode because I knew I would fall asleep, so it turned off every time shortly after I fell asleep).  I think some of the previous reviewers haven't read their manual.  You CAN create playlists on the unit, and you can create multiple playlists.  You can play random tracks by genre, artist, album, or (my favorite) play any track.  I have seen several guys have their iPods go bad over here.  My commander saw my Zen Xtra and liked it enough to go buy one himself.  I have almost 3,500 songs on this thing and PLENTY OF SPACE TO SPARE.  I don't even buy CD's anymore, it's all electronic.  BTW, this thing sounds AMAZING with my Bose Quiet Comfort II headphones.  At this stage in the game Creative has successor products out there, but in my opinion the Zen Xtra is still a great buy.

<Title>This really is a good player
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm in high school, and I see EVERYONE with an iPod. So when my birthday came rolling around, I naturally asked for an iPod. However, my dad ended up getting me this instead, and I was very disappointed with its appearance. It looked huge and I was embarrassed of it. I've had it for over a year now, and I am now ashamed that I used to be ashamed of it. It plays all my music really well and putting music on it is really easy and fast. I don't carry it in the case it comes with because then it just looks amazingly HUGE, but I've dropped it several times and it still works fine. I have more songs than I can listen to and still lots of room for more. And even though it's slightly unattractive compared to some other MP3 players, it is worth the price and can easily be hidden in a bag ;) But, honestly, the most important part of any MP3 player is that it works well and plays well, not how pretty it looks, and this Creative definitely does both. I highly reccomend this to those who want to save money and can still easily enjoy their music wherever they are.

My only complain has always been it's uglyness, it's so large and ordinary, but to me price and performance is more important than trendy devices disguised with eyecandy, so I've managed. But it did cost me $240.00 and for such a price, I've been more than happy with its performance. Great deal.

<Title>Good quality, long lasting
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player for a year and a half now. I have to say, it's more long lasting (and tougher) than I thought it would be.   Size: This thing is pretty big. I have not had a problem carrying it around- I mostly use it around the house (I recently boxed up all my CD's and only use MP3s), in the car, and at work when I'm not moving around much. I have recently orgered a small 1 gig flash memory player to use when I am more active, and I think this is a nice compromise.   Interface: The buttons are on the sides, and I love this. When it's in a pocket or bag, I can reach in and control the volume or skip a track without looking at the player. This is also nice in the car- I put it in the storage slot with the skip buttons facing out, so it's easy to control without taking my eyes off the road. There is no lock switch (you can access a lock feature through the player) but the buttons aren't that sensitive so I have not had a problem. The jog dial on the side is pretty small, but since I have small hands, this has not been a problem. The downside to this method of control is that it can take forever to cycle through a large numbers of albums.  You can download an update to the firmware that lets you use Windows Media instead of the software that comes with the player. I did this because I found the software that came with the player was having trouble with my 20 gigs of MP3's.  Durability: I have dropped my player, sat on it, and generally beat it up, and it's fine. I thought it would be flimsier- the entire front comes off to replace the battery, but it has not been a problem.   Battery power: When I first got the player, the battery lasted as long as the rating. Now that I've had it for a while, it's down to 6-10 hours.   Sound: I don't really have much to compare the sound to, but it sounds good to me. The sound presets are great, and it's plenty loud enough to play through my home stereo. I can't comment on the earbuds that came with the player, as they were too big for my ears- this is a problem with almost all earbuds for me, though. I ended up buying Sony's Fontopia in the ear earbuds,and those work quite well.   In the end, this has been a good player. There are better players out there now, but if you can get a good deal on this one, I would reccomend it.

<Title>Design Flaw in Headphone Adapter - Steer Clear
<Date>Mon Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content> In comparing the price of this player to others, be sure to factor in having to pay an additional $175 every 60-90 days of use.  That's how much it costs to have the headphone jack fixed by Creative.  Unless you're good with a soldering iron and don't mind fixing it yourself, this is a product to be avoided.  Sad too because it worked great for the first 60 days.  Shame on Creative for not fixing this defect free of charge.

<Title>Works Great!
<Date>Fri Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen Xtra for about 7 months now and have had almost no problems with it. I read the other reviews and I haven't had any of the same problems. I found both the player and the software easy to use. My favorite thing about my player is the EAX sound effects. You can listen to songs in fast forward or slow motion, without distorting the pitch. You can turn it on night mode which stops sudden increases in volume making it easier on your ears. The buttons and the scroller are at the sides of the player, so you avoid accedentally pressing buttons while the player is in your pocket, and it makes it much less awkward to use them. My only problem with it is the headphones, I couldn't get them to stay in my ears, so i just bought some different ones.

<Date>Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this item in May of '04 and it worked perfectly...for ninety days. I tried my very best to take care of this expensive piece of equipment and the headphone jack STILL went out on me. You're lucky if you purchase this and don't have a problem with it. Sure, in my opinion its the best MP3 player out there- that is, when it works. Luckily, I bought a 2 year protection plan on it and I'll get my money back. There's just no reason to take yhour chances on whether you'll buy one that has a faulty headphone jack- you're better off going with the more expensive Ipod, or maybe even the new Sony Network Walkman.

<Title>Great MP3 Player at a good price
<Date>Sun Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player from Amazon.com about 4 months ago, and i only have good things to say about it. It has great storage and a good design. I have used the ipod, and i prefer using this player because of how it was made for computers with windows and it allows you to play wma files (which i havent tried yet) but its nice to know you can play more than just MP3's. Also i love how it comes with a case. I know a few people with ipods, and the ones who didnt buy a case now have a very bad looking ipod. This comes with a nice (fake) leather case that protects it, and after 4 months of hard use, it still looks and works brand new. The batter has great life and i hardly ever charge it, i just leave it in my car all the time. Transferring files onto it is very fast and simple. I would recommend this player over the ipod to anybody wanting a player with lots of storage capacity at a great price. Buy it!

<Title>Best thing I've bought in a while
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am in the Navy and I bought this right before I deployed for six months. It was by far the best thing I took along with me. I don't know what I would have done without it. On a ship there is not much storage space, especially for hundreds of cd's. This fit right in my pocket or hung on my belt and was with me everywhere i went. I don't know what I would have done out there in the ocean without my music! I had no problems whatsoever, and was able to upload music from anyone that had something I liked on the ship. For those of you in the military, this is definately the toy for you! I used it often while jogging and working out, I dropped it many of times, and I have never had a problem yet. My favorite feature was the play random song because with over 200 cd's worth of music, you never know whats going to come up next. I recomend this to anyone who wants a cheaper but extremely reliable mp3 player.

<Title>The best reason not to buy an iPod
<Date>Thu Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When I first started looking for a portable jukebox, I--like everybody else--was drooling for an iPod. Then I did my research, and here's why I decided on the Zen Jukebox Xtra: (1) the iPod battery is not user-replaceable, you have to pay $60 for a two-year Apple plan in order to get it replaced, and you have to send the unit back to them to get it replaced (evidently it starts losing its charge about six months into ownership); (2) huge storage space--I have my entire CD collection on it plus a whole bunch of downloaded tracks at high quality and I've still only used half the space; (3) sound quality is fabulous, especially if you spring for a decent pair of headphones. As far as durability goes, granted I haven't passed the dreaded 90-day-warranty mark, but it goes with me trail-running daily (because of other reviews I've read, I hold it in my hand over rough spots so it doesn't get jostled too much) and in the car on long drives a few times a week. I've also dropped it from a pretty good height with no damage. My one complaint? No support for MP4. BUT...you can upgrade the firmware to be Real Player compatible (their downloads are only 49 cents) and I've found the process easily done. Good tech support as well. I just don't think there's a better value for the money.

<Title>Great product-- for a little while
<Date>Mon Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was my second Nomad Jukebox, and I should have learned after the first one.  The first was a 10GB player that I bought in June of 03.  It lasted EXACTLY 6 months before freezing up on me.  No amount of tech support would bring it back to life.  I said, well, I guess i will just spend the extra cash and get an ipod.    The low price of the Nomad 30GB seduced me.  I picked one up instead of the pod, and I loved it, for about 6 months.  Then the headphone jack stopped working.  Luckily, this time I got the service plan, so when my refund check arrives, I am off to buy... an Ipod.

<Content>I've had this guy over a year now and i'm totally satisfied with it. It has crashed a couple of times, but there is a nice little reset button that takes care of things in a flash. The software is a little klunky to say the least, too much of stuff bundled in something that's meant to be real simple!   Other than those 2 quirks, works like a gem, one of the other reviewers had concerns over durability, i think it has survived me pretty good! great features and it looks great, personally i don't like the iPod's plastic look. I much rather would have something like the Creative. Controls are great easy to get used to. A nice add on is the FM wired remote.   One thing that could have been useful is a sleep timer or something, but that's probably included in the later versions

<Content>this is by far the best deal for hard drive based mp3 players. im extremely satisfied with my purchase, its an excellent player at an amazing price. ipods are a total rip off, if you want to pay $400 for a nice case then go ahead, but you'll be getting one of the worst players on the market. a 15 gig ipod retails for $250. thats half as much memory, much lower sound quality, and a shorter battery life for $50 MORE! ridiculous! this jukebox has excellent sound quality, long battery life, huge storage, and all for less than some crappy flash based players. do some research and you'll see this is a great player. the only thing better than this is the iriver hp120, but it costs a good deal more. the fact of the matter is, if you dont care about price get an iriver, if price matters get this player!

<Content>I've had my Creative Jukebox for over 1 year and have so far had no problems with it and the review that says you can't use the Janus thing from some services might be true but you can get around that by transferring the music to your computer and then transferring to the creative.I haven't had any freeze up problems with my unit so far but I think all ipod devices freeze at some point.I've even heard about people reporting that apple ipods occassionally freeze up.The only negatives I've found with the creative jukebox is the battery life isn't that long between charges and you can't transfer video from your computer to your creative zen.I've got some game trailers on my computer that won't go to my zen it's just for music.The big plus in this product is the much cheaper price than apple and the battery is replacable.I highly recommend it.

<Title>Great player!
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, I bought this player way back in June this year, and since there were plenty of reviews of bad happenings with this player, I waited until now to submit a review.    So, this player is pretty big.  That really doesn't bother me though, I think its great, compared to the CD and cassette players of yesterday.  I bought this player because it offered the most for the cost, including the size.  Making electronics small tends to be more expensive, except TVs, unfortunately....  If size is not a big deal to you, this player is perfect.  If you want something small, maybe this one ain't so great.  I live and work on a farm, and I bought this player because I like my music, and dislike a lot of the stuff on the radio.  This unit gets a pretty good gauntlet run on it in my job: dirt, bouncing, and all the stuff you would expect.  I am not saying I don't take care of it, I just am pointing out those little things that just happen no matter how hard you try to protect it.  I have put it through a lot of that sort of thing too, and as of this time, I haven't had even a little bit of trouble.  Battery life is a big issue too, I know, and my experience is that on full blast (FM transmitter), it will run for over eight hours, probably around nine or ten, I just started a little down, and stopped a little before dead.    All in all, its a great player.

<Content>I absolutely love my Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Ztra 30 GB.  I initally had a problem because it didn't seem to hold a charge.  Fortuneately I had a pocket pc that used the same power adapter so I plugged in the unit without the battery and it worked fine.  Not the end of the world to get a working power cord.  This works with audible.com books but you first need to update the driver and firmware.  You can't create folders but can play based on genre, artist, album so forth.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a really cool gadget.  I have had the nomad jukebox zen xtra for a year and it's still just as good as the day I got it.  First of all, this player is about the same price as an ipod(depending on which product your talking about), and it has freakin 30 gigs!  That is a whole lotta songs!(for those of you who are technologically challanged)  Yes, it's true, this player is kinda big as far as most mp3 players go, but as long as it can fit in my pocket, this doesn't matter to me.  Some people have said that it is difficult to find what song you want on the player, but I figured it out in a few minutes.  It's not difficult at all.        Another thing I like about this player is the EAX audio options.  If your in a car, change the audio to CAR.  If your on a plane, change the audio to PLANE, etc.  You can also speed up the song, or slow it down(which can be quite hilarious if your listening to a rap song).  There are many other audio options that I won't go into.        The software that comes with the player is good.  Creating playlists is easy, and you can play the songs you have on your player right on the computer(but you have to put them on the computer first, of course).     One minor problem is that occasionally,(4 or 5 times ever) the player freezes up when I turn it on.  But this can be fixed quickly and easily by reseting the player.  The headphones that come with the player are a bit odd(you will have to see them to know what I mean).  But you can always buy new headphones.       This player never skips, which is cool.  I've shaken it as hard as I can and the song continues to play flawlessly.  This is great for jogging or working out with the player.     Last of all, don't listen to the reviews complaining that their players don't work.  This only happens with 1 out of a couple hundred.  I understand that they are upset, but there is no need to dis an mp3 player of which you've never seen it's full potential.    Buy this player for Christmas, Hannukah, a birthday, whatever.  You will be a happier person.

<Title>After a year Creative's Nomad still proves to be a great buy
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was given this MP3 player last Christmas and over the year it has peformed great for me, which silenced all of the doubt about this player that other reviewers spoke of. This player has some nice features such as the EAX audio, quick song or artist search, and great easy to use software. I dont really like the Media Source software much for playing audio and video on my computer, but I love using it to manage all of the music and files on my MP3 player. The only thing I can complain about as far as features is the fact that this player doesnt have an AM/FM tuner built in, which the new Creative 30GB out this year has. However, with all of the songs you can load onto this puppy, finding something to listen to wont be a problem. If you are interested more in great storage, sound and value, then check out Creative's line of MP3 players. They will definitely beat out anything that Apple has to offer.

<Title>If it does have problems, it's easy to fix yourself!
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my Nomad Zen Xtra for over two years now. I had dropped it several times without problem. One day it fell from about  18-20" and that killed the hard drive. I didn't keep it in the sleeve it came with but I do now! Since my warranty was already expired I took the chance and cracked open the case as I had found instructions online on how to swap out the hard drive. So for the fraction of the cost of a new player of any brand, I bought a new, even larger hard drive and replaced it. It was incredibly simple.   And yes, the headphone jack does come loose, but I really used mine very heavily (almost daily for 6-8 hours per day) and would remove the headphones from the socket to plug the player into my car or stereo at home. However, if you have a friend w/ a soldering iron, this is some what easy to fix too - online instructions galore.  I think it's a great player and the sound, capacity and price are far better than that of the ipod. I don't give this 5 stars because I do think the buttons are a bit clunky and not intuitive. The software that comes with this devise isn't very good, but again, for a few bucks you can get some really, really good third party software that works via Windows Explorer. And the fact that you can change your battery (I bought a spare when I was going to be travelling a lot and couldn't be sure I'd have access to recharge my battery), I can change the hard drive and I can make other repairs if necessary because I can get into the case which is not the case w/ an ipod!   I'm considering buying the newer version of this and giving my sister this one.

<Content>I've owned one of these 9 months, but about 2 months ago the power jack started getting screwy.  It basically refuses to charge unless I fiddle with it for an hour.  I opened it and it needs to be resoldered in a very hard to reach place.  I finally broke down and bought an iPod instead, and I can say for an $80 difference the change in technology is astounding (much better screen, interface, less annoying software).  I far recommend the iPod to this nowadays (at the time it was a good deal for 30 gigs)  The design is pretty ugly, it's larger than it needs to be, easy to break, the interface is irritating to use and the software is *horrible*.  However, it *is* $220 so if you can live past these problems it will get you by.

<Content>If you want a lot of storage and a basic mp3 player, this is the way to go. However, I do wish I had gone with the Ipod and plan to upgrade... but its all personal preference.  PROs ~Its not picky about file types; you can download just about anything (labeled/licensed or not) and it will play it.  This is not possible on Ipod.    ~Ease of use;  just plug and play.    ~Creative music software; this is a really convienient program and I actually use this over Windows media player.   ~Can use as a external hard drive.  I have about 15 gbs of photos stored on it.  Can't view the photos, of course, just store them.    CONs ~Somewhat heavy and bulky.  I can't workout with it.  Then again, it does have a 30 gb hard drive, so its a tradeoff.  ~The metal case.  Mine doesn't fit exactly right, and makes getting to some of the buttons difficult.    ~The battery is iffy; sometimes it doesn't hold charge.  ~Cheap headphones/case.  Overall, if style matters to you, pass on this.  If it doesn't, you will like it!    ~This might be glaringly obvious to everyone but me, but it is Windows/PC only, not compatible with Macs.

Since then I have upgraded the firmware twice much to creatives credit, including the now playforsure compatibility. It now stands as an equal to the ipod as far as portablity. Its a little bulky compared to the mp3 players available now but I'm not ready to trade up yet. My gripes are the travel case doesnt have a window so its pointless, and you'll have to buy one if you want one.  also the buttons are clumsy and the headphones are uncomfortable. as far as purchasing a new mp3 player now i would get one with the color screens and possibly video player but thats yet to be seen.

Instructions on how to use the player are vague and navigating thru the nomad can be a chore.With all the said, however, i can say that after you get used to the way it works and how to retreave your songs, it really works great. i am sure there are easier mp3 players to use out there but the quality of the music cant be beat. i am buying 3 more for my family for christmas this year

<Title>You take care of it, it takes care of you--Great Product!
<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my Nomad Jukebox since the end of June with no problems.  I was at the checkout with an iPod, watching it and all its accessories for a PC add up to nearly $600 and gulping.  Before finishing the transaction, which was rubbing me wrong anyway, I went back to the small electronics department at Best Buy and happened to run into a Creative rep, who showed me the Zen Jukebox and how to use it.  It came with everything for only $240!  The reason I hadn't seen it before is because it wasn't displayed with all the Apple products.  I'm SO glad I bought it.  It has replaced the 6 CD changer in my car because I use an old tape player adaptor with it from an old portable CD player.  I bought some Creative speakers for $50 and mounted them in my bedroom with which to use the Jukebox, so it has replaced a huge boombox I used to have in there.  I used it in the car for a 980 mile x 2 trip to Oregon and the battery never ran out.  It is a VERY GOOD PRODUCT, but you must handle it with care.  Yes, the headphone jack is a bit touchy and not great for jogging, but this is NOT A WALKMAN, this is a mini hard drive and needs to be treated with care.  AND, LAST PIECE OF ADVICE....if there is the option to buy a service plan wherever you shop, BUY IT--whether you buy a Jukebox or an iPod.  It isn't because they are destined to break, but they are delicate, and getting the service plan is just good sense, good insurance, and you'll kick yourself later if something does go wrong and you don't have one.  Happy shopping--buy the Zen Jukebox if you're money conscious.

I did have a sligh problem with the headphone jack - about 4 months after purchase.  I didnt have my recipt and I had paid in cash.  I sent my player into the tech support team with no recipt and they fixed it for free and sent it back to me at no charge in less than a week.  Great customer support which would give me great confidence in buying from Creative anytime.    I dont particulary like the software that is shiped with the player.  I dont think it is as useful as it could be.  It will not sort the songs in a particular play list by name.    But overall its a very good player and a great company.

<Title>Works well, for however long it works
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm in college and I don't have enough money for an iPod, but it would have probably been worth the extra money if i had it.  I treat my Jukebox like it cost me half a month's pay too.  It worked great for a few months, and when the headphone jack broke, I assumed it was just my bad luck.  I paid the $20 service charge because it was a few days out of the three month warranty, and went back to rocking when they returned a replacement.  Now, just out of warranty again, it stopped working completely.  I've sent it back a second time and when this is over, I will have paid at least $300 dollars total for the thing.  It works well when it works, even if you hold it while jogging or working out, but you better be prepared to pay if you want to keep it working.  Looking at the other reviews on here, I guess my case is unique, but I surely would have gone with the Dell DJ or even shelled out the beans for an iPod if I had it to do over.

<Title>If you are bouncing, don't get a hard drive based MP3 player
<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Benjamin Young's review states that he's had problems while using the Zen Xtra while working out and jogging. Well, any hard drive based MP3 player -- including the iPod -- is going to have problems if you bang it around (think what would happen if you took your laptop with you while jogging). There are memory buffers in these devices to preload content from the hard drive so that if the hard drive skips you won't hear it in the headphones. The Zen Xtra uses a laptop-sized hard drive. Smaller hard drives such as are found in the Zen Micro, Zen Touch, iPod Mini, the Rio Carbon are less prone to skipping, but they're still fragile. These jukebox models aren't really meant to be treated violently, despite what Apple's marketing might tell you.  If you're going to be bouncing around while using an MP3 player, use a flash memory based unit. They're lighter, cheaper and can take almost any amount of shock short of actually damaging the case or buttons.

<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got a NOMAD Zen Xtra 30GB and its really cool. It has worked flawlessly , without any problems for last 2 months. Software is also great to keep it in sync with ur PC. Or if u want to save space u can directly manage the mp3s on the jukebox. Battery is long-lasting, haven't tried to run it for full 14 hrs though. Have to try it out... Only thing that is missing is FM tuner and a line-in to record mp3s directly like some other expensive players have. That would have made it 5 stars. The wake to alarm feature is cool, you can wake to your favorite soothing songs, rather than a wake up beep.

<Title>Purchased 2 weeks back, not bad
<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hi, I bought one from best buy, just 2 weeks back, and have been compairing it to ipod since then. but my perticular player has some problem for adding songs to playlist, Or may be i am doing someting wrong. If i am in say Music folder, then Artist, and then Song, if I select a song and say "Add to Play List" the song does not get added to play list, and the highlighted option on the previous menu shifts one position down !!! apart from this , it is a very good player. I think the biggest disadvantage is the Size.. these things are going to get smaller and smaller , so in next 4-5 months this is going to look like the thing of 80's.. Biggest disadvantage of Ipod was If i am browsing some menu and want to reduce/increase volumn of the currently playing song..I CANT !! thats pathetic.  In this aspect Zen is much better because the volumn buttons are seperate !  the other options that zen have (and ipod does not) are just TOO cool.. like virtual sound etc (EPX settings)  I guess its a choice between saving $100 or looking cool !!  will keep compairing the 2 till zen touch or micro comes out

<Content>I would prefer the iPod as my child and I live a very physically active life and would like to take music with us everywhere.  But overall, if you can't afford a more expensive unit (maybe because your ex is a deadbeat parent), this unit will do.  Add it to your wishlist--a great Amazon feature--this is how my son receives gifts nowadays.  But, as in many things in life, your expectations for this product cannot *warrant* what they should.

<Title>Pretty good for the gym
<Date>Fri Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this to reward myself for 6 months of daily workouts, and I am very pleased with it. The software and user interface took a couple of tries to get used to, but now, I can sit down to my computer and rip my favorite cuts from CD (at my chosen quality level of 192) as fast as my system can process.   At the gym, I have no problem whether I am riding the bike, bouncing on the elliptical trainer, or lifting weights. I've dropped it a couple of times, but it hasn't missed a note.   Two minor points: the included earphones were useless, as I could not get them to stay in my ears. $9 at Wal-Mart bought me a great pair of Sony's  The other is that I haven't seen the battery actually go for 14 hours without charging. 9 was more like it.  Other than that, I have been very happy with my Zen Nomad.

<Title>A better alternative to Apple IPod
<Date>Sun Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This unit is great. I wanted the features of an Ipod without the very expensive cost of one and the Creative Zen delivers. The unit requires about 15 minutes of reading to learn how to use it. The user replacible battery is a good idea. The Creative software needs a little updating though, it's not as smooth as I thought it waould be for downloading music from your library to your zen. But aside from that it really is an Ipod killer.

<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got this Creative mp3 player a few weeks ago and am MORE than happy with it. I used to use a Creative Jukebox 2 and the Zen Xtra shows the same attention to quality and detail.  Of course this small player is still a bit larger than an ipod but the features make it an even trade.  The EAX effects are amazing and work well with the music.  It's also got a pretty good battery life (I've used it for two weeks and it's only my second time charging it).  All in all, I think this is a much better choice than an ipod especially since it is much much cheaper.

<Title>I've had this thing for OVER a year and...
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...I must say, IT STILL WORKS!  When I purchased this thing, the two main things on my mind were SPACE and COST.  If you don't care about the Color Screens, FM Tuners/Recorders, Voice Recorders, or that you can play pong on your MP3 player (or whatever games iPod boasts), then this player is for you.    If I'm any indication, ignore those people who gripe and moan about user interface, included software, and size.  Unlike the more recent iPods, and even recent players by iRiver and Creative, you're not dealing with a click/scroll wheel.  All of the major buttons you'll be dealing with are on the sides of the player, and can be navigated with one hand.  To scroll, it uses a "jog wheel", which may take about 5 to 10 minutes to get used to - TOPS.  The next issue that I'd like to address, and use myself as an example to debunk, is the complaint about software.  Okay, the Zen Xtra can't be seen as an external harddrive, so the only way to move files back and forth is through Creative's Media Organizer.  Maybe I'm not sure what the anti-creative crowd is complaining about, but the software is insanely easy to use as far as moving files to your player goes.  Honestly, you'd have to be pretty computer illerate to not be able to figure out the software within 10 minutes, and I'm no computer expert myself.  Though if you're not a fan of Creative's software either way, there is a program out there called "Notmad", but I've yet to find a reason to not use their Media Organizer.  Oh yeah, a BIG stigma Creative has that I have not experienced: the headphone jack issue.  I don't know whether I'm one of a lucky few, or there is just a silent majority, but I've had no issues with my headphone jack going out on me or anything.  Take that for what it's worth.  Also on the subject of headphones, I don't recommend the stock headphones, just because I'm not really a fan of stock phones, but other than iPod users, how many people use the in box headphones anyway?  Seriously, to enjoy the music at it's fullest potential, just look for some better phones.  I love the EQ/EAX settings on this product, as I set it to different pre-sets for each environment I'm in (I change it when I'm in the car, listening through headphones, etc.), and the screen is good enough for me to see in any situation.  I must also mention the removable battery, something I wish MP3 Players would implement more often.  Assuming the harddrive doesn't die first, I really wouldn't have to upgrade/buy a new player as long as I can find a replacement battery.  Much better, and probably cheaper than those who have to replace their internal batteries through the company, in my opinion.  Finally, let's talk about size and aesthetic.  No, it's not as slim or "sexy" as other players out there, so it won't look good if you're wearing tight pants and small pockets.  The carrying case makes it even bulkier, but if size and aesthetic isn't as important as price and space, then looking at the Zen Xtra is an excellent option.  To conclude this somewhat long review, if you're not into all the jazz and features being offered by Cowon's iAudio X5, iRiver's H10, and the new line iPods, then go for the Zen Xtra.  If the touch pads, the color screens, and other bells and whistles do not appeal to you, then the Zen Xtra is for you.  If you need a player that deals with music (mp3, WAV, wma) and gets the job done - keep the Zen Xtra in mind.  Finally, if you are on a budget, take one more look at the Zen Xtra.  Personally, my next purchase (from Amazon this time) will probably be an iPod Photo 60GB, because my wants in a player have changed in the past year.  I'd still recommend Creative's Zen Xtra to anyone with a tighter budget, but I'd love it if they atleast gave me a color screen with their 20/30/40/60GB models.  I know people like me, who need that much space, may be a rare breed, but don't leave us out totally!  Once again, consider this product if you need the space for music, want to save some money, and don't care too much about it not being as thin as a pencil.  It's well worth the cost, especially if you can find some good (cheap) deals on it!

I like realplayer and it allows you to use realplayer to download your songs as well as other places.  Do not stick yourself with just I tunes - get diversified.

<Title>Ok player, but not worth the money.
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I finally decided on the Zen Xtra, after some time of looking around. I didn't want an Ipod due to the fact I didnt enjoy the sound and price, but thats a differnt review. I decided to buy this because of the following:  - Changeable battery - Huge memory - Very cheap  I live in Paris, so I was extremly excited when it finally arrived. I installed the cd and the program it came with. It took me about 25 mins to understand how to simply add music but once I understoud it I placed all of my music on it in a time span of about 1 hour. Not bad I say, Usb was pretty fast.  Now comes the faults...  -It is extremly large compared to the current 20gb+ Mp3s out there. It was a pain to put in my pocket, and if you have a small hand then good luck on operating the Zen. I can only describe it as a big silver brick.  - The scroller isn't as inuitive as the other mp3s out there either. It didn't always stop where you wanted and sometimes lagged for about a second or two before it would start to move.  - The case it comes with is pointless really. It dose't fit properly, and dosen't protect the screen. All it does it make it harder to hold and 2x bigger.  - And to finish it off... My Zen Xtra died right after the warranty. It had as they call it on the Creative forums/ website a hardware error. Meaning there is nothing I could do. I was told to just buy another. Ha never!!!  Now the good...  - Great Memory, 30gb is alot!  - Ability to have different profiles for different people  - Eax has a range of different options and has ability to make a custom setting.  - Pretty good memory life, I used it about 2 hours a day and reachcharged overnight about 1 or twice a week.  - Removable battery, So you don't have to send entire player to have the battery changed( Like the Ipods).  I think you should just save up for an Ipod or buy an iriver (which I did).

<Title>iPod Killer - less money - great sound - a MUST buy!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I consider myself well versed in the language of portable mp3 players as i've had quite a few since they hit the market, begining back in college.  After using several types (iriver, rio, ipod, creative, olympus, etc...) i can honestly say that I've found the unit that i've been longing for that met each piece of criteria i had.  This unit not only meets my expectations, it exceeds them!  Truth be known, I did have an ipod and was very happy with my purchase.  However, my joy quickly turned to anger as I realized just how limited I was with it.  The battery can not be replaced by the user (you have to pay apple to do that), it only works with itunes software, and apple refuses to release information or software to allow you to use it with music "rental" services like yahoo or napster.  Apple wants to continue to make money off of you long after you buy their ipod.  Battery life began to deteriorate after about 3 months of correct usage.  Also, you're only allowed to contact apple once for a complimentry tech support call.  After that call (in 6 months) you have to purchase an apple care plan which costs over 1/4 the price of the ipod itself.    I finally had enough and decided to do more research into a better player.  I've used several of Creative's products in the past and looked into their new players and discovered the Zen Xtra.  After reading reviews and watching a few demos, i purchased it.  The cost of the unit was $20 more then an ipod mini and my unit has a 40 gig hard drive in it.  Cha Ching!!!  Out of the box, i could tell that the player is a quality unit.  The weight is almost non-existant, barely weighing more then the ipod.  It includes an AC Adapter (you don't get one with an ipod), USB 2.0 cable, carry case, NICE headphones, software, and literature.  The manual was very easy to follow and I was up and running in about 10 minutes.  Even beginner mp3 players will find the set-up easy to follow!    Once the unit was connected the software asks you if you'd like to add music from your My Music folder to the player.  It cofigures itself to work effectively with your computer.  Adding music was a SNAP with the Drag-and-drop feature.  It's incredibly easy to create playlists with as much music as you'd like.  The sound quality with the included headphones is phenominal and the player also utilizes EAX technology which allows you to manually adjust the sound settings to your preference, or even adjust the sound to resemble a concert hall or other locations.  You can adjust sound quality on an ipod, but not to your exact likings as the sound settings are all pre-made on the ipod.  The hard drive is so roomy, i'll never fill it.  At present, I have the 40 gig model and i presently have over 2,500 songs on the player and it's slightly 1/4 full.  It's quiet as a mouse, making virtually no noise as the hard drive spins inside.  Forget about skipping, this player never does... NEVER.  My ipod would get pretty warm/hot after about 30 mins of usage... the zen xtra doesn't even warm up.    The unit does not have a color screen... but... i never noticed the sound quality of my music improving when i had a color screen.  I'm not staring at the screen when my music is playing, i'm doing other things.  The backlight on the zen xtra is a brilliant blue and is easy to read.  You can even customize the way the screen displays information for you.  Navigation is a snap with the click wheel on the side and the buttons are located in easy to reach locations no matter where you store the unit. You can even replace the battery yourself when the time comes, at a fraction of the cost of the ol' ipod.  The battery life is great on this player and you can customize the power settings on this unit to maximize the battery life even further.  Of course.... you can't do this on the ipod either.... At present, i'm getting 13-14 hours on one single charge.  Accessories are easy to come by and the tech support with Creative is truly top notch.  They continue to release firmware updates to support new file types and give you continued features and improvements.  Updating the player is simple with an extensive online support base.  Everything i thought i loved about the ipod is crushed with the creative zen xtra.  Oh, and for you Mac users out there, yes, you can use creative mp3 players on a mac.  The software is called XNJB and it's FREE!  It even works with the USB cable that comes with your zen xtra.  You can also use this player with multiple music services like yahoo and napster.  You can even use this player as a portable Hard Drive to store files and other information on it.  As a graphic designer, i take advatage of this feature extensively.  Don't watch your money burn up, give this player a shot.  You'll fall in love with the features, ease of use, tech support, and impressive sound quality and features.  Don't believe the ipod hype... you're really paying for cool commercial budgets.    Go creative and never look back!

<Title>mostly happy with it
<Date>Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a very good buy at $150 that I paid. While it was one of the least visually appealing models on the rack (even when compared to other creative players) its performance is very good. Installation was quick and easy. Sound is excellent. Capacity is huge: I've put on it over 8,000 tracks at CD quality (300+ CD collection) and still have about 1.5 GB left.  Some of my complaints: 1. Not possible to shuffle within albums or artists or genres 2. Not possible to re-assign genres or albums from within the unit (must write down which tracks and go back to the comp to do it) 3. A bit too large to hold in your hand and mine are big - slippery plastic adds to fear of dropping - indeed did drop the unit, it slipped out of my hand but survived undamaged - would like a wrist strap - unit comes with a protective belt pouch making it even bigger (belt pouch comes right out when you sit down, so it is useless) 4. Must buy new headphones as the ones included are terrible quality - worse than dollar store 5. Only one bookmark can be placed, and if that was not enough bookmark disapears as soon as you choose different album/artist/genre. What's the point of having bookmark if it doesn't stay on?!?! 6. Copying tracks back to CD is a two step deal - must copy to comp harddrive and then to CD 7. Does not support MP3pro 8. Poor battery life My wishes: 1. Line-in recording 2. Built-in radio + record from radio

<Title>Doesn't support To Go subscription services: don't do business with creative
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before you buy, check out the blogs about Creative's customer service. There IS none! Most of us who spent a lot of money last year to buy a Creative Zen Nomad Xtra were disappointed to find out that this mp3 player does NOT support any of the Janus subscription services (like Rhapsody to Go, Napster to Go, Yahoo's to go service). That is bad enough, but any attempt to get a straight answer from the company about firmware updates (so that we CAN use these very cool services) is met with either no response, or a canned "This device does not support these services at this time."   No one has been able to find out when or even IF they ever will. I suspect not.   The other problem is that both my Nomad and my son's have a serious freeze-up problem, one to the point of not being able to be used.  I would highly recommend another mp3 player if you are considering the Nomad and certainly don't buy from Creative, they  pretty much don't care at all about their customers once you buy from them.

<Title>Awesome - new version has been fixed
<Date>Tue Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The newest version has fixed the headphone jack problem.  That was my only complaint.  The User Interface isn't quite as slick as ipod, but more powerful, and more predictable.  (i.e., it has a power button, ipod does not.  It has a volume button, ipod does not.)  Sound is higher quality as well.  the DbNR is 98 Db.  Apple has never published the DbNR, but most people settle on 90Db or so.  SPL is much higher, and it drives the larger headphones very admirably.  I think Creatives investment in E-mu is beginning to pay off.    Now supports audible and Real.  Only complaint is that there is no lossless file support, although I can't honestly tell any difference between a 320 mp3 and flac.

<Title>So Far, It Works : Part 1
<Date>Tue Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this player from zipzoomfly.com ($20 rebate, $207 price, free 2 day shipping) about 2-3 weeks ago, and so far its working pretty well.  Player: So far, it hasn't stopped playing or broken down, but i've held it charged up well, and always had it in it's case. I use it in school, and it's in my pocket as i move around, and so far it hasn't been damaged from running, walking, being sat on (once), etc. The only actual problems i have with the player are simple: 1. Unless you have big pockets, this player is going to fit, but it'll be a really tight fit. 2. With the case,its hard to get both the volume and the search buttons, you i have to keep moving my han to reach the bottons. 3. I had downloaded alot of music, and made about 150 playlists so far, and I turned it on, and found only 5 playlists. I quickly solved this problem by resetting it (the library rebuilds in a minute) and had all my playlists back (note: the songs were there, but the playlists only were missing).   The Computer Program: This is probably the worst part of the player. The program isn't bad, as it is annoying. Once you figure out how to use it (relativly simple drag and drop), but using it later is annoying. The music downloads relativly fast on my USB1, so i can only imagine what it can do on USB2. CD ripping CDs is alot slower (but my cd drive is only 4x) but still fast (5-20 minutes per cd). Organizing music is where this player fails: ID3 Tag (is that right?) is a hassle. I recommend making playlists for every artist, becouse otherwise the songs all go into a genral folder, and even at 10gb, thats alot of songs to scroll through. Songs are arranged by ID3 Tags, and if you have any music you downloaded (not from a website like itunes or Sony, but from Kazaa, imesh, winmx, and such), your ID3 taggs wont be accurate, and the artists, genres, etc will be wrong, mis-spelt, etc, and you won't be able to find any of you music. This is why I recommend making playlists for all your artists: if you download into a playlist, you don't have to aggange you music into playlists later, and all the songs are together, for easy managing, renaming, editing, etc (select them all, then right click, edit). Please note this is not a problem if your music is ripped from CDs or from pay-sites (it comes with a program for identifying all your CD music). The last problem is that when you close out, and come back to edit later, the playlists in the left window (think windows explorer) are in a wierd random order, and this is annoying especially if you have over 100 playlists.  Other then the problems with the program, i like the player so far, and look forward to having it last at least a full year, hopefully two. I plan on making another review after a few months, to (hopefully) prove everybody wrong about the player falling apart.

<Content>better than the ipod...really it is... and i hope you arent fooled by apple when your choosing an mp3 player for you, or someone else...  i own this mp3 player and have owned it for almost a year... it does everything it is intended to do, and then some...  it is VERY DURABLE, it survived my freshmen year of highschool, running from friends/dogs while playing,and a 25 foot drop off of the bleachers...(not recommended)  it comes with a case, unlike ipod (who wants to charge you extra for every accesory you might need)  and for the people that complain about the software, YOU RECIEVE UPDATES for it, for FREE so you can manage your library of music, while listening to songs, and burning cds... very cool  and way stronger than the ipod, (metal exterior), theres no annoying touch screen to wear out on this model...  more space than ipod for the price...  EAX effects you can apply to the soungs while listening, which are kinda cool...and the menus are customizable to an extent...  it has a clock, (displays date/time/alarm) hook it up to a pair of computer speakers and you can wake up to tunes every morning...also you can make and save playists by using the menus of the mp3 player, ipod cannot...  ipod is struggling to keep up with competing companies, apple is coming out with useless little knacks to encourage people to buy their product instead, aka: solitaire, calander, ebooks...  let me just say this... IT IS AN MP3 PLAYER... MP3 PLAYERS ARE FOR PLAYING MP3S... and this little device does that very well..  you can use it as a 30GB exterior hard drive if you must... so you can transfer movies, games, and software, from pc to pc..  this is a very cool toy :) , and mine is still holding up strong i highly recomend it...  and if you decide to buy an ipod for some reason, have fun mailing it in for a new battery ever year or so...  this one uses a replacable lithium battery,  (lasting about 14 hours)  just buy this one...its a no-brainer...

<Title>Great Ipod Alternative: Excellent Capacity, Reasonable Price
<Date>Sun Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I waited a full year before writing a review of my Creative Labs Zen Nomad 30GB Xtra, because some products work well for the first 6 months and then break down once its too late to return. Well, after 12 months, I can say this has been a great purchase, with no regrets. I listen to it everyday going to/from work on the train, with no major performance issues. With 30GBs of storage space, I have 4000 songs loaded and use the extra space to store files I need at work. Another plus is that it plays both WMA and MP3 file formats, so I can play all the songs from my CD library, as well as downloaded songs, without having to convert them. The unit itself is not as graceful/compact as an Ipod, but when you consider a 20GB Ipod costs around $300, whereas a 30GB Nomad costs around $225, I think you get more for you money. Plus, you're not forced to download tunes from Ipod's Itunes store at 99 cents/song.  Regarding usage, I use the included Nomad MediaSource Organizer on my PC. It scans your computer for song files, and then organizes them. You can then plug in your Nomad using the included USB 2.0 cable (which works with a USB 1.1 interface, albeit slower). The computer recognizes the Nomad after a few seconds, after which you can transfer all the songs on your computer (the first time), and then new songs afterward on an individual basis. One major drawback is that if you change a song title, genre, artist name, then the software will not recognize the song as being the same. As a result, you may have multiple versions of the song on your player. Perhaps a new updated version of the software will be `smarter'. Another problem is that you cannot delete or make changes to songs on the Nomad directly - instead you have to sync it with your computer to make those changes.  Regarding durability, the player has not had any major problems, except it froze once, but I pressed the reset button with a toothpick and that fixed it. I haven't dropped it (yet), but I do notice the faceplate of the player is not too secure and has come loose a couple times. If you use the leather case (included), that won't be a problem, but the player will be much bulkier as a result. I use the player without the leather case so I can put it in my pocket, which works fine. I wish there was a separate control unit on the headset cord, because Japanese trains can get so crowded that even my pocket is inaccessible. Speaking of headsets, the included pair are not the greatest, but they work.  The battery is supposed to last 12 hours, but I find that it last closer to 5-6 hours on a single charge. This is not an issue, because I only listen 1-2 hours per day and charge it up at night. One minor complaint - the power indicator has only 4 bars, so once you are down to a single bar, you're never really sure how much listening time you have left (which is why I charge it to full every night). I hope Creative Labs can improve that function on future models.  In conclusion, if you are not concerned about having the coolest, most ergonomic player around, but you want to have access to every song you every owned, wherever you go, the Nomad Zen 30GB Xtra is well worth it.

<Title>Excellent MP3 player for all
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Yes, this was my first mp3 player.But it might very well be one of the best choices I've ever made.I bought a 30GB Zen Xtra from Best Buy as of January of 2004.I must say, I am extremely impressed.Considering the Xtra supports USB 2.0, the transfers for all of my music and data files were outstanding, transferring at an average of 2.9MB per second.That's fast!! And yes, the player stores data files, so if you want to, you can back up all of your important documents on this (or photos if you have a lot of those).The real joy is the superb sound quality you get with this thing.With the SNR coming in at 98dB, this player produces LOUD sound.Very loud.Do yourself a favor, though: be sure to get rid of the earbuds that come included with the player.They make the player sound decent, but nowhere near as amazing as if you used higher quality headphones.My suggestions for headphones include Dynex behind the neck headphones (for the money-conscious, at only $9.99...yes, it's a Best Buy exclusive), and for earphones, try the Sony H.ear earphones (with different style changes, blue and silver).You can create playlists whenever you want to, something you cannot do using an iPod.With an iPod, you have to connect your player to your PC before you can do such a thing.While I'll admit the player loses the contest in looks to the iPod by far, that doesn't necessarily mean it's ugly.It has a very nice brushed-metal feel to it, and scratches don't show easily on it.The bright blue backlight is a plus, and the player controls are very intuitive, as is the interface.Go ahead and put on high quality music files, too: I have yet to come close to running out of space on my player.I still have over 6.5 GB of free space, with MANY songs and data files on it.The player not only supports the MP3 (MPEG-3) format, but also supports WMA (Windows Media Audio) and WAV formats.It supports bitrates from 32kbps (about AM-Radio quality) to 320kbps (True CD-quality), as well as VBR (Variable Bitrate) and CBR (Constant Bitrate).I highly recommend this player to anyone, whether it be their first mp3 player or not.It's very well worth buying, and at only $200, it's a steal.

<Title>Buy Sony and RCA's digital music players instead
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a good music player  and looks pretty nice.It is overadvertised and everyone has one so its not even unique. There are many better players at comparable prices with 20GB or greater harddrive.There are many accesseries you have to buy for it which you'd get free with other mp3 players(SONY Walkman digital music player and my favorite the RCA jukebox and video player)  It holds less songs than Sony's(Sony-13,000)  You can't watch movies in color on a 3.5inch flatscreen(you can on RCA's) Accesaries not included Case-$20-$45(included with Sony's and RCA's) USB cable-$30(included with Sony's and RCA's) No free songs(30 free with Sony's Walkman digital music player)  Dock $40(included with Sony's and RCA's)

<Title>Good value for price - but buggy firmware!
<Date>Wed Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have owned mine for almost a year now. All's well, except for pesky firmware freezes which happens a fairly regular clip--almost once a month. But I use mine almost every day. I haven't been able to pin it down to an exact sequence of button pushes, but it always recovers from it by a simple RESET with a paper clip. About half a dozen times during the syncing process with the PC I have seen it freeze with a seemingly virulent "Library Corrupted" message, but nothing a paper-clip cant fix ;)  I have even gotten used to the UI which is a bit clumsy compared to iPod, but then heck, I knew that before I bought it. I didn't care to pay an extra $200 for the sesky UI on iPod. The tiny jog-dial on the side is not as crisp as it ought to. Once every 5-10 attempts pressing the jog-dial produces undesired results, like going forward a step or going back instead of the "select" function. So its a bit of an annoyance.  What I *LOVE* about this, and something that I haven't yet seen on any other HD-based MP3 player, is one of the EAX functions which allows playback at 0.5x, 0.75x (slow speed) or 1.25x, 1.50x (fast speed) without altering the pitch! That's simply awesome if you have a keen ear for classical music.  The PC application used to organize the songs is awesome. I would have liked a better (more intelligent) auto sync capability.   The MP3 encoder that comes with it is very good.  Overall, a solid A-!!

<Title>My best college purchse
<Date>Wed Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>In getting ready to go to college, I decided I didn't want a big stereo and CD cases taking up space in my room.  So, I bought this MP3 player at Bestbuy and two small but powerful Bose speakers that I can connect to it or to my laptop.  With my first semester coming to an end, I couldn't be happier.  I've yet to have a technical problem with it.  The amount of songs it holds it great and it's easy to use.  The software it comes with is great too, because you can put songs from CDs to your MP3 player without having to put them on your computer first.  So no hard drive space is used up.  You can't say that about ipods.  My sister got the dell MP3 player and has had problems with it too.  I listen to mine for hours everyday...basically when I'm in my room, I have music on, and I love it!

<Title>Not for the technically challenged and others
<Date>Sun Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The instructions are just about worthless. When I first had it I was able to rip and burn CDs. I did get about 40 loaded before it stopped downloading them. What the problem is, I have no idea. It plays fine, but since I can't download anymore music, nor figure out why it doesn't work, I have to say I greatly regret buying this thing. They offer no technical support that I can find. There is a reason why iPOD is the leader it seems.

<Date>Tue Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen for a few months, and, after getting a defective unit replaced, haven't had an trouble with it. My main purpose for writing this review is in response to those complaining about the included software for putting music on your player: If you have a Zen, you can't function properly without Red Chair Software's Notmad Explorer. It's a breeze to use, and I can't imagine using my Zen without it.

<Title>Good but not Perfect
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have not any problems with the player yet but there is somethings that get frustrating. For example it took me hours to figure out how to create a playlist, and you pretty much have to learn how to work it yourself. Also the battery can work for a long period of time or just 90 minutes. The software that comes with it is not very good I registered the product then used windows media player for my music and it was a lot easier. But otherwise this is a great deal and the music quality is great.

<Title>Good player at a great price...but not perfect
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the 30gb Zen xtra a few years back and it is still working perfect and the battery life is still good as well (about 10 hours). I've even dropped it a few times and while one of the corners is a bit scratched up from dropping it, it is still working perfect. As with any product there are pros and cons. Here is what I've found over the years about this player:  Pros: Great battery life. Removable and replaceable battery is a big plus. You could buy an extra on ebay. By the way, for those of you who have a Muvo^2 4gb player may want to know that the battery and charger are exactly the same and interchangable with the Zen Xtra. The sound quality of this thing is amazing... especially if you rip your own mp3's at a higher setting bitrate (like 192kbps or higher). Lots of sound features that let you customize your own equalizer and other settings. By the way, it comes with a good mp3 ripping/compression software called mediasource.   Cons: The case that came with mine didn't have a window for the screen. The newer Xtras may come with a different case that does, so this isn't much of an issue. The size is a bit larger than other mp3 players(especially while using the included case). The controls are not as user friendly as they could be. No FM radio or voice recorder. Not a lot of accessories available for this player.      Creative, if you are listening... here is what we need for the  next Mp3 Zen upgrade. It needs to be a bit smaller yet hold at least 30GB standard. FM Radio and Recorder integrated. Removable battery is a must. Plug and play USB and drag and drop features like the muvo with no software to install would be great. USB charging feature. And last but not least, aesthetically pleasing looks and easy user interface.     Okay, while I was writing this (literally) I just went to the creative website and it looks like they have a new player out called the Zen Vision! Looks very exciting and has all the features I was talking about. Only thing is that it looks like it's $399 retail. Um... can I add that "affordable" needs to be a feature that we need too?

<Title>Very Good Value
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I own one of these for over a month by now. Regarding performance, I have no major complaints. This gadget delivers as promised, and sounds beautifully; even through my cheapo headphones (I could NOT bear the tinny sound of the original Creative headphones, so I replaced them with a pair of Sony low-end cans, which happen to improve the sound a lot.)  Now I will try to analyze the Zen Jukebox in some detail:   1.	Performance: As I said, it is really good. I cannot wait to buy a good pair of headphones, then the sound will surely be even better. Even now I perceive some details I've never had before in some of my oldest songs, it is amazing! One point I did notice: occasionally, the sound gets scratchy, apparently for no reason. I read some other review indicating this same failure and saying that it can only be solved by removing the battery. What I do is changing the album and/or turning the Zen off (using the power button). It has solved the trouble every time and, as I said, it's been very occasional up to this moment. I assume it is related to the fact that this is basically a portable hard-drive which may suffer magnetic interference from other devices (I have a lot of electronics both at home and at work).A good pair of headphones is essential so you can really get the most out of your investment. 2.	Battery: I charged it for 04 hours the first time, following the Manual's instructions. An average of 10 effective hours can be expected from a 03 hours charging. Considering I have to use a higher volume level to compensate my lack of good headphones, I guess this is acceptable.  3.	Software: Many people complain about the accompanying software. It's certainly not the best they could supply. Nevertheless, it has some advantages: for example, transfer is unbeatable faster than with any alternative (Windows Media Player and Real Player, for example). And I've found a way to rip a CD and transfer the files directly to the Zen without saving to my PC hard drive (it saves time and space)! As I mentioned, you can also rip and transfer from Windows media Player and Real Player. 4.	Connectivity: As the manual acknowledges, this is not intended to be an additional hard drive. But it would have been a blowout if it were. This means you cannot plug it in to any PC and expect it to receive or send files on the go. The Nomad Explorer installation is required first. Transfer speed is generally  good, but amazing if you use the Creative Software: for my usual songs, it averaged a second or less per song! 5.	Navigation: You can easily access any song, album, artist or genres, assuming you have taken care of ID tagging your MP3s. The bad point here is that you can only create real playlists in your PC and using the Creative SW. It is virtually impossible to do it in the device itself. But I've read some one say that you cannot play album tracks in the original order. This is not true; you only have to select the album.  *	Pros: Very good  price/value ratio; excellent sound; doubles as data storage  *	Cons: Cannot create playlists on the device; not for athletes

<Content>Many people are audiophiles and search endlessly for other options besides the infamous iPod for enjoying music on a portable mp3 player.  I feel that the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra is great.  It has plenty of space and works very well.  The Nomad has an excellent screen display, and it is easy to search through your files.  Also, unlike other mp3 players, you can directly transfer music to your mp3 player and from the mp3 player to a computer (any computer that can comply with the system requirements). Sure it's not as stylish as other mp3 players with its slight clunkiness and large earphones, but if you are searching for quality and not necessarily good looks, then I believe you cannot do any better. It's great and I take it everywhere!

<Title>Headphone Jack Defective
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've used my Zen Xtra very little - mostly on long road trips plugged into my car stereo, or on long flights. It's received very, very light use. Even so, the headphone jack on it is totally broken, rendering the player completely useless. This is apparently a common problem with these players - the jack is flimsily attached to the main board of the player. It clearly takes only the lightest use to sever the headphone jack connections, and once it breaks you can't do a thing about it. Bye bye Zen Xtra. Do a web search and you will come up with numerous web sites talking about this issue. It's a well known issue. Creative refuses to fix it even though it is clearly a defect in the product. They want to charge close to one hundred dollars to fix it - half the price of what I originally paid for the unit. Yeah - it costs less than an IPod, but all I can say is you get what you pay for.

My wife has a ipod mini, the ipod sofeware and controls are much more user friendly than the creative.  The software was very hard to find on my desktop once it was in installed, veryy odd. My Mp3 fell 3 feet onto a hardwood floor and that was the end of the hard drive for my Mp3. If you do get player make sure to get a extended warrenty.  My next player will be a ipod or iriver.

<Title>Simple, Solid, Almost Perfect
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Buying things online is not foreign to me, neither was having my entire music collection with me. Back then of course this meant several CD wallets and not much room in the glove box! I bought the Jukebox during the early days of ipod as a sound, cheaper, and equally competative product. I will never look back. Its not the most asthetically pleasing device but it does the job, I don't go in for fashion things for twice the price. Sturdy piece of kit with a carry case (very plush!) and its so simple to use your nan will have her sinatra on it before you can blink! The software provided isn't the most user friendly true enough but if you have 10 minutes to actually work it out properly its really really easy to use!  I've moved well over 4000 songs on mine with plenty i get from sharing media with others (not by dodgy rip off downloads). Plus I have saved over 5 years of digital photos onto the player too. I can't view them on it, but having a safe back up of all my photos is great.  Initially I had a little hiccup as the hard drive suffered a hardware error and wiped itself which hats off to Creative was sorted and a new player issued within 1 week! Plug in and reinstalled before I knew it.  Plug, Rip, Share, Play, so so simple. The only thing lacking is the ability to link it into the car without using a dodgy tape link thing or seperate mini speakers. Once creative achieve this, anyone owning this will be laughing! 4 stars but only because the software can be hard to get used to and because there is always room for improvement DJ

<Title>Great Product, great price
<Date>Sun Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is probably the best mp3 player you can buy for the price it has. It can store more songs than anyone can come up with and probably only crake about 3/4 of is memory. With reading these reviews it may seem like "you get what you pay for" when reading about its reliability. But in reality all you have to do is simply TAKE CARE OF IT! its that easy! For instance, don't let it drop 3 feet on a hard wood floor *cough*. Im sure most heavy mp3 players would stop working after that fall. There's basicly one rule to this, if you treat it like crap, it will work like crap. Keep in mind this is a 30 GB hard drive first, and a mp3 player 2nd.   Ok now that i have all of your worries about reliability gone, we can talk about its performance. I have to say this thing is good, and i mean good. the sound is great, its easy to use, the only problem is the size, which is well worth whatever it cost. Also the program i got from it is great, its really easy to use and it knows exactly what cd your burning (even if you made it yourself). making tags for songs and albums is so simple with this, you barly have to do any work. So anyway this is the product, its recomended to anyone that is not going to use this for jogging or anything like that, cause of its size.  By the way, i like the reviewer that made a pro's and con's list and under cons put: Stupid and Crappy. That made my day, I love people.

<Title>Ipod Schmipod
<Date>Mon Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen for five or six months now; it's a great little item. No problems. It's solid and sounds very good with my Etymotic headphones, and it has taken my music enjoyment to new heights and places. I have over 2000 songs and pieces on the unit, rock/pop/folk, jazz and classical recorded at high mp3 bit-rates. And there's space for plenty more. I put the Zen on random, and away we go. What odd and often wonderful juxtapositions of music come up. I would give the Zen **** and 1/2 if I could.  A few quibbles. The battery life is fairly short, not near twelve hours, probably more like four. The menu pointer is a bit touchy, takes some fussing, and the software is quite serviceable but could be better. Sveltness and size is where the Ipod wins. Everywhere else, I'd take the Zen. Size, well the Zen's bigger, but it's not exactly huge. Neither the Ipod nor the Zen are meant to be worn during sport--mechanical hard drives don't like to be jostled--and both will fit into your pocket.  The Zen has been reliable--my main concern. I use it daily in my car. When I walk with it I clip it to my belt in its leather case. I charge it nightly as it is recommended that one does not run the batteries all the way down.

I have 60GB hard disk in my pocket for storing my data, plus I can listen to the music! The software is very easy to use (Explorer-type drag-n-drop), strips CD's in no time, great sound! Earphones that come with it though are pretty pathetic, but it's a minor detail. I love my Zen, it is not as "cool" and "mainstream" as i-pod, and of course it was never on the cover of Newsweek magazine, but it's a great buy nontheless. I would highly recommend this player as both a jukebox and an extra disk space that fits in your pocket.

<Title>Unfulfilled Early Promise
<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>As an audiophile, I just this last year succumbed to the allure of being able to take most of my music with me and bought first an Archos Gmini (battery life of about 1 hour) and then the Zen Xtra. What I like about this unit: using WMA files ripped at 192kbps, the sound is often quite good, especially with a decent set of 'phones (Sony MDR-EX71). The size of the unit, while larger than the iPod, is perfectly acceptable. I even like the stying. And the price is right. With so much storage, I can carry most of my CD colletion with me. What I don't like: EAX "ambience" settings are a pure gimmick, sound pretty bad, and reduce the volume too much.  The buttons are flimsy.  The software is an abomination. And if you want to actually try the world of purchased digital music, it's probably best to stay with iPod.  I used MusicMatch, and have been unable to get the files onto my device after it recently crashed. Which brings me to the Achilles' heel of this unit: poor reliability.  My first unit died within a month after about a 6" tumble to the floor. My second unit crashed, too, for no apparent reason and I had to reformat the hardrive.  Now the FF and rewind buttons won't work. My unit is no longer covered by the ridiculous 3-month warranty, and customer service is a sad joke.  Being able to take so much music with you is great. But if this is what you have to put up with, it's not worth it.

<Title>Amazing Player
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recieved this Mp3 player as a Christmas gift and i couldn't be happier, It has enormous amounts of storage and the sound is crystal Clear. The only complaint that i have is it is a tiny bit big but other than that i love it.  ------EDIT------ This player is wonderful!! EXCEPT, It broke after 2 weeks after It fell 3 feet to a tile floor. Before that it was wonderful, i am replaceing it with an Ipod because they are more shock resistant. If you deceide to get the Mp3 Player only get it if you wont be in an active envoiornment BECAUSE IT WILL BREAK!!! And purches it from amazon!!!

<Title>I don't know why everyone has problems with it
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got it about 3 months ago, and I still love it. Playback is still perfect, I like the software a lot (others hate it for some reason), and I have yet to have a functioning problem. It took me about an hour to figure out how to put songs on it without it getting messed up, but that was my stupidity, not the players fault. It make take a while to get fully used to the scroll wheel, but it is a breeze to navigate once you do. It now comes with a snazzy leather case, complete with a nice viewing window. Now volume issues, this thing goes LOUD! I can't stand to have it on 23/25. However, it keeps perfect clarity even on 25/25, and sounds great when you run it through speakers. I run it through my surround sound system with it and the surround sound on full volume, and it still sounds clear. Not that its always too loud though, it has a good volume for any setting. The headphones that come with it are crappy, but that may just be because they are earbuds, which I hate. USB 2.0 is fast as hell. It takes me more time to put stuff from a CD onto my computer than it does to put stuff from my computer onto the mp3 player. All this, and its not over priced like others in the markert. *coughipodcough* I doubt that you have enough songs you actually listen to fill the 8000 mark, so feel free to put them in super high quality. Its also got some good playmodes, including a shuffle all, so you have a DJ that only plays music you like. You can sort your music by track, alblum, artist, genre, rating (you rate them in the software program), or how recently they were added. I find the EAX audio has several great features, but some features that are kind of pointless, extra fetures never hurt I guess. There is a slow motion mode, geat for musicians like myself who want to figure out how to play parts of songs. It also has a way to set a custom EQ, which I like. Finally, it has a mart-volume mode, with presets for trains, planes, cars, late nights, and some other stuff. The part that is stupid is environment mode. If you ever wondered what your song would sound like in a church, bathroom, jazz club, or several other odd places, environment mode can help you out (to each his own, I suppose) If you buy an Ipod after looking at this player, you are quite foolish IMO.

<Title>Awesome so far!
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My husband bought a Creative Zen Nomad 30GB for Christmas.  So far, it's been a blast.  I have uploaded 10GB of music onto it so far and it has already made my drive to work so much better.  I told my husband I wanted this player after reading about the battery issues of other mp3 players.  This one has a huge capacity, good durability so far, great sound quality, and a replacable battery.   I found the software to be pretty intuitive--after a few transfers I got the hang of it.  It's pretty much drag and drop.  The fact that it checks for duplicate files is really nice.  The upload rate is really fast with USB 2.0--in a matter of a couple hours I organized and uploaded 2500 files.    The player itself is nice and compact.  It's a tad heavy given its size, but then again, it IS a portable hard drive.  I am being very careful with it because of that--it's not a tape-based system, and I don't think anyone should treat a portable hard drive like this roughly.  The case that comes with is helpful, but I'm still being careful.    The buttons are laid out in such a way that it makes the player very intuitive to use.  Track advance is on one side, while volume is on the other, and the buttons are shaped in such a way that you can find the button you want to press even when you're not looking.  The select wheel button takes a bit of a light touch to get it right, but after a short while I got used to it.  The screen size is great--it displays all the information I would like to know about a track while playing.  It even gives you a count of how many songs are on your player.  I think the earbuds that come with are pretty good.  They might be a little big for someone with really small ears, but I think the sound quality is great.  I have uploaded mp3s that I have downloaded as well as those that I have ripped from my own CDs and have had no problems getting the player to recognize them.  It even plays .wav files.  One of the things that has always attracted me to Creative is their attention to different styles of sound--you can adjust it so your music sounds like it's being played in a concert hall or live in the same room, so it's amazing how it sounds.    I would recommend this player absolutely so far.  I will repost another review in a few months just to put in my two cents about durability.  All in all, it's a great buy so far for any music junkie!

<Title>Excellent, great storage, sound, quality
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recieved this as a gift, and was astonished when i first downloaded my cds onto the unit.  they transferred lightning fast, and no loss of quality.  AMAZING storage capacity, up to 8, 000 songs.  i already have 150, and i have only had it one day!!!  I would recommend buying an extra set of headphones/earbuds.  The stock set is usable, but cheap, breakable, and not great sound quality.  It is better than the Apple iPod's because it had way more features, it may be slightly bigger, but the compromise is way worth it.  this is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Best purchase ever! Afer reading this you'll have to buy!!!
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recived this item on chirstmas and down loaded all of my muscic (about 300-400 songs) in just above 30 minutes.If your purchase this item for anyone they could transfer all their music without parental help. Once it froze-up on my bot get a paper clip and press reset and your fine,no this will not earse your music.The only thing i dont like about this great product is the power bar has only 3 bars so you dont know if your battery is almost dead or almost fully charged.Some people say the head phone jack is faulty but this is not true.The best feature is the EAX audio feature it lets you controll sound,loudness and change the sound of the sound setting such as put on the indoor arena and all of the suden you think your in an indoor stadium during half time while they prefom the music.The allover rating out of 1,000 its 1,000 if you buy this produt you'll definatly agree with me.
