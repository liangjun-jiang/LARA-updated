<Title>Well Made Sounds Great
<Date>Sun Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I love my New Samsung player. The negative reviews are humorous. You can tell they were written by IPod owners &quot;defending&quot; their choice.I'm new to all this and could care less about Apple, Steve Jobs or anyone else. I just want a good player and legal service so I don't get nailed for stealing music.<br>I tried iTunes, Rhapsody and Napster. They are all fine. Anyone who says this player is no good or an iPod is a piece of garbage are just plain wrong.<br>My preference is for the Napster player that I bought because I like the Napster service the best. Its all about taste and I can't see all the fuss over priasing the iPod and trashing this perfectly fine music player/

<Content>Got one of these players today at Best Buy as they were out of the iPod. Can't complain I am using the napster service and for the same price as a 20GB Ipod I got a 20 GB Samsung player with 20 free Napster downloads and some nice extra features not found on the iPod.

<Title>Certainly a winner
<Date>Sun Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I researched this product in the magazines and here on Amazon. The only negative reviews were found here and I took them with a grain of salt as they were obviously written by iPod fanatics. When a reviewer says the Samsung Napster player &quot;does not work at all&quot; or &quot;it fell apart&quot; and then suggests that I buy an iPod, I have to seriously doubt the genuiness of the review.<br>In any event, the player is great and I have nothing to add except how to get the best price.<br>At Best Buy they have the player for $399 and you get 20 free tracks on Napster.<br>On Amazon you can get it through J&amp;R Music world for $399 and it comes in a couple of days or you can order it from Amazon for $379 and it comes in a week or two. I don't know if you order through Amazon or J&amp;R if you get the 20 free songs.<br>Find the best price and get this superb player.

<Title>Incredible
<Date>Mon Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>How they fit all the product features and storage space in such a small player is truly a miracle. The battery lasts for at least a week of my hour long + jogging sessions.<br>The best part about the player is the connection to the Napster service which rocks. I am a music nut and have tried them all.<br>Rhapsody sounds good but is limited on the download side.<br>Itunes doesn't let you listen to more than 30 seconds of a song.<br>Napster is by far the most extensive and flexible service out there. <p>The Napster player is the best way to take your tunes on path and on the road-it works really well in the car too!

<Date>Tue Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>It says that this player seamlessly intergrates with napster, but can u just download songs to the player without napster if you already have existing songs on your computer?

<Content>I connected my device to Napster last night and a new firmware release auto downloaded onto the device. The navigation is now even better and the device has speed improvments.<p>I like this device a lot. The battery life is way better than my iPod. The iPod just dies after a couple days sitting on the shelf.

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The best thing about this player is that it can serve many purposes.<br>1. as the obvious portable player tapped into Napster<br>2. for use in the car with the built in radio fm transmitter (something the Ipod does not have)<br>3. as your home stereo. Many people don't want to be tied to their computers to listen to music. They can use this player hooked up totheir stereo or just buy a good pair of speakers to hook into the system and plop the player anywhere you'd like in your living room. This avoids having to stream music via a wireless router from your computer to your living room system.<p>The features are all great and the interaction with Napster is a plus.<br>You can download all your other music not bought on Napster onto the player as well.<br>The only downside to this player is the cheap earplugs and handheld remote.<br>The rest of the player is top shelf and in all regards a superior player than the iPod.

<Title>good player/recorder.
<Date>Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>i see alot of ipoders flaming sammy here as anywhere else... basically both are nice mp3 players. both have working software accompanying hardware. both are from competent electronic producers. now design wise, yes apple got &quot;IT&quot;. it is so cool to look at ipod. however i got the sammy because of the FM recording capability and FM transmitter. OH YES! it is so awesome. i have no idea how i ever lived without these two features. (remember bart simpson and the FM radio mike? i have so much fun with this...) and all the special radio only mixes that i have in my collections. these stuff you just cant buy!<p>now to sum it up, i'm pretty sure ipod is good, if you want just a basic player. however if you know you way around electronics and want a extra features that you'll grow on, choose sammy. it may be little pricey but hey when you are using it every single day, almost every hour, who cares!

<Title>Returned my Ipod and got this great player!
<Date>Sat Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I made a mistake and bought into the Apple hype. I overpaid for the ipud and luckily learned of the Samsung Napster player which works with Napster. i did not know fo the player before I bought the ipod and then I realized that the Ipod only uses some proprietary Mac format that did not work with Napster. Also the ipod lacks the extra features of the Samsung Napster player like the FM tuner and the car adapter and voice recorder.<br>All in all I was luck in that I managed to return my ipud  the next day for this great player.<br>I am now enjoying Napster!

<Title>this player is not good
<Date>Sat May 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this player continually has problems uplaoding mp3 files from the "propreitary" Napster software and it constantly freezes up, i've sent it back to Amazon once and got another one- and the one I got did the same thing! - also the FM transmitter to the car radio doesn't even come close to working - this player doesn't do anything it claims to do but frustrate the user- there have been many times i've thought about throwing the thing against a wall after it freezes up for the upteenth time on the treadmill -I should have gotten something else

<Title>Excellent MP3 player
<Date>Fri May 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Look - it's inevitable, so let's get the comparisons to the iPod out of the way right away. This is not quite as stylish; you cannot create playlists on the fly or play games; and...and...<p>Right.<p>If you are buying an MP3 player to be stylish, you are kind of weird anyway and form over function is a poor choice in technology.<p>If you want to play games, get a cell phone with games or something.<p>IF, however, you want an MP3 player that plays MP3s and WMAs, has massive storage capacity, is lightweight, offer easy control of functions, and at least for me has so far worked flawlessly, look here.<p>iPods are overpriced. Simple fact. Plunk down the money for an iPod and you get a pretty little piece of mp3 player that can't play WMAs, gets annoyed if you try to circumvent iTunes, and has a battery that will most likely die on you in a few months (look it up, it's true). Oh, but that's ok - it's backed up by Apple's legendary customer service. By which I mean atrocious and feared customer &quot;service.&quot;<p>Get the Samsung. It's a good player. I admit that the FM transmitter is wimpy, but I didn't buy it to play mp3s in my car - and even if I want to, I have a tape adaptor from my satellite radio that works fine with the headphone-out jack on the YEPP. FM reception is great and you can record directly from another digital source with the line-in jack...and they include the cable! (something iPods do not), along with a (albeit meagre) carrying case, FM transmitter antenna, surprisingly decent earbuds, and the USB cable.<p>Go ahead and get it - I highly recommend.

<Title>No more CD clultter in the car!
<Date>Thu Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Samsung/Napster player is my first MP3 player ever. I compared it to others in the market, most notably the mini iPod and finally took the plunge. I am very pleased with the player.<p>The Napster software that accompanies the player is user-friendly and the user manual is very clear and informative. My only complaint is the FM transmitter function. The sound quality is good, but not great, and there is static between tracks. You will need to find the best EQ setting for the music you're listening to or else get way too much bass pumping through your car speakers. <p>Not being able to change playlists on the go could be a hang up for some people, but if you're using it to commute, it's perfect!  <p>If you're a windows guy/girl, I recommend this player for you!

<Title>Heartbroken -- I really WANTED this to be a great product.
<Date>Wed Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>There are a b'jillion MP3 players out there.  I have wanted one for about a year, but this one had an FM transmitter, which is what really seperates it from the pack (well, that &amp; the integration with Napster, which didn't matter to me).  I wanted to be able to listen to this in my car, at home, wherever.  And the FM transmitter should make that easy -- you don't have to carry anything else; just the unit.<p>Without going on too much, here's why I'm returning it:<p>1) The FM transmitter is very poor.  It's not just that the range is short (which it is), it also has crackling static all the time, regardless of which station I selected, and regardless of how close I put the unit to my receiver/antenna.  This was the case both in my car and on my 2 home radios.  I could hear my music well only if I turned the radio way up and had the unit within 1 foot of the receiver.  Even then there was an annoying static noise going all the time.<p>2) I had to reformat it -- twice -- and I only had this thing for about 36 hours.  When I downloaded my MP3s to it, everything seemed fine, but then when I would try to disconnect the device I kept getting &quot;Cannot disconnect right now&quot; messages.  The software said it was finished transferring -- I waited another hour, nothing happened -- so I shut down my PC &amp; disconnected.  None of my files were on the unit.  I could see them in Win Explorer, but they wouldn't play on the unit.  Reformatting fixed this, but wiped the drive clean &amp; I had to start over.  Second time worked with a transfer of 100 songs.  Then when I tried to transfer the rest -- another reformat.<p>3) You can only load music (even your own MP3s that you ripped from your own CDs) through the Napster software, and the Napster software sucks.  It froze on me several times, wrote corrupted files to the MP3 device, and is generally slow.  I did upgrade the software which improved the speed &amp; stability a bit.  But now that I'm returning the player, you can bet that I'll be removing Napster from my PC.<p>Anyway, that's it.  I'm really disappointed -- all I was looking for was an MP3 player with a (decent) FM transmitter.  If I was just a little geekier I could probably make this at home.  I hate that the only player on the market with a transmitter is so unreliable &amp; has such poor sound on the transmitter.

It is a excellent MP3 Player. I can play music using FM transmitter in my car. I am very pleased with this Samsung MP3 Player. Finally, you pay less, and get more feature than iPod.

<Title>Sadly, I'm Abandoning Napster Because of This Product
<Date>Sat Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a reconditioned YP-910GS from an Amazon dealer.  Unit works fine (although I agree with other reviewers that the FM transmitter's too weak); problem is that the current edition of the Napster software won't recognize it (though an earlier edition did, which permitted me to load some songs).  Customer Service made an initial attempt to solve the Napster software problem, then went silent.  Since the Napster software interferes with all attempts to load even Napster-purchased tracks onto the unit via WMP or any other way, I'm stuck with $90 worth of Napster songs that I can't get onto the unit.  I've thrown my hands in the air and downloaded I-Tunes (which, of course, doesn't like the Napster tracks, either).

<Date>Mon Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>BUY SOMETHING ELSE - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ONE.  There are plenty of other choices and I am so disapointed that I chose this one!  The FM transmitter, which is the reason I chose the YP-910GS is abslolutly useless - no volume and no treble.  The unit itself and full of bugs (crashes when you turn it on and has to be reset) and Samsung provides little to no support.  STAY AWAY!

<Content>I have had mine for about 60 days now and it just broke today.   I truly loved this player. I had great features and could seamlessly import playlists from Napster. There must be a reason why they don't make this one anymore...  There are tons of refurbished players on the market. Guess why?

<Title>Buy some thing else
<Date>Sun Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>To start the FM receiver is weak and the tramsmitter is even worse. I can have the player next to the antenna and it still gets over powered by local stations. I never got any downloads from napster and didn't care for about all of the songs that came preloaded. I had to send it back to Samsung because I had problems tranfering music files. It won't do some tranfers unless your logged on to Napster. There was no mention that you needed to be logged on to transfer music. When I got it back I still had trouble tranfering files. One of the worst purchases I have made. The only good thing is that Samsung has good tech support and customer service personel.

<Title>Do not waste your time
<Date>Mon Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This gets 2 stars because I really liked the hardware. Problem is, the software is from Napster and the hardware is from Samsung and even though they say they are in "partnership" the software doesn't work with the hardware at all.  Simple things like ripping a CD to the Samsung is a nightmare. The software acts like it's pulling CD data from CDDB, but it's not. You either get a garbled mess, or nothing. Even though the manual says that you can build a play list on your computer and then drag and drop it to the Samsung, you can't. In order to do practically anything, you have to sign in to Napster first.  And, of course, when you call for technical support, Napster blames Samsung and Samsung blames Napster. Both are pretty clueless.  Just get a standard MP3 player and forget about this Napster/Samsung stuff.
