<Title>Good as Rio, but no audio book support... Why?!

<Content>I have purchased Siren SIR103 IV 4 GB MP3 Player, as a former owner of Rio products I'm happy with Siren overall. I have one question about a feature that is very important for me as an audio book listener. It seems that I cannot make my Siren to remember the last position of the track after a powerdown - it does remember the album and the last song but not the current position. For a long abook track (20+ minutes) it is  imposable to navigate to exact point of a track where you had to shutdown the device. I called the customer's support - they confirmed that the feature was dropped!. Why?! A such small feature will cost them to lose 10% to 30% of the MP3 market!. Oh well, I'm returning the unit back to store.

<Content>I have owned three of these mp3 players.  The first one was indestructible, but I was finally forced to get a new one.  The 2nd one (bought here at Amazon, through J&R) didn't work, so I returned it and got it replaced. The third one had even more problems than any of the others, so I'm now in the process of finding something else.  The positives?  Great price, replaceable AAA battery, good sound.  The negatives?  Quite a few, unfortunately.  The player will shut off all the time, for no obvious reason.  Then you have to power it back on, which sometimes takes several minutes.  The "shuffle" feature works oddly: sometimes after powering off, if you had it on "shuffle", it will take you right back to the beginning of the shuffle sequence.  In other words, the shuffle follows the exact same pattern all the time, unless you manually reconfigure it.  And even then, if you've done that, and it turns off on its own, it will start again at its ORIGINAL shuffle sequence beginning.  VERY annoying.  The buttons work.....sometimes.  Other times, they just don't.  The display is fine as long as you're not in any kind of light; then it's impossible to read.  This could have been a great deal, but with all the little quirks and malfunctions and other problems, it's just not reliable enough to keep around.  I wish I had saved the receipt from this latest one: I would've returned it and asked for my money back.  In short, don't buy this unless you're into irritation.
