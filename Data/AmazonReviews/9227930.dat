<Title>I Love my I Pod Touch
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Being of the 40 over generation and needing reading glasses, the Ipod touch is wonderful, I don't have to squint to read those little buttons.  It's all on the screen and large enough to see. Then I just touch away.  Editing photos for my contacts is so easy, and I love showing off my I Pod touch to everyone and how easy it is to use.  Watching music videos and movies.  Now when I do have a long airplane ride ahead of me, I can download a movie or two and watch them while on the plane.  I also listen audio books, meditation music and classic rock and roll and even my some of my daughters music, which I probably woulnd't have done before, so I am keeping up on some of the newer music and videos.  My IPod touch is great.

<Content>My fiance and I bought iPod touches at the same time and we both LOVE them.  Wouldn't trade it for any other mp3 player.  The only thing that sucks is having to spend an additional 20 bucks to get the upgrade, but it is worth it.  We have reccomended this product to all our friends.  Everyone that has tried ours have felt the same about them as we have.

<Content>This is definitely the best iPod ever made. The icing on the cake is the price, you won't find a better price than the one they have here at amazon, and trust me, I searched. With free 3-day shipping included, what are you waiting for?

<Content>My review of the IPOD TOUCH  is just spectacular ,I give it this review because I drop my ipod in some water and didn't even realize it until it was to late and it got all wet' and I had just purchase it on the 27th of Jan, anyway I thought all was lost until 3 days later I put the ipod on the modem from my desktop which generates heat' by doing that the remaining water that was inside the IPOD gradually disappeared before u know it I was using my ipod again. I was really upset before this happen but luckily it returned to it's original form,"however APPLE design this product I give them a thumbs up, they must have had some type of protection around the chip inside but whatever it is it saved my ipod from destruction..
