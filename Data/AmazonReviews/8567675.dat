<Title>Forget the negative reviews.  This thing is brilliant
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, first of all let me say I am a VERY critical first class gadget whore.  And this thing is amazing.  The screen resolution is not amazing...but honestly, if you are watching a well encoded Divx or Xvid file you will not notice at all!  The battery life is very good...just over four hours for me.  Using it in hard drive mode could not be easier.  If you download tv shows from the internet ....or want to copy your DVDs over....it works amazingly easily and looks great.  The 7" screen is a completely different experience from anything you've seen before in portable media players.  The device is not pocket sized...but it actually is surprisingly small and handy.  It won't fit in your pocket...but, when in it's case, it is just slightly larger and heavier than a paper back book (though MUCH thinner).  My ONLY complaint about this device is the docking device to plug it into the TV.  There is no place to plug in an RF cable...so if you are on the road plugging it into a TV involves either a DVD or VCR.....or an RF modulator AND a System Switcher...which sort of defeats the purpose of it's portability.  But that is a relatively small complaint considering.   I LOVE THIS THING>...for $300...it's a steal.  Macros

<Content>I use this product extensively throughout the day for music, news and movies.  I record movies at night, the business news before I awake and music from my satellite provider.  I listen to satellite radio in my car and watch bloomberg news with my morning coffee at work.  Then, in the evening, I have additional entertainment options with my menu of videos.  I have also had the pleasure of sharing vacation photos on the big screen television.  This last feature is possible because of the docking station that totally integrates this DVR with the satellite and TV.  The included remote essentially controls all actions!

<Title>***  AWESOME  ***

<Content>I purchased this item for myself with my Christmas bonus.  My brother turned me on to Archos a while ago.  He bought his wife a unit that just displays pics and plays music.  While exploring their site I came across the AV700 and realized that this was the one for me!!  Since it's more costly, I've waited til now to purchase - it was soooo worth the wait!!  I love this thing!!  I've downloaded movies, music, pics and also DVR'd TV shows & movies.  I use mine mostly to watch stuff and you can easily view your downloads or DVR's on the screen.  The initial set-up of the different downloads (music, pics, movies, dvr) is not the best, takes a few times of going over the directions (which are minimal at best) to get the hang of it.  But once you've mastered them, it's very simple.  Also, it was great that it came with all the accessories needed.  My husband was so impressed with mine, that he had me go back online and order up one for him!!

<Content>This is a great unit.  Got it to record movies for the kids.  Replace portable dvd units that last usually less than a year.  Great product.  Only bad thing is battery does not last as long as I would like for it but I no worse than anything else in this size.

<Title>AV700 Beats a Laptop or Portable DVD Player
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used a laptop and portible dvd player to view videos and prefer my AV700 to both hands down. The unit is about the size of a paperback book. It turns on in seconds. The screen in no different from the LCD on a laptop or dvd player. For convience, it is unmatched. On a Windows computer with XP, the unit is recognized as an extra hard drive making it easy to drag and drop video and music files. During playback of a movie, you can easily "mark" where you stop and the unit can return to that point when you it turn back on. I keep about 30 movies on it at any one time and still have room to spare. The unit works seamlessly with Amazon's video download service. When transferring a file, Windows will tell you if the file is not compatible with the unit and refer you to Windows Media Player, which will convert and download files for you. All in all, using this is a "no brainer". It's easily the best gift I've received in years.

<Title>nice player
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had a very good experience with the playback on this player.  The sound quality goes down when you use headphones that adjust volume on the cable, so I would recommend using headphones that don't. Only issue I have is that the 700 uses a different size power cable than every other model and I could not find a replacement on the archos website (which isn't the easiest to navigate) and calling on the phone wasn't very effective either... I guess the company is geared to the advanced users, but geeks lose power cables too right?
