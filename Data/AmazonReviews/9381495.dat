<Title>Even a dummy can use it
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am a complete novice to MP3 players, and only a little computer savvy. I have resisted the MP3 craze for a long time now because I am an old school audiophile and prefer "albums" to "tunes". But when my FM headphone unit I used for workouts at the gym crapped out on me, I decided to take the plunge, assuming they could be had with FM capability for the option of watching the TVs at the gym.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how easy this Sony is to use, and how good it sounds. I did have to download an updated version of Windows Media Player, but once I did that even a tech dummy like me easily ripped my favorite CDs to my computer, and "sync-ed" the songs to the MP3 player.  And the sound is pretty good for a relatively cheap set of earbuds, with actual bass and good clarity. I'm not going to give up my multi-thousand dollar stereo anytime soon, but for car and gym use, it will do very well.  My only problem is finding an armband for it, seems any elastic armband with a small sleeve would work but I'm haven't found one yet.  [EDIT]I did find a cheap armband that looks promising, a Nextar MA-ASAB01. The Sony fits pretty snugly and is still accessible due to the clear plastic pouch of the Nextar.

<Title>very good, could be better
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This little mp3 player is well worth the money invested. The SOUND quality is fantastic, probably on the level of Creative players, and much much better than Ipod. That said it is probably little more on the bass side. You can edit it with 5 channel Eq - which is great and makes sound just the wasy you want. DESIGN is one of the best I have seen, it is clad in nice, not cheap platic, you can feel the different options without even looking at the small, albeit incredibly precise and readable display. The hold button is made of metal, and very very easy to operate, and the device has play/pause, forward, reverse, menu, record buttons, on/off, reset (pin) - (each distinct) and it plugs directly into computer USB port. It feels very good in hand and it has the capacity of 1.81GB. BATTERY lasts for 10h even and it even holds for week or two without charging (2-4h). INTERFACE is made to operate on Windows Media Player but I usually drag files and folders manually. The device sorts through folder/file or artist/album way - you can actually switch the way wou want to check it. It has FM & recording, Voice recording (encodes into mono/stereo 92/128/256 mp3s), great sound and fine earbuds which go along. WHY 4 STARS? - It does not resume the file you are listening to after you turn it off, the search with forward/reverse buttons is painful although precise - if you listen to audiobook/podcast it takes forever to go back where you have stopped, there is no deleting on the device. For video of the device and overall look please go to cnet. I would buy it again and these minor things could be possibly changed with an upgraded firmware. I have owned it for 3 months and I have not had any problems...

<Title>Truly a work of art
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After reading the experiences of others you may begin to worry about the consequenses of purchasing one for yourself.  I work in an IT department and can testify to the complete lack of knowledge many users have.   I own two of these units (one black and one white) and cannot say enough about their usefulness. I will admit that the many controls may confuse some users, and that it takes a few minutes of practice to master; but the product cannot be matched for its size, features, and cost. It outperforms my Sansa by a long shot.  I have ONE computer that will not play nice with the Sony, yet accepts the Sansa (that's my fault - and can be easily fixed). These Sony's work flawlessly in the dozens of other computers I work with. If your computer doesn't recognize the Sony device, try another computer. The fault is in the computer, not the Sony.

<Title>good hardware, bad firmware
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've chosen this product for two reasons: (i) it can be used as a USB stick without a cable, hassle free. (ii) A 2 GB Sony mp3 player with FM for this price is a very good deal. However my experience is not quite what I expected.  After just 5 days of usage the USB connection failed!!! It was disconnecting then connecting over and over again by itself. Basically the connectivity to a computer was lost. This happened in just one week, without any abuse or mistreatment. After going through a one hour troubleshooting on the phone with Sony customer service, they decided to replace the product. I have received the new one last week, no problem so far.  I have some other 'minor' complains about this player. Start-up is slow considering to the complexity of the product. Even though I was using only the %25 percent of the memory it takes 5-10sec. to start up the player. Battery life is 12 hours which is bad but bearable. It does not resume the file when you close and open the player. I hope they can fix this with a firmware upgrade.   And, couple of words about the sound quality. I am not an audiophile but my ears did not like the response of the included headphones. I bought the cheapest Sony headphones, now the sound is superb. I also own an Iriver (390T) and I can not tell the difference. Do not expect much from the equalizer; I think the default setting is the best.   I think the strongest point of the player is Sony's excellent customer service :).

<Title>Better have pockets, there is no case available.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As a player, it works well.  However, we discovered there is no case to hold it.  There is also no place for a lanyard or really anyway to secure it.  If your outfit doesn't have pockets, I guess you can tuck into your underwear.  Not good for you gym rats and runners.  Owning previous Sony Walkman's, we have used Sony Connect and have all of our song ratings/playlists on there.  Unfortunately Sony Connect does not support this model.  It comes with a disk for Napster which we don't care to try and are trying to set up Window's Media Player 10 for it...but can't say we like it.
