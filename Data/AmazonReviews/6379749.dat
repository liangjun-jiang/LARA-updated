<Title>Great MP3 player, especially for price I paid
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my wife for christmas and we've had it for almost a month now and we haven't had a problem out of it.  I installed RockBox firmware, it seems to have more options to it than the original firmware but if you don't know much about computers/mp3 players I'd stick with the original firmware, it worked fine just not as much you can play with.  The battery life isn't quite as long as they advertise but it's good enough.  Overall it was a great purchase!

<Title>Great player, lots of features, some annoyances
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>One of the great things about this player is you do not have to install any special software; just drag a folder of MP3s over to it. The best feature is its future potential; the manufacturer brags 'firmware upgradeable' on the box and an Internet search reveals an active user forum and homebrew software available.  I actually found a use for the text file viewer-- it is a handy way to keep track of a new workout routine. Sound quality is good enough for loud rock music while mowing or working out.  There are some minor annoyances in the software. The equalizer does not have enough frequency ranges and introduces some noise. There is not a clear indication when you disable the EQ and turn on the SRS feature. The picture display is cool, but no zoom and pan - even my cell phone does that. However, these are all minor bugs that could be fixed with new software.  One of the advertised features is line in recording - but you don't get the line input jack unless you buy a cradle. Hmmm, why not just use the line input jack on your computer sound card and save the money. I would rather have had a line input and/or a mic jack on the unit itself than the wired remote control jack - the iriver is about the size of a remote control itself so I am not sure what the logic was here.  Like I mentioned earlier these are minor annoyances and I am generally impressed with the performance and sound on the player.

<Title>Great product. but NO support from IRIVER
<Date>Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall a great player. The unit workes well with Windows media player 10 and is packed with features. The sound quality is excellent. Overall the player would be 5 stars EXCEPT-  IRIVER. This company has no customer service at all. I had a couple  quirky issues with the unit that I needed some help with. Their manual is useless. To-date, over the course of a week I have spent 2+ hours, per evening on 4 different days, on hold with them not able to get through. Good thing I have a speaker phone. They have yet to answer their support line.Its now become a matter of princepal that I get through. I've also sent off two different emails to them and in 5 days they have yet to return a one. Had I known, I would have seleced a different manufacturer.

<Title>Wonderful mp3 player/ipod 
<Date>Sat Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent player. Works wonderful out of the box and requires no firmware updates. The sound is wonderful. Much better than the ipod. If you want to try out both the place to go is bestbuy because they have most of the top mp3 players available to test in their store. the headphones that came with the player are ok, but you probaby should go out and buy new ones. Again for the money it is the best player around. It works with most audio services. Unlike the ipod which only uses itunes. It comes with a multitude of features more than the ipod. including fm radio, radio/in line/voice recording. all and all excellent player, easy to use/ tons of features/ pictures/ excellent battery life

<Title>Excellent Produce
<Date>Sun Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product is much better then an IPOD mainly because .. A. It has much better sound. B. It has an FM tuner. C. You don't have to ship it back to the factory (Apple) for $60.00 to $100.00 to change the battery when it starts going bad. There's way too much hype with IPOD. The only thing it has going for it is that it may be a bit easier to use and has a slightly larger screen, but it's not color. For the price the Iriver is a much better deal.

<Title>Wow, speechless
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>8/9/05 UPDATES:  So far so good. I am still enjoying my iRiver. I think my friend wants one, but it's kind of a waste of money since he doesn't even have a 128 CD case yet, and hasn't filled his 64. Besides, he has Windows 98, and the iRiver is only compatable with XP, Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X. The reason I am resumbitting my review is to point out a couple of things I didn't mention before.  1) Songs cannot play in album order. Though you can do this by using the quick list, it becomes frustratingg after awhile.  2) The battery life seemingly lasts more than 16 hours under normal use, more around 20-22 hours, depending on your usage.  3) The battery is not swappable, HOWEVER, iRiver's site said YET...meaning they are making a swapple battery for the H10-20GB. The battery lasts around 4 years, however shortens slowly after the third year. iRiver's website states at 4 years, the battery life will be dropped around -4 hours. Which means even if you get it now your battery will never die.  4) The player DOES seem to support .wav files. I by accident added a .wav file and my friend accidentally played it. The player played the four minute .wav file just fine without hesistation.  5) You can NOT add a song to an exisiting playlist that has been added to the player, a little frustrating. You have to delete the file in My Computer and then add the song again. This could take an immense amount of time if you want to add a large amount of certain songs.  6) Imo, CNET's review should be redone, as they say the navigation is difficult, when it's easy as pie.  So far, I still LOVE my iRiver. So, it's not 100% perfect, but the firmware hasn't even been upgradeable yet, meaning they are working on some new firmware for the H10-20GB.  And, if you haven't read my earlier review, it is posted below.  7/5/05:  I recently bought and returned the YH925GS. Not only did it not have an FM tuner (didn't care that much), but adding, modifying, and deleting files was becoming a BIG pain.   The MP3 player is pretty slim, even though it's not the slimmest one you can buy, it's light so if you like jogging with it or excersising you'll barely notice it. Like all 20 GB MP3 players, you can store 5,000 songs (approx. 400 CDs). The controls look strange at first, but actually, all you need to control is the touchpad. There are also arrows for them most easy navigation. You'll notice that it's easier to use than most MP3 players on the market today. The battery life is 16 hours. Some of today's players have more than 20 hours, but I guess 16 is okay.   The player also comes with a 1.8" LCD screen, and more colors than a computer so your photos will look of professional quality. On this player, something that most if not all players can't do, is view .txt files. This is a really cool feature. You can store lyrics or essays in Notepad, then transfer them into the player. This is a VERY cool feature that I will be using more often.   The sound is really good. It doesn't have WOW features that most MP3 players have, but it has a very decent equalizer. The sound isn't distored at all, and I'm suprised about this.   The player also comes with recordings and FM tuning. THe microphone can pick up voice pretty far, and the FM tuner is quite good too. There are also 20-preset stations for your tuner. And listen to this one, you can rip off of the radio. How cool is that? Say your listen to the radio, and you hear this hot new track that is so good, you can just press record, and you can listen to it whenever you want. It's not that other players don't do this, it's that this is the 1 of 2 players that has the fantasic combination of 20 GB, Radio, and Recording. (the iAudio X5 is the other player that has this...I didn't buy it because it doesn't allow you to change track settings, WTF?)   It's also PlaysForSure compatible, but to use WMP 10, you have to download the drivers from the iRiver website. Unless you have a lot of music on WMP, I would just stick to the drag-n-drop. It's not just drag-n-drop (e.g. My Computer, iRiver) or WMP 10 that's compatable. RealPlayer is compatable, and Napster is too (but I think Napster sucks). To put photos on your MP3 player, you can use the manual drag-n-drop. As a matter of fact, the My Computer>iRiver method is probably the best. I have no reason why you would want/need WMP 10 or Real to manage music. Though, I guess to have further options, you would need it. But otherwise, it's VERY easy to add tracks since you can drag-n-drop. But remember, if you can't get Windows to understand the H10, you'll need to go to iRiver's website and download the new drivers. I wish they would give you the drivers beforehand, because some people with computers may not have internet.   Overall, if you want the great combination of 20 GB, WMA and MP3, Recording, Drag-N-Drop (no hassle with WMP or Real), and FM radio, you just HAVE to have the H10.

<Title>Good product.... bad faults.
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I'm not 13. Now onto the product. I purchased this in the beginning of July. I grew tired of my CD player and went to Best Buy and debated between this or a Creative Zen. The specs were about the same so it came down to the looks of the player. The iRiver H10 is the best looking one out there. It's small, light and has a vivid color display. The player is also very easy to maneuver. I never really put the text feature to use or even tried it out and the picture feature is nice although i do not know what the significance of it is but I guess some would find it useful. Sound quality is excellent and you can change most of the options to fit your needs (backlighting, scroll speed, etc). Custom EQ, FM Radio, this player has it all. Of course this product has it's cons. It freezes up very often. I noticed this happening more and more as I started filling up the player more. It's not that troubling to take out the battery and putting it back, though. Two weeks after I got it I ended up exchanging it for another because the play/pause and fast forward buttons were becoming hard to push, which irritated me. Now that I have the new one for almost a month the back button occasionally does the same thing. Also, one morning it just kept crashing for no apparent reason. I had to remove the battery during a freeze-up while the system was initializing and it completly erased all my songs. But when I plugged it back to the USB I saw they were still on the player, just not actually appearing when I tried to play them on the iriver. So then I went to the iRiver website and  tried a firmware update which solved the problem and allowed me to start placing songs that would appear on my player. I was still angered about having to go through the trouble of putting all the songs back once again. In conclusion, this is a very good product even though it has major faults but then again..dont all mp3 players do? If you're planning on buying this from a store I strongly suggest purchasing a waranty or else you may regret it later on.

<Title>As good as the Zen Micro with the bonus of the color screen
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a Zen Micro and I cant say enough good things about it.  My girlfriend thought it was cute so I gave it to her.  I was going to buy another one when I did some research.  The H10 had some mixed reviews but after using it for a week now it looks like user error...i'll explain later.  First if you have Rhapsody to Go (which I do) you cant complain about the price...its only $100 after the rebate...wow!  Ok now back to the user error section.  Many people complain that the songs are played in alphabetical order.  Yes you can do it that way of you select an album and hit the play button on the side of the H10. If you use the o button instead of the play, you get the album to play as intended.  Pretty simple but I can see how it would get a little confusing.  So just for that I will lower my rating to four stars.  Other than that its the perfect little player.  As good as the Zen Micro with a color screen.  Buy it!

<Content>I bought this player for my son who needed to travel within 2 days. The setup with Rhapsody required several phone calls for tech assistance and they were very helpful. But after one day the MP3 player froze. A call to Iriver said that they would answer the call within 2-3 business days. We found the reset button ourselves and the player has been OK since. Its best to buy this product from a company that can render assistance much sooner.

<Title>The Good, the OK, and the Bad
<Date>Sun Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the iriver H10 20GB (Blue) about three weeks ago after saving and researching for about 6 months.  In summary, I have been very happy with the player and would definitely buy it again.    The Good  The sound quality is very good.  The included ear buds are fine (I'm not a fan of ear buds in general), but the source is clean and accurate and you can spend as much or as little on after-market headphones as you like.  There is a lot of control over the EQ.  Virtually all of my music is in Variable Bit Rate MP3 format.  The H10 supports MP3 and the Microsoft format (WMF).  I don't use iTunes (ACC) or Audible so lack of support for those formats is not an issue for me.  The form factor is nice.  It's about the same size as a deck of cards and fairly light.  It fits in my hand or a pocket easily.  The user interface works well with either one or two hands.  The controls are simple, intuitive and make sense.  (I recommend you read the short manual or it might take you a while to stumble onto some of the more subtle features.)  The thumb slider works well, even with a large list to scroll through-when your thumb hits the end of the slider, the display keeps scrolling.  Using the slider to control volume rather than a physical knob or wheel is a good idea.  One of my main reasons for picking the H10 was the FM tuner.  I like to listen to National Public Radio and other local stations.  The tuner has good reception and it is easy to program stations as presets.  I have used the ability to record an FM transmission a few times already.  The color display is bright and clear.  The screen layouts make sense and have useful information.  I don't have a reason to use the player to display pictures (other than when showing off the player), but it does have this ability.  I had no problems getting Windows XP to recognize the player-it shows up as a USB drive.  Data transfer rates have been good for a USB device.  I've loaded my entire library several times as I've played with different software besides Windows Media Player.  It takes about an hour and a half to transfer 12GB.  Some reviewers have complained that the player locks up when they used Windows to browse the player's hard drive.  It does take a while to display the contents of folders on the player, but I haven't had the player or Windows actually lock up.  The battery life has been good.  I've taken it on a couple of multi-day trips and haven't run it down completely.  The OK  The player is designed to work with Microsoft Windows Media Player 10 (included on CD with the player).  WMP does all of the basic things you want:  rip, organize, update ID3 tags, build playlists, sync with the player.  Of course it takes Microsoft's typical "software for dummies" approach-it doesn't do any of the things as well as some other programs and you can't change the way it behaves, where it stores your music files, etc.  ("Sorry ma'am, but you don't need to know the bit rate we're using to encode your music.  Move along now...")  But, if you are willing to be assimilated (resistance is futile!), it can manage your music collection and player adequately.  Fortunately, because you can copy the music files directly to the player using Windows, you can use any software you wish.  I like to use FreeRIP to create the mp3 files-it works very well, queries freedb so you don't have to type in any information, supports variable bit rate encoding, and is free.  To use the player with a lot of content, having clean ID3 tags is critical.  ID3 tags store the information about the music file (artist, album, title, genre, etc.) in the MP3 file.  I tried Windows Media Player, but again ended up using a different free program (MP3Tag) that worked better, especially when cleaning up hundred of files at a time.  Some reviewers have complained that the player will not play songs in the order that they were on the album.  Remember that the players has only the information in the ID3 tags and the file names to work with.  It doesn't seem to use the "Track" tag, but you can get it to play in album order if you include the track number in the file name and play songs in alphabetic order.  For example, I name my music files "Artist - Album - Track# - SongTitle.mp3."  99% of the time I have the player on random shuffle.  I'm still looking for a program that can make it easier to sync the player and manage playlists.    I don't expect the software to be an issue for the typical owner-I tend to be very particular.  I suppose the support for text files is useful, if you wanted to keep some reference files on the device.  I've read novels on a Palm Pilot, so I'm not opposed to using a small device for reading, but electronic devices have a long way to go to before they can match the performance and convenience of paper for pleasure reading.  Some reviewers have mentioned having to upgrade the firmware and having to remove the battery to reset the player.  The H10 20GB does not have a firmware upgrade release yet, and it resets very easily by pressing a small recessed button with a paper clip.  I have had to reset the player a couple of times, but it reboots quickly and this hasn't been a big deal.  The Bad  Bad is relative.  Nothing I've encountered with the player is truly "bad."   Probably my worst complaint is that there is a brittle-sounding click in the headphones as the player changes songs.  I don't really notice it any more, but at first it was annoying.  I like to listen to longer material, audio books and old radio programs, and fast-forwarding to a mid-point to resume listening can take a while, even with the scan rate set to max (6x).  A progressive scan (longer you hold it down, the faster it goes) would be more effective and intuitive.  The player comes with a white translucent silicone protective cover.  It has a belt clip and is soft and does a good job of protecting the player, even if it is not the most attractive thing I've seen.  I've listed it under the Bad category because it also makes it difficult to feel the Prev Track/Play/Next Track buttons through the silicone.  I haven't had to call iriver for support yet, but have no illusions about the quality of live support that will be available.  Unfortunately, no one provides good customer support.  Best we can hope for is a device that is made well enough that the need for support is rare.  So far, the H10 20GB seems to fall into this category.  Because the player is designed to be a copy of your master library, there's no obvious way to delete files (even ones you've recorded using the player's FM tuner) using the player's interface.  You have to connect it to your computer for this.  There's also no obvious way to figure out how much disk space is left on the player, either from the player or from Windows.  As a work-around, I add up the size of the various media directory trees on my computer to estimate how much space is left.  I'm hoping both of these are addressed by firmware upgrades.   Oh.. and I wish I had gotten red.

<Title>Piece of Junk
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave it a rating of 1 because that was the lowest choice available. Amazon didn't give me the option of a negative number.  I received my first (of 3) as a gift & it lasted about 1 month before it completely froze up & stopped working.  Because one corner of the cover refused to stay down, I optimistically hoped that it had been dropped and damaged in the store or in shipment, so I replaced it with an identical model.  2nd one worked for 11 months before it stopped working.  Since it was under warranty for 1 more month, I sent it back.  Whether iRiver replaced it with a new one or repaired the old one, I don't have a clue.  I just received a player back from them without any explaination about what was done.  It worked for about 2 months, before it stopped working.  No attempts at resetting or reformatting have worked.  So now all I have basically is a $300 paperweight.  I will never buy from iRiver again.

<Title>iriver is a stressful device and beware of wmp!
<Date>Sat Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Do not purchase an iriver!!!! It will make you miserable and you will end up spending more money than you would have had you bought yourself an ipod and here's why:  1-the iriver works with windows media player (wmp), the worst media player software on this planet. This software is designed to either give you a heart attack or to make you throw your laptop across the room so that you'd buy a new one. It is hard to create playlists in wmp and when u create them, upon subsequent syncing, wmp changes these playlists almost randomly. Some songs get doubled for mysterious reasons. It truly is a puzzle. Everytime you update your playlists or want to simply upload songs onto your player, you'll end up spending an entire weekend, and that's assuming that things are working fine. 2-the iriver firmware has some serious bugs. If you are like the rest of us (majority of iriver owners), then make no mistake, at some point within a year, you will spend an entire weekend downloading and tweaking your playlists only to realize that the iriver will have stopped working. You will turn It on and it will show a blue screen with a clock and an ominous print "system initializing, please wait", which means that you have reformat the player, which means that you'll need to re-upload everything that took you so long to upload in the first place. 3-within 1.5 years, you will realize how terrible iriver is and how stressful wmp is. This will force you into purchasing an ipod. At the end, you'll end up spending the money on the new ipod, in addition to the money wasted on the iriver.  The take home message is: Spend the extra 200 and buy an ipod; otherwise, you'll end up spending more. If you do not believe me and you think that I am just a mean disgruntled customer who's out there to get iriver, then forget what I said and do the research yourself. Go to google and type in keywords such as "system initializing", "playlists", "freezing on start up"...etc. you will see for yourself that the iriver is a problem, and wmp is even a bigger problem.   Note that when you're synchronizing, all hell breaks loose due to: 1-wmp changes the playlists almost randomly. 2-some files are supposedly transferred to the iriver but they just don't show up in the iriver. You will be puzzled and confused, not knowing what to do. 3-all of a sudden, playlists double in wmp and when you're synchronizing, not all playlists appear in iriver. It's all random I swear. The weirdest thing you'll experience. 4-this is my most dreaded: you're synchronizing, and all of a sudden, iriver encounters a file extension that is not supported by the player. The synchronization processes freezes and the player freezes too. Wmp may also freeze. And yet wmp, tell you "synchronization is progress" when in fact it's not. You cannot refreash wmp and you cannot disconnect the usb and you cannot turn off the player itself. You're forced to turn off your computer by ctr-alt-del method and to reset the player using the paper clip method. It is extremely stressful and time consuming. You will be angry and stressed out because you will feel that you did something wrong, when in fact it's the system that is so wrong that there is just nothing you can do to make right or smooth.  Be a smart shopper and don't even consider iriver mp3 players, unless you are a masochist and you enjoy torture and stress.   Little by little, it is becoming very clear to everyone that apple products are better even if they are more costly. After all, I truly believe that apple products are not only costlier due to sleek design but also due to better performance.

<Title>Works fine with WMP 11 and Vista
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased refurbished 8/07 with my Vista laptop. I like it but struggled with it the first 4 hours, reformatted it (nice feature) a few times using firmware updater program (download from iRiver) and started over. Once you understand it, it is actaully straightforward, but not as intuitive as hoped. Instructions say it works only with Win Media Player 10 but actually works great w/ the latest version 11. My advice - spend time cleaning up Id3 tags (Title, Artist, Album, etc.) before Sync-ing mp3s. Those tags end up being your folder structure for browing the players mp3 folders (by album, artist, etc.). Had trouble prior to id3 tag cleanup, created an inaccesible 'Unknown Artist' folder. My experience, the program that comes with the player for Windows Explorer like-functionality (Copy/Paste mp3s) wouldn't work on both my XP and my Vista laptops (shows 'Disconnected'). Actual Windows Explorer browsing to the player like a USB drive locked my unit up forcing me to push the reset/restart button (with a paper clip) so don't bother, stick w/ Sync-ing in WMP 11. What you save in $$, you'll pay back time spent understanding and making it work. iPod 30 GB more expensive but way easier interface

<Title>Long time owner
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, there is a small level of computer knowledge required to really use this thing at its full potential. Not much, just the ability to drag and drop files in windows. If you can do that, then you do not have to have your player tied down to any software, you can mix and match file types within album folders if you so choose, something that would melt itunes or windows media. The radio is excellent, the battery is decent, the screen is nice, the sound is very good. It looks nice, survives falls easily. The ability to read text files and record voice is good for students. Plus if you carry this around, and you dont really need a thumb drive. so why only two stars? Cause the longest I have ever heard one of these things lasting was just under two years. Generally the firmware fails somehow and you can no longer transfer files. The mini jack is not of the highest quality (when obviously the mini jack should be the most durable thing about any portable music player.) If you do get one for like 50$ or something be sure to carry around a small paper clip btw, you will need to reset it semi regularly.

<Content>Pros: Hold a lot of music, very user friendly, great sound quality, very durable, good battery life. Cons are: large (if that bothers you), freezes from time to time, I had a lot of issues getting it synced with my computer. Other than that, It works great.

<Title>I was satisfied
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this iriver although I can't use it anymore lol. I got this in 2005. I know its a bit late for me to be writing this review, but I was able to store more than enough music on this mp3 player. I have actually been a big fan of iriver but they went down a lot. I have had three irivers and this was either my second or third I don't remember but it plays pretty good. I would still have it if my boyfriend didn't start borrowing it did something to it. I don't know what he did but it doesn't work anymore lol. Its small and cute and not very bulky. The only issue I have with this as I had with one of the other irivers is that it freezes a lot. Overall, besides that I was satisfied.

<Title>the things I wish I knew when I thought it was a good deal
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1) that in just a couple years, the battery wouldn't hold a charge and die in 45 min. and you can't change the battery 2) the paperclip (not supplied but don't leave home with out it)Every owner now knows about the papercplip to reset and has one hid someplace.  I gave it a rating of 2 because it held all the music i wanted, the shuffle play worked well, and was a nice music selection away from home. I now wish I had went main stream and spent the couple extra dollars and bought the Ipod at the first. i won't send mine to the landfill just yet, but as soon as it quits working on 110, c'est la vie...

<Title>Line In Recording
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great player for subscription music via Rhapsody. Screen is brilliant. No complaints but one: no line in! If the player is described as a recorder, then it should have a line in. The 6G version offers an optional cradle which has a line in, but no such cradle for the 20G, and no mention of it on the iRiver site. :-(

<Title>Damn worth it !
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having researched for a while for a good mp3 player, I can now attest that this is an awesome player.  Best part is the sound quality. Very good head-set also.  I wanted a player with Radio as I listen to Radio quiet a bit and the fact that I can record out of Radio and with voice-recorder is just perfect.  Display is really good and very easy to navigate. Menu options are a breeze to figure out.  I'm really excited about the battery life. Did a lot of things starting from sync-up( of about 18GB ) out of the battery and I couldn't see any drop (!!) at all.  Areas of improvments 1. The polymer glove/belt clip. They can come up with something different and sturdy, but its good. 2. Having filled up almost to the brim, if the 'shuffle' option is turned on, sometimes I was able to feel the hard-disk seeking the song, when I hold the player @ in my hand. Its quiet a search I believe :)  But all in all, I'm very much satisfied for the money I shelled on this.  Good job iRiver !

<Title>EXCELLENT
<Date>Sat Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My friend owns this, after he bought and returned the similar Samsung version.   It is excellent, with good sound and easy to navigate controls.   It stores A LOT of songs. It places them into categories, making it easy for you to find the exact song you want.   FM Tuner is also included.  You can upload pictures to this iRiver, and view them when you are listening to music.  It comes with a rechargeable battery that has a huge battery life.  If i needed 20 gb, I would get this, but I plan to get a 6 gb Creative Zen.   Last Word: Best 20 gb mp3 player out there.

<Title>Disappointing - but decent - from a frustrated Napster user
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't know why anyone who doesn't use Napster would buy this device.  Good things: Good sound quality. Lightweight device. Good storage for multiple file formats, including pictures. Digital Graphic Eq. Napster Compatible. Nice form factor; comes with rubber sleeve to protect. Some nice design features. Generally works as advertised.  Bad things: Expensive. Took me 1-hour to install the firmware upgrade (required for Napster To Go). Battery life disappoints; probably because device sometimes leaves itself on even when I think it's off. The 4 bars of the battery life don't reflect the true battery life %. Software GUI isn't as efficient as it could be. You can't buy a replacement Li-Ion battery very easily at your hotel (although you can online). UBS is integrated with recharger (make it clunky). Produces occasional errors while downloading from Napster. Produces occasional error that says songs are "expired". Device freezes on occasion, requiring a batter disconnect / reconnect to reboot. Default headphones are awful. (I have been very happy with a $30 Brookstone Edition). Can't control L/R balance (at least not on the device; haven't played with the software).

<Title>Avoid for two simple reasons
<Date>Wed Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been an iRiver fan for a long time but avoid this player for two reasons:  (1) Although you connect the player to your computer via USB, the player side of the connection does not have a standard USB port.  Why should you care?  With many other players you can charge the unit and transfer songs with a simple standard USB cable.  With this one if you forget the special cable that comes with the unit (very non-standard) then you can't charge the unit or transfer songs.  I have one USB cable for my phone, camera, etc. and want to use it for the player.  Or, if I am out of town I can be assured someone is going to have or sell a standard USB cable.  I despise the iPOD for many reasons but at least they give you a real USB connection on the player itself.  (2) DRM on the US unit.  When you connect the unit to your computer you don't get a simple drive letter to drag and drop MP3 files to/from the player.  You must have Windows XP and you must use either Windows Media Player or "Portable Device" in explorer to move files over.  This means you can copy files over but not the other way.  I hear the Korean version of the unit gives you a real drive letter.  Come on iRiver - how much did Microsoft pay you to cripple the US version?  Summary: Stay away until companies get the message loud and clear - no DRM on the unit if you have your own collection of MP3 files.  Supporting DRM services such as Napster, Audible, Yahoo, Real, etc. is fine as long as it does not prohibit the use of my own collection - make the device appear as a drive letter when connected, and gives us a standard USB connection on the player side to charge and transfer data.

<Title>Wires, wires, wires, ...
<Date>Wed Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is not just a rant at the iRiver but all mp3 players. I just purchased the H10 20GB mp3 player and I just don't see the usefulness of these devices. All they are is a storage device with and audio chip. In order to use them I need to connect them into something that can eventually convert them to an acoustic wave.   There are a number of ways to do this:    1) Plug in a set of amplified speakers    2) Plug in an FM transmitter and receive the sound on a radio.    3) Use a set of headphones to listen directly to the music. However, each of these requires a separate device and wires, wires, wires, ...  The H10 has a build-in FM receiver but not an FM transmitter. I would much rather it have a transmitter so I wouldn't need a separate device.  The other problem that I have with this product is the USB/power cable. It is one and the same. So in order to use power (or to recharge) I need to plug in a 6' cable with a USB appendage.   I planned to use this mp3 player to carry all my music between home, auto, and work. So, I thought an FM transmitter would be the best option. This plan has a lot of problems. 1) The Belkin transmitter that I purchased has a lot of static on all channels. This might be corrected with a new transmitter 2) The FM transmitter is automatic and only transmits music when it receives an input signal. So when I start up or turn off the mp3 player I get a lot of static. 3)  Also, when I turn off the car the mp3 player doesn't know this and continues to run. This drains the batteries.   I'm going back to my mp3 CDs. When I switch to the radio or turn off the car the CD pauses. I can get 40+ songs on a CD and create my own play lists.  The only disadvantage is that I need to carry lots of CD. But the CDs are easier to organize than the pile of wires!  Just as a followup, I messed with this for a week and then returned it. I haven't decided whether I'll replace it or just keep using CDs. If I do replace it I will probably go with an iPod :-(

<Title>Highly Dissapointed
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>6 months ago I bought the Iriver H320.  This device was incredible.  Drive letter access.  You just drag and dropped files into the unit and played em.  no software, no worrying that your playlists are configured or track tags are proper. sadly the unit was stolen a few weeks back.  Having had great luck with its predesessor, I purchased the new HD10 20 GB player as the H320 is no longer available.  IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!  no drive letter access really upsets me.  The transfer rate is slow, the usp/combined power cable? why?  the old unit allowed usb charging, so I could leave my power cable at work and use usb charging at home or on my laptop when out of town.  No I have to carry around 2 cables (Designer should be fired)    the up down slider bar, is very unresponsive and jumps, causing you to overshoot what you are looking for. why couldn't they just stay with the buttons?  I think even giving this item one star after the H320 is being nice.  Iriver you "improved" upon a great product and failed.

One thing that annoys me is that the LCD lights on randomly while the song plays. sound quality is really good, the SRS effect helps in audio quality. Good LCD screen, with bright enough display to view even during daytime,  I got this product over the iPod even tho it was a little costlier was because of the features it offered. I am pleased with the product and looking forward to the next firmware release.

<Title>Best you can get
<Date>Fri Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start off by saying that I have owned or used many mp3 players. Iriver h120, h320, rca lyra, ipod(not the color one), Creative zen xtra, the new samsung, and many more. The only mp3 player that beats this one is the h120, and you can't buy that one anymore. No software is needed at all. plug it into your cpu, go to my computer, and drag and drop. it took 35 minutes for me to transfer 3200 songs. has fm, fm recorder, and timer for the fm recorder. Nice if you would like to record a morning show or something while your at work. Turns on instantly, great sound quality, easy navigation. People say the albums are not in order, rename your files via musicmatch or what ever and have the track number first. this will solve that problem. You can search for your music or files with the browser function. Very nice if you like a more computer type of navigation. This is currently the best mp3 player on the market, I've only metioned a few features of this player. If your into electronics, this is the player to get. If your more about being cool and don't mind software that controls your music then I would suggest an ipod. In my eyes this player has the ipod beat in every area, with the exception of acceseries. Not to bash the ipod of coursel. Even I'll admit that the ipod is pretty cool and if it wasn't for all of it's restrictions, I would buy one, if there was no iriver of course.

<Title>Beats the iPod hands down
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>iRiver has it all figured out, for sure. The only thing I've noticed that I dont like about the player is a slight lag when opening songs to play, but thats a small price to pay for everything else.   For Windows users, there couldnt be a better product! I manage my music library through Windows Media Player (which I highly recommend), so when I took my H10 out of the box all I did was sync it with my computer and bam --- my entire music library is now in my pocket! I love it. And the automatic sync updates any changes in your library when you connect, so the changes are then in your player too. (You can have manual syncs if you want, also).   And in case you're wondering, the case that comes with it is a rubber, sleeve-like thing that fits around the player with holes for the screen and buttons. The clip is pretty sturdy, I dont think its going anywhere.  Overall, I cant get over how great everyone thinks the iPod is; unless your a fan of Macintosh, its all about the H10!

<Title>Nothing Less Than 5 Star
<Date>Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sorry Ipod people, the IRiver H10 has taken the lead in the MP3 world. I think Ipods are great. They're quality made, with a very intuitive interface. But I just finished a long time of researching and trying out different players, and I settled on the IRiver H10. Every day since I have patted myself on the back for this choice. It one-ups all other players in all categories. My #1 recommendation though is to go somewhere like Best Buy and try out all the players you're considering. We all think differently and one person's favorite scroller could be another's worst nightmare. For me, there are no downsides to this player yet. Some may  have a problem with it using Windows Media Player 10, or others may like having the hundreds of accessories that Ipod leaves at your disposal, but for me this player is everything I want and more. Definitely a big thumbs up.

<Content>I Purchased my 20gb h10 about a week ago and I love it.  It is very easy to navagate through and it looks and sounds awesome.  The main feature that the h10 has is easy to use software.  This was the main reason why I did not get an ipod.  The itunes software for the ipod was so difficult to use that it kept me from buying one.  The h10 on the other hand has got to have the most user friendly software on the planet which to me was a huge selling point.  If you purchase the h10 you will not be disappointed.

<Title>Stopped working on the first day
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this product from Best Buy. I had a predilection to purchase an iRiver product as my current iRiver mp3 player had lasted problem free for close to three. Therefore, I brought my new investment home, read the instructions, tinkered with it, and finally, and synced it with my computer. Initially, I was very impressed. I was able to transfer files quickly and directly through MS Explorer. Hence, I transferred about 3gb of audio onto the player.  Still, I was impressed. The sound quality was unbelievable and I was overwhelmed with the innumerous features and equalizations settings of the player. I was so impressed that I figured I would test out the alarm clock feature. So, I re-synced the player (as a note, the USB connection/charger is terribly designed) and attempted to load one small mp3 file onto the player. As a clicked on the music folder which I wanted to transfer the file into, MS Explorer froze. I could not access the file system of the mp3 player. Subsequently, unplugging the player from the USB in an attempt to restore the player to working condition was of no benefit. As a result, both my computer and the player froze. After resetting player and my computer and connected the player again, as I had did the glorious first attempt where I successfully transferred 3gb, the player malfunctioned again. I repeated this process about five times, no success. Then, the player itself could no longer buffer files that were already in its hard drive. For example, nothing selected through the 'music' directory on the player would work and caused the player to freeze; files could only be played through the 'browser.' Additionally, the player would no longer record audio as it did previously. Any attempt to save a recorded file would again lead to freezing. Apparently, iRiver has not perfected their firmware to properly buffer inputs into the massive hard drive, or perhaps, only my player is dysfunctional.  I continued testing my player in the following days; but alas, no success. Finally, I returned the player to Best Buy. Honestly, I think this is a great product in thought, especially considering all of the equalization settings and the fm radio. However, it appears that iRiver has not done sufficient testing to work out all the bugs of this product. It appears as if iRiver was in a rush to compete with the growing dominance of the iPod. I commend iRiver on their ingenuity in constructing a highly capable player in such a small package, but the product needs improvement. I look forward to a future generation free of tremendous flaws.

<Date>Fri Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a teacher and have the summer off. This has allowed me tons of time to do research. This product does the most for the best price! I have had it for 3 days and it is so EASY to use. The battery life is amazing. I have been listening to it all day from 8 am till 6 pm and still have 1/2 battery life. The sound is stunning and there are a ton of EQ settings to choose from.. The interface is very intuative. I read the negative remarks of other people and can only assume ther received a lemon. This device amazes me with a new feature discoved daily. The silicone case it comes with is plenty good (other reviews said it sucked). I suggest that you become familiar with the keys and buttons of your H10 before putting the silicone case on because the case covers some buttons from visual view BUT they still work by pushing the silicone. I suggest you buy better headphones. You can use the windows media player 10 (provided on the CD that comes in the box)to help sync the h10 with your computer or Windows XP instantlly recognizes the H10 as a seperate drive. Either is just as good.I also bought the FM broadcaster by iriver and it is really powerful as well, the only key is that you have your volume at half on your H10 or the sound is distorted- but you can easily turn you radio volume up and down as needed. I have nothing but glowing things to say about this player...oh wait 1 thing- the photo feature is great but they are not the sharpest pictures. Good enough but not 5 megapixel greatness.  Stop reading this review and get your hands on one!!!

The player itself is outstanding - great features at a terrific price (20GB, color, radio, WPM,etc.) My son was really excited about getting this. HOWEVER, I spent countless hours trying to get Windows XP and WMP to recognize it. My research on the web indicated that many people are experiencing the same difficulties. It worked OK on Best Buy's computer, but, not a chance on my son's. Fortunately I was able to return it to Best Buy. My son and I are really disappointed because it is an excellent product, except for the Windows issue. FORGET IRIVER SUPPORT AND ESPECIALLY THEIR USELESS WEB SITE.

<Content>This is a great MP3 player, but I am highly dissappointed that Best Buy had none left. The storesperson said that this was a very popular item, even more popular than the iPod, and that it is very hard to get this item. I asked her to hold one for me. She said that was okay and they were getting more the next day. So before you go to Best Buy (currently, that's the only retail store that carries the H1020GB), make sure that they have one in stock, and ask to hold it for you.  So, if I have no info on the H1020GB, why would I give it 5 stars. My friend has one of these, and they are way above any MP3 player. The sound is excellent, and has an equalizer. You can drag-and-drop your songs. It's easy to use with it's touchpad. The cost is the same of the 20GB iPod that doesn't have any features.  Get this.

I'm a poor college kid, so the fact that this player was so reasonably priced was definitely what initially drew me to this one.  But once I started reading the reviews, I started getting a little freaked out.  I decided that I would get it anyways, and I love it!  It has frozen on me once, but that's a complete human error.

<Content>I like this products the sound it is nice and the space is AWESOME! I didn't think that it would have that much space.  The only negative thing about it, is the speed. Like if want to change the song and you click on the that song, it takes about 10 - 20 sec. But then again i am very impatient. Also the battery gauge, tells you what the battery is at, is not that good. Like everytime that I check on the battery (after charging it for a while) it is at the same position as the last time that I looked. That is just irritating.  But besides all of that, it is awesome.

<Title>Great sound but hangs a lot
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned mine now for over 1.5yrs and I like it a lot.  I got a great deal on it at the time only $199 at Best Buy.    First let me list my major dislikes:    - This player hangs a lot.  Most of the time, a reset does the trick.  But I have needed to refresh the database 3 times and wipe the device clean by doing a prom upgrade 2 times.  I kow this is not a small problem, so know that this will be an issue if you decide to purchase this product and keep your playlists and songs saved on your computer so you can get back to normal if you need to do the firmware upgrade.        - The software on the device is not very good.  For example, you cannot delete a song from the device directly, you must do it by pluginh into the computer.  Also very annoying is that there is no bookmark feature and the fast forward is a joke.  If you plan to listen to audio books or long recordings, I would not recommend this player AT ALL.    - The FM radio is okay to have but the reception is usually not great so I hardly use it.    - Transfers take a very very long time.  Especially when you have to transfer a lot of files like say after a firmware upgrade.  If you are still reading, on with the good news:    - 20GB of space is a lot of space.  You can fit more music than you would know what to do with on the player.  I have over 48 hrs of audio on my device and I still have over 60% free space.      - The sound is great.    - The audio recording is great (Main reason I bought it and I have not been disappointed)    - The radio is okay but I hardly use it.    - Works with Yahoo music unlimited.  Bottom line, you have to be very patient with if you decide to get this product.  You will not get much support from the company and their online documentation sucks.  But if you want a music player that can play MP3, WMA and subscription music, sounds great, NO DRM and offers lots of space for all your music, you can't beat the value of this device.

<Title>Would not recommend this player
<Date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My iRiver H20 has been a very big disappointment.  I've had to reformat the hard drive at least 4 times - about every 2 months which is a huge drag because you lose everything.  I've sent it to iriver once for a new hard drive.  It does not work well with Napster - crashes every time - yes EVERY TIME!  And now my scroll bar scrolls down to zero and stays there so I can't use it.  Mine is going in the trash rather than sending it in to pay for it to be fixed (out of warranty) when I know it won't fix all of the rest of the problems.  If you check the iRiver customer support site user forum, you will see the long list of issues with the H10/H20.  Invest in something better!

<Title>Does What I Need
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Iriver H10-20GB for over a year and a half and it continues to be a solid, reliable player. I use a software program called Media Monkey to manage my music library and it syncs with no problem. I have to admit I don't ask alot from my player - just store and play music. I especially like the long battery life. I recommend this product.

<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am 57 with minimal tech experience.  I found it so easy to download and copy to this player.  I was pretty sure I would have difficulty and had hesitated in making this purchase but my sister has an iriver so I knew if I had any problem she could help me.  I love it.  I didn't even have to read the instructions.  Well maybe a little.  The sound is good also.

<Title>Plays well but  . . . .
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think that the iRiver plays well, and I have had no trouble downloading from napster. However, I have had to reformat it at least four times in the past year. It is a drag because I have to reload songs every time I do that. This last time I can't even seem to re-format it. I've emailed customer service but their solutions haven't seemed to work. I'd rather a player that was more reliable. It is irritating when I am some where and want to listen and ooops the music won't play for no reason, and instead I get an error message. I'm a simple person and don't try to do too many things, but I would like it to work all the time.

<Title>Dumbed up iRiver
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this unit because of my experience with the iRiver iHp 120.  Though it's styling and features and color screen have come a long way, it no longer can be used the way it's predecesors can be used.  It's been designed to sync w/ WM10 and you can no longer use it as a straight mass storage device. Though you candrag and drop you need to create folders on your PC and then drag tham into the H10.  Therefore, I returned it and found that the iAudio x5 performs  like the old iHp120 and as they say, sorry iRiver, i've had to move on as iRiver has had to due to DRM.

<Title>nice but difficult
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the H10(20GB) player for a week. Having used other iriver players (512mg player) I felt comfortable with the choice. I am not in any way computer or eletronics savvy so products must be consumer friendly. From the start I had difficulties. The initial start up had a faulty disc. Trying the phone support took three tries. But when the player was finally downloaded it played nice. Easy to navigate the basic programs. Completely compatible with WMP. Nice window, easy on the eyes. But the difficulties arose again. The manual sucks in helping with anything or explaining things completely. The phone support was nice but never understood my objective question. Mostly "How the hell does this thing work." After three calls and constant web site visits I can still can not figure out the suffle mode. Sometimes the touch controls are not touch because you have to press them several times to get them to work. Again I stress, I need an extremely consumer friendly player. This just wasn't it. And because I realize that some of the difficulties made have been from consumer errors (that is way I gave it a 3 and not a 2)the support just was not there. I imagine if you are computer/electronics savvy this would be a very nice player for you.

<Title>Great Player-Glad I Got it over the iPOD
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did a lot of research before I bought an mp3 player and finally decided on the H10 20 GB. I went back and forth between this one and the new iPod with the color screen. I know several people who have iPods and have had problems with "denting" the screen and scratching the case. I have had no such problems with the H10. Also, the H10 has a digital FM radio, which is great in general or if you work out at a gym where the channels on the TV are broadcast over closed circuit FM. Presetting stations is a snap. It was extremely easy to use, straight out of the box. All the new ones are currently shipping with the most up to date firmware so there is no need for any upgrades at this point.   Controls are very intuitive and easy to use. Lots of different settings to give you control over almost every aspect of the player. If you get this player, consider getting Napster to Go. You can fill and refill the player with as many songs as you want for $15 a month. Downloading directly to the player is quick and easy. Sound quality is excellent. Much better than the iPod in my opinion. Battery life is awesome too. I have gotten 19+ hours at a time,excellent for long plane trips, recharges quickly also.  Bottom line, I'm sure I made the right decision over the iPod, very happy with my H10.

<Title>One of worst devices I have ever seen
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I cannot explain the good reviews here.  I earlier gave this H10 three stars but I am now forced to revise my opinion downward.  This device has demonstrated non-stop stupidity of design since I bought it two months ago.  The Biggest problem is that the device 'freezes' up so that even the off button wont work.  I am forced to use a paper clip (which I must now carry everywhere I take the H10) to insert into the reset hole, thus shutting it down.  This freezing is generally unpredictable.  It happens during playback, song selection, even during downloading.  When it freezes during downloading, it also causes the downloading program to freeze (I have seen this with both Windows Media Player 10 and with real's Rhapsody - which I use for the rhapsody-to-go service.)  At that point I have to use the paper clip on the H10 and use the task manager on XP to force the program to close.  I have the latest firmware and iRiver has failed to respond (at all) to my request for information on the problem.  Also, the device shuts itself off shortly after the final song plays, which is usually not a bad idea.  However, I have had the device run the battery all the way to nothing while I thought it was off.  I suspect it was actually just frozen with the screen blank.  There are other software glitch problems too.  It doesn't seem to know which songs it has already played when using random play mode.  It plays some songs many times and others not at all.  When using the playlist feature it actually played other songs (not on the playlist) while showing that it was playing one on the list.  The list of songs for any given artist seems to be limited.  In some cases many songs for that artist don't show up even though I downloaded them and can see them with the downloading software.  Aside from the software problems there are also a number of hardware design problems.  The rubber protector casing that comes with it has a belt clip on it but the rubber is so soft and maliable that you can't use the clip becuase you can't force it open.  Further the rubber actually ripped on mine within only hours of first use.  The buttons are extremely slow and sometimes outright unresponsive.  The volume control in particular is so slow it is infuriating.  If someone wants to talk to me, I have to take literally 5 seconds or more to turn down the volume.  They also put controls on four surfaces so that you can't easily hold the device while playing or you will accidentally change songs or restart them, etc.  Finally, it may be just a problem with the rhapsody-to-go service (I'm not sure), but the thing refuses to play songs often after only a couple of days, saying that the song's license has expired.  Also, it loses songs and even whole artists.  Sometimes selecting a particular artist or song causes the device to freeze up.  Once it even displayed a bunch of Chinese characters as the name of an artist - and I'm sure I didn't download that.  After these problems surface, I have to reload the firmware and wipe out all of the content on the device and then reload it.  This process takes an hour or more and if I try to download too many songs at once, that's right, it freezes!:(  I cannot recommend this device for anyone.  No, not even my worst enemy.  Hope this helps you avoid my mistake.

<Title>Great Design - HORRIBLE Reliability
<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player based largely on customer feedback I read on-line (ironically, in part because of a review that touted the reliability of this model compared to the iPod). And I have to say that I absolutely love the design and functionality of the H10. But the reliability of this model, at least from my experience, is deplorable. I ordered one from Amazon about two months ago and loaded it up with my mp3's. And the first week was great. Then the player simply stopped working. So I returned it to Amazon for a replacement and they promptly sent me another one. Great service. I loaded up the new one with my music and once again everything was great for about a week. Then the player started doing strange things - the display would turn on at random, it would download songs in random order from Windows Media Player, and the battery would not accept a charge. So I'm sending it back for a refund. I have to say I'm really disappointed because the player fits my needs very well.  This is the first time I've had an experience with "infant mortality" in an electronic device. And it happened twice! My advice to you is DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL.

<Title>great hard drive mp3 player but has some flaws
<Date>Sun Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this is a great mp3 player but the design of it was made to compete with the ipod.  the touch strip down the middle does not work the way it should and is still very usefull.  the screen is a rather low resolution and jpg's will show many unwanted artifacts as a result of the compression.  some jpg's don't and some do.  the storage capabilities as far as file storage are almost useless.  the mp3 player is not a standard hard drive and has different rules than one.  you can't run any programs or open files from the hard drive.  you must copy them first.  the mp3 playing capabilities are excellent.  great sound qualitiy and the colors make the menu's so easy to navigate.  if you are looking for a color picture viewer and removable hdd then look at the gigabeat.  but for those of you that want a large copacity hdd mp3 player then this is for you.

<Title>Get Ready To Rock Out !!
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did all my research before getting an iRiver.  At first I was dead set on having a "flash player."  Concerned about moving around with a hard drive device.  However I don't jog with it and during my work-out routine, I place the player in a belted tune holder.  Nice & secure !  I had no problems with reading over the directions and getting this up and running.  I also found some very useful sites for added info.  Just run a search for iRiver Forums.  I was one of those people that had a hard time going from cassette tapes to CD's....LOL !   I truly wish I had bought a mp3 player a long time ago.  I chose the H10 (20 GB) because I know it will be a long time before I have to do any upgrading.  This device has everything !  The sound will BLOW YOU AWAY !!I also wanted to be sure that I had something that would be compatible with any of the music sites.  Mainly for the "All You Can Eat" music downloads.  I bought mine at Best Buy store.  I was willing to settle for the....  1 GB version.  But at the time they were offering a free $30.00 gift card with purchase of the H10, and free two month subscription to Napster.   So basically for an extra $75.00 bucks I could go from 1 GB to 20 GB.   Too good to pass up.    I have read complaints about the scroll bar.  DON'T use it like a regular computer scroll bar.....Just press either the top or bottom of it.  If your searching it will pick up speed very fast !  I do believe that as we get close to Christmas we will see newer models of all types coming out.  I suspect to see everything else slowing dropping in price.  :)

<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like other reviewers, I was excited the first couple days I had this.  Used it with yahoomymusic.com subscription service and was thrilled.  The sound was great and it worked - for two days.  Then the model powered down from a full charge to no charge while turned off.  It accepted a charge but then played the music only erratically.  Looked up the internet site and found that iriver no longer has a firmward upgrade/format program for the 20gb model!  The iriver technician told me it had been taken off the web because "it wasn't solving the problem it was supposed to fix!"  Just now, I have tried the database refresh function and the device has frozen up completely!  I have e-mailed Amazon for a replacement.  I will try another model to see if just this one is defective - I hope the next one will work because I really did like it while it was running.  Will update once I have the new model.

<Title>I'd rather have an H10 over a basic 20 GB iPod, anyday.
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Where to start?  Well, feature-wise its far superior to the standard 20 GB. For the same cost as the afore mentioned iPod you can have the same amount of memory, in a slightly smaller and slightly lighter package. It includes a built FM tuner (which is unavailable in  iPod's, and unfortunately you need to purchase external adapters for your iPod to even play the radio), voice and FM recording (another feature that the iPod can only obtain via an adapter), a color screen (whihc is now becoming a standard feature and has recently been added to iPods). It also gets a longer battery life than most of the competition, including the iPod. Also, its compatible with a wider range of file formats than the standard iPod, including .jpgs.  My one knock on the H10 is its medicore navigation. While it's touchpad won't cause songs to change, fastfoward, rewind, or  pause as it slides around in your pocket (like the iPod tends to), its not very ergonomic. The vertical scroll touchpad gets the job done but its not as cool as the iPod's wheel.  Pros: -Comaptible with a wider range of files than the standard iPod. -Picture Display. -Color Screen. -Accessories (which can only be ordered from the iRiver website since iPod seems to have a monopoly at stores for shelf space). -Built in FM tuner. -Built in voice and FM recorder.  -Smaller and lighter than the standard 20GB iPod. -Being able to use Real, WinAmp (with plugins), and FooBar (also with plugins) allows the sound files to maintain their quality, which iTunes actually tends to deminish (particularly the bass and treble). -Better built in equalizer and even SRS Wow features. -Larger variety of online music stores that you can order music off of. -Large color variety. It comes in red, blue, platinum, and gray. -Doesn't get scratched up like the iPod's tend to (because it doesn't have a metallic back).  Cons: -Inconvenient navigation. -If you want accessories like cradles, car adapters, boom box and/or stereo adapters, and replacements for lost accessories, you'll have to order them off of the iRiver website. Theres nothing wrong with this, but it requires a wait and the extra charge for shipping and handling. However, you can pretty much use any iPod accessorie that only requires the headphone jack, (since they're universal) including some of the nicer Bose surround sound and sound canceling headphones. -Not as pleasing to the eyes as the simple, curvy, plain white iPod.
