<Title>Worth the Money
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[UPDATE]  Nearly two years later, I still have a working Creative Zen Micro. However, aside from the technical setbacks mentioned at the end of this review, I have encountered a few more problems. After several months of use, maybe a year, the ear buds broke, forcing me to buy a new ones (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JUZE1Q/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0945948-5579607">Earbud Headphones - White/blue</a> from Sony). Another problem that I can't seem to figure out is that sometimes, while it is playing a song, it gets briefly interrupted by another song or sound for a brief second and does this repeatedly throughout the song until you skip to another song. Another annoying issue is that sometimes, when I hook up the player to my computer, I cannot organize my tracks with the Creative Organizer because it cannot detect the player for some strange reason. However, luckily, I can still use the Creative Explorer to import new tracks, etc. Though the Creative Zen Micro remains functional for me, I feel that you should probably spend an extra $100 for a better MP3 player, such as the Ipod or Zune.  [/UPDATE]  For a while, I have investigated MP3 players, trying to decide which one I should buy and particuarly comparing them to the Ipod Mini. Based on the information I gathered, I made a unique move by stepping outside of the box and buying a Creative Zen Micro instead. I've concluded that the Creative Zen Micro greatly surpasses the Ipod mini in several categories, making it much more worth my money.  First of all, one of the biggest things to consider is the cost of the item. I was able to purchase my Creative Zen Micro for $171, including shipping and handling, as well as tax. The Ipod mini, on the other hand, is only available for around $240, not including shipping and handling or tax.   For $70 cheaper, I get 5 GB of memory space, an FM tuner, an organizer, 2 separate batteries (each providing 12 hours of playtime), a case, belt clip, stand, pouch, headphones, AC/DC power adapter, and USB 2.0 cable. However, the Ipod mini, at $240, offers only 4 GB of space and only 18 hours of playtime. It lacks an FM tuner, case, pouch, AC/DC adapter, and organizer, which are useful accessories and features to have.   - An FM tuner always provides refreshingly new music, which comes in handy when the songs get tiresome or repetitive when listened to too often. - The case and pouch help protect the MP3 player itself and save the buyer of having the time and money of having to purchase them.  - The organizer is helpful in keeping a record of events and contacts.  - The AC/DC adapter is an alternative way to charge the MP3 player, which becomes particularly useful when a computer is not available.  Finally, one of the main things that makes the Creative Zen Micro so superior to the Ipod Mini is its sound quality. Creative is known for its enhanced sound quality, which is one of the best in the business, whereas Ipod's is simply mediocre. Another additional bonus about the Creative Zen Micro is its compatibility with WMA files, which save the user time from having to convert WMA files to MP3 files. It also keeps a list of the songs that have been played the most and those that have been played the least. This helps the user single out favorite songs and new songs. Though navigation may feel a bit clumsy for some, the Micro's search feature makes finding tracks a breeze, whereas   to the best of my knowledge, the Ipod does not have one.  There are a flaws to mention about the Micro however:  1. Though some people are completely comfortable with the Micro's navigation, I find it is a little difficult. There are only 3 sensitivity settings and all three feel strange to me. The thing that is probably the most bothersome is how the scroller is also the selector, so if you're scrolling and accidentally tap it too hard, it will select something you did not want selected. I also think that the Ipod Mini's circular scroller is faster and more intuitive, but the Micro's vertical one is tolerable.   2. Yes, some people have claimed that their Creative Zen Micro broke within a matter of months or they bumped into some technical difficulties. This is not a myth. I, too, have been a victim, as my MP3 player froze a few days after receiving it from Amazon. However, I contacted Creative and they were very helpful and prompt in responding. Though I did have to pay a few dollars for shipping the product back to them, I received a fully functional replacement that I still use on a regular basis to this day (months later). I have researched a little to see how many people have suffered from any kind of technical difficulties with the Micro and have found that there are indeed a large amount. There are some who are more unfortunate than others, but it is more likely that you will not suffer from such problems and if you do, you will receive an excellent replacement.   Despite these few annoyances, the Creative Zen Micro is worth it. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase as I saved $70 while receiving more features than the Ipod Mini.

<Title>Worst product ever: Get the iPod
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a Creative Zen Micro in April and want to throw it against the wall in Dec. If I could, I would give it 0 stars. At first, it seemed like a winner. The fact that you could download mp3s rather than paying $1 per song via iTunes, I thought it would be a good deal. Unfortunately, this thing is so poorly made that it's been defective since the first three months. First the screen went out and what good is it if you can't see the titles of songs? The earbuds broke soon after. Then the thing just started turning off for no reason and having to re-build. Now, after just six months, my computer no longer finds it via the USB... thus can't download or do anything. Customer support? Non existent as well. I just wasted $200. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

<Title>Tech is pointless if you can't hear the music
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Tech isn't worth much if you can't get the music to the headphones. Buy something else.  My daughter bought hers in July. She returned the first one because it would not load music. She returned the second one because the headphone jack socket failed. Now she has to return the 3rd one because the headphone jack socket is failing.   Her experience is not uncommon.  She recommended the micro to a friend (it's really cool if its working). Her friend's headphone jack socket is failing.  (...)Consensus is that the only people satisfied with zen micro have not owned it long enough for the head phone jack socket to fail.   The problem is so common that there is a web site that gives the step by step instructions for fixing the socket. (with a caveat that you will void your warranty and should not attempt this unless you have professional soldering skills)  (...)

<Title>Don't buy it!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have never written an online review before but I feel compelled to do so.  While it appears some people have had good luck with this product, I found it a complete piece of trash.  My friends laughed when I said, "It was great until it stopped working."  I didn't mind the touchy controls and really loved the size and shape of the player.  Others on this site have described the many technical problems with the Zen Micro.  I will simply say I traded in my first one when it died only to have my second one become very sick in less than one month.  I now have an ipod nano with only 1/2 the storage capacity of my last zen micro but having 500 songs that play beats having 1000 songs that don't.

<Title>Love it to bits
<Date>Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Have had my micro since Feb this year and have no problems whatsoever. Great little player - actually has a replacable battery so you don't have to throw it out once the battery dies, like you do with the iPod. Just remember to download the firmware upgrade before you use it, I didn't know about this and had a minor issue with the battery life (fixed with the firmware upgrade).

<Title>Great player... for the first two weeks
<Date>Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player as a late Christmas present to myself this past January, figuring that while it was kind of pricy, that meant it would be high quality and last a while.  Wrong!  While I really loved the player when it worked properly, it hardly ever did.  After about a month, I started having compatability problems with transferring Napster songs I bought, despite countless upgrades.  After two months, the headphone jack started to go out.  Once it got so bad I could hardly use the player anymore, I sent it in to get repaired.  Not two weeks after I got it back, it fell about three feet off a table and onto the (carpeted) floor, and completely quit working.  According to Creative's customer service, they need $25 just to LOOK at it, so I'm done with this.    While the Micro is great in terms of features, it's badly designed and cheaply made.  I am extremely put out that I spent $250 on a piece of electronics that broke twice in less than 10 months.  I will be upgrading to an iPod Nano as soon as possible.

<Title>Excellent player - And Not an Ipod.
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this primarily for the FM radio - Apple and Ipod have dug in their heels and refused to include one.. Dopes. But then there are other advantages.  1) The sound quality is superior - it's truly excellent, with lower background noise with Creative than with IPod. See the specs. 2) The thought of having to buy the entire Ipod/Itunes/Music Industry monopoly seemed a bit bothersome. With the Micro you can run your toy off of RealAudio or MusicMatch or any of a number of other programs. 3) You can replace the battery - easily. 4) It used to be in competition with the Ipod Mini, and it's just got more memory. There's more bang for your buck. It is larger than the Ipod Nano, but..5GB!.. and I don't find the extra ounce or two to be a burden. 5) It leaves you as an individual - not one of the millions in the cult-of-iPod - I generally don't like 'mass fashion statement' accessories and I'm glad to be able avoid this one.  Creative has been an excellent alternative with no downside so far. Actually there is one downside, which is that 100 companies make accessories for Ipod and Creative doesn't have many similar add-on toys or cases available. But still I say - buy a Zen - you won't regret it.

<Content>I bought this player a litle over a month ago... sounds good , nice features but it is realy unfortunate how badly it works... download and sync problems( Napster). Whatever you do don't drop it even a soft landing can damage the unit.... Battery life is highly oversold ( 12 hours! not in my experience- try maybe 6) .   When I return this unit it will be the sencond and last time.

<Content>I purchased the Zen in late August.  It worked fine until recently when the headphone jack started to "wobble" and distort sound...now I have to constantly touch/tap the headphone jack area for it to play correctly....I'm about to send it in for repair -- wish me luck...

<Title>Good for those who aren't stuck on IPODS
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really like this player. The first day I got the player I wasn't used to the EXTREMELY senstive touch pads and pressed to many buttons too fast and it freezed. All I had to do was take out the batteries and it worked fine. It takes awhile to get used to the senstive scrool pad, but i like this thing better then the ipod. The software is extremely easy to use it's a lot like itunes. The only real con with this player is the battery life. If you listen to it for like an hour to 2 hours straight it'll be out of battery. That kind of makes it a hassle but its worth it. I really like this player better than ipods i've used. It's looks are awesome. it's WAY smaller than the ipod mini in my opinion, and the blue light around the outside is very cool. I've had many compliments about its looks and one of my friends bought one because she loved mine so much. It can fit in your pocket easily and you can throw it in your purse as well. The earbuds it comes with are not so great i went out and got some $30 really good earbuds to replace the ones the manufactuers give you, they have good sound, but fall out of your ears. Overall this is a really cool looking, durable, little guy who will make you happy.

<Title>i love my purple zen micro!
<Date>Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I first received the Micro, I did have some very frustrating times with the touchpad.  Then all of a sudden, I got it.  While it certainly remains a little over-sensitive, I am very comfortable with it.  Buttons would be better and I see that the Zen touch has them.  So far (2 and 1/2 months) my earphone jack has not broken.  Today, I purchased the extended warranty sitting in my cart for $40.00 from Creative, but noticed it went up to $50.00.  That is a lot for a $179.00 item that when the new price points already are much lower for much more storage..But it seems that the odds are that something will go wrong with the jack and the player might freeze up.  Within the first few days of owning it, my player did freeze up.  I was only getting about 3 hours on the battery.  I called Creative and it was just a matter of taking the battery out and putting it back holding the power on the whole time (I forgot the term for that).  I also downloaded upgrades from their site which extends the battery life.  I'm not sure why this information isn't provided upon purchase.  The players stay on "standby" for somewhere like 12 hours until you upgrade and it goes on "standby" for 3 hours.  That's what eats up the battery.  Once I had the upgrade, I was all set.  I don't know what the commotion is about how great the blue light is, but it's nice to have a light.  I did set mine to stay lit a bit longer than the default.  On the positive side, once you figure out the touchpad, the software, the upgrades, and get the warranty..you can really enjoy this player.  This is my first mp3, and I love that i have a stereo now that is so easy to manage and organize and tranport. I replaced the free earbuds (which did have excellent sound) with earbud w/earclips because the buds keep fallling out of my ears.  I have the travel sound speakers by creative that came with it in some promotion.  The music sounds phenomenal.  I also purchased regular speakers and hooked the micro in the living room and it was great during a party.  I then carry it around in my bag when I go anywhere in case I get stuck someplace and then I can listen to anything.  It actually has improved my quality of life!!!!  I also have only been able to get 1000 songs instead of the advertised (with asterik) 2500.  i deliberately went back and changed the settings for burns only on WMA 128, instead of mp3 192, and while that saved quite a bit of space, i ended up with the 1000 songs.    I also can't get any radio stations.  I don't use Outlook, but Palm, and wish i could psynch my calendar with the micro calendar.  In fact, that was part of the reason i justified buying the player-it was a storage disk, palm pilot, tape recorder, radio AND an mp3 player.  but it turns out  not to work for me as a calendar or a radio.    Many snafus, but what an incredible invention.  I'm just hoping it will last for a few years.  And i hope creative keeps on fine-tuning it, and being fast with customer service since they do know their products are problematic.. They have a great website forum where there are very helpful moderators and experienced owners lurking and helping everyone.  You can look up everything you want to know about the battery, touchpad, earphone jack and absolutely everything you can imagine...  Very good product (with lots of potential).

<Content>This product is great. It works very well and I don't have any complaints about the mp3 player itself. My only concern is the directions that are sent with it. The directions are not detailed at all. I kind of had to figure out how to upload songs, transfer songs, and create playlists on my own because the directions don't really tell you how to do all that stuff.

<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>first let me start by saying this little player kicks some serious ipod arse.Why should i get locked into crappy coustomer support and and i tunes and pay for a name this are questions i asked myself when i bought this little gem from walmart, and you should ask trhose questions your self.This little five gig player sound beautiful right outta the box and with a name like creative for people who dont know. Creative has been in the sound bussine ever since the days of the 386 producing sound cards for pcs. This player does it all,plays out crisp and sharp also with it's option to use as a 2gb portable hd. also can store contacts has and fm tuner and voice recorder built in and direct fm recording and trust me when i tell you wont be sorry with the fm tuner tune comes in perfectly no static at all. and the sound is almost as good as the mp3 on ur player.and the creative softwear perfect so easy to use i had it down in about 5 min. an to top that off a removeable battery w00t no more sending the mp3 back to the store or the manufactor becasue you can jus buy a new one. Plus it looks kick with the baby blue outline and all black front and baby blue buttons. but the touch pad takes some getting used to but even that you can turn down the (i have no idea how to spell this btw senseatvity) wow they thought of everything go creative. W00t and wacth out ipod becasue at half the cost and an extra gig of hd space and a unique look you to can have one of these awsome lil players. but i will end on this you could buy and ipod but you will be paying for just a name not and actuly decent player so it is your choice and trust me you will be paying becasue did ipod tell you that there mp3 player only work with i tunes ??? no i bet not well once more w00t for creative bye

<Content>i bought the zen micro because i thought i was getting more for the buck. but within 24 hours of receiving it, it already froze once. and within 3 months of having it, it died on me.  my friend took pity on me and bought me an ipod shuffle after this broke. it's safe to say, apple's jacked up prices are worth it because the zen micro feels so flimsy after holding an ipod. so...basically only get this if you're VERY CAREFUL with your toys. otherwise, i'd go with the safe route and get something else.

<Title>Great player that is dropping in price
<Date>Thu Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for about a year.  The first one I bought frozen up and was unrecoverable.  I returned it for a replacement, upgraded the firmware first thing and it's playing happily ever since.  The touch pad took some getting used to but like anything else, if you use it often it becomes second nature. I like the screen size and the variety of play mode options. As other reviewers have mentioned, you don't get much documentation with it and that's a shame but most things are fairly intuitive. If you upgrade to firmware version 2.20.05 you are locked into Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10 for operating the Zen. Version 1.30.03 only allows you to use the software bundled with the player but I find that option more useable.  I like the bundled software.  I don't like WMP 10. 'Nough said.  I use the Zen at work. It's very quiet but we're all in cubicles so this is a way to have my tunes and not disturb other people.  I carry it in a cell phone case around my neck as I move through my day.  I can listen all morning and still have plenty of battery left but I still recharge it during lunch.  If I'm at my desk for a long period I just leave it plugged in.  I've never had a battery go dead yet.  The earbuds that come with it.....suffice to say I invested in headphones I like better.  Needless to say I love this player.  For the price you just can't beat it and I've been very happy with it's performance. The size is perfect and whatever awkwardness there might be over software or button sensitivity, this is just a great little machine.

<Title>What  a piece of CRAP!!!
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased two Zen Micros and within two months both had issues with the headphone jacks cutting in and out. Both had to be returned for warranty work and after a lengthy wait they were returned. The replacements are sent without current firmware and driver updates in place which means that you will have to figure out which updates are needed thru the Creative website. There is an Autoupdate feature that allows you to just plug the Zen into the USB cable and the link decides which updates you need. To bad this doesn't work either.  Now, after having problems with one player that is 7 months old and the other not charging right I would say save your money and buy a Ipod Nano

<Title>Cool player
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I admit I am not what you would call technically sophisticated. After suffering through the limitations of portable CD players, my main criteria when looking for a player was being able to put a lot of music in one space while having good, clean and crisp sound.  Initially, I got my feet wet by buying a 512 MB flash player and eventually wanted to include more songs on the player. That led me to larger players. But which one to buy ... the dominant Ipod or another player which gets less attention? I have an older version of Windows which quickly ruled out the Ipod. So I turned to Creative Zen which was not only compatible technically but financially.  But I had huge concerns as I read reviews complaining about the player freezing and breaking. So it was with trepidation that I bought the Creative Zen Micro.   Hopefully, I don't jinx myself but 8 months later, I can report I am enjoying my player and its capabilities. When I first received the player, I was ready to throw it across the room (the $200 I paid stopped me from doing that) because I was so frustrated over not being able to work the touchpad. It took a few days but once I took a deep breath and managed to adjust the sensitivity levels, things were fine. The FM stations come in clear as well and the battery which I can remove and replace myself (an advantage over the Ipod) lasts a reasonable period of time without recharging.  Because the player came with few instructions, another frustration I had was not being able to figure out how to make playlists and other functions. I fixed that problem by going to Creative's website and finding a 65 page set of instructions there. For those who are still trying to figure out their player, I recommend downloading the instructions. It makes life and dealing with the player much easier.

<Title>ZEN MICRO WINS!!!!!
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my zen about 4 months ago. People have all their reviews about how the Zen battery doesn't hold a charge. WRONG! I charged my player right before Hurricane Katrina. IT HELD ITS CHARGE FOR FIVE WEEKS STRAIGHT THROUGH HURRICANE KATRINA!! It has amazing sound quality and is extremely easy to use. The touchpad takes about 1 day to get used to. The software could be a little easier to use, but if you work hard enough you can easily figure it out. The battery will last about 10 hours of use. The battery also holds it charge for about a 7 weeks of no use. I recommend you use the DLO clear jam case for the Zen Micro. Zen Micro is definatly an IPOD killer. IPODs use only ITunes. Zen Micro uses any MP3 format. The Micro is the best.

<Title>Comprehensive Review
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm going to begin with a basic review and then as an addenum address some of the complaints on the board.  Looking for an mp3 player I was looking for (in order of priority):  1) Audio Fidelity 2) Compatibility with music subscription services 3) Build Quality 4) Portability (including batterly life) 5) Interface 6)Maintenance Costs (i.e. easily replacable, cheap battery)  With this in mind, I was led to the Zen Micro.  I know creative creates great sound cards  (I've had 2 of them) and I had also read that creative had the among the best fidelity of all audio players.  Testing with a friend's zen micro and another's ipod, I noticed a clear difference in quality between the two using the same songs encoded at the same bitrate.  I am, however, an audiophile, so many people may not notice the difference.  Ipods tend to have weaker bass and less clarity.  Zen micro also had the features I was looking for that the ipod didn't: (compatability with subscription serviecs, not having to use system--resource-hogging i-tunes, and being able to transfer files between computers).  The FM tuner and voice recording didn't really play into my account, but they work fine: the FM tuner is a bit weak, and I get a little static listening to NPR, but its not gruesomely bad either (what do you expect out of such a tiny device without an antenna?).  The recording is ok too but the fidelity is really meant for note taking not recording a concert or anything.  The build quality of this thing seems pretty good as well.  The back is a clear, white plastic which I find to be very cool looking.  Unlike the ipod, it will not scratch easily and has a nice glossy finish to it.  The front seems to be a thin anodized aluminum faceplate (the screen is a whole in the faceplate, and on top of the plate is a thick layer wich borders the player and also forms the screen).  The text quality is very good and is about 10 font for characters and 8 or 6 font for time remaining and track number.  I've read reports about the zen taking hard knocks and still working and I believe them (at least everything other than the headphone jack seems solid).  This thing is extremely protable.  It is about 3.8 ounces which is slightly heavier than the ipod mini and the nano, and it is thicker as well but I find that to be great because it cradles more easily into my hand  (the back is curved).  It is light enough so that I don't notice it while exercising using my arm-band at the gym (in terms of weight).    I've had no problems with the interface either.  Its intuitive and yes, its pretty similar to the ipod's, but I've read that ipod jacked creative's interface in the first place anyways.  Instead of a wheel you have an up-down touch sensitive scroll which is used for volume control and scrolling.  Tapping it lightly selects things.  It is very intuitive and I got use to the sensitivity (which you can adjust) in a few minutes.  It has a very cool backlight as well making it easy to use at night.  In addition, it can be used in your pocket without a problem.  The controls are the only metallic part of the player exposed (the rest is covered in plastic) so its easy to find, and there are 2 small ridges (like the 1-side of a die) that stick up and  help identify where the buttons are by touch.  The battery life is about 11 hours on mine without constant adjustment (I tested it) and about 8 hours with constant adjustment (which usually happens with me).  The battery is removable and can be purchased cheaply on ebay which is a plus.  Now to respond to the caveats:  Ok, there's a lot of variance in the reviews for the Zen Micro so here are a few quick things I would like to point out.  Anyone that insults the Zen Micro and then tells you to buy an ipod (especially a 20 gig one)  seem to me to be  an ipod fanboy trying to turn you away from a good product or is clueless about mp3 players.  The zen micro is not competing really with ipods, its features put it in a different niche.  The normal ipod was just too big for me and I didn't need to have 20 gigs with me at a time.  Also the mediocre audio fidelity was a big turn-off to me.  Yes, there is a headphone problem, but noone is certain how really prevalent it is.  Forums are a terrible way to tell because you're getting a self-selecting group of people.  If yours breaks, of course you're gonna go whine about it online.  If it doesn't, you just continue on doing what you've been doing and don't even know such boards exist so a board full of complaining people may not mean the player is bad.     That being said, the  headphone problem does seem to be a systematic flaw (at least among those that expereince it) that occurs in  because the headphone jack is apparently not soldered on very tight.  Anecdotal evidence says that newer models are soldered on tighter, but noone knows for sure (not enough time to test).   If you know how to solder components you can fix it but void your warranty.  I don't think its that big of a problem, I talked to a local cambridge soundworks guy who said he never had any problems with the zen micro and that noone has returned it because of a headphone jack problem.   If you're really worried, I suggest you get Amazon's replacement plan rather than Creative's extended warranty.  Creative will send you a refurbished unit if yours gets broken, which begs the question, why is it refurbished in the first place?  With Amazon they will send you a new one, which is a better deal.  THey will also be  likely faster than Creative which has like 1 month turnaround times (no, I don't work for amazon; this is what careful research has shown me).  To solve the headphone jack problem, do not leave your headphones plugged in while in not in use (this also saves battery life), and do not put it in your pocket or anywhere else where it can collide into things.  This should not be hard as you should most likely have a belt clip or whatnot to protect your investment anyways.  Get headphones with a 90 degree jack to limit torque as well.  Small things you might want to know:  The organizer does what it says, display downloaded outlook tasks.   There is up to a three second lag between songs sometimes on shuffle.  This is due to the harddrive in the device moving from one section of the disk to another.  For songs immediately after another its not as noticable.  There is usually about a 1 second average lag between songs when fowarding.   Thats about it, I just got my purchase and am glad I got it, its a cool little device that had all the features I wanted + some nice bonuses.  I'm a little worried about the headphone problem but I know how to solder and I am extra careful with my player so I feel safe.  I'm certainly glad I got it over an ipod, the sound quality is enough to push the micro far and beyond the ipod to me.  Hope I've been of help.    EDIT:  I've owned this thing for 5 months now and still no headphone jack problem.  I even stopped worrying about it after the first month and just left my headphones jacked in and still no headphone jack problem.  Some dust got underneat the plastic at the edges but I used a business card and just scraped the dust out.  I've even used it to record lectures (be sure to listen to the recording after a few seconds to make sure you're getting good sound).  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would buy it again.

<Title>I am returning it back
<Date>Tue Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First the touch pad is too sneitive. I would rather have the buttons.  Second the FM receiver is not sensitive enough to catch the regualr channels.  Third, It would not charge from the USB port out of box, one has to install the Drivers/Media Source application to get it to charge which looks outright foolish specially when the system does not have required drivers on it or you have to sacrifice min 128 MB as HDD space for it to be able to charge. what a piece of BS.  I am done with it. I have had enough with this player's nightmares.

<Title>The Zen Micro
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, the zen micro is the only microdrive on the market that "de-throned" the apple ipod mini, go to www.mp3.com and look at the review they wrote.  the reason the micro beat the ipod was that it had:  1) an FM transmiter 2) very attractive blue outline lights 3) smaller and can fit in a Mintz box :) 4) supports yahoo music unlimited and other on the go subscriptions 5) as an amazing, removable battery!!!! 6) was the same price of the mini but you got an extra gig of memory.  The FM transmitter is a decent one, (espessially for no antena)  the blue lights on the outline are very attractive, but i fear that they are the reason that this player has only 12 hrs of battery.  the size is amazingly small for a microdrive. it fits in a mintoz box (one of the user images on amazon shows it)  the removable battery, this alone made me buy the micro instead of a mini. with All ipods you have to spend over 80 dollars just to get a new battery!!!!   and the value of the zen is much more than the mini.  with the micro you get an FM tuner, Voice recording, and 1 extra gig of memory for the same price as the mini was.  now that the mini has been replaced by the NANO, apple is bragging how thin the Nano is compared to the zen micro.. to me this makes no sence. why does apple compare a BRAND NEW product that was JUST realeased oct 12 2005 to the older zen micro, which was released at the end of 2004.    comparing those 2 is like comparing Windows XP to windows 2000..    tghe zen is a great player for those who go to highschool or colledge.

<Title>Great when it functions
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought it from Amazon in February and the earphone jack failed in three months.  Check Creative's forum to see how common this problem is.    It was still under warranty and I sent it back for repair.  They sent me another one with the disclaimer that this may be a refurbished unit.  This one lasted about a month before the hard drive completely crashed.  Again, check Creative's forums to see how common this problem is.    The warranty is almost done on this product, so I'm looking at IPods now.  When it actually works, it sounds great.

<Title>Mp3 players; the audiophile's worst nightmare
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm addicted to music. I'm also somewhat of an audiophile. Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me. On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine. On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality. I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.  I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut. The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb. The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go". So that's the one I bought. Too bad.  First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.   Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. They didn't really make any difference. I also experimented with an adapter for the car. If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. Hands down, better quality than ipod's. that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.    Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.   Otherwise, you should get an ipod. My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made. It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.    If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive. However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.

<Title>My unit came defective
<Date>Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for something else other than the IPOD when I considered the Zen Micro (ours is 6G) that we sell here at my store. I wanted good battery life, a durable unit, and plenty of space to hold my music under $275.  After much research I decided to buy the Zen Micro 5G which I found at another store for $179. It was defective...  I had previously heard rumors about a lot of problems with Creative's products because of poor design or just general defect. I was hoping to God I wouldn't get something defective, but after all I had heard from people's units crashing after a few months of use, I decided to return this unit instead of exchange.  For one, when I bought it, the touch pad did not work like the manual said. Instead of moving up and down... the up button was sometimes the select key, so when scrolling up I accidentally hit a lot of menu options. To avoid this I just used the lower portion of the pad, it was a pain...  Even worse was when I set up playlists once I got into them itself it changed to another list I could not get out using the Back key. It was EXTREMELY difficult to get to the main menu to change songs... and usually I ended up changing songs and moving the volume and so forth trying to desperately get to the menu.  My remedy was hitting the back key and select key at once REPEATEDLY... doing this about 50 times until it worked was the only way I could get to the playlist or main menu. I was not happy with my unit at all...  The display model at our job works GREAT though and from what I hear some people are happy with the units so far. I was thinking my unit was just defective considering many people have come back saying they've bought other Creative models as well as this one that have had similar problems as well as headjack problems.  I still have faith in Creative and it's reputation, but I would be weary of a lot of defects with their products. The hard drives have crashed after so long, at most a year, and I've seen two Zen Xtras returned withen the past few days which is A LOT considering our store doesn't even sale them.  If you notice with some of their models, the prices has dropped dramatically. For example, the Zen Xtra runs for $217 for a THIRTY GIG hard drive. That is massive for an mp3 player.  I still have some faith in Creative so I'm going to be persistent and try the Zen Sleek as it seems to be a very durable unit and something I'd like to give a try. Hopefully your unit wont be as defective as mine, but you should pay attention to why these prices are so low, and judge for yourself if you think this unit will reach your expectations as it is still a very well designed unit and very attractive looking.

<Title>Stay away from this product
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Micro boasts the capability of holding up to 2,500 songs, yet you will be lucky to fit 1,000 on it. I chose this player because I read/heard good things about it. The navigation is very hard and making a playlist is utterly impossible unless you load everything up on your computer screen and do it that way. The "touchpad" is ultra-sensitive, even when on the so-called least sensitive setting. Nonetheless, I put up with all of this stuff because the sound quality was superb.  Then one day the player froze up. It wouldn't even turn off. I removed the battery to get it to shut off. Now, the thing doesn't even work. I have only had it for a month any already it is broken, even though I didn't do anything to it. It only turns on when I use the adapter and it shows the beginning screen with the word "creative," it lights up, but nothing works...I can't get to my songs, I can't get it to do anything.  I wanted to post this so you don't waste your money and get stuck with this thing like I did! Spend a little more and get something reliable and worth the cash.

<Title>Works for me
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I was aware of the sensitive touch pad and of the headphone jack problem before I bought this.    When I first got it I opened the insturction manual and did what it said.  The manual doesn't tell you how to use your player but only tells you how to charge it up, turn it on,  and install the software on your computer and that's it.  Using the player itself you'll have to play with it to figure it out.  The software that comes with this is good.  It comes with Windows media player 10 and its own organizer.  The organizer is actually powered by Windows media player and a couple of other programs.  You can use windows media player to rip, burn cds, and sync music to your device if you want to, but I like creatives organizer better.  Using the player itself is easy once you get the hang of it.  You slide your thumb up and down the touch pad to select the menu item(don't tap it or press it) then once your on the thing you want you then tap the touch pad to select it.  The first thing you'll want to do when you get it is practice doing this.  You might also want to change the touchpad sensitivity to low in system/player settings/touch pad.  Also when playing music you have to use the touch pad to turn up and down the volume.  There is no seperate wheel or buttons for the volume.  What I mean is once you press play and start playing the file, you use the same touch pad you use for navigating the menus for the volume.  Personally I don't mind this.  I haven't tried making a play list using the player itself yet so I can't comment on that.  It is easy however to make one on your computer and import it to your device.  As for audio quality it's just as good as any other MP3 player.  Nothing special but it's good.  It's not distroted or anything like that.  There is a little bit of squeeling in between tracks though.  As for problems my device did freeze up once and I had to remove the battery and stick it back in.  That fixed the problem and none of the data was lost.  I haven't run into the headphone jack problem yet and I hope I never do.  I've only had it for a little over a month though.  I'm being extra carefull making sure not to twist the headphone plug around in the jack and not removing it and putting it back in all the time.  The only other problem is that the touchpad is hard to use at first but you get used to it.  Pros: -Plays MP3 and WMA -Small about three inches tall, one and a half inches wide and less than a half inch deep -FM radio -comes with good software  Cons -unsure about headphone jack -froze up once

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> The zen micro was given to me as a present, which makes it harder, but the first thing that happened was the battery was dying after about 1 hour. It went back to the shop, which in Hong Kong means arguing like mad to get them to take it back rather than having to go to the service centre in some remote place yourself. A couple of weeks later it came back with a new battery. For a few months it was OK, although it would hang up regularly requiring the battery to be removed to reset it. Then the remote died, oh well, i didnt really need it anyway. Then it came up with "firmware fault", and the whole unit was replaced  another couple of weeks after being returned. Then I changed to Mac from the PC, and there are NO drivers or support for Mac for Zens. Fairly unbelievable for a company trying to compete with the I-pod.  I found a third party driver written for the Zen called XNJB, which at least allows you to use the basic functions. Why Creative cannot do what one person did by themselves and released for free I cannot understand. Now the thing has totally crapped out and is stuck on "building library" and so is impossible to access, even to reformat. I'll try to get it fixed again, but I'm not sure what I'll do with it when I do get it back. I'm waiting for a 60Gb Ipod to arrive now. When it worked it was nice to use, the size was decent and the features were well thought out, but I strongly advise against this player and Creative products in general. They will not reply to any customer service complaints, but just send standard e-mails to put you off. Hopeless.

<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a Zen Touch about a year ago and the thing was absolutely ginormous. It weighed about a pound and barely fit in my pocket (and made a huge bulge when it did)  A few weeks ago the Zen Micro 5gb went on sale at Amazon so i decided to pick one up. I wasn't sure if 5gb would be enough space for me but it's plenty. I honestly don't understand these people buying 20gb-60gb mp3 players for double the price, it's just not needed or worth the extra cost. Ive got over 700 songs on my Micro (mostly 192-256kbps, some VBR) and there is still space left for more.    My old Zen Touch had crazy battery life (20 hours+) and I loved that part of it. The Micro's battery typically only has 1 bar left after a full day of use, but it hasn't died (or locked up) on me yet. Just make sure you update the firmware from Creative's website before you start putting songs on it, because it requires a full format of the hard drive.  Why pay 70 bucks more for an ipod nano when you can get one of these? I am a completely satisfied customer... even though Amazon took close to a week and a half to get it to me (free shipping option)

<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a Creative Zen Micro to have for Spring Break in March. I originally had a problem installing the software for it and had to call customer service. After that was sorted out, I put songs on it through Napster-to-Go and it worked for almost 2 weeks. That was all I got out of it. It wouldn't let me play any of my songs after that. I was busy and didn't have any time to call customer service for a while. When I did, I found out that I would have to use email customer support cause my time was up to be able to use the over the phone service. I emailed them back and forth for 3 months almost every day. Their response time was rather fast, but eventually I just went back to Best Buy and exchanged it for an iPod. So far, I haven't had any problems whatsoever with it. I do not recommend the Creative Zen Micro as it would not play my songs on it and my computer, which had nothing wrong with it(Dell Desktop PC), didn't sense that I plugged it in, therefore I couldn't even try to fix the songs on it.

I cannot get my wma files (pretty much all of the CDs I copied to my computer) onto the creative software!  It is not like I want to sit around and rip all of my CDs over again (some are so scratched I can't do that anyway).  Otherwise this is a good product, but still this is a huge deal.  Creative states that thier software can recognize wma and mp3 files.  Liars!

<Title>A so so product barely working
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After reading reviews on the internet, including the ones in Amazon I bought this product at a pretty good price. However, I have deeply regreted. This has confirmed a long time suspecion that online reviews are largely biased, especially the ones raving about the products. You just have no way to find out any info about confliction of interests.     OK, back to the point. I don't want to talk about the "pros" of this product because there isn't really any. Yes it plays music, but isn't it supposed to be working that way? It does everything the manufacturer claims it will do but, the manufacturer has been hiding from the customers a lot of "cons" that are not supposed to be found in any decent, mature product. Let's list some here.     1.  Very very hard to install softwares. It's a pain in the back side to update firmware. I have been playing PCs since DOS age and I have a Linux box which has been fine tuned by myself to such a degree that it can almost replace my Windows box. However, after hours of trying and numerous rebootings I have finally decided to just throw away the CD that comes with the player, just using Windows Media Player instead, any way WMP is the "engine" of all these softwares, the others are just "shells".    But I did manage to up-grade firmware to the newest version. and the following are the problems that I still have.     2. Everytime I have purchased licensed songs in it, it messes up with the rest of the songs unlicensed. I can't find them again, I can't send new mp3 formated songs to it since it prompts me to purchase a "license" for them. But everybody nows mp3 format dosn't carry any license infomation. Creative may say it's not their problem but the problem of, say, Microsoft, like I care to know. I want a working mature portable music player no matter what. Creative had promised me one when it took my money.    3. Every time when I recharge it, it automatically turns on by itself, even it has been turned off before. And when it's turned on it displays a messege saying "Docked" and a sign of re-organising forever, and I can't turn it off again, it is frozen, until it's unplugged. The same happens when I send songs over from my PC, or there is any error caused by whatever reasons. It's just so slowly reacting that it really looks dumb.    4. It's very hard to navigate through the songs. The touch-pad is either over-sensitive or not responding. They could have used older but more reliable technologies if they don't really know how to use the new ones. As an ethnic Chinese I used to take pride of Creative's products but this one has disappointed me big time.    All in all, this is a caricature of ipod, a product made by an opportunitist who is both jealous of the former's success and desperate to catch up. However, take a look at today's portable music player market, who is not?

<Title>Change to ONE star! Must Read. Avoid being nickled and dimed
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars. I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons. This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another. Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you. Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!! I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc.... I have used similar devices and they are seamless and simple. Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  This brings my review to one star! But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.  The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. It COULD have been a great product. Why isn't it? Read the next six mixed pros and cons: . 1.) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. . 2.) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer. The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer. I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket. If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market. I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord? Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc. Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. . 3.) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . 4.) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries. Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. . 5.) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired. The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. I have gone through two of them in two years. . 6.) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.

<Title>i love it, but...
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Don't get me wrong, I love the Zen Micro, but there are a few problems that everyone should be aware of.    The sound quality is amazing and I love having a ton of  music at my fingertips.  The problem is the fingertips.  The controls take awhile to get used to and they are not the most operator friendly.  I am sometimes frustrated with the way the controls are too sensitive or not sensitive enough.  I usually try to set it to what I want and leave it alone instead of constantly hunting for a different song or album.   Also the software is not the most user friendly.  I had to kind of play with it to figure it out and I am still learning some of the finer points.  Once you get the hang of it it is not too bad, but at first it is frustrating and I don't consider myself computer illiterate.  Overall though, I must say that I love the Zen Micro.  I think it was worth the initial frustration to get to have so much music in such a little package with such good sound quality.  I have about 690 songs and 4 sizeable playlists and I have only used a little over half of my memory.  I would suggest the Zen Micro to anyone who will deal with a little frustration to get the most out of a great device.

<Content>I am very happy with my Zen Micro player.  I've read some of the reviews on this player and  I can't understand why some people are having problems with it.  The only thing that I can say that is negative, is that the earphones aren't the best.  I purchased some high quality Sony earphones and the sound is incredible.  The battery life is also good.  I have over 850 songs in the ZEN MICRO, and I have more space.  I think that creative may need to work out some the bugs that some of the people are complaining about.

<Title>Excellent Value!
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my player for about a week now, and am very happy with the overall package that Creative has delivered!  I'll be using the player for a number of tasks:     -Rhapsody To Go Subscription (all-you-can-eat download plan)    -Audible.com Subscription    -Ripping my music that isn't available through Rhapsody    -Portable USB hard drive  Some notes/tips: -First thing you need to do is upgrade your firmware from the Creative site.  If you choose the version 2.x firmware, your player will be Windows Plays-For-Sure compliant, and you can use standard software such as Windows Media Player 10 for loading up your software (you must have WinXP SP1 or SP2 to use this firmware).  You'll also be ready to use audible.com for audio books as well.  -If you've read other reviews, you've seen the potential hardware issues such as the headphone jack going bad, or the hard drive crashing.  I'm getting a second player from my vendor as the touchpad is having some issues at the bottom.  So make sure you purchase from a vendor is local or has good return/replacement policy for the first 30 days or so.  -You can buy an extended warranty from Creative directly, as long as you purchased the unit from an authorized reseller.  I think it's a really good insurance policy; for forty dollars you extend the normal warranty (30 days labor, 1 year parts) to 2 years, and all shipping costs are covered.  You can purchase any time within the first 90 days of your original zen purchase.   -Excellent sound from the player.  The ipod has become known for it's great styling, and Creative is known for good sound (remember they're a major vendor for PC sound cards).  -I can create a huge USB flash drive on the Zen when necessary.  On the fly, you can re-partition the device to have a large (up to 4Gb) section as a flash drive.  So in an emergency I can delete songs off the player and have a huge backup disk for my laptop.  -The player is the perfect size to fit in an Altoids mint can.  I had a ton of fun getting a can, lining it with felt, and making my stealth travel cover.  -Rhapsody To Go has been a great service.  For fifteen a month, I can download any of the albums in their catalog (over a million songs to date) to my Zen for portable playing.  So now I can listen to tons of albums from the 70's-80's that have been in a moving box for years whenever I want.  Many of those I only want to listen to once, so why buy the music when I can rent it?  Pretty cool!  -When you purchase, recognize there are two bundles vendors sell.  One has an extra stand-up case and wall charger, the other just has the usb cord for charging.  These extras would cost you around fifty-sixty dollars as add-ons, so make sure you get these included with your initial purchase.

<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a complete non-techno-savvy person who didn't even know what an mp3 player was, I only heard of it when I was gifted this Zen a couple of months ago. I had to choose between an iPod and a Zen, and although everyone told me to go for an iPod "if only because it's a huge cultural symbol", I chose the Zen simply because I had gotten good reviews from friends who had it.  For a first time mp3 user and someone who doesn't know how the whole technical stuff etc, I absolutely loved it. The sound is so clear, it's really loud but only to you - thankfully it doesn't disturb others on a bus. It's sleek design and cool blue glow is really neat! And it's extremely easy to use. Literally just plug and transfer with no complicated wires and programs etc. And it's really sturdy and comes with it's hard plastic detachable cover, belt clip and desk stand. And you can simply plug it into your USB port on your laptop and it charges automatically (this is useful for me because I live in a 220-volt zone and it's 110 volts :( so charging would be a hassle.   Overall a great buy!

<Title>Controls impossible to operate by feel
<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for a mp3 player that I can attach to my belt while walking, working out at the gym, etc and listen to music, audio books, language courses.   I have been using a 512MB Rio Cali, which has been great, but I need more more memory capacity.   The requirements I have are:    1. Attach to belt    2. Easy to use the device and accompanying software.    3. This is a bigee - ability operate the volume, pause/play, rewind  and fast forward quickly and easily with the thing mounted on my belt.  That's because when listening to an audio book, lots of things can cause you to need to rewind a few seconds, or temporarily pause, or change the volume.    4. FM Radio    5. 4 -6 GB    6.  Supports audio book formats  So I got a Zen Micro.   Aside from the fact that one ear of the supplied headphones was dead,  it worked as expected.  I didn't like the supplied software but have previous experience using Windows Media Player so I used that to sync playlists onto the player.  I got a belt clip/case  from dlodirect that works ok.    I had intended to use the bookmark function to keep my place in an audio book when I did something else like listen to music mp3's or FM.  But it is pretty useless for this reason:   If you have a book as a playlist containing many tracks, and are somewhere in the middle, if  you set a bookmark and later return to the book mark,  it does put you back in the track at the right place, but it forgets that you were in a playlist ( so it won't continue on to the next track).  So, ironically, bookmarks are useless for audio books.  Here is a suggestion for designers of mp3 players:   REMEMBER THE LAST POSTION IN EACH PLAYLIST, SO IT WILL RESUME WHERE YOU LAST STOPPED!!  The big problem I ran into was the touchpad control.   After turning the sensitivity to low, I was able to operate it , with some pratice,  as long as I was looking directly at it.   The problem was trying to operate it by feel when it was on my belt, or even when using it in the car,  playing through the car stereo with a cassette adaptor.     The difficulty is that the touch pad is so sensitive, and offers so little tactile guidance that you inevitably accidentally touch the wrong button and screw everything up.     Here's another suggestion for the designers:   Don't try to use the touchpad for everything.  Its ok for scrolling or volume, but for Fwd, Rewind ,  Play/Pause YOU NEED BUTTONS that you can feel in the dark.  So I'm returning mine, and will keep searching, using my Rio in the meantime.

<Title>Horrible!!!
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having just bought my first mp3 player, the Creative Zen Micro 5gb, I am sorely dissappointed. Constant problems have plagued me so far. My computer won't recognize the device (it's not my computer's problem though), the mp3 player freezes up when I unplug the USB cable, and I still haven't managed to figure out the problem after a week of having it. Another problem I noticed is that the touch pad is extremely sensitive. You'll be fumbling your way through the menu trying to select options. It's awful!  Creative customer support still hasn't replied, so Im going to pack it up and send it back. I'll probably never buy another product from this company, ever again. I find it to be very irresonsible for a company to release a product that is plagued with so many problems.  Saving up a little more money to get an IPOD doesn't sound like a bad idea now!

<Title>Completely happy with my Zen Micro.
<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am completely happy with my Zen Micro.  I had an ipod shuffle, but it did not shuffle very well.  I kept hearing the same tracks over and over again; it now just sits on my shelf collecting dust.  I use my Zen Micro at work on my desk, at home, and on the bus.  In these environments it works just fine.  I don't use it working out; too much back ground noise.  I do listen to the FM radio, it works great.  As far as the problems other users talked about, I haven't had them.  My Zen Micro hooked right up to my windows pc without issues.  I am using Napster, and downloading and uploading is a breeze.  I installed the software like the directions stated, updated everything without issue.  Now I can plug into my pc and unplug from my pc without issue.  I'm not having any issues with the ear phone jack.  I have learned from the old walkmans that the jack can wear out, so I leave my headphones plugged in as long as possible.  I have switched out those ear buds and replaced with more comfortable head phones.  The touch controls did take a little getting used too.  But hey give Creative props for trying something new and different.  Now I'm fairly comfortable with them.  Remember I'm always sitting still when using the controls, if I was running it would be difficult.  I also think Creative customer support is much better than Apple.  I called them for simple tips and tricks.  Unlike Apple, Creative allows more than one call.  Creative gives a grace period of free tech calls, and then they charge.  I have only had to ask simple questions of them, I haven't pushed them for real support or really difficult tech support questions.  Over all nothing but good things to say about my Zen.

<Content>Purchasing this mp3 player I was faced with a few worries. Most friends told my to get an ipod but I refused because it didn't work with Napster to go. I have been completely satisfied with my Zen Micro and have found no problem with it at all. The touch screen is easy enough for a 5yr old to use. The one I bought at Walmart came with the belt clip and charger. It has some really good features like FM radio and a calender,contact list, and task list. Some stations dont get very good reception but this is an MP3 player we are talking about, which some people need to realize (ipod movie fans). Overall this is great for anyone who hates their ipod or is purchasing there first one. Battery life=12 hrs. Great choice!

<Title>Why couldn't this work?  Think I'll get another....
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So, bought my Zen at the end of April, moved to new city, used it well and often.  I charged the battery through my computer using my USB Port. I experienced no problems whatsoever, not even the buzzing that so many other Zen-ites had.  At one point I was using it at my job, plugging it into their stereo system and playing the music that I was able to download onto my Zen from Napster-To-Go.  Then, about 2 months ago, it started freezing up, my battery life went way down, it wouldn't charge fully, etc.  You've heard it all.  As the main problem was the battery, I put out the $40 for a new one.  Also completely rebooted the whole damn thing, which I couldn't do until the new charged battery came in.  Worked better for about a month.  About a month ago, same thing started again.    I know alot of people are totally gone against Creative after this, but I loved my Zen when it worked, and everything it did for me.  I'm an actor, and I was able to record my monologues and play them back on the subway to help memorize.  As soon as I have the cash, I think I'll get another, upgrade this time to the 5GB, and get an external power charger.  I'm also going to get both the 2 year warrenty from Creative.com, as well as the extra $300 warranty from either Target.com or Amazon, depending on where I but it.

<Title>Good Features - Scrolling Impossible
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I liked the features this player offers except for two: 1> The scroll wheel doubles as the select button. I couldn't get it to work properly; I would try to scroll to the next entry and it would act like I "clicked" it. I tried reducing sensitivity of the scroll bar, but it wouldn't go low enough. 2> It gets its power through the USB port (long time to charge up). Creative wants $30 for a charger. I travel and may not be near a computer, so figure this cost into the total. After a couple of days I returned it. Still searching for a good mp3 player.

<Content>What insane person designed this thing?  I didn't even get a chance to use the player; after spending 45 minutes trying to work the touchpad, I gave up in frustration and returned the rotten product.   No matter what sensitivity I adjusted the touchpad to, it was impossible to reproducibly make a selection.  The manual says "lightly tap the pad to make your selection"- Ha!  Lightly tapping,  smashing, mashing, grazing- nothing would work reproducibly. I refuse to pay this amount of money for a product that within 15 minutes of use causes my blood-pressure to sky rocket.  Blech- run away from this player!

<Title>I'll pass...
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought one of these only to return it the next day. I like the design and the feel of the player, but it has some strikes. Namely, the controls. The vertical touch pad is just not any good. It's difficult to use and frustrating. But it think worse that that were the other buttons the front. They are all touch buttons too and don't have any kink of "click" response. I found myself having to try and hit a button more than once because they don't respond that well unless touched right in the middle. The case it came with was nice and i like they idea of a replacable batter as well. The software was all fairly straightforward. The radio was less than stellar and didn't have great reception. Sound quality from mp3s was very good. I realized after buying it that 5 GB wasn't nearly enough space for me. I put about 1000 songs on it and it was full. It had alot of things going for it, too bad they screwed up on the usability. I returned it and, like so many others, bought an iPod. I got the 20 GB color version so I have plenty of room now. It's not as small and portable as the zen micro, but I'd trade that any day for the iPods exceptional control. The scroll wheel is 1000 times better than the vertical touch pad on the zen micro. I use iTunes on my PC cuz it doesn't seem that bad to me. But if you wanna use something else you can try MediaMonkey. It's similar in use to windows media player and supports ipods. If you absolutely must have this, at least wait a couple months and the the color screen version that is about to be released. One last thing. I paid a bit over $200 bucks for the zen micro and about $275 for the 20 GB Color Ipod. The zen is WAY overpriced. Should be $150 or lower at most.

<Title>BEWARE. DO YOUR RESEARCH. HEADPHONE JACK PROBLEM
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers. I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod. Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off. The Zen offered a great alternative. Now, there are many alternatives to the Ipod, but I wanted a nice design, also, and not some generic looking mp3 player. I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod. I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member. What happens follows:       Let's start with the software. It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch. You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer. The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy. The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,500 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software). When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space. Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. Check the Zen's S/N ratio and DB rating. They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom). The included headphones suck, so get your own.         Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software. The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod. The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen. Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen. This feature works almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well. Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored. At least, that is, while it's still alive.        The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies. It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first. A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info. going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes. Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly). The features this thing has are just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer. But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.         One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved. I loved this thing. I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing. It cost less than, in most cases, $190. Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the rechargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.        But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything. Why? because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it). There are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it. If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.       Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use. Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem. I used them. Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone jack that Creative has acknowledge. I know what you are thinking. You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out. If only only it was that simple. The flaw is inside the Zen. You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are. The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to. In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.           There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means? Exactly, warranty voided. So, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music. The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer. Do your research; check out the bulletin boards.

<Title>Great Product, If You Can Get A Functioning One!
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Personally I Love The Creative Zen Micro 5GB. It's sleek, holds the perfect amount, and is compact for traveling. The only problem that I would have to say is that most of them are disfunctional or have flaws in them. I have gone through 2 myself and am now on my third Zen. The first one had a problem with the buttons squeaking like mad. The second one wouldn't respond all the time when I pressed the buttons. Finally on my third one they got it right. So in the end it was well worth it, well at least for me. Although I gave the retailers one heck of a hassle about it lol. Anyhow the problems you have to look out for in this product are squeaky buttons, buttons not functioning all the time, and a possibility of the headphone jack breaking. If you really love the way this product looks, as do I, then I implore you to take the risk. Cause in the end it will be well worth it. (...)

Everything the nano does the micro does better. the color screen is dumb. looking at pictures on your mp3 player is dumb. having to instal itunes is dumb. that crazy connector on the ipod is dumb. games on an mp3 player are dumb too. PEOPLE! ITS A MP3 PLAYER! If you want pictures get a photo album, if you want games get a psp! If you want a color screen get a plasma tv! the smaller size of the nano is cool but alot of people are breaking them. The Micro gives you better sound quality, bigger harddrive, (great) FM, (good) Recording, and battery replacability for WHEN the battery goes out.I dont care who makes the battery. The only thing the nano has is a little bit better batery life and a solid state hard drive. I still say rotating drives are dependable as long as you dont throw your mp3 player at trees.   I can plug my zen up to my parents computer (with NO creative software on it at all) and swap music, i can switch it to flash drive mode and swap files (I have mine, a 5gig, set up as 4.5gigs music and a .5gig flash drive to store my financial excel stuff and other files. but you can change the setup) This also replaces Flash drives! You can have up to 2 gigs set up, but that means only 3 gigs for songs  I got sony mdr-e10's headphones because the creatives werent cool/good enough. Oh and there is a leather case on ebay from canada with snaps that is very west coast choppers. Its the one thats not krusell. Krusell is for doctors and those silicone things are for children. or you can make a case out of an altoids box, thats also cool. Also motorola makes a wall recharger that has the prongs fold up for the RAZR phone that also recharges the zen without the usb and its tiny too! (the razr and zen have the same 3.7v Lithium battery) The zen takes a USB A - USB mini 5 pin, the same as my cell phone and my camera and radio shack makes a (USB 2.0) retractable cord thats like 4 inches and extends to like 25. But it all depends, they are both good, i just think the micro is better. Plus i got mine refurbished for like 163. creative has them on ebay and i did it that way. mine was 100% brand new. But I also say "Its your money, get what you want!"

<Title>Don't  be fooled by flashy ipods
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When i was looking for an mp3 player,like everyone else i wanted an ipod. Sure they are cool looking, sure they are very small(the nano i mean), and sure they are name brand apple, but who cares! The creative zen 5 gb kicks aplles nano butt! One reason is it holds more. I think it looks cooler and its glow in the dark. You can replace the battery easy, in ipods, u basicallly have to pay them like 100 to 150 dollars to replace a wore out battery. One thing about the nano i hate is that it is so breakable. My friend was fooled and got one, i tried it out, and i accedently dropped it on the floor, a carpet floor, and the screen cracked and now it doesn't work and he has to replace the ipod. Also the damn nano scratches so much, i hold it and it has like 20 handprints and like 10 scratches. The creative zen is durable and light weight and smaller than ipod. Don't be fooled like my friend did. Buy a creative zen micro 5 gb, way better, trust me!

<Title>Definitely worth it!
<Date>Tue Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my Creative Zen Touch Micro about 1 1/2 months ago and I have been in love with it.  I had been wanting an MP3 player for a long time, but had the hardest time deciding what I wanted.  I bounced around from the Ipod, to the IRiver H10, and then suddenly I found this little baby in a magazine.  At first, I just blew it off and said it definitely wasn't for me, but when I saw all the features it had, I definitely became interested...  For $199, it's definitely a good player...  5 GB should be enough for the average music enthusiast, but you can always compress your files (really, who honestly uses all 20 GB?)...   Anyway, the Zen Micro has FM Radio, Voice Recorder, Outlook link-up, and the software that comes with it is so easy to use..  It has endless features and definitely doesn't disappoint...  The only problem your sure to face is that the screen gets greasy and fingerprinty pretty quick, and try to avoid any contact on the screen (scratches), so just get a Skin....  Other than that, there are no complaints here.. Creative did a great job!

<Title>The Reviews are Right!
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my Creative Zen Micro (in white) a few days ago, and I fall in love with it everyday a little bit more!   When I first saw the box it came in, the "actual size" picture is actually almost ONE inch larger than the real thing! It's that tiny and portable! But not too tiny, naturally.   What I Love about My New Zen Micro (that Creative doesn't tell you): 1. The backlight screen fades from a bright, pretty white into the natural grey after your done selecting the buttons. That's really a nice touch.  2. The Zen Micro came with an extra battery! BUT THAT'S NOT ALL--did you know your Zen Micro can charge while connected to the computer's USB? This is not mentioned in the 3-paged 'instructional manual'! Nor on the 'Quick Tips' paper they give you! The same USB plug is used as a power-charger with the adapter, as well as a regular USB port to the computer--now that's cool.  3. THE ZEN MICRO CAN DISPLAY ASIAN LANGUAGE CHARACTERS! If I had known this, I would've bought the Zen Micro a lot faster! Japanese, Korean, and Chinese are all capable of being displayed on the Zen Micro! I listen to a lot of Korean and Japanese songs, and I hate having to romanize the title names, this is a great feature that should be talked about!   4. The extras! You can't beat this low price! With 1 gigabyte more than the I-pod, the ability to play WMA & WAV, a recorder, an FM radio, and ability to use Windows Media Player 10 to sync your items!   Things that I particularly Don't Like about the Zen Micro:  1. The keypad is too sensitive sometimes, even on the'Low' setting--but I'm getting used to it.  2. The software that comes with it seems redundant, and getting the software updates on the Creative website was a little confusing--I'm still not sure if I've corrected my Creative Media Organizer's freezing problem.  3. If you're going to transfer music in Japanese, Korean and Chinese languages all at the same time, it's best to use Windows Media Player, because the Zen Micro can only display the characters you've selected it to show properly at each start of the Organizer program. Even Zen Media Explorer can only display the default language of your computer's fonts (in my case, Japanese).  4. Simple features like "Play All" are weirdly hidden in a menu called "DJ"--and then you must select "Random Play All." Maybe there's a better way?  5. The instructional manual is brief. VERY BRIEF. In 3 languages, it tells you how to turn on your Zen Micro, get it plugged in and charged up. That's about it. Then Creative included a "Quick Tips" sheet with VITAL INFORMATION about how to use the keypad?! That's not a "Tip"--that's instructional information, and needs to be put inside the manual booklet. I was very disappointed with the poor instructions. Having all of the menus written out in an instructional booklet would've helped me a lot instead of getting frustrated trying to find "Play All."  Overall, the Zen Micro is the best bang for your buck! It sounds great, plays 3 file types of music, displays various fonts and languages, is small/stylish/colorful (even though I got the sleek, sophisticated white!), and full of space for over 2,000 songs with its 5 GIGABYTE memory. Getting an I-pod for any Windows user seems pointless at this point, now doesn't it?!

<Content>It is a really nice product. Works as advertised, the DJ function is really nice when you want to try something different. The sync software and firmware that comes with it is out of date and has a battery-life draining glitch, so update immediately once you get your Zen Micro up and running.  Other than that, an excellent item - cheaper than an iPod but worth the value.

<Title>Intruiging accessory for those who don't want an iPod. 
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Often, I have seen iPods around my school. What can I say? They're popular, and everyone has them. But I'm not everyone, and I didn't want an iPod.   For Christmas, my dad got one of the first few Creative Zen Micros in Canada. He gave it to my mom, and I was immediately intruiged. Not only was I the one who listened to music more often, but I was the one who has had two different MP3 players, and one when they had first come out.   I watched my mom use it with ease. She's new to MP3 players; it was her first. She used it with such ease, whether it was adding music, listening to it, or organizing into playlists.   I immediately wanted one. I finally got one when my birthday came around. I've been using it ever since. I've only had one bad experience with it, and it was quite minor. (It froze for me the other day, and I was honestly shocked. Though, it was easily fixed.)  I don't know whether that other reviewer abused his Zen Micro into taking forever to shut down, but mine certainly shuts down quickly. It takes about 3-5 seconds for it to shut down, and it's not a problem.   Playlists can be made, so there's no problem with separating songs. All songs are put into albums, artists and various other listings. It's even got a very nifty "DJ" feature, that allows you to listen to your most-listened to songs, or your least-listened to songs.   I've been telling all of my friends about the Zen Micro, and they've all said that they want it now, when they used to want the iPod mini. They're both trendy, they're both small, but the Zen Micro has not only a better value, or better colour options, but it's made for everyone; techno geek or newbie.

<Title>Love my Zen.
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. Creative did an awesome job with the design. The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. I have the black one and adore it. It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal. I take mine everywhere.

<Title>Review from a mp3 player Virgin
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>That's right...the Zen Micro is the very 1st mp3 player I've owned. I'm a CD kind of girl, with probably 200+ CD's in my collection.  (Since I buy a lot of used CD's, I can usually buy anywhere from 2-3 CD's for the price of a new one.)  I have about 500+ mp3s, but these are usually just for listening to at work or home.  It wasn't until my co-worker bought himself an iPod that I began to consider getting one myself.    I had a few requirements for my mp3 player: 1. It had to be small, compact & lightweight for exercise. 2. I wanted an FM radio. 3. I wanted to be able to change the battery myself. 4. It needed at least 4+ GB storage capacity. 5. It had to be easy to use. 6. I didn't want to get sucked into the world of Apple, where I'm sort of forced to deal with iTunes & weird Apple file formats that only work in Apple hardware & software.  I researched everything out on the market.  I wanted something dependable, with a good reputation, and good support.  This was a major purchase for me.  With 2 kids, car payments & a mortgage, spending $200 on my own personal enjoyment is a HUGE deal.  I came to like what I was hearing about the Zen Micro.  Since Creative is trying to compete with Apple, their product seemed to have everything the iPod was lacking.  It is also PC friendly, catering to the Windows world for us non-Mac users.  Since I use Outlook for my job, I liked that I can sync my Zen with my calendar, tasks, & contacts.  The Zen is shorter than the iPod, although slightly thicker.  (It's slightly smaller than a regular size Altoids mint tin.)  Even though the iPod has a sleek, modern look, the Zen has it's own unique look with the blue backlight trim.  It has a radio with 32 presets and a recorder for voice & radio capture.  The recorder is a handy feature since I'm a writer in my spare time & often get inspiration & ideas faster than I can write them down.  What really sold me on the Zen was that I could change the battery myself.  iPod's internal battery makes it so that in a year or two, I'll have to ship it to Apple & pay them a fee to get a simple battery changed.  That idea completely turned me off.  I just turned 30 yrs old!  I've been changing batteries in things for probably 20-25 of those years.  It's patronizing that Apple feels only THEY should change your iPod's battery in order to get you to pay more $$$$ for a product you already own.  I've also heard bad stories about this process, such as getting your iPod back with all your stored music gone.  So far, I'm loving my Zen.  In the course of a weekend, I was able to upload 431 songs, (roughly 36 CD's).  Ripped at 128kb files, I still have over 3 GB of space available.  I haven't had to read the manual at all.  (I read the little 5 page booklet in the box, but haven't had to brave the 65 page User's Manual.)  While my Zen charged (in just under 3 hours), I installed the software with ease.  I was able to program my Zen & start ripping & transfering music onto it with zero instruction.  The radio works great.  The reception is decent, although sometimes I do get some static for stations that I get just fine in my car.     Things I was happy about:  ~ The sound quality is far better than I expected!  ~ I've had no real problems with my pink Zen Micro.  It worked great straight out of the box.  ~ It looks pretty cool, better than I thought it looked in pics.  While it has a kind of "plastic" look, compared to the iPod's sleek, metallic look, the Zen is still pretty cool looking.  The glowing blue trim lights that pulse off & on when charging give it a sort of alien strobe light effect.  But I noticed my Zen gets a lot of comments & catches people's eye.  Everyone & their grandma has an iPod, which makes the Zen more of a conversation piece because people are curious about it.  *Everyone* at my office, even my boss, wanted to try my Zen out.  (That didn't happen when my co-worker brought his new iPod to work the 1st time.)  ~ I can make my own unique "case" for my ZM out of an Altoids mint tin.  I plan on painting mine & decorating with some cool decals.  I'm an artist, so making a personalized case no one else in the world has really appeals to me.  (Google "Zen Micro Altoids case" or go to the head-fi.org forum for some cool pics & instructions.)   Issues I've had w/ the Zen Micro:  ~ No internal FM Transmitter to broadcast your mp3's onto your car/home stereo!  I thought this feature was included in the standard player, like the iPod. An annoying detail that miffed me a little.  ~ The Earbuds are terrible!!  The earbuds are so "bulbous" & large that they don't fit into my ears at all.  They made my ears sore the 1st day from constantly trying to stuff them back in.  It's all too obvious that I'll have to buy replacements.  If they won't stay in when I'm sitting at my desk, they definitely won't stay in when walking, jogging, or riding my bike.  ~ The battery drains, even when player is switched OFF!!!  This is a well known & documented problem in the Zen Micro.  The Date/Time, sleep/alarm funtions, etc cause the battery to run constantly.  See, the ZM doesn't turn OFF...it's literally always in "Stand By" mode, which causes the battery to run even when it's not in use.  There are several ways to help this though.  Use timer/alarm functions sparingly.  Using the player conservatively helps the battery life.  (i.e. playing at full blast, skipping around constantly, not lowering the LCD lights to minimum setting, etc will run battery down quicker.)  However, the best method is to fully charge the battery, then simply take it out of the player overnight.  This actually turns the player OFF & keeps your battery from draining overnight.  I also plan on updating my firmware regularly (in case they someday patch this problem with software) & buy a 2nd battery to rotate my player with.  (It seems to help to fully charge the battery before 1st use, then play it until it fully drains.  Do this a few times, fully charging then fully depleting the battery.  Once the battery is "primed" this way a few times, it seems to keep a better charge for longer.)  All in all, I gave it 5 stars, despite the 3 issues I had.  These issues are all things that can be worked around.  The iPod has it's own battery issues, however with the Zen, I can at least replace my own battery without having to ship my player off for several weeks.  To me, that alone is worth the 5th star.  I would recommend this product to a friend.  And I would buy another Creative Zen product again in the future.  Actually, I'm thinking of getting my hubby his own Zen Micro so he'll stop stealing mine.  Note:  I do not work for Creative, Apple, or Amazon in any way.  I'm just a regular customer who is enjoying her 30th b-day present very much.  Hope this is helpful to someone else.  ****Update**** 10/18/05 I've owned my Zen for over a month now & it's still working great.  A software upgrade from Creative's website fixed the battery drain problem.  I only have to recharge it once a week, sometimes once every OTHER week.  I have 560 songs on it with just under 3GB of space left.  I keep in an Altoids mint tin, which is nice cause it's protected from getting damaged when I throw it into my purse.  I love it & have had zero problems.

<Title>Seriously the best.
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I started looking for an mp3 player I didn't just follow the trend and get an ipod because it was the cool thing to do. I did my research. I refrenced price and facts. And when it all came down to it.   The Creative Zen Micro was better. I've had my Micro for about 8 months now. I've dropped it countless times. And It still works as good as it did the day I got it in the mail.   On here you'll see a lot of people bitching about the scrolling. But I have to say, it's ridiculously easy to use. My little cousin *who's 6* can use it just as well as I can.   The software that comes with the micro is also ridiculously simple. It's as easy as copy and paste to get songs into your device.  There seriously is no downside to getting the Micro, because on top of everything it's cheeper then it is to get an IPOD of the same size. Not to mention the batteries last longer and cost less to replace.

<Title>A terrific item for your listening pleasure
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is definitely worth the price for its features.  First, the sound quality from the headphones is terrific, considering that they're only little earbud headphones.  I have other pairs of regular headphones from such makers as Sony, and these little headphones have a better sound than most.  The sound is crisp and clear, with the only downfall being that the headphones could use just a little bit more of a bass boost.   Second, the 5gb of room is plenty for me, even with my music library off the player being very large.  I am able to load and delete songs from the player handily using the USB cable and the software that comes with the player (which is very easy to use).  Third, the FM radio, along with its presets, is a terrific idea for an mp3 player, especially knowing that you won't always want to listen to mp3s.  You can also save 32 presets, which is more than most people will be able to use.    Then, as another feature, you can also use the DJ feature to shuffle your entire library.  This is great for times when you need a variety of songs.    This is a terrific player for the money and I would recommend this player to anyone who is looking to stray away from Apple and their iPod, which happens to be mainstreamed only towards iTunes.

<Content>This item has caused me too much frustration. It's a piece of crap backed by a terrible warranty. I've had it for only three months and it's already broken and useless and the company refuses to take responcibility because I told them that I dropped it once. Once. In an effort to fix the problem I told them the truth and it obviously backfired. Stick with the Ipod, at least it has a decent company backing it...

<Title>Great little gadget
<Date>Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Micro for about a month now, I received it as a gift from my boyfriend after he bought his and I mentioned I wanted one too.  I read some people complain about the scroll pad but the truth is that after a couple hours of playing with it (you want to set it to low sensitivity) it's a breeze to use.   No complains about sound quality, its great!  You might want to get a different pair of earbuds as the bundled ones get a bit uncomfortable after wearing them a while.  I was lucky to get the package that had all kinds of accesories but most importantly an AC adapter.  I bought a Rhino skin for my Zen and that keeps it nice and secure plus offers extra grip.  I had to download some firmware from the Creative website in order to get the ZEN explorer application to work.  It was well worth it.  This application lets you rip cds right into the device, create playlists and generally administer the music in your device in a very user friendly environment.  There is another software that is supplied but I never figured out to use it and it was a pain, so the explorer is much easier.  So far, its only frozen once and I think that was my fault because I went click happy.  I had to take out the battery to boot it and after that one time, it hasnt happened again.  It can be a bit slow to respond when you click the FWD or RWD buttons, but maybe that's because I've uploaded so many songs to it.  Design wise, its much more ergonomic that the popular ipods. Even without the Rhino skin, I wasnt afraid it would scratch or lose its nice purple color.  Unlike the mini ipod, the scroll pad is not white and will not get dirty.  The controllers are covered in a non-porous plastic so dirt and grime wont harm them.  The blue backlight is beyond cool, although you might want to set it to a 5 sec lag, as it could use up your battery. I would recommend buying a Rhino Skin to protect your Zen.  Battery life for me is not as advertised.  I get maybe 4-5 hours max.  That was a disappointment.  I give it 4 stars because I had some trouble with the software and the short battery life.  Other than that, I've already recommended this fun device to many friends.

<Content>The reason why I gave the Creative Micro Zen five stars is because it is a really good product. It's better then a lot of other Mp3 players. You pay a lot less for this one then you would with the so-called better ones. And you get more for a cheaper price. It's such a good product that I had to buy my dad one for his birhtday. I don't know how anyone could not want one. They have a lot more colors then the other Mp3 players. This is the best way to listen to music.

<Title>Great Player, BUT...
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent mp3 player for the price!  I did research on creative, apple, sony, etc. and the thing that kept bringing me back to the zen micro was the price with the extra GB of space.  I asked several people I know who have ipods and zen micros what they thought of each of them and they both had pros and cons but the zen micro's price was worth not being trendy.  I have found, like most zen micro owners already have, you must download the new software to the player or the thing isn't any good.  I have also found that it is damn near impossible to find accessories for creative mp3 players anywhere (other than the internet).  I searched high and low and noone could even point me in the right direction.  I have not yet used it to jog with (I will probably write another review once I have) but it is recommended that you don't jog with it.  My final thought is that if you are the type of person who doesn't want to follow the ipod trend or you just don't want to spend the big bucks for something that can't perform any better than the zen micro then you should buy this product right now...if you are the type of person who will be using this thing everywhere you go and will need every accessory for it, either order it all together or get an ipod because you can find ipod accessories in every store you step foot in (with the exception of a liquor store!).  Also, read the rest of the reviews here...they are pretty accurate.

<Title>It does its job & It does it well enough
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After a long and tireful comparison of Zen Micro VS IPod Mini, I ended up buying the Creative Zen Micro.  Well...that may not have been the best choice.  It does what it's supposed to do but it definately has one annoying drawback.  I had the Creative Nomad II a few years ago - which I never had a problem with.  This product's sound quality and other features such as the microphone I greatly enjoyed.  Seeing as the Zen Micro appeared to be an upgraded version, I made my choice.  The Pros: 1) The sound quality.  Even the earbuds it comes with are decent for listening, though I prefer my Sony earbuds as they provide more bass.  There are also several EQ presets or you can set your own.  2) The extra features.  It's a bit annoying to record anything but it works perfectly.  I use Microsoft Outlook so I can easily have a mini version of a PDA.  Though the radio function is lacking in signal, it's a nice option. 3) The program.  I had not one problem with the PC to MP3 Player transfers.  Nor any installation issues. 4) The capacity.  It's plenty for me with my midsize CD collection and various songs purchased from MSN.  I have over 400 songs on it and it isn't even 1/4 full.  The Cons: 1) The player's ability to shut down.  I became horribly frustrated with the stupid little thing when trying to shut it down.  You pull the power button over and the screen says "Shutting Down..." and the backlight goes on, but sometimes that screen never vanishes.  I think I let it sit for 10 minutes and the dang thing didn't shut down.  At least eight times I've had to remove the battery to get it to turn off.  This is horribly annoying when you're in a hurry.  Not to mention that it then goes "Rebuilding library" and makes you sit there even longer.  It returns to the original screen and you have to try shutting it down again.  2) Track playing problems.  Though at the time of transfer my songs went on fine, I find that several of them have glitches that they don't have when played on my computer.  All of a sudden it'll skip a beat or sounds like someone is fast forwarding it.  Though I don't know what is causing this problem, it's not fun when you're into the song.  Overall: I would give it 3 stars because of it's failure to always shut down, but it does its job and it does it well.  This MP3 player does exactly what I wanted it to do - play my music with good sound quality.  4 out of 5

<Title>incredible
<Date>Sun Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>well i have been saving up to but one and eventually i got one!!!  Zen micro's are amazing. they can hold so many songs just for 5 gb. and that is more that the apple ipod.. because a 5 gb apple ipod can only store about 1200.. well the zen can store 2500 songs and they are around the same price... no infact i got mine for 25000/= shillings!!! yeah in kenya.. and the other 5gb was 30000/= shillings.. and if you get the zen you get a much better deal.. so i advise anyone who reads this:  to get a zen... they come with more accesories but the extra accesories are hard to find!!!  good luck

<Title>Nice, but doesn't support directories
<Date>Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This device has great sound, but...  It doesn't support subdirectories.  So all songs have to go into a single flat directory.  For me this is a major inconvenience.  I like to separate jazz, pops, classical, recorded books, etc.  And, when you connect it to a computer, it doesn't appear as a normal directory, so you can't use it for data files.  This is the sort of info that you can't determine from the product description.  You have to buy it to find out.

<Title>Zen-sational
<Date>Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the Creative Zen Micro (5 MB) for about 6 months and in a word, it is outstanding. When researching MP3 players, it really came down to the iPOD vs. the Zen Micro, but the features of the Zen won me over. First and foremost, the sound quality is MUCH better than the iPOD, which after all is why we are listening in the first place. I have listened to both with the same headphones and can hear a significant difference. Second, I found the touch controls and user interface much better and more intuitive than the iPOD. Finally, updates to the firmware have made it simple to buy/download music from ANY service and import into the Zen.   Updates to the software have improved over the months and the end product is fairly straightforward and easy to use. And, despite what one reviewer said, it is really easy to make folders (i.e. playlists) to sort your catalog into multiple groups according to your mood or activity.   I like the feature of having a radio tuner, though I admit I don't use it that much. I have found the signal needs to be fairly strong, so if you are in a more rural area, you may be a little disappointed.   Taking everything together, the Zen Micro is a great buy and is loaded with features for the money (appointment calendar, alarm, etc.) but more than the value, you'll be impressed, like I was, with the sound quality.

<Title>totally sweet!!!
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Good stuff!! this little guy ousts all other players by far.  It's cooler looking, has a better battery system (interchangable), a supperior touch pad, and a more accesable library and interface than other players.  i prefer it over the i-pod specifically becuase of the battery capabilities - no service charge to buy and change the battery.  great sound quality, sufficient volume, impressive equalizer funcions, and the extera functions are deffinately an added bonus.  the radio has some trouble on fine tuning the reception, but overall, the function is enjoyable and worth average reception.       a great buy.  sastisfactory in all of its aspects. long lasting and durrable, and even usefull for other tasks other than just music (flash drive, calendar, planner)  (might i reccomend green, it's really cool looking with the added glow light)

<Title>Pretty in Pink!
<Date>Thu Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the pink Creative Zen Micro 5gb about 3 months ago and I have had no difficulties with it so far. PROS: It sounds Great!  Soo cute in pink (with blue backlight..yay).  I love it because I just get all my songs for $6.99 a month from Yahoo! Music Unlimited and upload them to my mp3 player (reallyy convenient...it beats paying .99 cents a song for Itunes..)  I really do love it.  You can buy a new battery for it once yours goes dead (IPOD's must be sent to the Apple Store for $100 to get a new battery installed in it...that sucks..)    However, CONS: the ear plugs are horrible...dont even try to keep these around.      Overall, I would still buy it today if I had to make the decision all over again.

<Title>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS THING?!
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had a life of crisis with my Mp3 players. First I got a Virgin Player 5GB. Worked for about three months.  So, I got a little Zen Micro. I heard they were pretty good.   Installation wasn't really any major problem. I got it up and running pretty quickly, charged it for about 3 hours, then loaded my songs onto it.  I wasn't really used to the touch pad the Zen Micro has. Anyone who has owned an iPod will be sort of familiar with it. I found it very annoying since I had used a button pad on my Virgin Player.  It took me a long time to get used to the touch pad. About a week, which in my mind is too long to learn to control an Mp3 player.   After about half a month of use, the problems started.  One day I was charging my Micro by hooking it up to my computer via the connection cable. I left it alone for a couple hours. Then I came back and it was making this weird buzzing sound. I looked on the screen and it read, "Hardware problem."   I got a return authorization from Creative so I sent it to them and they sent me a new one.   Again, about half a month later, I saw the words "Hardware problem" on my Zen Micro's screen.  I got ANOTHER return authorization so now I'm on my third one. I was on vacation at the beach and I carelessly went in the ocean with it in my pocket. I know, it was stupid of me, but actually my Zen Micro deserved it.  It was only a couple seconds of being in the ocean when I realized my Zen Micro was in my pocket. I immediately rushed out.  Some Mp3s will work if you get a little water in them. This one was broken for about a month.   One day I tried customer service and got it working again. I was like, "Oh, joy, I got my Zen Micro working again."   By now, I was wanting to smash this thing with a hammer. It was with great hesitation that I decided to use it again.  Just to make sure, I got a THIRD return authorization and they sent me yet another Zen Micro.   Three days later--"Hardware problem."  My fourth return authorization they denied. I guess they got tired of caring for my carelessly made Zen Micro.  Now, the only problem is thinking of a way to destroy the player. Should I fry it? Should I put it in pizza dough and make a pizza? Should I pour gasoline over it and then throw a lit match onto it? I'm not sure, I still haven't decided.  The only joy you will get out of this player is massacring it after the fourth return authorization.   I will never buy another Creative product again.

<Title>Best Value in the Land of Un-iPOD!
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Micro is near perfect.   I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.   I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips. It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers. It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered. It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.   All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync. So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player. The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... charm. When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.   It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip! Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.   My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy. It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it. over and over again. But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch. I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.   The accesories that come with the player are great. White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag. Also all the required cables and what not. To me, currently at $218, this player is a best in class. It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.   Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.   Pick your favorite color and buy it.

<Title>Best investment for portable audio ever.....
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Purchased not 1 but 2 Creative Zen Micro's for anniversary gifts.  Extremely pleased with the units after we loaded all the necessary firmware and updates to "Plays for Sure" specs.  Took a few tries and eventually called Creative for help.  Customer Service is outstanding - had our problems corrected in minutes.  Had to call Napster for assistance also, their Customer Service was outstanding also, our problems once again were corrected in minutes.  Devices are small, portable, easy to use and sound quality is excellent.  Battery life is good - no strange battery drains or anything.  Units charge up nicely.  Only wish they had as many accessories as I-Pod has (portable speakers, reasonably priced portable items to work with car stereos, etc).  Only problem, hard to find a truly decent sports case for this unit without spending more than $20.00.  Body Glove makes a sports case at $40.00'ish.....  Only bad item is the enclosed belt clip, the clip is not strong enough and the unit slides around whatever it is fastened to.

<Title>I tried it three times... finally gave up
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I LOVED my Zen Micro!  It was easy to set up, easy to load and easy to use.  I took it to work everyday for two months.  Then I started having the same problems a lot of people have been talking about- the screen freezing and the buzzing noises. Sent it back to Creative, got a new one right away.  Another two months, another frozen screen and more buzzing.  Sent it back.  Got a new one. Three months. Same thing. Tried it one more time (I really loved that little gadget!) Another two months and the same old song.   Now they want to charge me for a new one!   Argh!   If your Creavtive Zen Micro works, cherish it.  Because there are a lot of malfunctioning ones out there!

<Title>Great Player 
<Date>Fri Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yes I'm sure you've heard it all before people raving about the Zen Micro but you ignored it right, because it's not an i pod.  Well for those of us who are over the hype and just want to buy a player that works with wma or mp3 music not to mention has a host of other great features, meet your new best friend the Zen Micro.  I have the silver Zen 5 gb and have spent about two weeks with it and I love it!  I have seen that people wrote that the vertical touch pad and touch sensitive controls are impossible or very difficult to use.  It's not impossible but you do need to give it more than five minutes to get used to.  The settings for the touch sensitivy can be adjusted to the preference of each user, I currently have mine set on low and after less than an hour of playing with the controls I felt like a pro.  The one thing that you do want to purchase with Zen Micro is a good set of headphones cause the ones that come in the box are in a word, crap.  Plus, then you can fully appreciate the great sound pumped out by this tiny Mp3 player.  The player fits comfortably in my hand and the vertical touch pad, to me makes more sense than going around in circles.  My favorite feature right now is the DJ: Random play all, so the player takes all the music loaded and plays in random order.  You can also create playlists on the go, which is helpful when you have 800+ songs and just want to hear a select few.  I went from the creative Muvo TX FM 256 to the 5gb Zen micro and the amount of music and features that you can cram into a small package blew me away.  I loved my old player, the problem: I really wanted a player that would hold all my music.  I will say this, that comparing the I pod and the Zen Micro is like comparing apples and oranges, just can't or shouldn't be done.  If you have all your music on iTunes then for you the I pod makes sense.  If you have your music in the wma, mp3 etc formats and use a windows friendly music service then try the Zen Micro.  I really could go on about all the features but the specs are there check them out.  I just really love this player and wanted to share!

<Title>A Good "Poor Man's iPod"
<Date>Fri Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It actually has a lot more than an iPod Mini, and for less cost.  FM Radio, Voice Recorder, Datebook, it's definitely a nice little item.  The software is really nice, it's easy to use.  I do have a few complaints.  The biggest problem being a high-pitched whine if I ever skip to another song.  It's not really loud, though.  The earbuds aren't that great, besides looking like iPod rip-off buds, they begin to lose sound quality pretty quickly.  Overall, I'd suggest to anyone to buy it.  iPods are just way to commercial, and therefore way too expensive for what you get.

<Title>Good player but....
<Date>Fri Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall, it has been a good player.  I have a few gripes though.   1) lack of accessories -- hopefully this will change, but I've owned this thing for 6 months and just recently found an arm band that "somewhat" fits it.   2) Battery life - the battery does not last very long at all 3) malfunction - the player cuts in and out and requires me to move the headphones around quite a bit.  i hear creative will replace it quickly, but I hate to have to reload the player and to go without it for however long it takes.  Plus the pain of having to ship it.  Other than these gripes, it has been a good player with a decent user interface.

<Date>Fri Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wanted to get an MP3 player that was not an Ipod.  I didn't want to get locked into the Apple file system format. So, after looking into various options I purchased the zen micro.  It worked great for about 3 days after the warranty expired.  Had a problem with the earphone jack. (This is a well documented problem; you may check Creative's web site for more info.)    I sent the Micro back, had to pay $40 since it was out of warranty.  They sent me a refurbished one.  It lasted less than a month.  Got a "Hardware Problem" icon on the player.  Tried various things to revive it.  Contacted e mail support.  They tried to give advice. Nothing worked.  I then contacted them by phone just to get an authorization so I could return the 2nd player.  They said they couldn't talk to me unless I paid $20--just to talk to them...amazing...  Anyway, here I am with a dead micro.  I am still waiting for Creative to get back to me so I can give send them this one back...assuming I want to pay another $40 just for them to look at it.  Should have bought an ipod.  I will steer clear of all Creative Products in the future.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am not super technical, but I know enough that this is a great player.  The face controls can be touchy, but the lock feature makes up for that.  The sound is pure with a broad range.  The headphones are pretty basic so I bought a better pair, but otherwise I have really enjoyed the Zen.  One problem is the charger unit.  It comes apart (I suspect for changing the prong unit for international use) and if one is not careful you can find yourself without a way to charge the unit back up again.  Otherwise I would HIGHLY recommend this unit.

<Content>Anyone shopping for an MP3 player really needs to look at this product before any purchase.  I've heard the Apple unit as well and if ease of operation and sound quality at a great price are important to you, this unit cannot be beaten.  It also includes the option to record directly from the FM tuner in the unit.  This is what you would call a 'value' purchase and I recommend it unequivocally.
