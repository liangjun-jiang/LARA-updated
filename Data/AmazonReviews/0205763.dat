<Product Name>RCA Mp3 Player 512mb With Interchangeable Colors
<Title>An amazingly courteous player
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I picked one of these RCA 200's up to serve as a "stop-gap" player while I waited for a Toshiba Gigabeat:  I wanted something that could play Audible content out of the box, take a lot of abuse, and basically serve as a player in situations I wouldn't want to drag an expensive player into.  I wasn't expecting much out of it from the display box (it was cheaper than a Shuffle), but I've got to say: I've been thoroughly impressed.  The system weighs almost nothing, even with the battery installed, but still feels fairly solid, with nice hard buttons that provide a satisfying "click."  It comes with four faceplates/battery-covers in different colors, which secure tight to the unit and serve as ready-replacements if you manage to crack the casing (I put it through its paces, and the Black is now thoroughly scuffed but still fits taut).  The OLED display (blue on black background) is extremely bright and easy to read under all conditions, and serves as a passable display for navigating tracks.  Even the interface is well designed: it separates audiobooks from regular tracks right on the main menu, so Audible junkies don't have to search for their tracks (something my Zen never did).  My only complaint here is the player segregates music tracks on the SD card from tracks on the main memory, so I occasionally had to go hunting for a song.  But the player really shines in the small touches.  Everything is included: a lanyard, faceplates, earbud headphones, a mini-usb cable, battery, and a surprisingly well-made armband.  The player supports SD cards (a fact that wasn't even mentioned on the packaging).  When plugged in, the unit powers off of the USB port, and XP recognized both the player's memory and the SD card in it as volumes, so I could drag and drop music onto it without messing around in MusicMatch.  Audible supported it right out of the box (it was a great change of pace from the firmware updates I'd gone through with the Zen Micro).  The playback is passable: the audio is good, and the display is informative, but when you fast forward, the player doesn't update the display for a few seconds (which is a pain when you're trying to find your place in an eight-hour book).  There's no explicit bookmark feature, but the player does remember your place in a book when you want to switch over to music for a while.  I wouldn't recommend this to any audiophile or someone with a large music collection as their primary player: spend a few extra bucks and get a low-end iRiver or an iPod Nano so you get the niceties of a full-size display, better navigation, extra space, and rechargability.  But if you're looking for a player that can take a beating on a trip, happen to be particularly harsh on your equipment during workouts, or just need a player to tide you over for a few weeks and won't regret having around afterwards, the RCA's a great choice.

<Title>great product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great product compared to my now dead IPod Mini.  It froze all the time and died 11 months after purchase.  This has nice earbuds and a high quality armband.  The OLED display is bright and looks good.  I have had mine for over a month and no problems so far.  I recommend going to Target where for $80 you get twice the storage(this is a 512 MB version) and an RCA fm transmitter.  I highly recommend this product.

<Title>OK, I guess, for short pieces.

<Content>Pro: inexpensive.  Secure digital card slot.  Sound is OK.  Con:  About 1/3 of the time I can't turn it on without popping the battery out and back in.  I don't know if this is common or mine just has a defect.  Menus are a little cumbersome to navigate.  Most serious to me is that this player will lose it's place in a file if the player is turned off.  This would not be a problem for someone listening to pop music.  I use my player to listen to speech.  A typical file I will listen to will be one to two hours long.  I do _not_ want to have to memorize where I left off, and find it again with with fast forward.

<Title>Best MP3 Player For Under 75$
<Date>Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is THE best MP3 player if you want an entry-level or inexpensive player. The expandable SD slot makes it super cheap to expand the memory by 5 times. I've had it over a month, and use it every day while walking to or from class, or in the computer lab at school, the grocery store etc.  (PROS:) -It does all the simple things you need it to do, very cheap.       -Light and small, fits easily in my jeans pocket. Much smaller than                          than my wallet       -Bright display, pretty easy to navigate.       -Has an expansion for an SD card to increase the memory (I bought a                                               1 gigabyte card online for only $7.99!)       - No special software needed, it is just like an external drive, just drag and drop your MP3s from your PC right onto the player.  (CONS:) -Ear-buds COULD be better. The ones what come with it are good, but I used my girlfriends old Ipod ear-buds and it does sound better with them. Might be worth it to you to invest on a good pair of earbuds          -Not from personal experience, but I have read that it will not read a 2 gig SD card, only 1 gig.  Lastly, there is a version of this product sold which doesn't include neck or wrist strap which is 20$ cheaper, thats what I bought.

<Title>MP3 Player from RCA Model M2000 with 512 MB SD Card Slot
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got an RCA Lyra RD 1076 512MB at Christmas. The unit was DOA and never powered up so Thomson sent me the M2000 512 as replacement. Believe it or not the new unit wouldn't turn on either. Of course we tried new batteries, reversing the battery, battery tester and holding the on button for over a minute. I was sent another identical replacement unit. This one consumes a brand new energizer or duracell battery in less than an hour. When you remove the battery and put in a tester, it still reads very good! So this one is also being replaced. I went with the RCA because I keep everything on SD Cards. I like the looks and feel of the unit. When it worked, I had no complaints. Support has been responsive. Judging from the other reviews it looks like I have just had a bad run of luck.

<Title>Okay of an mp3 player....
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this back in Feburary. Along with a few SD cards. Pros: Nice cheap 256 Mp3 player I got at Walmart.. especially with an expandable SD Slot card to increase it dramatically which was the reason to buy it. Nice menus, and as for audio books, you can get to play where you left off.  Cons: This 256MB mp3 player is a bit slow when it comes to switching music mp3 tracks. Sometimes after a few months or at least two of usage, sometimes the player won't read the SD cards which you may have to either restart it or turn off the player, take the card out and then back in, turn on for the card to be read again. I couldn't tell if it was the SD Card or the player problem.  Overall, it's a fair mp3 player if you don't want to spend much money.
