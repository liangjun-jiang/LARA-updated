<Title>WAY better than the competition!
<Date>Mon Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I first purchased the RIO sports mp3 player (the red one).  Anyway, it was a piece of junk.  I took it back and got this one!  This thing is the best! the detachable portion that holds the battery is replaceable, which means if you drop it, most likely it will fall on the detachable battery until and leave your player in tact.  I just can't say enough about this player,, in the 50 hours of use I have used it, I have not had one problem!  It has suffered swet, drops and general abuse and has held up wonderfully!

<Content>I bought this MP3 Player looking for something light and with a good capacity hard drive. It's durable, stylish, and easy to use, and it still worked after I left it in my pocket and it went through a load of laundry! What more could u ask for??

<Title>Light-weight, stylish, versatile
<Date>Wed Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have always wanted to have a MP3 player + USB Flash drive combo. Creative Muvo was a step in that direction, but it had its drawbacks: cheap plastiky look, max memory of 128MB, no LCD.<br>Then along came Muvo NX with all these issues fixed. One of the best things you'll like about this player is that it does not require any drivers on the Windows 2K/XP (maybe other versions also but I haven't checked). So you can practically work off any computer. Just drag and drop your MP3 or WMA into the player and you are all set...<br>It sounds great and is light-weight enough to put in your shirt pocket and not feel it. At 256MB storage capacity, I can simultaneously have sufficent number of songs on the player to last me a long trip as well as have a number of work-related documents to carry between workplace and home.<br><br>You will need to get a good headset, though. The earphones that come in the box are uncomfortable and slippery and would just not stay in the ears.

<Title>Great little player- but......
<Date>Thu Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>WARNING! Please read the last paragraph.<p>I purchased this product about 35 days ago, and it was love at first sight. Sleek, ultra compact, an LCD screen and a built in voice recorder - what more could you ask for? Well, i'll get to that. <p>The LCD is a great addition to the Muvo and with it comes quite a few surprising features such as a 5 band equalizer and idle timer. The display is clear, and menu is easy to navigate using the rocker, which doubles as a track changer and fast forward. Keeping the volume controls seperate is a good idea, since they're the things you use the most. Switching on and off is painless, although controlled by the play pause button - holding it down for a time will turn it off or on, and just hitting it once will play or pause. <p>Data transfer is a breeze. You plug the stick into the nearest usb port on your computer and you can transfer songs within a second. At least on XP - i don't know about other windows versions, but i think it's the same with 2000. I'm not sure it's very useful if you have 98se2. Data transfer is slow though. Even slower than the previous model infact, but not inhibiting - it transfers and average song in 5-10 seconds, no particularly good, but I don't think many people will see it as a problem. <p>Battery life is average. One duracell ultra M3 lasted for about 2 days, with quite heavy usage.<p>The voice recorder is great, with an average range, and 8hrs of recording when the memory is empty. Perfect for Journalism - it's that good. The music sounds crystal clear, with several preset EQ levels or your own custom 5 band. <br>Using it as USB pen memory works perfectly too - you can put any type of file on it.<p>Memory. Not so good - 128mb is really not much to play around with, especially when you prefer quality over size, and the realistic number of songs you are going to fit on it is 35 - which according to me is alright for a day, but no longer - 2CD's? <p>So, overall good, but serioiusly lacking in memory and USB 2.0 compatability which is why it didn't get 5 stars. <p>However....WARNING!!!! It lasted 35 days. I dropped it once in the first week, but treated it pretty well after that, and on the 35th day - nothing. Would'nt turn on at all. Battery changed several times. Nothing. It wouldn't even work when plugged into the USB. Notice it broke 5 days after the warranty ran out. Great. So, it's cool, but beware - yours may have a fault too...(I also heard of the same problem with the orginal Muvo...)

<Title>Plays tracks in alphanumeric order
<Date>Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a great MP3/WMA player with one glaring deficiency: It insists on playing the songs in alphanumerical order by track title. The manual states this, customer support verified it and I couldn't find a reasonable work-around, so it went back. Sure you can manually move from one song to another as they play, but if you want to load an entire CD and listen to the songs in the order in which you're accustomed, it won't do it without interaction. In my opinion, this is a colossal design flaw. The original MuVo 64 and 128 will play the tracks in the order which you load them but not this one. If that won't bother you, the MuVo NX is the one to get.

<Title>Be careful!
<Date>Sat Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is nice and convenient unit. As you know it doubles as flash drive and makes it easier for you to move files and music from different computers. 128 MB of memory is adequate, if you looking for more then try iPod or some other hard drive based MP3 players. <p>However, only buy this from places that offer unconditional money back guarantee return policy. I bought one unit and it would not power up. In addition, the earphones were uneven in length. The right earphone was 3 times as long as left one making it awkward to listen to music. As I was exchanging the player I heard customer service representative saying how this is second one she had today with the same problem, it would not power up at all. I exchanged the faulty unit and got the one that works just fine but the earphones came uneven in length again. Somebody is sleeping at quality control department. So be careful and ready to exchange or return this product. It might be worth it to buy product replacement plan for this product if you decide to get one.<p>This is definitely useful gadget that makes life more pleasant so I will keep mine. .

<Title>Great Gadget
<Date>Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>First thing first: this is a portable drive &quot;that has a MP3 playback ability&quot;<p>With that said, if you are looking for a MP3 Player, buy an actual MP3 player that is designed for that performance.<p>The unit has a USB port on it, so there aren't any undesired long plugs that needs to go around. However, since the unit package doesn't come with an USB extension, for desktop users that only have USB ports on the back of the computer might be inconvinient.<p>One review for this device suggested &quot;the headphone uneven&quot; issue. One side of the head phone is suppose to go behind your neck so that you don't have a headphone line go straight down the middle.<p>The sound issue is something that I can't understand either. I use this device on the streets of New York City, the busiest city in the world, and I didn't have any problem with the volume. I don't know how loud you might want it, but if you plug in more sophisticated headset, the sound quality will definitely improve.<p>Do not format this device. Then it will loose all MP3 playback capabilities. You can delete and drag-drop files anyway you want it, but you will need to use the program that Creative Labs provide, which is called &quot;Initializer&quot; to format the device.<p>It's a pain to use the program that they provide with, since I'm not familiar with it at all. This will force you to only listen to songs in alphabetical order OR random, in my case. So, that's a minus.<p>One definite plus. For many non-alphabat users, this unit will be great, since it's able to display East-Asian characters, such as Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc. A lot of other units don't do that, but you will get that capability with this device.<p>Overall, I recommend. But I wanted a &quot;all-in-one&quot; device, which this device was perfect for. For music playing, storage, portability. Great buy.

<Content>I have my MuVo NX 128MB for 6 weeks now and I can't fault it.<p>I find it strange that the 256MB version of this product gets 5 stars and this 128MB version gets 3. It's the same product with a different memory configuration.<p>I see one user , Emir complaining about the uneven length of the earphones. This is normal. The longer one is supposed to go behind your neck. I've seen this with Sony & Sennheiser earphones too.<p>I also see someone else complaining about the sound quality. This unit has a Signal To Noise Ration of 98dB. This is much hihger than any other MP3 player. If the music doesn't sound good then the chances are that it's your MP3 recording which is at fault.

<Title>Volume Problems
<Date>Sat Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This product worked great for the first 3 weeks. Now, the sound cuts off unless I lower the volume. I assumed that my MP3's were clipping or over modulating so I re-ripped them using the normalize feature. No change. I have to lower the volume to almost half in order for the music to NOT cut out mid song. With these dinky headphones, I can hardly hear anything.<p>Also, it takes a single AAA battery which dies very quickly.<p>The size is great. The data storage is great. The voice recorder is adequate. But I think I would rather have a hard drive based player. I got mine on sale but the retail price is WAY too much for this product to be worth the purchase.

<Title>Excellent Product!
<Date>Fri Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you want a compact, high fidelity, and easy to use MP3 player, this is the way to go.  It is incredibly easy to use, you just pop it in you usb port and drag and drop the files you want onto it.  It also has excellent sound qualitiy (Except for the provided ear buds.  I upgraded to new ones.)  It can hold about 28 WMA songs at cd transparency quality, which is very high fidelity sound.  If you dont want good quality sound, you could compress the songs and get about 40 or 50 on there easily. It is also one of or the smallest player on the market, so its good for joggin, running, etc.  The only drawback is the expansion, but it's not the most important thing.I would recommend this product to anyone who loves portability, sound quality, and an all around good product!

<Title>Very Nice -- While It Lasts
<Date>Sun Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great product while it works. It is compact, reliable, and easy to use (just drag your music files to the player as if it were a removable disk drive). <p>But beware: it WILL fail. Be sure you buy from a store that gives a convenient money-back or exchange policy that lasts more than a few months. I had three MuVos of various sizes and configurations and ALL failed completely within a year -- one within two months. Once your player fails you are pretty much out of luck. Creative support is almost non-existent; but if you can track it down you will have to pay $20 to have them &quot;look at it&quot; and ultimately nearly $80 to replace it. In this product's defense, it could be pointed out that many MP3 players have a limited lifetime (e.g. even the iPod's batteries run down within a couple years and are costly or impossible to replace) so it could be argued that product failure is not in itself a reason to avoid this product (that's why it doesn't get just one star). But the MuVo just doesn't last long enough to be worth the price.

<Title>Throw the packaging away when you receive this item!
<Date>Sat Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This MP3 is AWESOME!  It also doubles as a mass storage device.  I particularly like the fact that you can put ANY music format on it.  I put FIVE albums with .wma format, and listen for hours with one battery (I usually don't crank the volume past 21).  Emir Causevic rated some problems with the device, but the solutions follow:  First, you have to PRESS &amp; HOLD the play button to power the device up.  Same to power it down.  This protects against inadvertant operation.  Second, the earphones are SUPPOSED to come different length, because when you wear the device on your arm, the distance to the further ear is greater, so the extended cord reaches over, so you don't have excessive cord dangling about.  Comes with arm band and red AND silver casing.  This MP3 ROCKS!!!

<Title>Great player but drains batteries
<Date>Tue Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a really good MP3 player &amp; USB storage device.  I bought the previous version and this one with the LCD display is so much more useful.<br>The only problem is that it constantly drains the battery (a problem with the previous version also) even when the player is off.  So if you don't use it for a while and leave the battery in it, you will find that the battery has less &quot;juice&quot; or is completely drained (for you geeks: it draws 700uA to 800uA in the<br>&quot;off&quot; state).  I would guess that it's because Creative is using an electronic &quot;power&quot; switch instead of a mechanical one....poor choice.  Just remember to take the battery out when not in use!

<Title>a happy balance
<Date>Fri Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i've owned the device for 5 mo now, and it's done a beautiful job as a &quot;walkman&quot; and a usb storage device (ppt files, etc.).  having read every review on amazon, i was a bit concerned about the 'lasting quality' of the device, but i haven't had any trouble, even after having dropped it a few times.  the factory headphs are undeniably bad; i bought a pair of sennheiser mx500s as a replacement.  the irivers obviously have a solid reputation when it comes to these &quot;compact mp3&quot; players, but i couldn't deal with having another connecting cable (from mp3 player-&gt;computer) on my desk.  the built-in plug on the muvo and its size just makes it an all around convenient little gadget.  to echo a previous reviewer, if you're concerned about the 'order' of your uploaded songs, use the &quot;copy to device&quot; function in windows media player.  oh and for those that are just doing +/-30-min workouts, 128mb is more than enough storage space.  <p>finally, if you're really paranoid about warranties, etc. look into your credit card options - visa (platinum) said it would double the manufacturer's warranty, so that took my muvo from 3-&gt;6 mos.  if that's still not enough for you, then look into buying an iriver from best buy and purchasing the additional 1-2yr coverage direct through best buy.

<Title>Good, but flawed
<Date>Tue Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The MuVo NX is the big brother to the MuVo NOMAD. The new features included make using this MP3 player an absolute breeze. There's now an LCD screen with backlight, which, despite the odd inaccuracy with the timing and the average brightness of the light makes selecting songs much easier. There's even a high quality EQ system, which allows you to use a custom EQ setting or a preset. The microphone comes in handy, though the 8-bit quality means bootlegs are out of the question! It's also much easier to navigate your music files, and a copy of Creative MediaSource is even thrown in which is superb for ripping and recording. The batteries last ages, though the backlight, EQ and jog dial tend to drain them quicker. The player can also be used as a flash drive - those used to floppy disks know the relief this brings. The 128MB is not huge, but you can squeeze on about 40-45 MP3s. Just the size of the player alone is one aesthetic quality that prompted me to buy it (apart from being a previous Creative NOMAD user).<br>However, the sound quality is not amazing through the standard issue headphones, and they quickly die out being so delicate. There also seems to be a common glitch with most of the NX users I know that results in a sound cut-out if the player is put down in a certain way - possibly a poor quality eadphone connection. Creative have also done away with the handy neck-cord - instead, an armband contraption is thrown in that is absolutely no use to me. The jog-dial - despite being better than the tiny switches on the NOMAD - is far too delicate.

<Title>Fragile and bad sound
<Date>Thu Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this player a week ago, when I opened the box I was suprised for all the stuffes that comes with it...software, belt, two colors battery bases, etc.  I plugged it in my portable and copied some music.  The sound was not good enough ( if you compare this with the RCA Lyra's one for instance ) , I tried by setting the equalizer but it did not make big difference.  Some time later it started to sound worse, one channel was unavailabled because I could barely hear the singers in the song. I thought in replace it with a new one, but I asked for my money back instead.  It's a really weak player, it seems more like a memory stick than a real MP3 player.  I love music, and a like listen it very loud with my headphones or my car stereo, and this "thumb-drive" doesn't work for that.

<Content>This is a great little gadget at a good price. Thumbdrives are replacing floppies and the fact this has that options is great.  Just pop it in the USB port and bam, a new drive pops up on "my computer." The folder options is a plus but can be better. It only recognize up to one subfolder level. The size is incredibly small and yet they still managed to offer an LCD screen with the song title rollin. Unfortunately, my headphones were a waste, I never even listened with them because they were stuck together at an unbalance point. Or in other words they just cheap, so use some other headphones. I definately recommend this product.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player

<Content>I purchased a Creative MuVo 128 NX about six months ago.  Since then it has seen moderate use (2-3 hours a week) and I have no complaints.  You get just what it says: a truly tiny MP3 player that holds a couple hours worth of songs.  Also, the player is so light that you won't notice it while running/walking.  Pros:    - tiny size and light weight    - decent battery life (approx. 9 hours per AAA)    - ease of use    - several play modes (shuffle, repeat, etc)    - voice recorder    - plugs directly into USB port for file transfer  Cons:    - 128 MB only holds a couple hours of songs    - no built-in FM tuner (available on other models)    - horrible provided headphones  Notes:   I have "outgrown" this player and upgraded to the MuVo 512 TX FM.  You'll be suprised at how quickly 128 MB fills up.
