<Title>Good enough...
<Date>Wed Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I saw that this player had some good reviews elsewhere.  For the money it is a pretty good player and it looks sharp. I bought a pair for my wife and I. Although, I already see some issues I am going to have with it.  As far as music goes, it will play just fine and has an onboard speaker you can turn on and off, so if that is all you care about then it will be a good player for you. While it does play video well (when you can get one converted) and the picture is clear, this is NOT an MP4 player.    All video must be converted into .SMV format, an obscure codec used for SigmaTel chips like the one in this player. The video conversion software that comes with the player is junk.  It converts maybe 1 out of every 15 videos I have tried.  So far I have had no luck with large video files at all.  It advertises that it will convert MOST videos.  Well, it will convert SOME mpegs. So far no AVI, no MP4, no quicktime, etc. I am pretty savvy about video and conversion, etc and there does not seem to be any other software out there that will work.  I called tech support and they were very nice but did not resolve my issue.  Same issue with two different players, two different computers, two different software discs.  Mach Speed must know this is an issue...   You definitely need to read the manual or you will not be able to figure out some of the functions. Many of the negative reviews I have read about this player could have been avoided if people just read the thing to begin with before they had a fit.  Ebooks seem to work ok on the player.  Photos are good too.   Another issue is that it charges and transfers files pretty slow like it is not USB 2.0. Updated the firmware and no improvement.  Maybe its the cable.  My old mp3 player loaded at least twice as fast and it was as basic as you can get.    While this is not an Ipod, Creative, Sandisk, etc, it also costs nowhere near as much.  Just as a 1gb mp3 player its decent enough.  The video was a main feature on this player and its shortcomings have left me pretty disappointed. I am debating whether or not to RMA this one and cough up another $20 for something better.  Then again maybe they will update the software or make a work around as it is not the player's fault, but the software that is the weak link.

<Title>Great Price for a Great Product

<Content>This product is small enough to carry  on the go yet the nice size screen is  plenty big enough to listen to music,  watch videos, view pictures, and use  the voice recorder. The only thing i  need to caution you about is that the  format itunes videos are in do not  corespond with the formats offered by  this player. Other than that this player  is the perfect versitil mp3 player for  anyone that is looking for a good buy.

<Title>DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just bought this from Fry's 6 hours ago and have already returned it!  Played one song, then crashed. Wouldn't play after that.  Oh, and this is to be expected: Instructions with the product give you the protocol about what to do when it freezes!!!!!  Good luck if you buy this!
