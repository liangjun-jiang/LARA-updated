<Title>simple but useful
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a long commute and now use this solely for Audiobooks and it is perfect for such a use.  When I first bought it I intended it to be used for my morning jogs but I decided that I wanted something that held more so I wouldn't have to constantly update it according to how I felt that morning.  However, that is pure laziness as it takes seconds to update.  The battery life is also more than sufficient.  I don't know about other 256 MB MP3 players but this one seems great to me

<Title>A great starter/responsibility tester
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player was everything that it said it was. My daughter wanted an expensive MP3 player but I wanted to see if she could keep from loosing it. She hasn't lost it yet. I really like the fact that this comes with the FM radio... they all should. I say starter in my title because with the limited memory it does not hold many songs. Another benifit to the FM radio..

<Title>Not too impressed...
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this unit for almost a year, and there are things I like about it and things I don't like...  Pros:  -good sound for the small size -good price -easy to use -I like the clip; I can prop it up on my desk.  Cons: -battery life is nowhere near 15 hrs -when I do change the battery, it resets and I have to skip around to find the song I was listening to. -putting it on shuffle or skipping through uses up the battery more.  I am planning on getting a SanDisk with a larger capacity; I am hoping it will work better for me.

<Title>MuVo TX 256 MP3 player - broken usb connector
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I saw another review with a broken usb connector problem. It happened to my MuVo too. The connector is not really broken but is cleanly separated from the player (and attaches firmly to the battery unit). My MuVo player is now completely useless. The CL "Award winnging customer service" web site has no address or phone number to call for repair. Needless to say, CR loses me as a customer.

<Title>For Beginners
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this about 2 years ago, when it was first released and very expensive. It is still the only MP3 player I have ever owned and does the job. Compared to newer MP3 players this is a `toy', with limited functionality, memory, and lack of video, pictures, etc. It is extremely basic. The biggest problem is with battery life - it is horrible!! Absolutely horrible battery life. It uses 1 AAA and it eats through batteries like crazy. That has been the biggest downfall. The software it's bundled with is ok, but not very intuitive; I still have a hard time figuring out how to transfer music easily. The player is extremely compact and the headphones are ok - nothing fancy. I've used the voice recorder a lot and also the FM radio, and both offer good reception. The on/off dial is a button that you have to hold down and it takes quite a while to start up/shut down. You can scroll through songs, fast forward, rewind, and the songs seem to be played alphabetically by song title (unless I just haven't figured how to change that). This isn't a player for people who love music, because it doesn't hold too many songs - between 60 and 120. I've outgrown this, and technology has surpassed what this player is capable of; this is a bare-bones player that doesn't hold much and doesn't do much. Great for a run in the park, but the battery probably won't even last that long. Unlike others, this has never broken on me or malfunctioned. There are much better options available now in MP3 players, so look around for something better.

<Title>Total Piece of Crap
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this player for a little over a year and have hardly used it.  It has never worked correctly.  When trying to switch tracks, it automatically shuts off on me.  Now, it won't even turn on!  Unfortunatly, I did not register the product or keep any of the original paperwork, so the company won't do a thing about it.  If you have this player, do not get rid of the paperwork!

<Title>Muvo looked to be a great deal until.....
<Date>Thu Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was a great little MP3 player. Great sound, my wife loves the portability in the gym, but after 7 months of normal wear, the display stopped working. Worse yet, I call Creative and they tell me it's not under warranty anymore. They said the warranty was for 90 days!  Huh? The rep at Creative said they'd give me a "discount" and only charge me $45 to fix it. I asked for him to please talk with his manager about this problem. He said he'd call me back today, but I'm still waiting.   Beware ... Creative products look great, they sound great, but clearly they not only don't hold up well, but also don't have the type of support you expect to have from Creative. Sad.

<Title>Love it - Can't put it down
<Date>Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Creative MuVo is a 256MB Flash Drive that can be used to store music or data. All normal disk operations such as cut, copy, paste, delete, rename and also drag & drop can be used with folders or files. When you plug the MuVo into your computer USB, it will recognize and configure the MuVo and then lists on the directory tree as "Removable Disk (x)" with x being the next drive letter.  In addition to music, you can use the MuVo as a Secure Data Key. To do this, I am using a program called "Password 2000" which I have installed on the MuVo that uses about 625K of space. When used as a Secure Data Key, a double-layer of protection is provided. Two conditions must exist before protected information can be accessed. (1) The owner of the MuVo must plug it into the USB jack and (2) the correct password for Password 2000 must be entered. This is very handy since the MuVo's portability allows your encrypted passwords to be used anywhere, on any computer. Once unplugged, your data is off the computer and safely back into your pocket.  The MuVo lives up to it's reputation as outlined by other reviews on this web site so, I won't duplicate that information.   On the down side, I found the Earbuds to be difficult to use as they kept falling out. Also, they don't quite match the audio quality of the Radio Shack (Koss) "Pro 25" headphones I'm using.  For it's size, weight, portability, and sound quality, I highly recommend this excellent product. Be sure to shop around for the best price. I've recently seen this product at a local chain store for about 33% less than the typical price.

<Content>The Creative MuVo 256MB Player is a great all-in-one product.  I got it after losing my Otis player.  I listen to a lot of audio books from Audible.com and there is a firmware plug-in from Audible to support this product for their download manager.   After experimenting for a few minutes everything works fine.  I have experimented with all the features and they work fine.  To have in one small lightweight package a flash memory drive, radio, audio book player, mp3 player, and voice recorder/FM radio recorder is very useful.

<Title>First CREATIVE experience
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My life is full of first-time experiences.  As a oblivious infant, I experienced my first time walking. As a 5-year-old, I experienced my first time how to read, and speak cohesively.  As a adolescent, I experienced my unbalanced emotions that I couldn't understand when I'm around girls.  And now, as a modern electronic-enthusiast,  I experienced my first time purchasing an mp3 player...or in this case, FLASH mp3 player.  ~REVIEW~  Let me get right down to this:  I LOVE this device.  Any newbie who's under the same shoes I am, looking for good mp3 player at its core, should place this player on their electronics checklist.  This review probably isn`t going to be THAT informative, because I don't know got-dang much about the selection of mp3 players.  I took me quite a while to find the best player on the market with the green I little have on my wallet, and I believe this CREATIVE product is the right choice to make; right on the features, and right on retail.  The "CREATIVE MuVo TX FM" player is cool, because like what it says on the box, it's not only a mp3 player:  it's a mp3/FM radio/microphone hybrid!  The player is small, it can place well into the palm of an adult's hand.  The screen is small too, but the buttons are big, and the text on the screen are quite readable, so the size is not that big of a deal.  Plus, it shows how much juice the AAA battery got left.  Like every music player affair, it has a standard play/pause, and volume button; the play/pause button also acts as a power button, but it's one of those power buttons where you press and hold it for a few seconds in order to turn off.  The scrolling gray thingy on the black width side of the player controls the rewind and fast-forward of the song whenever it`s pushed either left or right, which also skips tracks the same way, and pressing it can activate the selection the screen highlights or go to the main screen.  On the mp3 side,...well, it plays mp3 songs obviously, and it plays well, and sounds clear and flawless (it also plays WMAs).  Since I bought the MuVo TX FM with 256 Megs (approximately, meaning between 240 to 250),  it can plays up to 4 hours of songs with 128 kbps.  This player also has its own Equalizer, which is basically a bunch of bars moving vertically so the adjusted sound placement of the songs can be just right for the listener.  It contains its own sets of EQs: rock, jazz, classical, or if you're a EQ pro, you can customized your own EQ to personalize.  I can pull the black piece out of the white area of the MuVo, and use it as a separate USB hard drive, which was the greatest thing about it, because it's the easiest way to drag in any files (NOT JUST MP3) from the computer and put it in the device shown as a separate drive without out all that yes-or-no legal-disclaimer nonsense.  And I couldn't believe how fast the transmission is from computer to device; it took me almost a minute to put in all 25 4-minute songs.  The MuVo package does include a CD program, and with it I can convert my CDs into mp3s; there are other programs that can do that, but I don't mind this one.    One thing must be notified:  Licensed music files CAN'T be transmitted through point-A-to-B dragging, so you must transmit these types of files through a computer media program.  On the FM side, albeit without AM to back up, it sounds just as fluid as an mp3.  I can save a  preset to the radio stations, using the in-device menu, and up to 32 presets can I automatically go to any of my favorite rock/rap/whatever station.  The reception is good; it's not great, though.  Sometimes I have to wave my hands around like an airplane director with diarrhea just to hear the local college jazz station.  Otherwise, the FM radio is a wonderful alternate if I don't feel like listen to my personal tracks.  You go to school, and you were snoozing while your algebra teacher is discussing about the Pythagorean theorem, this device is effective as a microphone.  I went through the same situation, and this device works wonders as a listening stand-in.  And up to 16 hours can I record any kind of situation I want to hear again, or forgot to hear the first time.  Just a reminder, this takes up the same amount of Megs as the mp3s, so record it wisely...or not.  I made so much positive facts, the MuVo seems perfect, right?  Sadly, not true.  When it comes to putting the music files in the MuVo, I can't sort the tracks of my choosing, because the tracks are always listed alphabetically.  For that,  it became a time-consuming process to rename the whole files on the computer so the MuVo can list them the way I wanted, and that's tiresome.  The play/pause button has a tendency to get a slow response when I press it, and like everyone who reviewed this product, the uncomfortable headphone included in this device can make a person spend 30 extra bucks on a new one.  THE FINAL WORD:  Value.  If a media player has a ton of features AND it cost less than $150, almost nobody would ever stop saying "wow!", and with MuVo, I still have the habit of keep saying that.  Okay, it's not an Ipod, a Rio, or a Sony network walkman, and what I say is no different from every other positive reviewer for this item, but another positive review is just another example of why this is such a good buy and a good alternate for those who just wants to listen to music, no matter how much it can hold.  Don't distant yourself on this one.

<Content>USB 2.0, light weight, awesome sound, FM radio, long battery life, quality ear buds, and it took a total of 7 minutes for me to be up and running with this thing. I cant stress enough how easy it is to load it up with music. The software is great, it rips CD's, organizes music, compresses files, you name it. No cords no funky wires, just plug it in and the transfer is so fast. I personally dont needmy entire music collection with me, this holds just the right amount of music for my train commute and my jogs at night. This player is awesome.

<Title>Size Matters
<Date>Tue Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>We all know size matters, and as tiny as the MuVo is, it's one of my sexiest gadgets. I've owned larger lighters.   This is my first mp3 player, so look elsewhere for comparison based reviews. As a first time owner, I am absolutely delighted. The sound quality is as crisp as a CD. The controls are simple and intuitive. It's tiny enough to fit into the smallest fashionable purse, but also comes with an easy-to-use removable belt clip and exercise arm band. What more could I want?   I bought the MuVo to go with Audible.com. At 256 megs, it will hold 2-3 medium length novels or one huge unabridged one. I could've bought a MP3 jukebox, but in comparison, even the iPod mini is HUGE. I don't need every song I've ever heard with me all the time. I'd rather throw on a playlist and a book and have a wonderfully tiny little device.  The software is so simple I never needed to open the manual. Plug and play, baby! The MuVo is also a USB flash drive, so no cords are needed. Just slide it into your USB port and you're all set. Loading files is simple and intuitive. If you already have audible.com, loading audible books is just as easy (IMPORTANT NOTE: This is only compatible with audible files at a 2 or 3 resolution. Higher or lower and they won't be recognized by the player.)   The biggest shock was the FM player. I owned a Radio Your Way for awhile and couldn't hear the songs over the static. My tiny little MuVo picks up even the faintest NPR stations with incredible clarity.   The included headphones are a bit uncomfortable, but headphones are cheap and easy to come by. I can't begrudge them that. Other reviews complain about low battery life. I get about 8 hours on my rechargables, which I find pretty reasonable since it's powered by a single AAA.   If you're looking for a small, inexpensive mp3 player/FM reciever, with great sound quality, you can't go wrong with the MuVo.   ***addendum:  The Samsung Yepp is, in fact a tiny bit smaller. For people out there who want to rub it in, the MuVo is the sexy thong of the MP3 world while the Yepp is closer to a g-string. Less is what you see and less is what you get - the Yepp is NOT Audible ready and does not offer any Audible support. In addition, the Yepp does not come with either a belt clip or an armband (MuVo gives you both) so make sure your clothes have plenty of pockets. The MuVo is still the tiniest MP3 player in it's class, but there is a less classy competitor out there if you're looking for sheer Geek Chick Size Coolness.  The size difference is pretty minimal. MuVo: 1.4 x 2.9 x 0.6 versus Yepp: 0.94 x 0.94 x 2.2. It's really more a question of whether you prefer your MP3 player flat (the MuVo) or cubical (the Yepp.)

<Title>File System Error Fix
<Date>Thu Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>In general, I love this little machine.  It has all the right features.  It's small, but packed with goodies such as a FM tuner, a voice recorder, a 256 MB USB storage device with an integrated USB plug (no wires), and the sound quality is great.  A few small complaints.  First when the clear plastic belt clip holder is on, it's really hard to remove the MP3 player from the battery housing.  I guess it's not supposed to be removed with the belt clip on, but I'd like to be able to do that.  I ended up cutting a chunk off the clear plastic so I can unplug it easier.  Second, the headphones are poor.  The ear buds don't fit well and the sound quality is poor.  The wire has an asymmetric joint so the wire to one ear is longer than the wire to the other ear.  Ditch the headphones and buy a good one.  Third, I had the unfortunate experience of having the dreaded "File System Error" show up on the screen.  Don't know how I got it, but when it happens, you can't turn the beast on.  It just flashes the error message and turns itself off.  I can plug it into the PC just fine and it will work as a USB storage device.  Just won't work outside of the PC.  Formatting it didn't help.  Calling Creative tech support didn't help.  They told me to return it for an exchange.  I did a web search and found some people with similar problems.  They were all told to return it to Creative or to return it to the store for an exchange.  By an incredible stroke of luck, I stumbled on a way to fix this nagged problem.  I formatted it again (using windows explorer), but this time, I specified FAT file format instead of FAT32.  Voila!  It turns on and seems to be working just fine now.  So those of you who see the "File System Error" message, try that first.  You may also try to put a Label on it.  Perhaps that helps too.  Overall, I still love this little music machine and would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Great little gadget for the price
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I won't give all the specs because those are listed in the spotlight reviews. I got this for going to the gym, and it's pretty much just the right size for putting all of my favorite up-beat music on to exercize to. Also it's holding up remarkably well considering it gets thrown into my gym bag with my sneakers.  The controls are very simple and easy to use. And contrary to the first spotlight review, you actually can skip to the middle of a song, you just have to roll the track-skip wheel to the right and hold it for a while (it's just not terribly quick). The menu is pretty self-explanatory and includes all the features you would want without all the bells and whistles. Also if you turn off the player while it is in the middle of a song, when you turn it back on it picks up in the middle of that song and remembers your settings including playmode and EQ.  You don't have to download expensive software that takes up all of your memory, but you have the option of installing software that the player comes with, or you can just drag and drop from your computer to the player. However you can't create new folders once the music is on the player - files have to be in the folders you want them in on the computer and uploaded that way.  Two criticisms: one is the microphone quality. If you are recording a person talking, it comes out slightly muffled and quiet and you really have to turn the volume up to hear. However seeing as this is hardly the most expensive, high-quality mic on the planet, it at least does its job.  Second, and this is minor, the player hooks onto the armband via the belt clip. The belt clip is fairly fat, so although the player is tiny, it becomes quite a protrusion from your arm, as opposed to say, ipods which go into a case that's flat against your arm.

<Title>Great and Little!!!
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first bought this product, I was a little skeptical because some of the reviews on this site said that it breaks easily after six months.  So i finally decided to just buy the damn thing and take my chances.  However, I bought an extended warranty for 10 bucks (from amazon) just to be on the safe side.  I am happy to say that after 8 months my mp3 is still working just fine.  The only problems I have with it are the following:  It doesn't have much room, especially when you want to hold files and music on it at the same time, you have to keep buying batteries for it and since I listen to mine all the time I usually end up buying batteries every single week, and for some reason the button used to increase the volume is a little jammed (but that could be from me always raising the volume.  Other than that I would recommend this product to anyone.  I personally like it better than Ipod cause it is cheaper, lighter, it just better.  If your a person that NEEDS 1,000+ songs to listen to, then Ipod might be the way to go.  But if ur like me and 90 or so songs will do, then definitely buy this wonderful gadget.

<Title>Great Device
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great buy for someone who wants a device to play good quality music for an affordable price. I have had this for a little above 2 months.  This is my first MP3 player.  I have very little knowledge about MP3 players.  However, I can easily say this is a good product.  This is great for someone who wants to spend a resonable amount for a Portable music player.  The sound is great, plays beautifully with a good set of headphones.  Its easy, just plug in a USB port drag and drop your file and you're done, it comes with software, but its unnecessary to install it.  Sturdy, I've dropped it quite a few times and no problems what so ever.  As long as you have Duracell or Energizer batteries the battery life is exceptionally long, about 15 hours.  Carry one extra and you can go an entire day with skip free high quality music.  The headphones are nice, not great.  If you have a good ear you might want to get some better ones, otherwise they work fine.  I don't quite use the extra features, but to write a good review I check them out.  The Radio for the most part has good reception, not to mention you can record it.  Voice recorder does an okay job, gets about a two foot range and you can hear it well.    Either way if you are looking for a music player with no special features, such as watching music videos, then this is a great buy for you.  Great sound quality, FM radio, easy use.  This alone convince me to buy it.  Simply because I'm not going to go out and spend 300 to 400 dollars on an iPod.  This is great if you want small and easily portable music with great quality playback.  My only recommendation is that you get a larger storage size.  I found because of the quality of sound, it brings out the irregularities of shrunk music to fit on it, I keep my music stored on it about 5MB, so the number of tracks are limited for me.  Actually I've considered buying another Creative MuVo MP3 Player with a larger storage size.    I don't know your preferences, but I was very satisfied with my purchase.

<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the MP3 player for about a month now, and overall Im pleased with it...it's lightweight, plugs easily into the computer, and has good sound quality. The earbuds are decent too. I've been using it in the gym and it works well for me.  I had problems when I downloaded music files using Windows Explorer...it's best to use software to download the files to the MP3 player. The software that comes with it is a little awkward to use, but not too difficult after some practice.   It does go through batteries rapidly! However, I've been loading MWA files on it, and they are supposed to drain the battery more quickly than MP3 files. I plan to experiment with this.  If you've got more money to spend (I didn't), I'd recommend an MP3 player with more storage...this unit holds the equivalent of about 4 CDs, so I'm having to periodically erase the MP3 player and load up different CDs. It doesn't bother me but it's something to consider.

<Title>Good for the money
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted an MP3 player with a radio for my walks....this fit's the bill, althought I had another one that only lasted about a year.  For the money...it's s good little unit but I think the next one will be an IPOD that will hold a lot more cd's and work with my home stereo.  I would recommend this to people who want some tunes while working out as it's small and no to expensive if it's dropped.

<Title>Value for Money....better display would help
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This chap is sheer value for money, triple the features for half the price of an ipod. Quite easy to use for the average buyer....would have helped if the display was a bit more ligible and the menu would stay for a couple of seconds longer, I bought this for my dad who is 70+, and it took him a while to get used to it.

<Title>I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT...
<Date>Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 Player for my 10 yr old son for his birthday.  We downloaded alot of songs on it and it played for a week, then it would just turn off by itself while my son was listening to his music, so my husband and myself played with it a little to see if it was the batteries and it kept doing it even after replacing the batteries.    Finally, we just sent it back and got a refund.    After we got a refund, we went out and bought a SCANDISK MP3 player and he has been in music heaven every since.

<Title>Great little thing! Better than iPod nano
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is fantastic. Very easy to use, excellent sound quality, excellent battery life. The buttons are little small for those who have big hands, but it is extremelly light. The FM works great, and you can even record from the FM. It is really a pen drive, so you can just stick it in your USB port with no need for calbles to connect. I'd recommend, not only this version but all the others 512Mb and 1GB (blue and red)

<Title>Battery Life - Unacceptable
<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have used the MuVo TX FM 256 MB for several weeks now and find that it does everything well except that battery life has never been more than 2 hours.  I have bought the best batteries available, not used the variety of functions available on the unit and the result is always the same.  Two hours or less battery life.  I've even used the "monster" batteries that are made for digital products.  Support from Creative labs has been a series of nonsensical emails that were obviously written by High School dropouts.  I would not recommend this unit to anyone.

<Title>Better by design
<Date>Mon Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like most who purchase from Amazon.com I do read reviews and try and help others who may come along. On the plus side I do like the small conveinent size,with easy to use controls. It would be perfect for cycling. I  did have two concerns.  1. On page 12 of the manual there is a warning notice to wash your hands after use, because you "may" have lead contact with the cords.  It does not specify internal or external. Based on how harmful lead can be I didn't want to take any chances.  I don't think it matters on the size of the product and its components that contain hazardous materials. Warnings are usually there for a reason.    2. The Sports Armband has a poor design.  Unless you have 16 inch arms than it may work for you.  Having to gather the fabric to make it work felt odd and noticeable.  As for performance I never go that far.

<Title>not bad
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had this for several days and overall I am pretty satisfied with it. I won't bother going through all the features here. The things I like most are: 1) pretty samll and light weight, good for taking it with you jogging 2) it's really a jump drive, so you can use it just like a jump drive  A couple of complaints: 1) The earbuds are very uncomfortable (at least for my ears), even though the sound quality is pretty good. I had to junk it and get a new one. 2) The belt clip holder could be much better.  Also, a previous reviewer complained about a warning label on "lead contamination", I believe that is the same "warning" they put on all Christmas lights. In fact, I think that warning is only for residents of California. :) The same reviewer also mentioned the size of the armband being too big, actually if you put it on the right way, it won't be too big.

<Content>After reading the other reviews, I selected this item as my first MP3 player.  I think it is great!  The sound is excellent;  it's a great size (for a 256 MB player);  it holds enough music to make it useful;  the radio is ok;  the battery life is impressive;  the price is right.  Some minor complaints:  the ear buds are too big to be comfortable;  the display is a bit too small;  the scroller is too touchy?  Overall, I'm satisfied beyond my expectations.

<Title>The earphones are large, but...
<Date>Sat Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe it or not, I'm on my second MuVu.  I bought the 256MB NX almost a year ago for a pretty decent $119.99, and then I just bought the 256MB TX FM not too long ago for $99.99.  I agree with what most people say, at least in the flaws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earphones are large, and I'm a pretty big guy with pretty large ears, etc., and even I find discomfort with them.  What I did was sell the earphones Creative Labs packaged it with (which fetched around $10 on eBay), and I went out and bought new earphones.  The included earphones are special because they use the metal Neodymium, but Neodymium earphones are readily available through other makers (although the Creative Labs one is the best fit for the Creative Labs player), so it shouldn't be a problem to find an ear bud that's the right size for you.  Any earphone/headphone with Neodymium offers crazy bass than if you use an earphone without it. I think Coss sells affordable ones for $9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, a lot of people were saying the buttons are too sensitive.  Well, the reason I'm on my second MuVo, and not switching over to something else, is because the buttons are simple.  I keep mine in my pocket, and I don't even have to take it out to see what it is I'm doing (unless I use something that requires the menu).  I mean, there are only four buttons (!)  I give props to whomever designed it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My only beef is that the new MuVos come with a white battery case, and I looked at Creative Lab's web site, and found them peddling battery cases in different colors (I guess to keep up with the iPod Mini fad), and I really wished it would've came in gunmetal black (the original black color the NX came with).  Some people won't mind it, but I use mine at work and I don't want it sticking out like a sore thumb because you see this chunk of white, so I'm going to have to dish out $9.99 for the gunmetal black battery case (plus S&H).  And the radio's not that strong, unless you're outside or the station you're listening to has a strong signal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even then, its positive traits outweight the negative ones.

<Title>Great product with only minor flaws
<Date>Tue Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the first mp3 player I have bought, but I am a techie so I know all about various computer related products. I had spent a couple of weeks looking for a decent mp3 player. I choose a Flash based player because I wanted to use it while I exercise (or when I start to actually) and a hard drive based player is just not a good idea for that. My requirements were that it have at least 256 MB of memory, have a FM radio and be able to carry more than just music. Having said that, I am providing a list of pros and cons.  Pros: Small Size: Smaller than my cell phone so it can fit in all my pockets and I barely notice its there. Connectivity: USB 2.0 is so much faster than USB 1.1. Loading music goes quick. Ease of Use: I opened it and within 5 minutes I had it loaded with music and playing songs. I give it to a few other people who wanted to look at it and they were able to do everything with it right away. Sound quality: It produces very good sounding music. I connected it to my speakers which have very good bass and all around performance and the Muvo was on par in terms of quality as my PC is. Buttons: The buttons are nice and big and easy to find. The power button has to be held in for a bit to turn it on and off. At first I thought this was a con but it is actually a benefit as it prevents accidently turning it on or off. One last thing, some people have said that you can't skip to the middle of a song, well if you press the dial forward and hold it there it will fast forward through a song. Same goes for reverse if you hold it the other way. Battery: The battery that came with it is a major brand battery and it has lasted a long time so far. I would guess at least 10 hours and its only half way done. Its only a AAA so thats pretty impressive to me.  Cons: Headphones: These things hurt! I have big ears and they still don't fit me. They sound from them when they are in is good but the discomfort of having them in outweighs this fact. Included Belt clip: The way the clip is positioned is great if you use it with the armband but if you put it on your belt it kinda digs into your stomach and I'm a really thin guy so its not my stomach causing the problem. It would have been nice if the player could be turned sideways so it is horizontal instead of vertical. That would have made the positioning much more comfortable while I am listening at work. Belt Clip Case-thingy: The rubber case covers only half of the player. Since it makes it really hard to take the USB part out of the battery pack, it would have been nice if the case covered more of the player to protect all of it or made smaller so its easier to take the player out. Lanyard holder: Creative could have spent the extra 10 cents and thrown a key ring in with this so you can attach it to a neck lanyard since there is a spot for one. Did I mention how uncomfortable these included headphones are?

<Title>An Amazing Thing
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The MuVo TX FM 256MB is perfect for listening to music outside your house.  It is practically weightless, at 1.5 ounces, and of course, it doesn't skip at all.  Perfect for if you are running, biking snowboarding, climbing, taking a stroll around the block, or sitting through a boring English class.  It is small and unobtrusive, easy to use and best of all it has an amazing sound. It can hold a surprising amount of music for its size and weight, right now I have about 4 or 5 hours of music on it.  But if you get bored of listening to your music, you can always add new stuff or switch to the FM radio.  it doesn't have a big antenna sticking out of it, it doesn't even have an antenna, yet it has amazing reception.  You can also switch from scanning mode, to preset mode.  It you ever have a quick though that you need to remember, but you have no aper, just record it, with 16 hours of recording time, you wont need a note book any longer.  So over all this is an amazing MP3 Player, that you should consider buying.  The only downside to it is changing the battery, but that is not too big of a deal, it has about 15 hours of it.

<Date>Sun Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After weighing my options whether to buy a dedicated MP3 player and an MP3-cum-USB storage disk, I decided to go for the MP3 USB disk combo. I shopped around and stumbled upon this MP3 player from Creative. It delivers good performance for its relatively cheap price. On the plus side, it is inexpensive, considering the fact that it is from Creative. It comes with features such as FM tuner, FM/Voice recorder and 256MB memory size for file/music storage. The software bundle is okay, although you may never need it if you know how to use Microsoft Windows media player 9.  On the minus side, the audio level is low, I wish the designers put in more power to its amps. Value for value, the Creative Labs MuVo FM MP3 player is a very good buy.

The creative media organizer is easy to use and has a good selection of playlists.  And, the computer treats it like just another folder when the device is plugged in to the usb port.  Upgrading the firmware is a little bit of a hassle, but not too bad.

<Title>Good value for the price
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I agree with the pros and cons the previous reviewer highlighted. This was my first MP3 player, and I bought it for two purposes: 1.) to listen to the radio while jogging, and 2.) to listen to mp3 files while traveling. It fit the bill perfectly for both. The only downside (and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that the headphones didn't fit my ears well and didn't block out ambient noise. Honestly, for the low price I didn't expect the system to come with great headphones, so I wasn't too disappointed. I just purchased new in-ear, noise-cancelling headphones and "voila!" -- the perfect system for my needs.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player and i sure do love the features of this:  * 256 mb capacity * USB Connector * Small and sleek design  * Great quality earphones * FM Radio  However there are quite a few disadvantages also:  * Is it just me or when i'm using FM, shaking the headphones affects the quality of the music (??)  * The documentation is not very good...for instance, how to use FM radio is not clear as also the ability to move into the middle of a track (yes, this is possible unlike the previous reviewer who claims it is not -- you need to turn the "tuner" midway forward or backward depending on whether you're forwarding or rewinding and hold it there  * Finally, 256 mb might seem adequate, but trust me once you finish filling up the place, you might have a pretty difficult time trying to decide which songs to remove and which ones to keep (Granted this is not a mistake of the manufacturer, but be aware of what you're getting into.  All-in-all a product that's gives you full value for money, but then again there is every possibility that you're underestimating the amount of money you are willing to spend on a good MP3 player...

<Content>I got this little guy as something to use when I go to the gym.  I have a 30gb ipod as well, but that's not really something to be moving around and working out with.  I chose this player becuase it was affordable and had an FM tuner.  I like the fact that you can just drag and drop your files to it.  If you decide you don't want a song on it anymore, just drag it away.  Voila!  It also the shuffle option, which was the big thing with the ipod shuffle.  Let me tell you, I have tried my friend's shuffle and, to put it nicely, it sucks.  Big time.  No screen or anything.  Yuck.  Anyways, some people have reviewed this and said that it breaks easily and quits working and such.  I bought this back in November at Wal-Mart and have used it four to six times a week for a half hour each time and it is still working great.  If you need something to take to the gym or on workouts, get it!  It's worth it!  The only thing that I would do is get some alternate headphones.

No need to install crappy software or drivers to transfer files/mp3s 4. Customisable graphic equaliser 5. FM Radio 6. Dictaphone 7. Good amplification (can use low sensitivity headphones)  Cons 1. Included earphones are uncomfortable and have poor sound quality. They should be replaced. 2. Display is good quality, but unfortunately it only shows id title tag and time elasped. i would prefer it showed artist and title tags. 3. No way to skip through albums unless you store each album in a different directory 4. No dedicated hold switch 5. Only supports - mp3 / wav / wma. No support for ogg and monkey audio etc.

<Title>Perfect for Audible audio books
<Date>Sat Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First, a disclaimer: I didn't buy this to listen to MP3 music. I love to listen to audio books from Audible.com, and this is one of the approved players for that service (it uses a special audio format so you can't use just any player). But since lots of people want a device for audio books, I figured this focused review would be handy.  Setup was a snap: popped in the battery, and started exploring the controls. It's a testament to how smart the design is that I didn't have to refer to the manual at all. Once you figure out that the little rocker wheel can also be pushed in (like clicking the mouse wheel on a computer mouse) that's the "open sesame" to navigating all the menus.   I plugged it into a free USB port on my Windows XP PC, and the PC immediately recognized it; wonderful not having to install any drivers!  I got the Creative Muvo plug in from the Audible site to allow the player to be recognized by the Audible software on my PC, activated the player via Audible Manager (took 30 seconds) and then I quickly transferred a couple of audio books to the device. Easy, fast, and the audio is clear and high quality.  PROS Incredibly tiny.  No hard drive--durable.  Thoughtful design, like a power switch that has to be held in for a couple of seconds to turn on/off, so no accidental presses will affect it. Intuitive controls. No special software needed to use it. Easy to use controls without even looking. Bonus: convenient way to transfer files between PCs.   CONS The ear buds are junk. Toss 'em. It'd be nice if the display was a bit longer, but this is a nit. FM radio receiver is mediocre.  Can't force FM to mono; this is annoying with a weak signal.  Overall, this is the audio book device of my dreams. I was using a Pocket PC for the purpose, but it was bulky compared to this, and I was always afraid of dropping it because they're pretty fragile. And the software controls on a Pocket PC are incredibly awkward to use compared to the purpose-built buttons of the MuVo. This isn't a replacement for a really high quality FM reciever like a Sangean, but it's a nice bonus. I have no regrets getting this, and it's a great value too.

It allows you to customize your own equalizer setting to suit your listening preferences. I have tried other brands of MP3 players and I can say that Creative produces the best quality sound. For those people who complained about the limited number of songs that it can hold, if you cannot read the 256MB written on the packaging when you bought the player, it's not the product fault. There are 512MB and 1GB version of this in the market for those who requires a larger capacity.

<Content>i'll preface this by stating this is my 3rd MP3 player in 4 years. previously i've used Rio products - the 500 (which i still feel is one of the more aesthetically pleasing players ever released) and the s10. compared to those products the Muvo TX FM is by far the best flash player i've ever handled. it supports mp3, wav, wma and Audible books (with the latest firmware upgrade at creative.com). the user interface is nicely done and leaps and bounds above what i've seen from competing manufacturers. all the features touted work as advertised - the radio reception is particularly good (at least in NYC), and the radio recording is loud and works well, though the bitrate used makes the feature more ideal for talk show recordings than music. likewise the microphone offers pretty decent recordings, but it isn't going to replace anyone's tape recorder for clarity and reception.  though the device has a sturdy construction that feels completely solid in your hands (especially once you slide the device into its rubber casing), i worry about the longevity of its spring-loaded rocker wheel. i haven't had any issues with it in the week i've had the device, but i'm not sure it'll last through months scrolling and occasional drops. as is, the case is great (though it's only protecting 3/4 of the device) and the included armband is a godsend for me since i will be using the Muvo primarily when i'm at the gym. as some have mentioned the included headphones are garbage. jettison them quickly and get anything else.  the player installs as an external hard drive on Windows XP/2000 systems. this highlights a great design feature of the Muvo TX, as it's basically a USB keychain drive with a LCD screen, buttons, and a battery holder attached on. unplugging the usb drive from the battery compartment, you can plug the Muvo into any usb-capable computer and access your files. throw your word documents, pictures, anything really, into the device and you can still use it to hold music. as a college student i carry documents on the drive to bring it back and forth from the computer science labs to my home system. easy and no hassles.  putting music on the drive is as simple as dragging it in from Explorer. if you want, however, you can use either the included Creative media program (bloated) or Windows Media 9/10 to transfer music over to the device. the Creative does not accept playlists, which could be a problem for some. users can get around that by either grouping audio on the device by folders, or by renaming their songs to play in the proper order. the Muvo TX plays songs by alpha-numeric order on the drive, so filenames starting with A will be read before B, songs with 01 read before 03, etc. since most of my music is appropriately tagged with id3 and named properly (artist, song number, title) this isn't much of a hassle.  a bigger issue for me is that the device does not read music nestled under 2 or 3 layers of folders. you can section off your music by folder, but the folders must exist on the root directory of your drive. the player won't find any music that's buried inside two or more layers of folders, which is a hassle because windows media player 10 by default transfers music organized under a litany of folders. after transfering songs from WMP 10, i have to manually go to the drive and drag folders, delete folders, and other sorts of nonsense to get the device to read them all. this is nothing that can't be rectified by a firmware update, but creative is spotty in this area. the latest update available at creative.com lets the device support Audible books, but introduced some radio volume problems (seems to jump up and down occassionaly).  music clarity is great, and i have no problem whatsoever with the decoding engine in the player. replacing the headphones with a decent pair, music came out loud and clear on my sony earbuds. the included EQ is very adjustable and its settings make a definite impact on the music. the player has a minimal set of buttons, which is great. there is a play/pause button on the front of the device which also functions as the on/off switch if held onto for 3 seconds (you'll see a progress bar on the player's LCD screen when you hold down the play/pause button to indicate that you're bout to shut the devie down). volume is controlled by two sets of buttons on the player's side, and rewind/fastforward and song skip are handled by the rocker wheel. the rocker wheel also handles the menu and interface, which as i've said earlier is intuitive and quick.  the best is the battery life. my Rio S10 spoiled me with 20+ hours of playback on one AA battery, and i expected the Muvo to be noticably less since it uses AAA. to my surprise i've had about 15-18 hours with the included name-brand AAA, and i doubt it'll change much when i switch to my rechargables.  all in all this is a great player and i recomend it to anyone who is interested in a flash-based device. though there isn't any room for upgrades, the device has enough memory for the job, and its dual function as a USB keychain drive makes up for the loss.

<Title>The downsides to this MP3 player.
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Here is a small list of a few things I found annoying about this MP3 player:  1) The earbud headphones are bulky and the foam covers are rough, which cause your ears to hurt after about 15 minutes of using them.  2) The earbud headphones are very limited in terms of frequency range. The frequency range is very narrow, meaning you miss out on some of the high end and low end sounds. I bought a pair of Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones in order to hear what I was missing and the difference was astounding.  3) While using the MP3 player, there are no playlist features or folders available to help organize your collection. This means you can only skip to the next song, one at a time and in whatever order you imported them in. This is probably due to the 1-line, tiny screen on the player, which can display only one song at a time.  4) The maximum volume is not very high at all. I turned it up all the way and I can still hear my surroundings. Oh well, at least I'll never go deaf using this MP3 player.  Other than that, it's a sleek-looking, highly compact player that packs a punch. No complaints at all in the sound department. Also, the custom EQ let's you tweek the quality of sound EXACTLY the way you like it!

<Title>How to display more that the song title
<Date>Wed Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got this today, so I haven't had it long enough to give a review, but I noticed that other reviews commented on how you can only see the title of the song in the display and not the artist.  What is shown in the display is what is in the title category when it's on your computer.  If you go to the file and right click and go to properties, then clikc on the summary tab there will be a box for title.  Just type in whatever you want for the title and that is what will be displayed on the mp3 player.  A quick way to see what the titles are is if you look at the files using detailed list to view them (where it shows all the info about the files).  If you right click at the top where it says name, size, filetype, etc. it will give you the option of displaying the title.  This way you can easily look down your list and figure out which ones you need to change.  Hopefully this will help some people, I'll write a review of the mp3 later when I have used it more.

<Title>great little gadget
<Date>Mon Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got this item a couple of days ago and I'm pretty happy with it.  I really wasn't looking for an MP3 player, but I got sucked into the technology.  I'm nowhere near computer literate so it took me a couple of tries to transfer my music files on to the player.  For some reason I just couldn't just drag and drop so I had to use the software to get started, but I started flowing soon after.  The biggest thing I like about it is the size of it.  I can just stick it in my pocket and roll.  I didn't have any problems with the carrier as I've read some folks did.  The price is right if you're not looking at spending a lot of money and a first time buyer of this type of product.  I'm pretty happy with my purchase so far.

<Title>Outstanding overall and #1 jogging mate
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my second MP3 player I have owned and about the 4th I have tried...and it is the best. Creative has found their niche--high quality, reasonable price, good sound quality. Rio can't overcome their quality control issues, Iriver is high priced, and so is Ipod...and the rest are either low quality or low in performance value. This MP3 player is the perfect jogging companion, the belt clip is very tight (no worries of falling off while running), but also extremely comfortable...I don't even notice it is there. This MP3 player is so light, you can clip it on your running shorts, without worrying about the wieght draggin them down. If you prefer, it also comes with an very well designed armband. About the only potential drawback is if you like to listen to the music at levels that will guarantee to damage your hearing...this player doesn't go that loud, but it does get plenty loud enough where it will be impossible to hear anything but your music. Drag and dropping music via USB 2.0 makes this the fastest I've seen in music upload. It has all the features you want and 256 will hold plenty of songs. Best jogging partner on the market and one of the best overall MP3 flash players out there.

<Title>Excellent for Workouts
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you are buying an Mp3 player to use while exercising, this is an excellent product for the following reasons: 1.) It is lightweight and durable. I have ran through some extreme weather (heavy rain, snow) without any adverse effects on the player.  2.)I am 5'8'' and 155lbs. The included strap kept the unit stable on my arm. People with wider arms might have problems with the strap, however. 3.) The software is easy to use. I was able to convert my CDs into Mp3 format within minutes of installing the package. Because a flash-based player, you just have to plug the flash drive into your computer and drag and drop the songs.  4.) The FM Tuner gets good reception in urban areas.  5.) Long battery life. I get about 16 hours of use before having to change the triple A battery.  Again, I only use it while working out. I can't give an informed opinion on the more advanced features.

<Title>MuVo TX FM / Enormous bang for the buck
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The MuVo TX FM by Creative Labs is an exceptional digital audio media player. If you're looking for lightweight, good performance and ease of use in an MP3 player, search no more. Ruggedly designed for the person on the go. It can be attached to your arm with the armband for running and exercise or simply clip it to your belt.  Packing high performance and ease of operation into the tiny MuVo TX FM is what makes this baby a breeze for the novice user. You can drag and drop songs super fast with the USB 2.0 connection that requires no extra cable to tote along for transferring. You also don't need to install the Creative software that comes in the box if you have Windows Media Player. Just plug the unit into the USB port, drag and drop your songs, and you're ready to go. Storage on the 256 MB model will hold about four hours of MP3 music.   Other features include: voice recorder (16 hour capacity with 256 MB) with built-in microphone, back light, customizable five band equalizer, FM radio tuner and recorder, and it can be used as a storage device for other files and photos. Operating on one AAA battery will get you about fifteen hours of non-stop music.  After e-mailing tech support at Creative Labs questioning if this unit is compatible with the Mac, it was pleasantly surprising to get a response within fourteen minutes, however it is not compatible. For those considering this unit for use during running or vigorous exercise, you may want to purchase a different set of ear buds. The set included with the unit seem to fall out easily.   The multiple features and low price make buying this MP3 player an easy decision for those who are not so savvy with the new innovations in digital audio media. If you want a small media player but want giant, quality sounding music at a price that won't break the piggy bank, you'll want to give the MuVo TX FM by Creative Labs a try.    By:  Bill Bennett

<Title>Best Value for money. 
<Date>Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player at walmart for 59.96, a bit cheaper than the price here.  I love it, it was very easy to use and although I couldn't figure out at first how to get my napster music into the library for it, I went to the creative website and it gave me a tutorial. Really nice and simple, step by step instructions.  To the person that reviewed this before me, you CAN skip to the middle of a song, my 3 year old did to mine on accident, lol.  Press the middle of the scroller button one time, and you can fast forward within a song using the scroller. Press it again and it reverts back to scrolling to the next song.  I agree about the earplugs on the headphones, they are quite big, so I will definitely be buying different ones for it.  But I still give it 5 stars for ease of use.

But it is loud enough for me, and probably better for my ears.  It comes with software, but none is needed. you can store data or music or any thing using windows explorer.

<Title>Muvo works with MAC but you must delete .trashes folder
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My girlfriend uses the MUVO with her MAC. she just plugs it in and drags files to it. the problem is deleting files, it creates a hidden directory called .trashes And puts the MP3s there. so they still take up all the space. you have to change your MAC to show these hidden files and delete the folder.  I usually just plugged it into my PC and deleted it for her.   this is a tiny lightweight MP3 player good for jogging or traveling with. i bought new headphones because I did not like the earbuds it came with. i love that there is no cable, just put in in the usb outlet and go. I also like the AA batteries, i use rechargables. so No charger. no cables. no docking station. it's a complete kit in one unit.

<Content>An excellent lighweight and cheap player with a decent receiver. The earbuds are not worth mentioning - I recommend e.g, the a cheap and comfortable Sony MDR-A35G S2 Sports Headphones, that one can wear for hours without getting sore ears.  My player started to shut down eratically and would not start on many occasions after about half a year, but simply installing a newer firmware fixed this problem: (http://dapjukebox.altervista.org/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownloaddetails&lid=232&ttitle=[MuVo%20TX%20FM]%20Firmware%201.19.01)

<Title>Like it, but it didn't hold up for the most part
<Date>Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item in the summer of 2005 and was quite happy with it and the reasonable price of it.  I had gone back and forth between getting this and the ipod shuffle, but I liked being able to have a screen.  This does come with an FM radio, but alas, mine stopped working 4-5 weeks after I bought it. Actually the radio might still work, but I can no longer get the MP3 player to switch to that choice.  I am continously stuck in play mode.  I can't delete songs (unless I connect to the computer), I can't shuffle the songs.  I can turn it on and off and use the volume.  Still, with all that, I like this little player, sound is nice and I don't worry about breaking it.  We recently purchased an Apple ipod 30GB and 4GB nano, and those seem to fancy for running around the block, and I would really be unhappy if I dropped one of those.   I don't worry about this one quite so much.  Still, the small capacity is getting a bit old.  I think it held 65 songs in mp3 format.  For this price I don't know if I would buy it again for the small capacity, but I have it now and I will keep it, as long as it keeps playing.

<Title>A basic mp3 player that exceeds your everyday needs
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative MuVo TX FM is actually very useful in my everyday life.  I jog with it, work with it, and if I need some relaxing music to lull me to sleep, this player has it all.    Some of its great features hold:  -Plays mp3 music -Has a FM radio -Can record FM music -Has a voice recorder -Can be used as a jump drive, in a way -Can store 256 mb of memory, although it actually holds 242.3 mb of space... -Ultra light {only 1.1 ounces without the battery (32 grams)} -Built in USB drive  -Simple and easy to use.  CONS:  -The memory is a bit small for hard-core music lovers, or people who store lots of files -The screen is a little small, but you don't actually notice that while you're using it -The color white on this product can get dirty, but that's just getting nit picky.  OVERALL:     I highly reccomend this product.  The features as well as the low price has me lured onto this product, and I wouldn't be surprised if you decided to make this player your new best friend.

<Title>I Bought 2 of Them!
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For the price, this is a great mp3 player. Its competatively priced with other mp3 players, but offers a lot more. It can also be used as a flash memory drive, a recording device, and an FM radio. Its compact size and 256mb memory drive are useful too. The only downsides to this player are the size of the ear buds, which are a bit too large to fit inside the ear comfortably; and the fact that songs can only be arranged alpha-numerically. You can't randomize the order that songs are played in, or order them according to the order they appear in an album.  Despite these downsides, the advantages were enough that I bought one for myself as well as one for my girlfriend. I recommend it for anyone looking for an mp3 player with about 4 hours playing time (with mpgs), decent battery life, and versatility

<Content>I have had the product for several weeks.  I'm very happy so far with the performance.  I use it for the gym. The radio works well and sound quality seems fine to me. Loading music was easy.  Pros:    Price    Radio & mp3 palyer    Loading music was easy Cons:    Instruction manual is not very good    Limited song capacity    Headphones were poor.  I use ones I bought    Battery life is fairly short, but I don't use it for long periods.  (1 AAA battery)    Needs Windows 98 SE or XP to load music.  Be careful your operating system is compatible    When battery gets low, you have to be careful you stay out of the play mp3 mode.  The device will shut off immediately if the battery is low.  When you turn it on, it will start in the mode you left in.  It took me about 9 tries to pause play so I could switch to FM mode. Overall I am happy with the product.  It fits perfectly with what I needed. I would recommend it as long as the limitations above are not a problem.

<Title>Lots of features, reliable, great workout companion
<Date>Thu Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my 2nd mp3 player--my first was an iRiver FP-190T which began having sound issues after about 15 months of use.  I was looking for a flash-based mp3 player which would be small and lightweight for use while working out, would have easy file transferability and would be more durable than my previous player.  After 6 months of use, it has met my expectations.  Size and weight is about as small as one can get, and the flash-based memory makes it perfect for use while exercising.  The holder and armband work well.  The FM radio has nice reception.  I've yet to use the voice-recording capability, but it's nice to have there, just in case.  File transferability is the strength of this device.  The iRiver software I had to use with my previous player was always kind of clunky.  The Creative is very easy--in fact, requires no software.  Just plug the USB part of the player into a USB port on your computer, and drag-and-drop.   In fact, it doubles as a USB drive to hold other types of files such as Word documents, so its versatility makes it even more valuable.  The cons are relatively minor quibbles:  --While in use, navigation among songs and folders is virtually impossible.  Basically you have "next song" and "shuffle" options.  This is a needed software/firmware upgrade, IMHO. --It doesn't have plug-and-play capability with all computers (e.g., my office computer).  It may require installation of the accompanying software before it is recognized as a USB storage device on other computers. --It is somewhat difficult to remove the mp3 player from the armband holder. --I don't care for the earbuds, but I've yet to find a set of earbuds that I care to use, so I don't hold this against Creative at all.  Overall, the Creative has met my expectations.  I hope it maintains its reliability longer than my previous mp3 player, and given my positive experience with other Creative products, I trust that it will.

<Content>I loved the unit. It just broke right away. The size was great although it is sparse on storagge.  However, my rating is based on a 3rd or 4th time usage problem that caused all the music to be distorted and unlistenable.I found nothing about that in any literature on the product and researched online as well.  I returned it as a result of never getting it to sound good again.  Get something with better reliability as the products are getting better all the time.

<Content>I really like the design of this player. Unfortunately both of the units I bought for my sons for Christmas skip during the song playback. At first I though it might be that the MP3s were encoded in variable bit rate format. I converted them to 128 bps and tried again. Both untis still skip. I then tried to download the latest firmware 1.12.04 [per another review here, thanks!]and format the drives. Even after all that both units still skip during song playback. I've contacted Creative support and I'm hoping for a fix soon!! I have two very dissapointed kids with what now appear to be $120 lumps of coal.

<Title>Great deal for a reasonable price...
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great little player... period. The fact that it can be had for about a third of a ipod mini is just icing on the cake. It's light, fast (due to it being a memory based player..  no skipping!) and packed full of features. Record a voice note? Check. Record off the radio? Check. Drag and drop your music files with no special software being required? Check. Organize them into folders for different music genres? Check. Backlight for easy use at night or in low light? Check. As you can see, a lot of thought was put into the Muvo TX FM to make it easy to use, but be flexible enough for the most savvy of mp3 owners. There is a lot of little features (most are easily custom tweaked to your liking, like backlight time duration, LCD display flip for lefties and righties, support for ID3 tags, etc..) that just add up to making this a great little player.   There are a few nits, tho. I'd like the navigation of folders to be more intuitive, the scroll wheel to be a bit more weighty (several times I tried to skip a song and I accessed the settings menu with a push on the wheel) and a battery life counter would be greatly appreciated.    But all in all, this is a great little player. It may not be as hip as a ipod, or have a revolutionary feature that marketing would play up but it has a lot of thoughtful "little" features that add up to a enjoyable musical experience.    Also, to the person who said you cannot skip forward into the song... You can access the Cue/Review feature under the Setting menu and set it to do exactly that... a quick push of the wheel to skip songs, and a push forward and hold to cue forward into the song and it even lets you hear the audio so you can stop where you want to. Like I said, lots of thoughtful features!

<Content>I want to express my satisfaction and correct a review I read before I bought this item. The instruction booklet is not very detailed but I learned that you can fast forward through a song. You just need to hold the button to the right vs. pushing quickly to go to the next song.   The only thing I wish this had was a charger or power connection. Otherwise, it lasts a really long time with one battery. I enjoy taking it in the car with my cassette converter, the gym with headphones and the beach with mini speakers. It is easily carried in my purse for use whenever I desire. I would definitely buy it again.

<Title>Easy to use, fun to own!
<Date>Mon Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a MUVO TX FM 256 mb mp3 player for my wife, a runner.  She's not too computer saavy so she had me get it set up, which took minutes.  Install the software to allow the MUVO to be recognized by your computer, drag and drop mp3 files onto the MUVO (you computer sees it as a drive), and you're ready to rock.  I found that it holds about 4 cds worth of music, plus a few single tracks.    The MUVO FM also holds an fm radio with more presets than you'll ever need.  I set my wife's up with the 5 fm frequencies that provide the sound from the TVs in our health club, plus another 8 or so local stations she would listen to when running outside.    The best part is the unit's very small size; its ability to play FM or MP3's; and ease of use.  It also comes with a belt clip and an arm band for use when exercising.  Downsides?  None that I have found yet...in fact, I bought another MUVO for myself!

<Title>Love this little thing!
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought two of these little babies as Christmas presents for my wife and my son, and I am very impressed to say the least. It's been quite a while since I've come across a product that is this well designed. It worked out of the box, no software installation required, just copy your music files to it and they play beautifully! Everything about the player is intuitive - neither my wife nor my son bothered to even open the user manual, they just started using the player and got the hang of it in less than 5 minutes flat. That says something for the quality of the user interface, from both a hardware and a software perspective. The quality so far seems great, too, and battery life is incredible, considering it uses one AAA battery only.  And yes, the included headphones are not of the best quality but they are certainly usable. Overall, I am highly satisfied with this purchase - so much so that I have now gone ahead and ordered one for myself as well! You won't make a mistake choosing this player.

<Title>Creative scores another 10 from me
<Date>Thu Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I decided to go with a Creative device because a few years back I bought a sound card for my PC and was very happy with it&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; The MuVo TX FM is a great little device that burns all other MP3 Players in it's price catagory. I am able to store my files from work, record meetings, and hook it up to personal speakers in my office. The only problem is that the headphones that come with it are a bit too big for the avarege adult ear.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; I love the 5 band equalizer that lets me change the sound settings for diffrent kinds of music. It even has a custom setting where you can adjust it to your liking. The AAA battery last about 5 to 6 days if you use it regularly, so rechargeable batteries are a good idea. Overall, this is a great device for the music lover/computer guy.

<Title>Second One and Still great
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Creative Labs MUVO 64 MB a few years ago and twas great. Never had a problem with it, not once. Only that it could carry 1 hour of mp3's or 2 hrs. of wma's. But that was a lot then, for a flash memory mp3 player. Now, with the MuVo TX FM 256MB it's what was great before but with more memory, FM radio, Voice Recorder, and an LCD screen to let me know what I am listening to. In my opinion, more reliable then the ipods because who the hell needs 100 hours of continuous music play. Although I do have to admit that the ipod is good to backup your files, if you have a whole lotta files to backup.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first portable MP3 player. My wife wanted wn ipod to work out with, and when I was researching it and found that with the Ipod's hard drive based memory you really can't work out with it, I found the Muvo TX FM. So for less than the price of an i pod (except the shuffle) I bought two Muvo TX FM 256s from Amazon for both of us.  So far I like everything about it. It's only been a couple of days but transferring songs was simple. The user interface on the unit itself is easy to use. The headphones are decent, but I'd upgrade those anyways. The volume range is great, the equalizer settings were more than I expected.   The only thing that concerns me is that it feels a little flimsy. I realize they designed it to be light, and light it is! I'm curious to see how it stands the test of time. So far, no real complaints.

<Title>the PERFECT mp3 player for the workin' man
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player for $60 at Wal-Mart, and it works PERFECTLY!! I LOVE it! I was stuck between this and an RCA Lyra 256, but I wanted an FM radio. So I got the Muvo. And I'm NOT disappointed. It's SWEET. The radio's pretty good, the songs don't skip, and the battery lasts FOREVER. What I also like is that it's really small, not like the old iPods. I've got it in my jeans pocket right now, actually. Another plus is that the earbuds included have INCREDIBLE sound, better than anything I've had before for headphones or whatever. Also, it's great that you can just do Plug and Play with it on other computers, without a bunch of software crap. All in all, a GREAT buy. Creative has made things like Sound Blaster, so they know how to make EXCELLENT sound products. This is no different. You WON't be disappointed!

I usually have 1 or 2 "issues" when setting up something new, however, I was on my own since my son (who is my computer resource!) is in Iraq. Very easy to set up.  Simple to drag and drop files.  I can't believe the sound on this little player! The sound is great even w/ the earbuds that came w/ the player. Menu is easy to work your way through. FM radio works fine. Going to really enjoy this little MP3 player!

<Title>Quick Comparison with the Zen Micro
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Muvo for christmas for my wife, and it was nice and all..  But the 256MB size was quick to fill, so I went and bought a Zen Micro for her (and I of course, kept the Muvo..)  With the exception of the Zen Micro having more features and an easier interface, the sound is literally identical.  I took 1 ear bud from each player, and managed to get both of them to play the same song at the exact same time, and it sounded exactly the same from both players.  So if you want the same sound quality as the Zen Micro, but can't pocket out about $100 more for it..  The Muvo definately has the great sound quality that you want, and the fact that you can detach it from the "battery" and plug it directly into the computer is another plus.  Two thumbs up.

<Title>Good Gadget
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound quality of FM radio and MP3 player is good.  If you are engineer type, this gadget is for you.  The engineers who design this device are very smart.  All you need to know how to use the device is: how to use scroller.  The scroller uses multiple hierarchies.  You reach all the features through scroller.  The manual don't tell you everything, but all the features are clearly defined in the simple words on the screen when you scroll.  You push scroller to select features.  When you push scroller, it either select feature, or go into another sublayer, or go out of sublayer.  Inside the sublayer, you have choice to select.  After you select the features in sublayer, push the scroller again, you go back to uperlayer.   If you don't understand how the thing works, you get frustrated, you push the scroller too hard, and you destroy the device.  Remember, don't scroll too hard or push too hard.  You may destroy device.  Good luck.

<Content>I hope this product works fine with a PC: I wouldn't know, because I own a Mac, with which this product does not work. It would've been nice had the "Product Description" specified that; as it was, it made a disappointing Christmas gift for my girlfriend (who also owns a Mac) (and who is now very happy with her new iPod shuffle).   A pity, because the MuVo seemed to pack so many more features into a similar size, and at a lower price. Oh well. We're waiting to see how the return to Amazon works; watch this space.  Adding a note here after receiving a refund for the whole amount, less "shipping credit" ofabout a dollar. The refund worked fine, and it took about 2 weeks.

I've read quite alot of reviews with simular problems and bet the upgrade will fix their problem. Install even if brand new.

<Title>Recommended basic MP3 player
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After doing a lot of online research, I decided to buy this MP3 player.  That was over a year ago, and I have not been disappointed.  Pro's: - Takes AAA batteries so you don't have to worry about a rechargeable tough-to-find battery that dies within a year.  Highly recommend rechargable NiMH batteries.  Alkalines or rechargable alkalines don't last very long. - FM receiver with lots of presets.  I probably use this as much or more than the MP3 capability.  I live in a city and the reception is quite good. - It's tough.  I keep mine in my purse in an empty mint tin padded on the inside with felt.  My purse gets dropped, thrown, and generally beat up and the player has not suffered at all. - Secure armband that fits even people with small arms.  Great for working out. - Price.  If you are looking for a good, reliable MP3 player for working out and traveling and don't care about putting your entire collection in it, this is a great choice.  Lots of functionality for the price. - No USB cord, plugs directly into USB port.  Con's: - Does make a slight buzzing noise when the backlight is on.  It has never bothered me, however, and you can minimize it by minimizing the amount of time the backlight stays on. - Max volume is somewhat low though I have never had to max it out, even in a noisy gym. - Did have a problem with the FM presets getting erased if the battery got extremely low.  I only had this problem with rechargable alkalines and it went away when I switched to NiMH.  My husband has the identical MP3 player and has always used NiMH batteries.  He has never had this problem.

<Title>Less than it appears
<Date>Tue Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was all set to like the MuVo TX FM - it was small, but the important controls were easy to get at and I liked the design where it plugged right into a USB port.  I bought this for my wife to use during multi-hour car trips to visit her mother (along with a Belkin Tunecast II, which I liked a lot, so she could listen through the car radio.)  I loaded it up with several of her favorite albums, using Windows Media Player 10.  Very easy.  Showed her how to use it, and she was on her way.  She called me on arrival to say that the player worked fine - but why did it play one song from one album, then one song from a second album, then a song from a third, and back to the first again?  I was puzzled and annoyed.  Had I somehow set it into a strange playimg mode?  At home, I read through the manual, not seeing anything that could explain it.  Several days later she gets home and I take the player to look for myself.  What I discovered was that WMP10 had copied all the song files to the "root directory", so that it played them all in alphabetical order!  Since the tracks were prefixed by the track number, it played all the track 1 songs, then all the track 2 songs, etc.  Yuck.  Ok - my mistake.  I see that WMP10 has a setting to use folders, and I can see from the manual that the player can use folders.  Fine - recopy the albums with folders, turn on the player, and.. what the... "No Music"?!?!?!  I mount the player and look at the contents.  There's a top level Music folder, then folders for the artists, then folders for the albums, then the songs - just the way it appears on my disk.  My Rio Carbon (love it!) has no problem with this.  Hmm...  Some experimentation shows that the MuVo TX can "see" only one level of folders - any more levels and it's helpless.  WMP10 can't, automatically, flatten the file structure to the right amount.  Sigh.  Ok, load Creative's MediaSource application - surely it can deal with the MuVo, right?  Wrong.  Not only can MediaSource NOT store the songs in the right folder structure, but it annoyingly creates two entries in its library for each track I have, one with a track number prefixed and one without.  Furthermore, the user interface is far inferior to WMP10, lacking the multiple view options WMP10 has.  So it seemed that the only way to get the MuVo to play songs in the correct order was to drag-and-drop the individual album folders and to name the songs in track order.  Sorry, that's just too much work, so back went the MuVo to the store.  Right now, I don't know what I'll buy instead, but it isn't going to be anything from Creative (and that includes the Dell Pocket DJ, which had looked intriguing until I found out what it was underneath.)

<Content>A previous review said that you couldn't skip to the middle of a song with a MuVo.  Not sure what the reviewer meant by that, but you can fast forward or reverse within a track by holding the jog wheel in the forward or reverse position.  This feature isn't mentioned in the skimpy Quick Start guide that's included with the MuVo.  To learn about all of the features go to Creative's website and download the complete 75-page user manual.

<Title>Versatile -  Compact -  Covenient - Worth the Price
<Date>Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before you buy, first do a price comparison at Bizrate.com or Pricegrabber.com because I recently noticed the prices have come down since I purchased mine.  Even though I have the 256 MB version, I would recommend getting the 1 GB version, which is the most memory in this particular plug and play model.  The plug and play feature is so handy and dispels the need for an extra USB cable.  And because the player is also 2.0 flash/jump drive, you can store any kind of file on it--WORD, PDF, JPEG, WAV--Whatever you want!    Regarding the EARBUDS, they are designed to sit in out ear with the short shafts resting over your earlobes.  They are not meant to fit inside your ear canal.  However, I found the buds burned my ears after 30 or so minutes of usage.  If you find the buds bother your ears too, check out the Koss brand.  They makes a  respectable variety of headphones and earbuds around $20.  I like the Koss buds that wrap around my ears.  Regarding the FM radio, forget trying to find stations manually, which I found a waste of time.  Choose the auto prescan mode and the device will preset all the stations that come in your area.  If you travel, you'll need to do another scan.  Using this funtion, you will get around 10-25 stations.    Also the microphone/recorder too is a great tool and gives you the freedom to dictate your thoughts wherever you are.  Purchasing a digital recorder separately can cost around $50 or more so this feature is a delightful extra.   Lastly, if you're an avid user, you may want to consider getting a rechargable battery set-up.  Ray-O-Vac makes a great one that comes with the 15 minute recharger, 2 AAA rechargable batteries (which this device uses) and 2 AA rechargable batteries (which a lot of other devices use as well.  There's also a car adapter with this product.  I hope you enjoy this toy as much as I do :0)~

<Title>Good so far: the MuVo TX FM Digital Audio
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't have any long-term usage data on this player yet, but wanted to give my impressions (since I relied on the reviews when making my selection.) This gizmo will replace my long string of CD/tape players at the gym; which after several players I've found the weakest link to be the plug to player connector - where the player is okay, but the connector on the player starts to cause the music to cut out (bad interconnect @ player.) I've taken a couple players apart and the ear jack solder connection generally breaks away from the printed circuit board. I don't think I treat my players badly, but more or less never think about them at all, so if I drop my gym bag or leave it in the car for a week-I just don't pay attention to it (or the player sitting in the bag.) I decided to time how quickly I could get my MuVo TX FM Digital Audio player playing music that I down loaded to it.  The preloaded demo starts playing as soon as you install the battery.  1.	@3 min. mark: Finally cut through packaging. Used a pocket knife, but was trying to be careful, this would be a hard package to return no matter how you try to hack through it.  2.	@9 min mark: After plugging the player into my d-link USB hub: XP did not detect it (and still doesn't.) Reboot=detect. Ready to download.  3.	@16min17sec mark: Music Downloaded (USB 1.x - I think). I had 250Mb pre-RIPped CD music using Winows Media Player (WMP) ready and waiting. I was surprised WMP has a tab just for this - I'm not interested in the whole music downloading craze so I never looked to see if WMP was prepared to do something like this. Although the hd folder size says 250Mb I got a "disk full, change disk" error before full download. Player does not care - it just did not accept all the files.  4.	@16min51sec mark: music playing.  5.	@23 min mark: Finally figured out how to scroll to different directories and change music. I thought I was stuck in a sub-menu, but I don't think I scrolled in one direction enough times - to get to the folder called "skip folder" (for some reason.) "skip folder" allows you to change CD's/folders. Wait for rollover.   6.	@55min mark: Set mine up, played with it, and download (after stupid reboot) my 2nd player (for my wife)   I hate to pile on the guy who sent his back (see other review)  because it was too complicated, but if this thing is too much to figure out, I hope you are a university professor because you are unsafe in the real world. For size, I cannot even compare it to my Sony Walkman CD player, which I had to pack around in a fanny pack. I don't like fanny packs - if you do: see the previous paragraph. It is 3"x1.75"x0.5" or your index and middle finger side by side. I was able to store almost 7-full (.WMA) cd's on it. I can go months w/o changing music for working out, but checked the FM tuner; the gym has tv's with tuner frequencies if I want to hear sports or O'reilly while working out. BTW. The users manual and packaged software are untouched. If I have a problem with the player I'll update this or repost, otherwise no news is good news.  Wayne  EDIT: I WANTED TO ALSO ADD THAT THE BATTERY WILL GO DEAD AFTER ABOUT 1 MONTH OF NON-USE. I GUESS THE ON/OFF MONITORING DRAWS ENOUGH JUICE TO DRAIN THE BATTERY. MAY BE BETTER TO USE A ON/OFF SWITCH SINCE THE SYSTEM USES FLASH (DOES NOT NEED POWER TO MAINTAIN STORAGE)

<Title>Multiple problems with this player
<Date>Mon Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered this MP3 player for my daughter for Christmas.  Two months later, after endless problems with it, I finally gave up and returned it.  It's possible that the particular unit we had was just defective, but since I've seen quite a few complaints similar to mine on Google groups, these defects may be fairly common.  The problems mostly fell into two categories: 1) power-related and 2) skipping or stopping in the middle of songs.     The power problems got more and more mysterious.  In the beginning (first week or so), there were no problems.  Then, the player went through a period when it would suddenly turn itself off.  We tried testing the battery that was in it (they always turned out to be fine) or just replacing the battery anyway, but that wouldn't help.  In fact, then we started seeing the next set of problems.  Putting in a new battery would make all sorts of strange things happen.  Certain songs wouldn't play, or the player would always turn itself off during certain songs, or would claim that it only contained a few songs.  Looking at the contents of the player on a computer, everything appeared to be as it should.  Finally, the last straw, the player began refusing to turn on.  My daughter, being very patient and persistent, discovered that she could get it to go on by pressing the power and shuffle buttons at the same time.  It wouldn't always stay on, however.     The second problem was just as mysterious and random.  My daughter would be listening to a song one moment and the next time she tried to listen to it the player would either refuse to play it, stop playing it in the middle and shut the player off, or not show the song as a possible choice at all.  There seemed to be no pattern to the problems, whether or not we had connected the player to the computer in between playing the songs, for instance.  Things would play one moment and simply not play the next.   Most other reviewers of this player obviously didn't have the troubles we did, so maybe this is an aberration.  They also don't say, though, what the source of their music was or how often they were adding/removing songs.  I sometimes wondered if we'd just loaded the contents of several CDs onto the player and left it alone if it would have worked.  Instead, we were adding one song at a time, bought on various music sites, both WMA and MP3 formats.     Other than the frustrating problems we'd encountered, the player seemed like it would have been easy to use.  So, if it works for you, great, but before you buy one you may want to check the reviews on Google groups.

<Content>This is my second Mp3 player and it's the best by far. It is very small, very portable, and very easy to carry around. It comes with: belt clip, which is very nicely designed and fits on perfect. You won't even notice it is there. Headphones: started out fine, but I would recommend getting some new ones because the ones they provide do not last long. No USB cable or cord for media on computer. This is the easiest it will get, you simply pull out the bottom of the mp3 player and put it into your USB slot in your computer and drag and drop the songs you want into the desired folder. It is so easy and you can do this on any computer at any place during anytime. Because there are no cords and no software needed to transfer music. Also, the mp3 player acts as a USB drive. You can transfer files, pictures, documents, etc. with ease. This is one of the best Mp3 players out there at one of the best prices.

It comes with a workout strap and an adequate set of ear buds.  You can organize your music files in folders.  The FM is just as good as your car stereo!  Whenever I've had a portable radio, the channels never came in as well as a stand alone, or car stereo.  Well, this actually does it quite well and I find myself using the radio feature as well.  And they're so comfortable that I'll even fall asleep in bed while listening.  You can not go wrong with this MP3 player/jumpdrive/FM radio/new best friend!  Get it!  -Oh and for those who say it breaks easy ... they must really manhandle their stuff.  These are electronic devices - not hockey pucks!

<Content>I bought two of these players in May, and one of the is already virtually useless. The screen has stopped displaying information, altho the player still works. Considering that all the options (sound, volume, file structure, etc) are normally displayed on the screen, some of the options are not accessible.  I tried to reset the drive, but there is not reset function or button anywhere. I did download and install the latest firmware for it, but that didn't fix it either. I found a support forum on Creative's website that has other users with the same problem.  I can still use this for transporting files, and even listening to music, but I do not recommend it. I contacted Creative's support and was told that I would have to pay 25.00 for a RMA just to have it looked at, which is half the cost of a new player. I will probably be going with the Sandisk player next time.

<Title>Very user friendly
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The sound quality is superb.  It's well designed and easy to control once you learn how to use it. The belt clip and arm band make it great for working out. It's very compact, so it's easy to take it everywhere.  A possible downside is that 256 MB of memory is not a lot compared to other players, but you can always delete tracks and put new ones in. If you must have all your music available at all times, then you should look for a player with more memory. The FM sound quality is great. The software and USB plug make it easy to rip tracks and organize your music into folders.  It's a great entry-level player at a relatively low price.

<Title>Love it - great product
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Very easy to use and it works great.  My only complaint is that the battery life doesn't seem to be too long.  6-8 hours?  Maybe that is standard.  Otherwise, loading and changing music is very easy.  256 MB holds about 50 songs - I might go with a larger one to get more songs, but for my purposes it works great.  Highly recommended for runners - I use it all the time.

<Title>It will break - trust me. 
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player in June and within a month it began to distintegrate: horrible distortion in sound, screen slowly began to blank out completely, etc. It became unplayable. I contacted Creative and was told to try the firmware download that supposedly corrects this exact problem, which means that many, many units must have done the same thing. I was unable to get the download to work, so Creative informed me that for $25 I could send the unit back for repair. This is a third of the price of purchase!  I will not be buying another Creative product - terrible customer service. I own another micro Creative mp3 player that also broke down, although it took it a year to do so. I am very disappointed with both the product and the customer service.

<Title>Excellent, better than an iPod shuffle
<Date>Mon Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been using creative products for over 10+ years - started with soundblasters and now in mp3 and they have been making excellent products from then to now.  What do I love my muvo ? + Cute and compact + Nice looking LCD display (ipod shuffle does'nt have this) + MP3 & FM (ipod shuffle does'nt have FM) + Record FM radio into mp3 (not in ipod shuffle) + Record your own voice & lectures (not in ipod shuffle) + No need for custom software(ipod shuffle requires custom s/w) + FM Presets - store your favourite channels + Easily available batteries (AA) + Flash drive, no micro drives (which have moving parts) + International FM tuning support - US FM channels are like 101.3, 97.3 etc, but in India, frequencies are 91.0, 101.0.  Some FM tuners do not even tune to .0 frequences.  But Muvo has been made flexible enough to tune to all frequencies  What I do not like about muvo ? - Wish if they had made the mp3 player seperate from the USB memory so that you could plug any memory card into the mp3 player.  So I buy a 256 MB player, but if I want to expand it to 1 GB, I just buy a different memory stick.  - Better quality earphones with volume control in the earphone cable  I also own an ipod shuffle 1 GB - which is pretty good as well, but i like my muvo better.

<Title>Cheers for the Customer Service
<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I completely agree with the positive comments made by previous reviewers regarding the Creative MuVo TX FM 256 MB MP3 Player. As I am 66 years old and walk 45 minutes daily, I have found MP3 to be a much more convenient music delivery system than CD players. Three days after I received an iPod Shuffle, I gave it to my friendly cab driver for his young son. In agreement with many previous reviewers, I am delighted with the performance of the MuVo TX. Perhaps I missed it, but I haven't seen any comments about the excellent customer service. I called Creative twice shortly after my machine arrived. The customer service representative was friendly, knowledgeable and behaved as though his sole purpose in life was to answer my questions. I use my machine daily, have changed all of the music a couple of times and will buy Creative in the future.

<Title>On Voice Recording
<Date>Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this mp3 player, ultimately, for its voice recording function.  I wanted an inexpensive digital voice recorder (because I was tired of my tape recorder) that fit my needs, and so I refrained on buying anything until I could see it in action, especially since no one really explores the voice recording functions very much in their reviews.  Therefore, my review will focus more on the player as a digital recorder.  On first glance: --When you look at it, the microphone is just a tiny hole on the front of the player, so I didn't expect very much from it.  But the microphone is actually deceptively effective, in that it picks up far more and far better than I had thought it would.  On proximity: --Being a singer, I use this gadget to record my voice lessons.  I've set it about 15 feet away from both me and the piano, and the recordings sound great--you'd never guess it was sitting so far away.  When I put the recorder on the piano, there was a bit of buzz from the reverb of the piano (which, honestly, was to be expected), but not so much that it really bothered me.  The optimal position for this situation is probably about 5 feet away from the piano and you.  On usability: --Other digital recorders usually have multiple settings (i.e. good quality, better quality, and best quality), but as this is an mp3 player first, it's not surprising that it only has one setting.  It records as relatively small .wav format files, which allows for the 16 hours of recording time.  The controls are not initially instinctive, but easy to get used to, and once you do, it's really easy to navigate.  On practicality: --It's not something that you would take with you to a college classroom to record a professor's lecture from 30 rows back, but for voice lessons, it's just fine.  The quality is comparable to tapes, which is fine for me, because that's what I'm used to.  On what others have said: --I wasn't planning on writing about any of the other functions, but I disagree with some of what the other reviewers wrote. 1)  If you have Windows 2000 or higher, you do not need to even touch the software they provide.  The player works like a flash drive, and you can drag and drop mp3s, wmvs, and wavs to and from your computer without the software.  It does not need a driver (if you have Windows 2000 or higher, of course), and can work straight out of the box. 2)  There is a way to change the settings so that you can scroll through the songs during playback.  Granted, it doesn't actually skip through very quickly, but it can be done.  I don't know that I would pay $60 for this, though; but that could just be because I was only looking for an inexpensive digital recorder, and never intended to spend more than $30 in the first place.  I got it at Cambridge Soundworks on Black Sunday for $20 because it was an older model that they were trying to get rid of.  Needless to say, I have been very happy with my purchase.

<Title>a good inexpensive choice
<Date>Sun Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Most difficult part of the set-up for this product was getting it out of the packaging.  But a pair of scissors and one very sharp knife later, I was good to go.  I found I had to reboot the computer (Windows XP Pro) in order for the USB drive to be detected.  I also found it replaced one of my existing remote drives rather than creating a new one.  Don't worry, once you stop the USB drive so you can "safely remove device" the previous remote drive mapping comes back.    I found it holds about 45 songs (mostly mp3 but a few wma).  I could easily drag and drop songs from any Window's explorer window onto the player, and I did not need to install any player software.  Whatever order they are in the explorer window is the order they play in "normal playback" mode.  It also works well as a mass storage device.  I was able to put both music files and a PowerPoint presentation on the drive, and still listen to the music files.  When using the player PowerPoint (and other incompatible files) don't show up when you scroll through using the player's lcd interface.   FM radio works great (except in the basement of my work, but nothing works there).  Also, the battery use is much lower when using the radio.  Main complaint: the earphones are not that great and too big for my small ears anyway.  Also, more colors than just white would be nice.  People using Audible.com to download audiobooks should note that only type 2 and 3 audiobooks are compatible with this player.  Overall a great choice for the price.

Once I download the software upgrade from creative's web site(it runs on your PC and upgrades the software in the MuVo) and ran it, the device worked (and still works) great! It really p***ed me off that the MuVo really, really didn't work right without doing that. Wow. Go ahead, Creative, ship crap and fix it later??? What about folks who don't realize they can/should/have-to go to your web site and search for a software (firmware) upgrade to make this thing work? The product management team that shipped this device in not quite working shape should be fired immediately.

<Title>Fit 8 hrs with WMA
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i've had mine for almost a month now, haven't had ANY problems.  The only problem is that the headphones are cheap quality i would recommend a cheap sony headphones they make a big difference. I use wma at 64 kbps(i found this was the same quality as mp3's @ 192kbps), meaning i can fit 130 songs about 7-8 hrs in a 256mb player, which is equivalent or better than the IPOD shuffle at 512mb, which only allows mp3's. And u can put albums into different folders so u can select them quickly.  The software is excellent, it can rip or convert files into mp3 or wma directly to the player. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

<Title>Great player for the price
<Date>Tue Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I first purchased this mp3 player, I already had one. This one was a HUGE upgrade. This is probably the best Flash Based Mp3 Player out there right now. It is roughly $90 and you get everything.   First off, it has a very nice and bright LCD screen. The screen is kind of small, but it still shows all the information you would ever need to see.   The battery life is awesome. For one AAA battery, the player will last 30 hours. That's plenty, and even if you plan on listening to it constantly, it's very easy to replace the battery. Just carry around a little battery in your pocket, and it will be replaced fast and conveniently. This is better than having to take it home and recharging it, this way you can change it anywhere at anytime and not worry about running out of battery.   The best part about this player is the connection via USB. There are NO cables. No cables equals no hassle. All you have to do to connect to your computer is pull out the bottom half of the Muvo and connect it to your USB slot on your computer. This is what "Plug and Go" really means. You simply connect it, transfer the music, take it out, and you're done. This is also great when you are using someone else's computer and have music you want. With the easy "Drag and Drop" method you can use it anywhere. There is no software needed to transfer music.  You can also use the Muvo as a USB "Thumb Drive" to transfer files, documents, pictures, whatever you want. So you're getting 2 in 1.   The Muvo also has a Mic for voice recording, and FM radio which is something not every player has.   Overall this player gets 4 stars out of 5 for me because it's nearly perfect. The only thing I would change is the size of the LCD screen. I also don't like the scroll wheel, but for the price it's all worth it.

<Title>A couple of issues keep it from 4-5 stars..
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I read all the reviews of this player and decided to purchase.  There's a lot to like about it.  First off, the price is right.  Lots of value for the buck.  Size is perfect for taking to gym or out running, which is what I was looking for, primarily.  I can't wait to hit the road.  This is going to be so much better than my FM radio that I was using.  No 15 minute strings of commercials!  Ok, I just opend the package and was I listening to music in about 20 minutes (and that includes ripping some cd tracks to the pc.  Build quality seems very acceptable, but time will better tell that story.    Audio quality (MP3 128) is very good.  A couple of negative things I noticed: Volume (mp3 listening) is a good bit lower than I expected.  The volume display ranges 1-40.  A setting of 20 is way too low for even background listening (and I'm in a virtually silent setting).  I'm probably going to have to keep it set at top volume (40) most of the time.   I'm really hoping this is caused by inefficient (included) earbuds.  Otherwise, It's definitely not going get to the volume I like for running.  I sometimes need that loud, hard driving music after the mileage starts to pile up.    Also, the volume is a little quirky when listening to FM radio.  Top volume is significantly louder than MP3 listening.  Strangely, the jump between the "32" and "33" setting is a really big leap.    Not sure how, but I'm gonna see if I can determine if these things are the norm with the MUVO TX FM, or if my unit is somehow defective.  If not for the volume issues (and there pretty critical issues in for me) I'd really love this player.  As it is, it may have to go back.  I hate that, because it really seems almost perfect for me in all other aspects.

<Title>Great
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Owned product for... 8 hours.  Alright, first of all, this is a great mp3 player. The earphones might be horrible, and if you take off the covering off the buds, it might bruise your ears like no tomorrow. But the sound quality is good. Very easy to use, didn't even have to read the manual. Just like it promised, drag and drop and your done. Took me less than 2 minutes to cut the packaging open and to attach it to my computer and start dragging and dropping songs.  I would've just like the case for the mp3 player to have a plastice covering all around instead of just half. And maybe if they gave a lanyard. Then again it is a bargain to get this item, I would reccommend it for anyone.

<Title>Got my money's worth!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this model after my previous MP3 player stopped working.  Not only was it cheaper than the other one had been, but it also works much better.  There are no cords to connect from the device to the computer, which is one less thing for people to keep track of!  And the process of putting songs onto the device is very simple as well.  As a couple of people mentioned, however, the design of the USB portion isn't as nice as it could be.  If your USB ports are at all recessed into the computer, this device won't work.  I have a laptop, so there's no problem, but I know some desktops would have issues with this design.  Also, the earbuds are uncomfortable...but then, earbuds by nature aren't very comfortable!  I have small ears, so they don't fit very well, and after about half an hour of wearing them, they start to hurt.  I would recommend buying a pair of sport headphones.  Otherwise, I've had no complaints about this device.  Right now, I have a little over 2 hours' worth of music downloaded, and there's still room for much more!

<Title>90 day wonder
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product would receive 5 stars if it were still working properly.  It was wonderful for the first 100 days or so and I loved most every aspect of it.  I was just about to add to the rave reviews when it failed.  A few days after the warranty expired, it stopped working properly.  First it wouldn't turn on.  After repeated tries, it powered on but I can no longer access the plus volume control nor can I use the scroller knob to access the other functions.  I can still load songs, but cannot raise the volume or use the fm or recording functions.  Creative will not provide any help after the 90 day warranty period, and the suggestion on the web site to reformat the player does not help.  I can still use it as an extra drive--but it is a huge disappointment, especially since I loved it so.  I suggest getting an extended warranty if you buy this product.

I also workout a lot and the package came with a very exceptional armband and case. I love everything about the MuVo TX. Cool thing is, if I get tired of hearing my own music, I can always turn to the radio. Get one of these. You will not be disappointed. And the price? Very reasonable.

<Title>MuVo For The Money
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my second Creative purchase.  I have been very please with the service and performance.  There is a screen to view the song titles as they play and has many features to enhance the listening experience.  Plus, there is FM with 20 (I think) presets when you get tired of your mp3s.  The mp3 folder can be shuffled to give the feeling of listening to Sirius or XM.  The player is very small when taken out of the holder and can double as a flash memory if you don't fill it up with mp3s.  It is drag and drop simple.  Even in the case which houses the battery, it is very small and works well as an exercise player. Over all for the price, I am very happy with my player and will buy Creative products in the future.

<Title>Player will not play when pressing play/pause button
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I Purchased this unit from Wally World last night. Transferred a few music files using Windows Media Player 10 and hoped for the best. Well, all we could play was the Demo from Creative. So I decided to format. Reloaded files, again using WMP. This time the songs scrolled across the bottom of the screen. I Pushed play, but as soon as I released the play button, it would instantly switch to "stop" and the only thing I could hear through the headphones was a slight whirring sound (like the sound a CD player makes when it's at the end of the disk and doesn't automatically shut off). After 2+ hours of trying to install firmware upgrades, reformating, reloading songs, etc. I remembered reading somewhere in my internet meanderings about the graphic equalizer settings. I navigated to the custom EQ icon, moved one slider and wouldn't you know it . . .MUSIC. I then set the EQ back to normal and it plays fine. This player is only 20 minutes old for us, so as to its longevity I cannot speak. I simply post this as a tech support idea. Lord knows the manual and the creative web site are a helpless bunch of drivell.

<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recieved this mp3 player for christmas last year. I lost the instructions, but I really didn't need them. It's very simple to use. The only problem is getting the thing connected to the computer. Of course my dad did that for me. If you need to know how to do that I'm sure it's in the owners mannuel. I like having the built in microphone. If I'm bored I'll just play around with voices and stuff. I can also use it like a diary type thing. Some songs do skip, but that is because of my computer not the mp3 player. The song quality is excellent and it holds more than enough songs for me.  Pros:  - Good quality sound - More than enough songs - easy to use - microphone - Good radio reception - comes with belt clip and arm band - great price - easy to load songs on - you can sort songs into folders so it's easy to find them - volume goes loud enough so that I can turn it all  the way up, stand at the other side of the room and still hear it - very durable  Cons:  - ear bud things hurt my ears  I would highly reccomend buying rechargeable batteries.

<Title>so easy to use
<Date>Tue Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am not technically savvy.  My truck is from 1990, I don't own a cell phone, and my TV has a knob that you push or pull for on and off, and a dial that goes all the way up to channel 13.    When I first started shopping for an mp3 player I wanted something that would be easy to use, that was compatible with Windows Media Player, and that didn't cost a lot.  After comparing a lot of brands and reading a lot of customer reviews on various websites I settled on the Creative MuVo N200 256 MB player.      Shipping was really fast, and the player arrived in about 7 days.  When it first arrived I couldn't believe how tiny it was, only 1 inch by 2 inches by an inch and it weighed less than 1 ounce.  I didn't believe it could do very much, or sound very good, but I can't believe how much stuff they can pack into a box the size of a tic tac pack.      It includes a 5-band equalizer with 4 preset functions (rock, jazz, classical or pop) or the option of customizing and storing you own settings.  It also includes a FM radio with the ability to record either FM broadcasts, through a microphone, or through a line in.  It can be a mass storage device, and even has a pretty blue backlight that you can adjust how long it stays on for.  The LCD can even be flipped over for left handed people, and yet the controls on the player itself are simple to use.  A volume up or down button, a play/pause/stop/fast forward/rewind button, and a knob that you either flick left or right or push to page through songs or features.   It even came with an armband, a battery, headphones and a protective rubber sleeve with belt clip. The ear bud headphones it came with were a little big for my ears but had bass boost and sounded great. The overall sound on the player is great too, except for a little background hiss when the LCD light is on, and that only lasts for a few seconds. The player itself will hold 4-6 hours of music, and the AAA battery lasts about 15 hours.  I've found that rechargeable batteries are the way to go.    The software is easy to use, just load the included software disk into the computer and follow the on screen directions.  It has mostly drag and drop features that let you make custom playlists and separate your music into folders.  It also works great with Windows Media Player and I was able to figure everything out and load my first songs in about 20 minutes.      In the first couple of weeks that I owned the player it developed the habit of the LCD freezing up when I pushed a button.  I called customer support (for free under their standard 30 day warranty) and was connected to a real live person who easily walked me through updating the software and the rebooting process, and I haven't had a problem since.  After 4 months I am still amazed at how convenient the player is. At the grocery store I can just slip my headphones on and the sounds of muzak and screaming children disappear.  If I need to write a paper for college I can work on a computer on campus then download the document into the player, in a matter of seconds via the 2.0 USB connection, and take it to any other computer to continue my writing.  With an accessory I bought at Wal-Mart I don't have to worry about carrying CD's in the truck, scratching them up, and having them skip when I'm 4X4ing.  I can plug the player into the tape deck of my truck through the headphone jack and have enough songs for a weekend road trip or a weeks worth of commutes.      All in all I think I got a great deal for $63.95 (plus shipping and handling), my only regret with this player is that I didn't spend the few extra bucks for larger memory.

<Title>Purchased this yesterday..
<Date>Sat Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had been looking for an MP3 player for a month now.  A friend suggested this one to me.  I was looking at Ipod Minis.  However, 4GB was too much space for me.  When I saw this player I was impressed, plus it has an FM RADIO and you can record from the radio to listen to later... come on people!!!!  I love that I didnt have to charge this for hours.  Just placed the AAA battery in and I was ready.  Transferring songs from my computer to the player was sooo easy!! I haven't had to use the software at all.  It took me about 5 minutes to copy 55 songs onto my player.  I love the fact that if I don't want to listen to my songs, I can switch over to the FM Radio!!  Using the radio for the first time was very easy.  It just scanned all the channels.  Then let me delete and save stations on my presets!  The player was alot smaller than I had imagined.  I keep saying it's the size of a Trident Gum Package.  I love it!  Mine came in white.  However, I was looking on the Creative Labs website and they have battery modules in different colors.  So you can change the color!!!  All in all, I am wayy super happy with this find.  If 256MB is too small for you, you can always buy the 516MB.  But like I said, I was able to fit 55 songs.  Plus, have the option to jam to the radio.  The earphones have not bothered me at all.  I do have small ears as well.    Good buy.

<Content>I find this thing mind boggeling.  I could not download a song to it, the earpiece wire was completely fouled up (two inches of lead on one side and 14" on the other) i tried to slide it back in place and it broke,and it keeps playing that stupid demo which is driving me nuts.

<Title>User Friendly!
<Date>Wed Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Since so many other people have talked about how wonderful this player is, I thought I didn't have to say anything. However,I saw one review that talked about un-user-friendly it was even though she owned four computers.   I don't own four computers, but I work with computers a lot and am VERY critical of applications which are not user-friendly. I would rate the controls on this A+.   I never opened the manual and did all the stuff I wanted to do within 30 minutes of opening the package. In fact, it was fun to try out all the stuff to see what they did without reading the manual.   I have had mine since the first of the year and I am still trying things out. I listen to audible.com books, the radio, music ripped from CDs, save data files to the drive, have recorded from FM stations and notes to myself. I haven't gotten tired of it. It's fun just to have around and try things out.

<Title>Excellent alternative to iPod Shuffle
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I already own a 40 GB Archos that plays video (with a huge color screen), but the size and weight of that player make it a tad inconvenient to port around, especially when I only want to listen to music. I carried an iPod Shuffle around for about a week and I liked the look and size of that little gadget but I felt that it had some drawbacks, like not being able to select the song I want or see which song is playing. I also felt the price was a bit steep considering the limited features. So, I began my search. To make a long story short I chose the Creative MuVo. The 256 MB model is about $20 cheaper than the iPod, it has an FM Tuner, and a digital recorder. There are larger models available, but I've found that the 256 MB size works for me. Because the device is USB 2.0, just like iPod, it can also be used to store regular data (PowerPoint files, photos, etc). So far, I'm completely thrilled with it. It only weighs about 1 oz and it's about the size of a pack of Dentine gum when it's not in the beltclip. Also, as a Digital Designer, I must mention the success of the interface. It's very intuitive and simple to navigate. I'm impressed with the amount of functionality they've been able to pack into so few buttons without making it difficult to use. The Upside: great functionality, tiny size, FM Tuner (with programmable presets), good price-point, displays ID3 tags (song titles), good sound, digital recorder, audio equalizer, and the power to choose your song. I really like the power to choose. The DownSide: no lanyard (which would have been very useful), a mediocre belt clip, awkward headphones. I don't use the armband that's included, but the small size of the player permits me to drop it into my shirt pocket when I'm at work and I don't even know it's there. With the money I saved over the iPod, I bought a nice pair of earbuds and a bag of groceries. This is the third MP3 player that I have owned and one of many that I've used. I'm very happy with this purchase. Even though I adore Apple's design and branding, I'd recommend the Muvo as the better value because of the higher number of features combined with a lower price.

<Title>First MP3 Player for My Daughter
<Date>Tue May 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this as an Xmas present for my daughter.  It is the first MP3 player we have owned.  I wanted a flash based player so my daughter could jog with it.  This plays protected WMA files from internet music stores as well as music we rip from our CDs.  It holds about 4 hours of music recorded at 128 kps.  It also has FM tuner.    No drivers are required to move music from computer to player, which was one of my requirements.  You can use Windows Explorer to drag and drop music you rip from your own CDs.  But you must use an application like Windows Media Player or MusicMatch Jukebox if  you want to transfer protected files (DRM) from online music stores.  The battery life is pretty good.  The only downside is that as of the time of this writing, I could now go out and by the 512 mb model for what I paid for the 256 mb model.  The 1 gb models are getting down there in the same range.  But that is always the case with electronics like this.  Bottom line is my daughter has been very pleased with it.  And she has been using it for 4 months without any sort of problems.  Next Xmas she may be getting the Zen Micro 5 gb.

<Title>Great Mp3 Player!
<Date>Thu May 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recieved this mp3 player for x-mas. I didn't have to read the directions because it's so simple to use. It is hard for me to plug it to the thing in the computer.( of course I'm only eleven so...) Anyways the earphones hurt my ears and often fall out. Another thing I don't like is it always skips in the middle of songs. I like the fact that you can record things, but it's hard to understand yourself. Something I do like is the accesories. It comes with a belt clip and an armband. I don't use these but my dad often borrows it and he finds them useful. My mom uses it too. BEWARE: IF YOU GET ONE BE PREPARED TO SHARE!!! I also recieved rechargable batteries which are a life saver. I would definately recommend getting some. In the end this is a great mp3 player. It comes with a couple minor glitches but nothings perfect. (speaking of perfect please excuse my spelling in this review)

<Title>Theoretically wonderful product - If it worked!
<Date>Fri May 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It seemed like a wonderful product.  I loaded mp3s and used it a few days. I put the unit away for some time.  When I tried using it again, the unit would not power on.  Tried new battery, of course.  It only works as a thumb drive now.  I have read many forum posts describing this same problem.  It is clear to me there's some design flaw.  It is also suspicious they would offer only a 90 day warranty.  Fixing it now would not be worth it given its low price.  It is the size of a disposable lighter - but I though the similarity would end at that.

<Title>I have had 4 of these and they work well but...
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...the only flag is the capacity. You really want more space, 512. So, four stars.   I bought one for me, for my brother, my cousins.... for over 6 months.   Look, after checking around a lot, I decided to try creative labs mp3 players. The  best is the TX line. I have seen sandisk (for about the same price) and ipod mini, therefore the comparison would be with this. Iriver, RCA lyra and others do not seem to be so nice, simple and small like this.  The pros are simple and if you do not agree, then you can choose another one.  This muvo (on 512) is better than Ipod mini, because of the extra functions.  This muvo is better than sandisk version, because of the design and earphones quality.   That is all.  Documents, software, navigation screen, etc. do not seem to be a significative difference for myself.   WARNING: I have heard some people complaining that after about 4 months (only 3 months of warranty), the device die.  It seems to be a very rare event. It is a a matter of statistics. So, use it a lot before 3 months. If it is gonna die, then it will be during warranty period.
