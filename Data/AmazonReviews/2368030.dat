<Title>The eGo does a lot more than I expected
<Date>Mon May 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I bought the 32MB eGo player about 4 months ago.  Since then, the company who makes it, i2Go, has made tons of improvements which I just download from the desktop software, the MP3Agent.  I love it.  I use it a lot in my  car - it can play through the car stereo.  The coolest is that I can drag  and drop my MP3 files from my own collection OR go to i2Go's website and  build a program that is the stuff I want to listen to - like news, sports,  weather, entertainment info, and music.  <p>I'm actually going to buy more  memory (an additional 64MB) from i2Go because I find it better than  listening to the radio - more customized for me.  The customization,  expandability and upgradeability options are awesome!<p>I have played with  a friends MP3 player (not an eGo) and the eGo has great sound quality  too.<p>I highly recommend this product for someone who spends a lot of time  on the go.

<Title>Best MP3 Player for your Money!
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Overall, this player packs more punch than all the others. No other player can compete in storage capacity (you can buy additional storage  to the 32MB included here), and the eGo has more innovative features, such as  MP3Mail and Interactivity. Using the i2Go website, you can customize your  own news, sports, and weather content for downloading to your eGo. The eGo  can also load an IBM microdrive for a whopping 340mb of storage space, or  680mb if you buy two microdrives and the optional Compact Flash Expansion  Slot! Also, it's not locked into a certain amount of memory, you can add  more as the flash card technology improves. It's also slick-looking and  perfect for the car. The eGo is a great product and well worth the money.
