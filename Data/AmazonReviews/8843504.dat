<Title>fun features, but not reliable
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I loved the write-up on this  item...especially compared to the ipod Shuffle (which I have). But there are so many times I can't get the darn thing to start!  My ipod always starts and runs for a long time.  The battery on this one doesn't last very long at all.  Maybe I got a lemon?...not sure.

<Title>Mine was defective.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Even though my Sansa Clip ended up being defective (worked fine for a few days, then wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple hours and then it just stopped working completely after only a couple weeks), I'm still giving it 4 stars.  I'm just baffled by the sound that this puppy puts out.  "Awesome" is the only way to put it!  Pros: 1.  Compact size 2.  AWESOME sound 3.  I love having the radio option 4.  Holds a lot of songs 5.  The price is great 6.  I love the whole look/design of it. 7.  Easy to operate  Cons: 1.  The earphones (I should note that the previous review calling them "Earbuds" could be misleading, they are not actually Earbud brand, just the "generic" ones you get with pretty much everything)  2.  The rechargeable battery cannot be replaced so, down the road, once it dies, it's done. 3.  USB charging... I'm not a fan of this idea in general 4.  Instructions included only covered the very basics.  Would have liked the actual manual that you can find on SanDisk's site. 5.  The clip isn't strong enough to use during vigorous exercise without it falling off.  I end up just putting it in my pocket, if I have one.  Despite the cons, I love this thing!  Here's to hoping that my replacement won't turn out to be defective as well.

<Title>Good Little MP3
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a good MP3 for the cost. The size and the clip make it super convenient, especially when I exercise at the gym. It holds about 20 to 25 albums worth of music and the sound is decent. The only issue I have with it is the size of the scroll pad. If I want to fast forward through parts of a podcast, the button is small and tends to slip so I end up attempting a few times. Overall, it's very nifty!

<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had a hard time getting my PC to recognize and install this device as it came out of the box. Found a forum, figured out how to force into a mode so I could do a firmware update and got it going. I really like it now! I have a 2nd gen iPod shuffle as well...I like this one better. Easier to update (now) and the little display is very handy.

<Title>Tiny but mighty
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this little MP3 player. It is compact and easy to use and the sound is great.  Downside the battery cannot be replaced so when it dies you have to purchase a new player. The clip is fragile plastic and I expect it will not last very long but the player is so light it can actually dangle from the earbuds.

<Title>A great start on a promising product
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Sansa Clip 2Gb unit is a very good alternative to the popular iPod devices.  It is particularly good for joggers due to it's small size and the securing clip feature.  I actually have two units, one is 1Gb and the other 2Gb.  They integrate nicely with the Windows (XP or Vista) environment.  The sound quality is excellent when used with good quality ear buds or high-quality earphones (I have tested both).  The downside is the ear buds provided with the unit are not the best quality, but better quality ear buds are readily available at low cost.  The "quick start" quide provided with the unit has minimal information, and does not clearly point out that a full user manual is available at the manufacturer's Web site.  I discovered this later independently.  One positive here is that once you access that web site and install the microcode update software, the rest then becomes automatic and simple (but the enclosed documentation when you first get the unit is not very clear about this).  My main requests for improvement would include improving the original quick start documentation to make sure the user understands that the best way to proceed is to go to the company web site first.  My second request would be to provide this package size with much higher memory size, I would say at least 8Gb.  I love the small size of the unit since I play only music, not videos, which I think are not worthy of watching on a small screen.  By next year I think we can hope memory costs will be low enough to make this happen.

<Title>Ipod shuffle killer
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love my 2 year old 5th generation ipod (video) but it's kind of big and heavy and expensive to use at work or when exercising. So i've been in the market for something small, cheap and light. I considered an ipod shuffle, but then i read about this thing. A quick comparison: Shuffle has 1 gig storage, no screen, has a clip, is available in pastel colors, is very tiny and light and currently costs 80 USD. This model sansa clip has 2 gig storage, a bright color-on-black screen, a clip, is available in bold colors, is slightly larger and heavier and currently costs 60 USD. I like apple but you can't deny the bargain this Sansa thing represents. As for the Sansa itself: I think the sound is very nice once you get rid of the pack-in headphones (are those things EVER with any mp3 player you buy). The color is a snazzy metallic red with blue light-up highlights. It seems pretty sturdy (but would probably be destroyed instantly if you stepped on it). It holds a charge for more than 10 hours even with constant browsing.  Goes very loud. I just drag and drop files into it with windows 2000. One Con is the non-removable battery but at 60 bucks this thing is almost in the realm of being disposable. By the time the battery stops doing it's thing, something better will be available at this price. Or something comperable for much less. Overall I highly recommend it.

<Title>The Sansa Clip,A good looking & even a better sounding MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you're looking for a great sounding & nice looking MP3 player at a good price, this is the one you should buy, and the" OLED" screen is great & easy to see. The clip makes it easy to put any were, I use mine in the car with a cassette adapter & I clip it to my sun visor & it plays all day, the only draw back is the ear buds that come with the player, so you mite want to buy a better pair on down the road.

<Title>I just love my Sansa Clip!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When my 4-yr-old Ipod Mini's battery died, I found it would cost me big bucks to have it replaced. I looked around Amazon for reviews of cheaper MP3 players.  OK, I have to admit that I liked the red color and cute mini-Ipod look of the Sansa Clip. But the reviews were good, and the cost significantly less than just replacing the battery of the defunct Ipod. So... I bit and ordered.  I have been using it daily for going on 2 months now, and think it was a great buy. It set up and interfaces easily with Windows Media Player. It is small and lightweight and tucks easily into a pocket, or clips to a collar, lapel, etc. I've dropped it a time or two, with no effect, so appears to be pretty sturdy. The 2 GB is less than my Ipod, but I just synch often to change things around. I have to anyway to keep up with podcasts. The sound is great, with plenty of volume. The battery charge lasts for a looooong time.  The only thing I miss is that with the Sansa Clip you cannot back up incrementally within a track, as you can with an Ipod (albeit not that easily sometimes). So if that is a must, you'll want to try something else. But that has not been a big problem at all, not worth paying an additional $100-$150 for.  Oh yeah, it is even cuter than it looks in the picture, with a very easily readable, crisp color display that is super-easy to navigate.

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XQRAI6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Red)</a>  Since this is my first mp3 player, I have nothing to compare it to.  So far I have one problem, and that is the unit won't hold a charge only for a short period. I read this complaint in the review section before I purchased it, but I figured the but buyer just got a defective unit. I was on song 12 and all of sudden, the player just cut off and message came up battery low. I don't know if this is a defect, or will I have to charge this player every other hour. I don't think so. Also, headphones are sort of bulky and a little large for my ears, but they can be replaced. Since the player really sound good, looks great, and have a bunch of neat feature, I'm going to return it and get another one and see how the replacement work.  Other than the charge not holding, it's really a nice little player with great sound.  Personally, if the battery life improves, I would definitely recommend keep it.

<Title>Sansa Clip 2GB - Great MP3 Value and Performance!
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>  The Sandisk Sansa Clip 2GB is a great value MP3 player.  It has twice the capacity as the iPod Shuffle for about $50-60.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can get the 1GB version for $35.  Pros -  + good sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner (20 Presets) + voice recording   + nice design with more color options + Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via software + 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Clip Plus + Integrated Clip means no add-on case / lanyard purchase needed!  Cons  - larger body than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  The new Sandisk Sansa Clip has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the compatibility, feature, and price benefits of other MP3 players.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.    The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced VERY well for the holidays.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.  The rechargable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The earbuds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only  time will tell; so far it's holding up nicely.  I definitely recommend the larger 2GB option. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa, Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Overall, an awesome starter unit that deserves a try.

<Title>compact and super easy to use!
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a red 2G Sansa Clip for my mom and the same in black for my Dad.  Both were thrilled to have such a small, stylish, easy to read (i.e. great display contrast), easy to use mp3 player with FM radio.  Initially they had requested IPods but after receiving the Sansa clip they got over the hype pretty quickly.  This one is a winner, and frankly, if I didn't already have my 30G Video Ipod, I'd be a Sansa clip owner as well.

<Title>Solid Value
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this unit at Best Buy on sale for around 35.00.  If you are only listening to music and have a computer to store the bulk of your mp3s 2 gigs is adequate for most purposes.  The addition of the FM tuner is iceing on the cake.  I love this tiny little unit.  The headphones leave a lot to be desired but can be inexpensivly replaced for best performance. Even with the replacement of the headphones, this unit compares favorably to much more expensive units (of which I bet you'll want to replace the headphones anyway).  Both of my daughters have much more expensive players and they keep commenting on how much they like mine.  Well, they can't have it!

<Title>Great MP3 for audiobooks
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player that would support e-audiobook free downloads from the library. Ipods won't work. The Sansa Clip is perfect - but you have to update the firmware from Sansa to have audiobooks (or long audio files) work properly. Google "sansa updater" to find the updater software, install it on your PC and it will automatically check for firmware upgrades every time you connect your clip.  What a great little device - good sound, holds a battery charge as promised (even after sitting in my purse in cold weather for two weeks), and I love listening to books from NetLibrary for free! Makes time fly on the treadmill. The radio is perfect for tuning in to the TV frequency at the gym, or listening in a metro area.  I did get one for my dad, who lives in a rural area, and the FM tuner is useless there.  Overall, I highly recommend this MP3 player without reservation.

<Title>I love this mp3 player!
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the first mp3 player I've owned.  I bought the Sansa Clip because I can't afford an iPod and frankly don't need anything that fancy.  I've been extremely happy with the clip so far.  I'm actually on my second; the first one I bought did not live up to its promise of a 15-hour battery life...it only lasted 2 or 3 hours at the longest.  Best Buy let me exchange it for another one, and this time it seems to be working great!  I also love the radio feature.  I would definitely recommend this tiny player to anyone who needs some music to work out at the gym to, or who just wants to carry around some of their favorite tunes.

<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this mp3 player for nearly 2 months now, without any problems. And the price is reasonable, too. I've been hearing about defective units, but don't let that discourage you from buying this little gem! If yours happens to be defective, just exchange it. Sandisk's quality control may not be perfect, but when they get it right, they get it RIGHT.....  Pros: Small & easy to carry Display is easy to read Lots of features Good sound quality Decent battery life Charges in about 3 1/2 hrs(other mp3 players take 6 hrs) Menus are easy to navigate Small & compact Convenient belt clip MSC mode to drag & drop files- a must for Linux users like myself. Fast file transfer- more than 1 GB of songs transferred in roughly 5 minutes!  Cons: User guide isn't very extensive USB cord that comes with the player is only 9 inches long, so I have to use my own. I don't like ear buds, so I use my own Sony headphones.  Overall, this is an excellent player & I'd recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this little mp3 player last Fall because let's face it, I'm in the dark ages without ever having an mp3 player.  I refused to buy an Ipod because the prices are ridiculous.  I found this little gem (2 gb) for $50 at Best Buy.  The only initial problem I had was I was running Media Player 9 and you MUST have 10 in order for your computer to recognize that the Sansa Clip is attached.  (This caused me many days of frustration...I even returned the first Sansca clip, thinking it was defective.  Then Sandisk support saved the day!)  Other than that, this player is awesome!  I use the FM tuner a lot on the bus back and forth to work, and have loaded multiple albums onto it also and still have a lot of room left.  Sound is great -- I don't like earbuds so am using my favorite Sony headphones.  I have nothing bad to say about this unit!  The only thing I can foresee going wrong is the clip breaking because it's made of plastic (why they didn't just make it out of the metal, I have no clue), but since I don't use the clip, this isn't a problem for me.  If you have a pocket, use it :-)

<Content>I bought this b/c it was great value compared to the Ipod Clip and also had a display.   PRO's So far everything that I expected is great. Holds alot of songs, good reception, small and light weight, clips works wells.  CON's - Ugly white headset and wire too short - Doesn't hold a charge for the 15 hours as speced out. For some reason even when it's off it is still using power.  - Trickly stop button. I accidentally press this and then my radio stopped. It took me a awhile to figure out why the radio wouldn't work. The stop button should only work for mp's and not for the radio which should be only off or on.
