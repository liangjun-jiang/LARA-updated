<Title>no staying power
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was really happy when I first got my Dell DJ. I should have known what my overall impression would be based on the fact that the first time I plugged it into my computer, the computer and the DJ froze. I had to reset the DJ and pull the plug on my laptop to convinve them to play nice. It's been about a year and a half now, which in the grand scheme of things is a good run, but it sure is going out with a bang.   1. I can feel all of its innards shifting when I turn it over in my hand.  2. The left headphone never works. In fact, when using it in the car, it doesn't play out of the left side speakers either. 3. Half of the time when it is left to charge, or plugged into my computer, it does not recognize that the cable is attached. Therefore, it does not charge or playback on my laptop.  4. Dell no longer makes these, and in looking for a way to fix the headphone problem (which is the most irritating of all of these) it was suggested that I take the thing apart and wedge a bit of a plastic bottle cap behind the headphone jack from the inside.   Though creative, I hardly find it encouraging that Dell has this posted as a legit fix with no response to the contrary from their technical staff.   I am not alone in having these problems, and Dell elects to recommend other mp3 players to its customers. This leads me to believe that they realised they didn't get it right, and just gave up.  I don't recommend anyone buy one of these. They're out of production, and it seems like they are given a operating life of 2 years maximum. You might as well invest a little more money to get something that will last a bit longer, or at least stays on the market.

<Title>Holds thousands of songs.

<Content>This handheld has a ton of space.  20 Gigs.  That will hold somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 songs depending on the format you use.  This player is a bit outdated with it's larger size and monochrome screen.  But it delivers good quality music with long battery life.

<Title>Love My Dell, Dude!

<Content>I love my Dell!  I've had it for a couple of years and it has only freezed on me once. And that was an easy fix.  I've yet to max out the 20 gig memory and when I first received it, it was easy plug and play.  I didn't have to read the manual to figure out how to work it.  Too bad Dell doesn't make these anymore.  I would totally recommend this player, even used!
