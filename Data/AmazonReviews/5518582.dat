<Title>Does everything fairly well
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, I loved this device except for one thing.  But first, the good:    1.  Once you start using the touch-screen on this thing, you won't want to go back to pushing buttons on another player.  Being able to tap this or tap that is pretty addictive and you quickly get used to it.  Archos needs to learn a few things about interface design.  I found unintutive in some areas, and some things just need to be tweaked out.  While I owned the unit, Archos released two firmware upgrades that I applied (very easy to do) that solved a lot of interface problems, and I expect some of the other things I didn't like too much will probably be fixed soon enough.  2.  Music (and all other content) is sync'ed using WMP10/11.  With the latest firmware, album art gets sync'ed as well, although I had plenty of albums that didn't seem to get the album art downloaded.  You can also bring the 604 up in hard drive mode and just dump whatever files you want on it (if they're music or video files, you can also play them).  3.  Video playback is superb, playing almost any DivX, MPEG, or WMV file I dumped on it.  Most of my videos are either recorded via Windows Media Center or downloaded from various Internet sources.  Haven't tried any DRM-ed videos you'd get, but I'm assuming as a PlaysforSure device the Archos 604 should play them if WMP syncs them.  4.  Surfing the Internet with this thing was pretty nice too, using the Opera browser.  You can view a page in real-size and scroll up/down and left/right, or you can zoom out on a page and see most everything pretty well on the screen.  Wouldn't play Flash movies and other active code, but what do you expect?  :)  5.  Finally, I was able to stream music and video off of my network shares.  Unbelievable.  With the use of the docking station, it's conceivable that one can hook the 604WiFi to their TV and stream movies or music wirelessly from a network share.  There is only one reason I sent the player back.  It was just a bit too big for what I wanted to do with it, namely play music while driving or working out.  It's an incredible machine for video and everything else it does, but too large to carry around in my pocket.

<Title>604 WIFI
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After finding the first 604 WIFI not working with my network, I was promptly sent another piece by Amazon without much issues. It is working great. The whole thing is awesome. I do wish the built in speakers were of better quality but earphones are great.  Overall this thing works great. Bought a DVR station from local Walmart for $78.00 (most Walmart out at one time)other retailers over $100. TV recording is clean. I recommend this to most media lovers. 30G HD is small but what can you do if you wanted WIFI.

<Title>Love it, need more accessories
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nice screen and video and music capabilities.  Web browser is slow. Need larger selection and variety of hardware and software accessories, e.g. cases, screen protectors, stands, web browsers, cables, chargers, etc.

<Title>The Perfect Multimedia Player Yet
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me start with this: *** You can download music videos from Google with your Arhcos 604wifi(directly onto it) and play them. That's right, the 604 runs a Linux distro and Google's protection does not work, so it won't ask for the stupid Google player. It neatly downloads an .avi file and it plays it*** Now, the above in mind, you can pretty much say you have a player with access to a database of videos that rivals Itunes(if not bigger) and you can get most of them for free! Now, when you purchase, do the following: * get later firmware release - No delays, as described by CNET in their review * buy plug-ins, especially if you have a huge video collection  * read this: [..]  Enjoy  P.S When the firmaware is hacked, God can't even think of the possibilities :D

<Title>Very Good High End Portable Media Player
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This media player is definitely on the high end of price for portable media players.  However it is worth the money.  The large screen makes it extremely easy to watch movies on and is very clear.  The touch screen also makes user interface very simple and quick.  WIFI on the device is faster than dial-up but still slower than cable.  The nice aspect is that with web surfing all the links on the page are accessible by touching the link with your finger or with the stylus.  I was debating between this version or the regular 604 and I am very happy that I chose the WIFI touchscreen.  Since I have had the Archos, I have almost never used the side buttons.  Battery life lasts 5 hours watching movies continuously.  Some cons are that the built in speaker isn't that great, so you pretty much rely on headphones.  Also the software with starting and stopping movies or music is a bit slow.  Plus the software will only play AVI files out of the box.  You have to buy additional software from archos to play Mpegs.  I bought the optional DVR docking station, and it is the best accessory you can buy for this item.  Charging the Archos on the docking station is a lot quicker than with the supplied USB cord.  The Archos is sturdy and has an all metal case but because the entire thing is a screen my fear is that if I drop it then the entire device would break.  Overall I think this device is more of a travel companion and a good device to keep around to keep you entertained.  Not like the video ipod where you can take it running.

<Title>Great Player AND RECORDER!
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have read all 15 reviews for this device and I am shocked at some of the comments. First I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I still think its a bit large and heavy to be a pocket media player. But with that said, there are so many positives: 1. Replaceable Battery, you can carry an extra on long trips. I know many iPOd owners that are not happy with sending off their units for battery replacement. 2. THis is also a recorder and DVR, iPod's are not in the same league. You can hook up to your COmcast/Charter or DirectTV/Dish settop box, and create your own timeshifted material.  Then take it to work, and watch during your lunch hour the next morning...no downloading hassles. 3. I no not care that I cannot buy movies from iTunes etc.  Just buy the DVD for $9 from Walmart, then use a free Ripper like DDR. Then watch all you want, and then save the DVD for the HD big screen. 4. The speaker does sound poor, but what do you expect, it does work in a pinch.  THe iPods do not even have a speaker (nor do any other Media players) 5. Video codecs cost real money for manufacturers to ship, so why ship every unit with codecs that I may never use.  The "buy if you need" is a good way to keep costs down. You can use "Super" converter for free, and it will convert all your videos to Divx 5.0 or any other format 6.  Yes the WiFi is slow, but what other Media players have WiFi?  ZERO 7.  The bookmarking feature is great for movies, what other HDD based player has that?  8.  The touchscreen is great, no iPODs even have a touchscreen, but looks like the iPhone (just shown at CES) will have a touchscreen 9.  This unit does make HiFi recordings with the built-in microphone, or you can use line-in (extra $$ for accessorie though). Note that mic recording s are MONO 10. Firmware releases are easy to install  On the con side:  1. Need more useable accessories 2. A bit heavy 3. I wish it had a "Now Playing" list like Creative Labs does.  Maybe in a new Firmware release????

<Title>OK
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is quite good for what it does. The only downsidews are that you have to purchase the plugin packs in order to get the full range of video codecs and it doesnt come with an AC adaptor. You will have to buy a USB to wall outlet adaptor or you can spend an absurd amount of money for a dock station and a cable from Archos. The only other grievances is that it doesnt play music while your on the internet and that pdf files load way to slow. If you can get past its shortcommings it is a really good product. I do not regret buying it, I just am a little dissapointed in ARCHOS for not thinking that the consumer has already spent hundreds on their product and they still want more.

<Title>Great picture... Sound could be better...
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased the Archos 604 WIFI Media Player, it is a very nice product with a very big price tag!  If you are more concerned with with viewing pictures and watching videos than the Archos is great for you.  If your primary use would be for playing music like an IPOD I would look elsewhere because the sound is not equal to that of an IPOD (I also own an IPOD).  The internet option is decent, it works well for things like checking e-mail, sports scores, or reading news articles.  It does not work though for web sites like YOUTUBE, and it is not JAVA enabled so doing things like watching football games in real time is impossible.  I would actually give this product 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option so I rounded up to 4.

<Title>ARCHOS 604 Wifi is AWESOME!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, kudos to Amazon--I ordered my Archos 604 Wifi on Sunday Jan. 14 at 10PM EST on a HOLIDAY WEEKEND, and I signed for delivery just a couple of hours ago (Tuesday Jan. 16 at 6PM via UPS). AMAZING delivery service, especially since I selected the FREE Supersaver delivery option! I am impressed!  Speaking of impressed, I LOVE this new Archos 604 Wifi unit! Note that I did not open the user manual for any of the following tasks, the new Archos UI was very intuitive (at least for me, since I have four different older Archos units.) I have had it now for only about two hours and after opening it and plugging it into my Mac's USB 2.0 in hard drive mode, it began charging and mounted on my desktop immediately as a hard disk icon, enabling me to drag and drop hundreds of MP3s to the "Music" folder. I was playing the playlist in MINUTES!  While in hard drive mode, was able to quickly copy AVI videos previously recorded from my Archos AV380 and AV700 to the 604 Wifi's "Video" folder, and was able to play those immediately as well! No need to "stream" video from a Windows network. I can just copy and delete videos as needed. I do wish the 604 Wifi had a larger HD, but that's why I will still use my AV700 100GB.   In another few minutes, I activated the Wifi feature, the 604 Wifi detected and was able to connect to my Apple Airport Express network (all I had to do was enter my 26 digit WEP key) and I WAS IN! Can't wait to test the 604 Wifi's connectivity with public Wifi access locations like my local coffee houses and bookstores. From reviews I have read, this unit should automatically connect to open public networks very easily.  ALL OF THIS TOOK ME NOT EVEN A HALF HOUR!!! Of course, working in tandem with Apple Mac hardware probably made this setup process super easy, I dont know how this would go with Windows (I don't own any Windows products at all.)  I also ordered the Archos 604 DVR station via Amazon (under $80, just got an email confirming that it has shipped), so I'll soon be able to charge the unit with AC adapter, hook up USB digital cameras or other Mass Storage HDs to it and record from my Comcast digital cable box or ANY video source.  Get yourself an Archos 604 Wifi, you will not regret it!  It is a great little unit at a great price considering its stunning video and Internet-enabled capabilities, which surpass my Apple 60GB video iPod which was about the SAME PRICE as this 604 Wifi--there is no other PMP like this on the market!  Archos rocks!
