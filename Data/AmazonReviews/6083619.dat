<Title>User interface is slow!
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After trying several units at different Apple stores, all of the new iPod Classics suffer from a slow interface. Apple added Cover Flow and additional graphics but apparently underpowered the device and menu items have a noticable delay, Cover Flow is slow to refresh and even the clickwheel navigation is sluggish. These problems are not shared by the new Nano, which operates beautifully. I wanted to buy the classic, but now will go with either a Nano or a Touch.

<Title>Still great for Music and awesome storage space
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have 4 iPods including a 2G refurb I keep in my car.  So obviously they work well for me.  There are a number of solid alternatives to the iPod and depending upon your needs one of those could be better value.  For the classic the screen is too small for video but that is true of most "video" players and cell phones.  Overall the Apple iPod + iTunes experience can not be beat.  It is an elegant seamless integration and experience.  An often overlooked feature of getting an iPod is that there are tons of accessories to select from and that alone is compelling reason to go with an iPod.  If video is must look elsewhere perhaps to the iPod touch (great screen and makes video actually an option) or one of the Archos options (better screen size and storage then the touch and some with video in option).  If you need a voice recorder or fm tuner other options such as those from Creative might suit you better.  These can be added to the iPod but only at additional costs.  But the core - the simplicity, power of use, battery life and organizing and storing music, photo and video files the iPod is still the best.  Don't get distracted by bells and whistles that really are not important to your core end user experience.  Don't focus on  marginal battery draining features like Zune's wifi unless you really think that those feature are important to you.  If you are on a budget and are willing to forego Apples legendry and well deserved elegance, you can find a decent player for much less.  If you have more specific needs add them to the vlaue equation and figure if the iPod + accessories is worth the extra cost to you.  And if you want a great music player that simply works go with an iPod.

<Title>Too good to be true!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always thought that an ipod sold solely because of publicity. I assumed that most people who bought it didn't research well or didn't know what they wanted to buy. I was often surprised to see people buying one ipod after another for their family and friends!   Now I know how wrong I was!   I am finally a proud owner of the 80 GB Classic (Black)! Now, I'd like to jump to the list of pros and cons for this great product:  PROS: 1. Unbelievably slim for an 80 GB player. 2. All metal design is really impressive (less scratches). 3. Cover flow definitely adds a lot of pleasure to the user experience. 4. Preview for the selected menu option is impressive. 5. More controllable click wheel. 6. Great Battery life. 7. Great Extras (especially the games)  I guess, I could go on n on n on...  CONS: 1. Menu to Cover flow transition is slow. 2. iTunes consumes all your resources on PC. 3. I'm not sure about the datastructure in an ipod, but it seems that if there is an album in which there are songs by various artists, the album shows up as many times as the number of artists in the cover flow mode. 4. Although certain photos get copied but they don't open (Note: They are visible as thumbnails) 5. Need more menu options for photo viewer. 6. Can't change EQ settings from a song. Need to go to the menu->setings->EQ to change it. 7. Artwork for certain albums don't show up even though iTunes shows them correctly.  Finally, I would definitely like to say that this is a great product and one of it's kind. Once you own it, you would never wanna part with it!

<Title>Nice capacity, but that's it...
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is definitely a great gadget, but not the best out there. It still gets scratched just as the other ones, but that's no surprise. I was excited to see how the cover flow feature would work, since it was on the iPod Touch also, and it was not that great. It is slower that the touch and freezes on some occasions. I did like how they kept it sleek and thin as it used to be. It didn't come with many accessories (this means no protective sleeve either), but I didn't mind since I didn't end up paying for the iPod. It's also very affordable, unlike the other iPods. And for those wondering how I "got" my iPod go here -> http://flingk.com/n21v9v1 I saw it on CNN, FOX, G4TV, so I tried it and it actually worked! Overall this is a great MP3 Player, but not the best.

<Title>Music Great.... Video lets hope for a update
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the Classic now for 4 days.  The interface is much better than Gen 5 but the Classic is slower.  All and all for for Music and watching video on the iPod its self the Classic wins.  The bad.  Most of all the iPods docs and ALL Of the past iPod cables do not work with any of the new iPods. Apple change the computability so that you have to buy new cables and docs. They say it is because the old ones put to much drain on the battery(whatever I have had no issue). So if you are not upgrading from a previous iPod it may not be an issue because you will have to buy the $50.00 cable any way but if you already have all your iPod accessories you may want to keep the iPod you have until they fix this issue.  By the way if your car radio has a adapter for a iPod. Like the Pioneer D3 I just bought.  You guessed it none of the new iPods will work.

<Title>not good if you want to watch video
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple won't tell you this before you buy this product. If you use this with third-party video products it wont let you switch the TV OUT selector to ON. This means it won't work with those products. Apple sells two special cable sets you need in order to watch video. Each of these sells for $49.99. There is currently a four week wait for these cables. I have a laptop-like Vision Video 55 that allows the ipod to drop into a special bay so you can watch videos on a bigger screen and carry it around. Its great for traveling etc. My previous ipod videos worked great with this and a similar unit sold by Phillips. Now if I want to use these portable video devices I need one of these special cables partially defeating the point of having these custom devices. And this isn't a fit issue. Apple has purposely done this to prevent users from using third-party devices. Don't look to future after-market video devices to fix this problem. Apple has decided to be greedy on this point. If you just watch video on the ipod itself or on your home TV this will work fine (if you buy one of Apple's $50 cables). I wish I could return my ipod but they wont take it back :-(. Maybe I'll start calling mine the ipoop :-).

<Title>Good but not Great (yet)
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a 5.5 Generation 80G and I got a 80G classic, so I quite literally did a side by side comparison. True, the new interface is lovely, the screen is a touch brighter and its a thiner design, but even after the update from Apple, the spin up time on the interface is just so slow. Its especially horrible going to a listing of movies, it once took nearly 2 min for all my movies to display. The classic is sluggish and for me that is a bit of a deal breaker. I'm a huuuge Apple fan, I have 3 ipods (iPod mini 1st generation, Shuffle 2nd generation and my 5.5 generation 80G), a Mac Mini and will be shelling out for a Mac book pro next month when Leopard comes out, but this one is going back. I have a feeling the next generation Classic may be the one to watch for but for now its all Style and not enough substance, if your going for a ipod video get the 5th generation while you still can or wait until Apple has a chance to get rid of the glitches in this one.

I give it 1 star because you have to buy a universal dock to use it Apple does not tell you this When you buy the unit. just what i need is more gear to carry on a plane if you don't want to mess with docks and stuff to plug an i pod into a tv at a hotel stick with the 5 gen.

<Title>Posting User C. J. F. Was mistaken. It works. Here's Why...
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just as someone else stated, you do not need a Dock, for this or ANY iPod to work for that matter. That is an optional accessory, but not really needed.  Just use the USB cord that comes with it.  It's fastest if your computer has USB 2.0 ports built-in, but it also connects with older slower machines like mine that only have USB 1.1 ports.  It's great.!  USB 1.1 has a much slower data transfer rate than USB 2.0. Just be patient when doing your very first sync. Other syncing is faster just because you will be syncing less data at one sitting.  I love it. 80 GB, well worth it.

<Title>This product rocks!
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>THE GOOD: Good price, lots of HD for the price, has an equalizer, is basically easy to use; can be recharged via a USB 2.0 port on a PC. Also, it looks good (if you need a snappy-looking MP3 player), the touch-pad control is very convenient to use and it's good for audio books too.  THE BAD: No FM tuner, dinky earbuds, weird (incomprehensible to me at least) filing system if you're using a PC running Windows and you try to find individual files in the iPod using Windows Explorer. So, instead of being able to easily delete a few files here and there, it's easier to just restore (ie reformat) the HD and start from scratch. AND, the battery isn't meant to be changed by the owner - you're supposed to mail it back to Apple when the battery dies (although aftermarket batteries are available for the more technically adept owners).  OTHER POINTS: Uses iTunes software to upload & download from, won't support music purchased from anyplace other than iTunes. iTunes is pretty easy to use, make sure your PC can run iTunes 7.6 before you buy an iPod! RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES: Speck ToughSkin rubberized case for iPods & a decent set of brand-name earbuds. CONCLUSION: The pluses outweigh the minuses as far as I'm concerned - I love my iPod! If you disagree, check out the Microsoft Zune or Creative Labs MP3 players.

<Title>No problems or issues at all, complaints seem overblown
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We have just upgraded from a 30GB gen 5.5. video iPod to this model, and are happy overall.  Any complaints regarding software glitches, cover flow, etc. can be fixed quite simply by downloading the newest software update as soon as you first hook your new iPod up to your computer, and it takes about 10 seconds to disable the cover flow feature.  It's a good price for the amount of memory.  I haven't noticed any drastic reduction in sound quality, but on the other hand, there isn't any improvement either.  The only reasons this doesn't get five stars is because there doesn't seem to be any upgrade in sound quality, and even with the software updates, the click wheel seems a touch slower than the old Video model.  But for the extra storage and price, and the improved exterior casing, it's still a great deal.

<Title>INCOMPATIBLE with Accessories
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought into the iPod despite concerns about being locked into a proprietary format.  This buy-in was based on the ecosystem of accessories available (and mainly options to integrate in my car).   I just "upgraded" to the 80GB iPod classic.  Everything I own that used to work with my previous 5G iPod video no longer works.  Anapod Explorer - BROKEN.  Never liked iTunes, and this was my solution.  It no longer works, which is, in Apple's Defense, Anapod's responsibility.  Fortunately the newest WinAmp integrates well (although it can't seem to get cover art right).  Still important to note that whatever file system changes were implemented here are likely to impact other products as well.  Auto OEM Adapter Kid - BROKEN.  My $600 OEM iPod car adapter no longer recognizes the iPod.  This is what I used my iPod for 90% of the time.  No auto connectivity, and this product is borderline worthless to me.  Logitech mm50 Speakers - PARTIALLY BROKEN.  Plays music but no longer charges the iPod.  How tough is it to make sure the newest iPods can still be charged with older accessories???  All in all, a MAJOR disappointment.  I'll be looking for a used or refurbished iPod video to replace this as soon as I get the chance.

<Content>I had been hesitant to buy a new iPod because of the high price tag for any of them, but I finally decided to spend the money and upgrade from my old iPod mini, which the battery was starting to becom bad on. I first looked at the 8gb Nano, but decided to spend $50 more and get 72gb more space, and the larger screen. Let me tell you, this device will change you life. The video and picture quality is unbelievable, and the music quality is also tremendous. For someone like me who travels a lot, this is a great product to own.

<Title>A worthy upgrade
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The most important thing to consider about purchasing this iPod is what you're coming from or comparing it too. Sure, it may not be that much different than the 5th Generation, but for people that have held on to older models (I had a 3rd Generation) or for whom this is their first iPod, it's absolutely as good as it gets. Sure, the scroll wheel isn't perfect, but it's better than the significantly older models, and it's definitely better than nothing! The only real major that I can see from the 5g is the new hard drive capacity. When I was considering getting a new iPod, I knew I wanted space, but I wasn't quite willing to sacrifice the slimness of the 30 gig. Now that's not at all an issue and all my needs are satisfied. On top of that, the new cover looks terrific (not nearly as rounded as it looks in all the pictures) and the cover flow is nice, though not perfect. So I would say that if you've got a 5g, it would probably be wise to hold out for a bigger iPod touch or something, but if you've got an older model or nothing at all, then this is just about as good as it gets.

<Title>A believer at last....
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been a PC guy for most of my computing life and recently switched to a Mac. I bought the Classic when it became available and am amazed at its ease of use, user friendly interface, capacity and most of all the quality of the sound that it plays. I am very picky about my music and until I bought the Classic I thought my Zen was a good player. This player puts the Zen to shame! It works seamlessly with Itunes and is all in all a great player. The only thing that I can negatively say about it is that when switching between playlists/songs etc there is a lag of a few seconds that takes a bit of getting used to but I guess thats the difference between flash memory and a hard drive. Other than that little quibble, the Classic is the way to go if you have a pretty good sized music collection. Set up was a snap and there were no issues with the OS. Another winner from Apple!

Had NO idea that Apple has totally removed the capability to run on W2K until I tried to install the software (Amazon, you should have put a warning somewhere). Spent several hours searching forums and looking for 3rd party SW to make it work but found nothing. I have way too much $ invested in SW that will not run under XP to switch operating systems.  Apple, gotta give you credit, you can shoot yourselves in the foot better than any company I know of (except maybe Microsoft).

<Title>Beware J&R for purchases
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had no idea there were different generations of the 80GB ipod, and J&R saw an opportunity to dump old inventory. My wife originally ordered the 30GB ipod from J&R through Amazon back in August. After much delay on the order, she called for an update on Sept 8.  She was told by their sales person that the black was out of stock and so she asked if there was something comparable. He said he had an 80GB he could send for the same price ($249) - sounded to my like it was the new ipod.     That arrived in the mail the second week of September.  Today, I walked into Circuit City to buy her the same 80GB ipod.  I spent the same $249. I was shocked to see that the one I just bought is much thinner, lighter, the graphics are more advanced, and there are more games on it. It's a totally different ipod.  J&R did not inform my wife as to what they were selling her.  They tricked her into thinking she was getting 80GB for the price of a 30GB when they actually sent her one of two (older gen) ipods they had lying around in stock, just when the NEW 80GB's hit the stores and the 30GB's were being discounted. The one they sent her is white with a gray dial, not silver with a white dial.  The ipod's themselves are wonderful, but beware what you're getting for the price when buying anything from J&R. They mislead and mis-inform people.

<Title>major problems with thumbwheel
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I strongly urge anyone considering this product to do a test-drive first.  Apple has redesigned the thumbwheel and it just doesn't work properly.  Its virtually impossible to stop on the desired album or track.  Also, the album art is a disaster - images don't load timely and as they do, it causes the flow to freeze and then release 10 albums away from where you were trying to get to.  The Nano doesn't have this delay issue, so it must be related to the hard-drive slower access times.  But both the classic and nano both have the same redesigned thumbwheel that is very hard to control.  I was completely frastrated with my experience.  I'm not going to recommend another product, just don't buy this or the redesigned Nano.

<Content>I had a 5.5 gen IPOD before but decided to get Classic this week since it has larger storage and is thiner.  I got it Friday, but I have been disappointed with the issues I encountered.  1) The new IPOD already crashed once and I have to reboot it. I never rebooted my previous IPOD 5.5. 2) Sometimes I connect the IPOD with computer, the IPOD didn't show  the connected sign. Replug the cable didn't help and I have to reboot the IPOD to make it connected. 3) I upgraded Itunes to 7.4.2 so that I can use this IPOD. The iTunes  told me there is a IPOD software version 1.0.1 available which I expect they have some patches. But the upgrade failed because of some "1415" error.  I believe all of those issues will get fixed in the following few months. But I'm still disappointed, they should have done more testing before  putting it on market.  2 stars for what they did. I'll keep this ipod for 1 more week and will  return it if I still have problems with it.

<Title>So far so good...
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this ipod as soon as they became available at Apple stores.  The main problems that I have encountered so far is of course the clickwheel not being as sensitive as previous ipods.  I tend to wear my ipod on a belt clip, and before if I had a t-shirt over the ipod, I would be able to adjust the volume over the shirt.  However, I can no longer do that.  But that's not a big issue.  The other problem seems to be with the USB connections.  Sometimes when I sync my ipod or try to charge it, I have to adjust the USB cord a little bit to make a connection.  It's a bit aggravating but manageable.  The cover art flow does lag but fully loads in about 2 seconds.  I don't mind waiting that long.  The positives in regards to this ipod are of course the 80G space (my previous ipod was a 30G), the cheaper price (my 30G ipod was $300 when i purchased it) and a sleeker overall feel, whether it's the main menu flowing cover art or browsing by category.  In the end, I am satisfied with my purchase, so far.  Luckily, I haven't crashed yet.

<Title>Not for first timers
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this as a requested Christmas gift and was very much looking forward to having an easily portable drive that could play my CD collection at home as well as at work with docking stations, or, wherever I chose with the headphones.  The unit I received was purchased new at Best Buy, along with a charging cable.  Upon opening I found an 8 page simplisitc folder that tells you how to turn it on and off, but not much else.  No problem - go to the iTunes website and download a 70+ page instruction manual.  Great!  Here we go - loaded 700 Cd's worth of music onto the iPod, and enjoyed it for three weeks.  Then the iPod froze.  I tried to re-sync but it would no longer recognize several files stored in the iTunes library.  Deleted those files, "restored" the iPod to factory settings and tried to re-sync.  If collecting different "unknown error messages" is your hobby you might be happy with this.  Unless you're a big fan of user forums that offer multiple solutions to problems that should've been resolved before putting the product on the market I'd suggest that you seriously consider other options before purchasing this product.  (And no, I'm not an 80 yr old who knows nothing about them 'puters'.)

<Content>80 GB is a great size.  If you're planning on doing anything with music videos or DVD's, perhaps go for the larger one.  My ipod arrived new and undamaged within a few days.  I've been loading stuff on it for a couple of weeks and only have 12GB on it.  I'll have my life back soon.

<Content>I just joined the "iPod club" and purchased my first iPod from Amazon.  Fast delivery, lowest price anywhere and it's a guaranteed Apple product.  I've already downloaded my music library and I'm slowly (VERY slowly) filling it up.  80GB is HUGE!  I even downloaded a movie from iTunes and the clarity was so much better than what I was expecting.  This will be great for road-trips back home from school :-)

<Title>Better than the 20 Gig model (so far) but it doesn't have a 40 hour battery
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was one of the first people to buy the 4th generation 20GB ipod when it came out a couple of years ago and I really loved it but A) after a year of so of use it started to freeze a couple of times a month every month and B) it just totally died after a year and a half of use.  That being said, that made me a little reluctant to get a new iPod. So I got the 80GB two weeks or so ago and I'm liking it so far. I like the idea of being able to watch the movies and TV episodes I have on my computer  on my MP3 player and I think the coverflow feature is cool but I'm pretty disappointed with the battery life so far. The ads say you should get about 40 hour of music playback but the last two times I've listened to the music before a recharge I've gotten about eight or nine hours of battery life at the most and that kind of concerns me seeing as how I just got the thing two weeks ago and the battery life is already a little crappy (hence a four star review and not a five star review). In the unit's defense though my iPod did play for two hours this afternoon (with the backlight set to the "always on" setting) with the smallest sliver of battery life left so I was impressed with that (I set the backlight to "always on" when I'm trying to finish off the battery's life so I can recharge it sooner).  So all in all it's a really cool improvement over the 20GB model in most respects and the video option is really awesome as well but the battery life seems as poor as the original iPods and that's kind of a shame seeing as how that seems like something Apple could and should improve rather easily.  So I would recommend this baby if you have an eight hour flight or road trip but I don't know if it would be that great if you had a ten to twelve hour flight or road trip. Maybe a Zune would be better for that. I don't know.

<Title>Worth every penny, cover flow is just a minor flaw.
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iPod is amazaing especially for people with huge music collections like me. But everyone keeps putting it down because the coverflow is a litte slow at loading the album art. Can you blame it? If you have 50 albums on the iPod do you think it can just load them up effortlessly? It's the same way on the iTunes menu on the computer. If you let the cover flows 2 second load up time get in the way of you enjoying your iPod then you have missed the point.

<Title>My Ipod after a 3 year trial.
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received my ipod 3 years ago as a gift from my company. I was so happy I couldn't see straight. Since then I've used my ipod almost every day. I walk to work 5 times a week and the ipod really helps my travel.  So here is a short of my journey with the ipod.  The day after I received my ipod i put my entire mp3 collection on it and was thoroughly satisfied.   6 months later I bought a new computer and when my ipod tried to auto sync it erased my entire music database. I went back to miniDisc.  3 months later I rebuilt 50% of my music base and tried my ipod again and used manual sync ever since.  Then the next 2 years I spent enjoying the ipod with little or no problem.  3 months ago I experienced my first ipod freeze.  2 months ago I experienced more frequent freezing and very quick battery death (Even with no backlight).  Today: I have about 20 to 30 minutes of a functioning ipod (barring no glitches happen).  I was never rough with my ipod, I do walk in cold weather when it's cold im not sure what effect that had on it.  But for the price tag I would have expected a MUCH longer life span.  I had my miniDisc player and I used it the same way I did the ipod and it still lasts today and is going strong.  For the price point Apple needs to make a better product or give a non-soldering option of trading out the battery if that is the problem.  Not that I paid monitarily but I did pay in a way because when I moved my music on to ipod they changed my files so now my miniDisc can't read.  So now im forced to buy another ipod in order to listen to my music.  Bravo.  I am not excited of the idea of paying 200+ dollars just to have a product of a 3 year life span.  My super nintendo and my playstation cost that when I bought them and they are still running fine.  I will admit it is a good product but it has a very disappointing life span.

<Content>Following the recommendation of my Daughter and Son in Law, I finally bought this unit.  With a little work and an ION turntable I have added a 55 year collection of records and tapes to a tiny device that fits in my pocket.  I have collected vintage juke boxes and loaded them with 45's.  This device is like carrying 2500 juke boxes in my shirt pocket.  I work outside on our tree farm, and love having this with me daily!  This is my first iPod so I don't have a history, but I can't find any fault with this great little musical miracle - except I needed over the ear phones to muffle out the engine noise of the tractors, mowers and ATV's.!

<Title>Works great and looks even better!
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First of all, let me start by saying that the only reason I bought this was because my 30g fifth gen. ipod was stolen. If you have that ipod, then I don't see why you should upgrade to this one, unless you're rolling with cash. This ipod, however, is a really nice mp3 player and accentuates all the reasons why apple owns this market. It has lots of space with 80gb and can hold my entire music library.  This ipod looks really nice as well, with a nice sleek design. The new face plate gets rid of all the finger print issues with the old one and just looks great. They rounded out all the edges and made certain things black which is a nice touch.  The touch wheel is really responsive but their is no ability to change the sensitivity. The new interface looks really nice, but cover flow isn't the fastest thing in the world. I haven't had us much trouble with it as others have said, but it's not that useful.  The only thing i've had problems with is when I transfer music onto my ipod, some of the songs are recognized as different albums. It's not a big deal, but it's frustrating because songs from the same album are listed as different albums and I can't figure out why.  It has something to do with the fact that I download music, rather than buy it off itunes. If you buy all your music, you should be fine.

<Content>I didn't want to upgrade from my ancient iPod, but a hardware failure gave me no choice.  I have been delighted with my replacement, however.  The 6G 80 GB iPod classic is a very elegant unit.  Lovely screen.  But the biggest plus is battery life. An amazing increase over my previous player.  I have hundreds of songs, symphonies, operas, and all the Harry Potter books rattling around in about 1/4 of the classic's memory.  Don't know how I'm going to fill up the rest.  Bought an FM transmitter for the iPod when the CD player in my car jammed.  Don't miss the CD unit at all now.

<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this player.  I can watch TV shows (at the doctor's office) and not feel like I am going blind because the picture is crisp and the colors are vibrant. But I wouldn't push it.  Don't be dumb.    The music quality is excellent as always for an iPod.  I only wish it came with a charger and a better case.    Pros: * Great sound and picture quality * Battery life has been vastly improved.  When playing video, the battery is used up quickly though.  * Accessories are plentiful when you buy iPods * Durability -- I've dropped it a few times accidentally and it's done no permanent damage, although the player has had one freezing period that required a hard reset.  Cons: * Pricey * Dealing with iTunes and reformatting issues is a drag * Screen is a bit too easy to smudge even with a cover on it

I have applied all the "patches" and I have the latest software from itunes. The iPod works well.  In retrospect, I wish I bought a different product. Apple has a monopoly on the music and in my opinion does not care about my problems. After reading the reviews and recommendations from Apple, I was afraid of loading iTunes on my Vista-running computer. After reading horror stories on the web, I would wait till Apple and Microsoft certify that iTunes works with Vista

<Title>Good...not perfect.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Before reviewing this iPod, I should say that this is my second iPod, my first being the original, 20GB model.  Considering that that and this were about the same price, I think it goes without saying that I'm thrilled with the improvements that have been made over the years.  The color screen is beautiful, I enjoy seeing my album art, and this model is an all around better player.  In general, I'm very very happy with this purchase.  I do feel that some other customers' complaints are valid.  The click wheel can respond slowly, especially when in the "Cover Flow" menu.  This is easily resolved by either not displaying cover art on your iPod or by using the other menus (artist, playlist, etc.) instead.  I would imagine this will also help to prolong battery life.  My only other complaint is that the earphones for this model seem to fall out of my ears.  I don't know if this is a common problem, but it was easily fixed by using my old earphones.  No big deal really.    Otherwise, it's a product that I'm quite happy with, and am glad that I purchased.

<Title>Not as bad as people are saying.
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>ok, so people are griping a lot and worried apple is flopping and giving their customers the old one finger salute. I bought this, trying to be as open as possible, and this is what i found. The click wheel- Not as bad as some are saying. It is not perfect, but after an apple update or two it should be fine - Cover flow. Its true, it doesn't update fast enough; however, i don't care much for the concept and will probably never use it... I imagine most will be the same. -Battery life- Great!!! what more can you ask for? - Incompatibility with 3rd party accessories... ok, understand this gripe, but lets be honest, not all your computer accessories for the 90s fit this nice new HP you just bought. When you think about it, we should have expected this some time. granted i have less to gripe about than others since i haven't had an ipod since my gen 4 died 2 or 3 years ago, but if you search the net, I'm sure buying a new cable hear, or there wont kill you. Then there is the problem with games not transferring over. Its true, the games you bought for your gen 5 video wont work on the classic.... Its 5$... is it really that big of a deal? if i wanted cheap i would have gotten a zune, and if your really that concerned, maybe you should. I think a lot of the gripes we are seeing are a little overdone, and if you really think about it... look deep deep down inside of yourself, you will see it makes sense. lets look at the pros - 80 gigs at $250... it must be my birthday - that new brushed metal finish, mmm mmm mmm, it just feels nice. not fingerprints either. - regardless of what i have read on a few forums, all my cover art transfered in rather well (minus a few rare cds that i didn't expect to show up) - the amount of time it takes to charge is great! - its not made by Microsoft - itunes is the MOST intuitive way to handle mp3 tags that i have seen inside of a mp3 player client --- cons the click wheel is a bit awkward at first when compared to previous generations BUT it is not as bad as others will make you think no case, but who cares, you can get em cheap off ebay --- So if your like i was and are really worried about getting this because of all the bad reviews, dont worry... remember, no piece of technology is perfect in its first days, it takes a few updates to get it righ, and im sure Apple is working hard to perfect its product and continue to dominate the MP3 market (for good reason too)

<Title>Big Disappointment
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought new iPod classic 80 GB yesterday and a day later I think I am ready to return it. There are several problems with this iPod. If you never owned iPod before you may not notice these issues. However, if you owned iPod video or iPod photo you will be greatly disappointed.  Things that I don't like:   1)You can't enlarge album artwork anymore  2)The artwork doesn't load immediately when you browse your music.  3)When you browse and click on artist it gives you all the albums that you have and tells how many songs are in each album which I find annoying since I have lots of classiclal music and it doesn't make sense when you read that Mozart's Symphony No.40 has 4 songs.  4) Cover Flow doesn't support all album artwork. Some just won't load on iPod. I don't even bother to talk about that feature. it's useless   However things mentioned above are not major problems. They are very subjective,just something I dislike. The big problem with new iPod classic is its click wheel. When I used my new iPod for the first time I even thought maybe something was wrong with my fingers instead of suspecting that something maybe wrong with click wheel. That's because I had iPodphoto 60Gb for 2 years and it worked exceptionally well. But after reading all negative reviews online I realised that everyone has the same problem with click-wheel. How can Apple allow this to happen when they always brag about their patented clickwheel in the ads is beyond me. It's just a shame. I like the design and the bright screen of new iPod but who wants to wait for music to load for five seconds or who wants to try adjusting volumes multiple times because click-wheel simply doesn't feel your touch.   Like some other reviewer mentioned here I really wanted to buy iPod touch but 16 GB capacity is a joke in our age.I think Apple is just teasing consumers and will probably release 60 GB or bigger versions of iPod Touch close to Christmas to make huge sales. It's kinda sad what Apple has become...

The navigation system is so much better than anyone elses not to mention the sound quality, the itunes interface, or the secondary accessory market.  the problem i guess is that they set the bar too high too many times.  me personally, i couldn't care less about the ipod touch (who needs it?), i'm just giddy about 60gigs for $249....

<Title>iPod 5.5 vs iPod Classic
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the iPod Video 5.5Gen while my friend recently bought this new iPod Classic 80gb. I have compared the two side by side and I must say that the new Classic sports only a couple of new features against its predecessor. The price is quite a bargain though. The menu navigation on the old 5.5G is a little bit faster than the Classic. I bet this is because of the slideshow running in the background while navigating through the menu. The menus are admittedly very sluggish on the Classic as compared to the 5.5G. Good points though are the "scratch-proof" surface, which I think is rather a compromise in looks for functionality. The coverflow concept is also nice but I just wished the hardware could keep up with refreshing the album art thumbnails while browsing. And don't forget to start downloading those album arts.   Back to the iPod 5.5G. Well, this device has entertained me during long drives and has made me sleep for the past several months. It definitely never failed to do its purpose. I learned to love iTunes to make playlists and organize my music. But don't hesitate to use third party software like floola when you need to backup your stuff.   The bottomline is: if you are not one of the early jumpers when a new device is introduced, this device is perfectly cool for you. Honestly, I would've still bought the 5.5G now even with the iPod classic around.   Be cautious though, since this is a hard drive device. But I bet you already know that.

<Content>Well, I've never bought an Ipod, having held off for years. With the lower price on the classics, I jumped in. Boy am I sorry. I've had it a week, and can't do a thing with it. The itunes software is buggy and deleted all my songs (after getting them on their easily on an older version, which it made me update). Now,itunes tells me it can't write to my device and continually tells me to reset it (which does nothing). Look on apples support site and you see hundreds of people screeming in the forums about this problem, with no response from Apple anywhere... not even acceptance a problem exists and a 'we are working on it'. These things are supposed to be easy to use... that is the main advantage of Ipod on itunes, right??? Well, I'm about ready to return this one. Buggy software and non responsive support is not the way to 'lead the industry'.

<Content>I've only previously owned a 4th gen 40GB iPod, so I can't comment on the 'downgrade' issues from the last generation iPods, but so far I am very, very happy with my new 80GB classic.  Installation was a breeze.  I already had iTunes set up with all my music, so all I had to do was load up iTunes and plug in the iPod, and automation took care of the rest.  The iPod charged up in a few hours.  That simple!  The 80GB classic is perfect for what I use it for: listening to my entire music collection from one convienent place.  I've been listening to it for many many hours straight, and it's barely even touched the battery.  The screen is nice and vibrant for looking at all the cover art, and the backlight auto shuts off to save on batteries when you aren't using it, especially useful when it's just sitting in your pocket or glovebox.  The brushed aluminum looks very stylish and gives it a more solid feel.  The clickwheel can be a little sluggish at times, but I've never found myself irritated by it.  All in all an excellent purchase.  Extremely impressed by the battery life.  I'm glad I waited a little longer to buy an iPod, as we now get 80GB of storage instead of 30GB for the same price.

<Title>Such a disappointment 
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You can read on for a detailed review.  In summary, if my music collection wasn't larger than the iPod this was replacing, I would put the iPod classic on the shelf (or maybe ebay it) and run the old one.  This iPod is the first apple iPod product I have felt was just an afterthought.  I have owned the 1G shuffle, the 2G 4GB Nano, and a 4G 20GB iPod color (wife also has a 5G 30GB iPod Video).  I absolutely loved all of them.  All felt like polished products.  The iPod Classic feels like an afterthought that they came up with when they decided to make the iPod touch not a real iPod, but halfway between a nano & an iPod.  The iPod Classic is very underpowered, or the firmware is poorly written.  Either way, you will find navigating through the menus very tedious and will start becoming annoyed.  The first thing you will notice is that there is something wrong with the click wheel.  It doesn't pick up your finger movements the way the other generations of iPod did.  Apple has never been very friendly to audiobook listeners, but the current software makes it really bad. You can no longer sort your audio books by genre (or author, or even book title).  All audiobook files are only accessible in a single alphabetized list.  Yes, that's files, not books.   So to get to 'State of Fear' part 6 of 8, you need to scroll down through every file of every book you have that has a title that starts earlier in the alphabet than "S". For me, that's 187 files.  What's worse, is the list isn't a normal list of files (as was in the last generation of iPod), but is double height for each file and displays a tiny picture of the book's cover next to the file.  What's still worse is that most of the time these just show question marks and slow the scrolling process even more.  The podcast menu uses the same double height lists, as do virtually all lists. Currently you can't turn this off, and you get to wade through your songs in this manner.  The cover flow feature is completely unusable as it is so slow and the album art isn't populated quick enough to actually be of use.  The general navigation utilizes a 1/2 screen for the menu and 1/2 screen for artwork, cut vertically.  Its only use is to look good in apple commercials.  After the "wow, that's neat" wears off, you search around for how to turn it off, but sadly, you can't.  All it does is make what you are trying to read cut off, and also slows down the iPod.  You will notice between a 1 & 2 second lag time from selecting an item before the sub-menu shows up.  I would say you should buy a fifth generation if you can find one, or hold out for the next generation of the touch (when it has enough space to hold your music).  The only good thing about this iPod is that all the problems appear to be software related... however my fear is that apple won't be working too hard to fix them as the "touch" is their baby right now.  The click wheel problems might also be software related, as it seems like some of the non-response you get is the software locking up, rather than the click wheel itself not detecting your finger.  I would recommend not purchasing this iPod until a SIGNIFICANT software update is released.  I will update this review for new updates to the software if there is any noticeable difference.  Currently I have version 1.0.1  *Update: I have found that if you disable "view album artwork" on the settings in iTunes, this dramatically speeds up the iPod.  It is a shame you need to do this, but it even makes the click wheel more responsive.  You will have no artwork, at all, on the iPod, but the music and menus will function quickly.    *Apple released software version 1.0.2.  I have not noticed any change in performance running the iPod without artwork.  I enabled artwork to test if the patch did anything there, and I must say that the speed of the menus has improved and the coverflow is a lot more smooth (though still not very useful). However, it is still slower than the old iPods and the flaws mentioned above remain.  *Apple released software version 1.0.3. Hopefully it will address some of  the above mentioned concerns.  ***WARNING - I have installed software update 1.1.  It has some serious issues and I would not advise installing this update.  For some, it is bricking the iPod. Not for me, but there are some really weird/bad things it does and I haven't noticed anything good that it does. The most noticeable negative change is that the iPod does not turn off correctly at the end of a playlist.   I like to listen to my iPod as I fall asleep (The Classic Tales podcast is excellent, look into it), so I do an "on the go" playlist with one episode, so that after I fall asleep the episode will end and the iPod will shut off.  Not so with the new update.  At the end of the episode the iPod just plays what I can only describe as dead air. So, the iPod will just play this (I guess until the iPod runs out of batteries, but I usually just find it playing dead air in the morning and turn it off manually by holding the play button).    My fears about the software updates not being priority for Apple look like they are coming true.  I have a sneaking feeling that they will update the iPod Touch to a full sized iPod (30GB-60GB) before the Classic is fixed.  Again, buy a 5th gen if you can find one and avoid this product.

<Title>Could it be? A hard drive music player with decent audio quality? Nope. Try again. 
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I put off getting an iPod for quite some time. Too expensive, I thought, and the sound quality probably isn't that good. But finally the alluring 80 gigabyte storage capacity and ultrahip stylings of the iPod Classic could keep me iPodless no longer, so I bought one.  I have a fairly extensive collection of music on my computer, and I was already using iTunes, so loading it up was no problem. Quite pleasant actually. The battery was charged and the screen was great. Everything was fantastic. Until... I finally started listening to music on it. I tried the Apple headphones included with the unit. Rubbish, but that's to be expected. Moved up to my nice pair of around-ear studio headphones. Still not great. Messed with the EQ, and found this was the problem. And oh what a problem it was.  First off, there's no custom EQ setting. Ridiculous.  Second, none of the settings have adaquate bass for desirable listening. Stuck listening to tinny, trebley music sucks. And I'm not really an audiophile.  Third, the EQ settings that approach having a listenable amount of bass response clip the signal. Digital distortion does not sound good like analog can. Harsh clipping in the lower registers. I've had a few portable CD players that had plenty of bass response sans clipping, so I know it is possible. This is just atrocious design. Seriously.  Other reviews complain about a nonresponsive clickwheel, and the useless Cover Flow feature, but these aspects didn't bother me. I actually quite like everything about it except for the sound quality (I even imported a few discs using the Apple Lossless format and still the quality is disappointing). Even watching movies on the thing is kind of fun, which I was surprised about.  Alas, I will continue to use it when out and about because having an enormous volume of music available at all times is quite convenient, and we all know convenience is everything in this day and age.   So, my recommendation would be not to buy this product if you care about how your music sounds, although if by some chance you are going to be running it through an external amplifier and EQ, you can disable the internal EQ and it will sound just fine. Try and find somebody with one so you can try it out before you buy to see if you mind the subpar audio. I doubt the Zune sounds better, but try that one out as well.

<Content>I bought the i-pod classic since I needed a stereo for my living room.  I purchased the Cambridge 745, which is a Bose competitor.  It has an ipod dock, and the remote will control the ipod too.  I bought the classic so I could transfer my CD collection to the ipod, make playlists, and have easy access to my music.  It's working great - loads of memory, just requires patience and lots of time to get the music on it.    I would go with the nano if I were using it to carry around, but the classic is great for a home stereo.

<Content>When my Creative Vision Zen M fried, I needed a replacement - quick.  I was away at school and needed something to drown out my noisy downstairs neighbors.  I decided to go with the original this time, and I am very pleased.  The iPod, with all things Apple, is like driving a Cadillac after years of driving a Chevy - beautiful to behold, and a pleasure to "drive."  Sound and video quality are superb.  My only complaint is the amazingly thin body and polish rear surface, which makes the iPod a tad difficult to hang onto in arthritic hands.  But all in all, I am very pleased and would buy another.

<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this new ipod.  If you are like me and have a 5 or 6 year old ipod then this one is revolutionary!   The ipod that I inherited from my father several years ago finally began showing its age.  Although the old ipod still works, I felt that I should get a new one--one with color!!  Imagine that.  I think that the resolution on the screen is fantastic.  I have actually downloaded tv shows for the ipod because of the great screen quality, although that is not initially what I thought that I would use the ipod for. i think the sound is way above the first or second generation ipods as well.  It also feels to be made of better quality materials.  I probably really wanted an Iphone, but I settled on this because I didn't want to pay to get out of my cell ontract and I actually use my ipod as a hard drive (being a teacher).  I think that this is one of the best purchases that I have made.

<Content>The other negative/mediocre reviews have already pretty much said it.  Itunes is buggy, and Apple is trying harder then ever to force people to use it.  The new UI and click wheel are kind of clunky, although they look pretty.  Sound and picture quality are fine, but there are other players out there that are just as good without the annoyances that come with the new Ipods.  I traded mine in for one of the new creative zen players, and haven't regretted it.

<Date>Sat Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first ipod. I always have had a regular 1 giga mp3 player and I was ok with it. But three weeks ago, a friend of mine turned up with the new ipod classic (6generation) and told it was 80 giga for just 240 euros. And I thought "That's interesting". Then he show me the new cover flow interface...which is stunning...at that moment i knew I was also gonna get one.  Now that I have i just can say that "absolutely love it". Its huge capacity allow me to put all my music library in it and browse through the albums easily with the mentioned beautifully crafted cover flow mode.  I think the design is also great. I have the black one and looks great. I don't get any of the complains on the reviews. The wheel works perfectly smooth on mine. And now this ipod is so much thinner, just in case you didn't notice!  If you already have an ipod video, you probably won't need to upgrade to this version. But if you don't have and Ipod, go get it right now!!! It's well worth the money!!!

<Title>Don't Believe All The Reviews
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've never written a review before, but felt I had to this time because some of the negative reviews here almost kept me from buying a terrific product.  Specifically, I was concerned about comments about the scroll wheel not functioning properly, and about comments about accessories for previous iPods not working on the Classic.    Fortunately, I went to Best Buy and was able to play with their display model for quite a while.  I used the scroll wheel extensively and found that I had no problems with it at all.    All my accessories for my iPod minis work with the Classic, including my AC charger and the adapter I use to listen to the iPod through my car radio.  I was surprised at how watchable video is on the Classic; I thought the small screen would be impossible.  But, the picture quality is so good that I actually find that I would watch videos on this iPod while traveling.  I've been converting video files and loading them onto the Classic with zero problems.   I've had no problems syncing the Classic with iTunes either.  I wonder if those having problems are limited by computer resources.  I have a HP Pavilion running XP with 2Gb of RAM.  All in all, I'm thrilled with the Classic and strongly recommend that folks check it out for themselves rather than just believing the reviews (including this one!).

<Title>The SLUGGISH new IPOD CLASSIC
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Ipod Classic 80 GB is sluggish and the click wheel sensitivity has just deteriorated compared to the previous Ipod Models. I own several IPOD's starting with the 2nd generation and frankly the SLUGGISHNESS to user controls and the WEIGHT of the new 80GB classic is quite a disappointment. Apple packs less in the package, first the dock disappeared , then the CD and  now the sleeve has disappeared. All you get that matters  is the IPOD and a USB connector cable. The  output volume is more powerful and the battery appears to to have less work to do , so will last longer. My Ipod touch arrives next week and I hope that will give me more joy than the classic !

My boyfriend takes it on trips, downloads movies for plane rides and is all set. I would recommend an iPod over any other MP3 any day of the week.

<Content>I purchased this as a gift for my husband for his birthday. Overall, it's easy to load music and movies onto and has a ton of space. Considering his original iPod was a Nano Shuffle, this is a considerable upgrade.  I like the brushed silver finish and the size is a little bigger (though a little thinner) than a cell phone. It's not super small, so if you're using it to exercise, you may want to consider an arm band. At first, my husband thought it was too big to use when he worked out (he's used to the Nano, remember), but now that he's discovered he can load movies onto it, there's a new found love!   Overall, I am extremely pleased with the product and my purchase!

The music is easy to upload/change/customize with Itunes (just make sure your computer has a hard drive large enough), the music is easy to browse through with the "cover flow", you can upload playlists, the pictures get converted to a different format before loading onto the Ipod so it saves space, and one of the best features is the ability to upload games!!  Itunes has some great games to download/upload.  Phase is a good version of the Guitar Hero game.  Overall an excellent product.

<Content>Just upgraded from a 4G Ipod, so the difference in features is amazing.  The menus are well organized and very intuitive.  When using coverflow, the Ipod has a tendency to freeze for a couple of seconds while changing menus or even playing the selected soundtrack.  Personally I don't see much use for the coverflow, specially when you have over 50Gigs of music.  When you are NOT using coverflow, the Ipod runs like usual.  Coverflow is nice to look at, but its more practical just to search for music by genre, artist, etc.

<Content>Hello all,  First I would like to say that I have the 80GB Classic iPod and I just LOVE IT! The cover flow is a great feature and I cannot find something I don't like!  Ok, I have read several reviews (specially the first one) and I completely disagree. I have to say, PLEASE STOP WHINING! Do not give bad reviews for extremely tiny things like this! You are misleading other customers to other products when they can get this one! Yeah, I saw the video about the "Cover Flow Annoyance", and yes, the cover flow takes about 0.0000065461 seconds to load the arts, SO WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!? I guess you can live with that! Is not like it affects the iPod's whole performance!  So, if you really like the iPod, and you trust in Apple, BUY THIS! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!  Sincerely,  A very satisfied customer with his 80GB iPod Classic.

I even went to the Apple site and tried to download it that way but the needed Quick Time program wouldn't load. So now I have a brand new 80 gig Ipod that I can't tell if it works because of this issue. I am sure however that if these issues didn't plague me I would rate this product much higher. As it is I can't even see if it came in working order and is functioning. Disappointing.

<Content>I've had a LOT of iPods and other media players. I still have a nano 2g for the gym and skiing, but this iPod holds my whole music library, sounds great and is small enough to be easy to carry around.  The battery life is great, sound is awesome and video isn't bad though I'd never try to watch a full length movie on a screen this small.  I considered an iTouch, but I think the novelty will wear off and I'll have a 16GB music player, larger than my nano, a $399 price tag and no ability to control things like volume or song forwarding without taking it out and looking at it to run the touch screen.

<Content>It took me a long time to decide which MP3 player to buy because of all the varied reviews.  Well, I have had no trouble with the IPOD 80GB Classic.  I'm really impressed with how good it works.  Sure, I wish it knew what I was thinking when I am driving so I didn't have to touch it to tell it what to play next, but that is probably in the plans.  Be sure to think about the space difference between the 80 and 160.  You may really not need the 160.  I wondered about this too.  I think if I ever manage to get the 80 filled up, they will have a new model out and it will be 2 years down the road first.  Maybe I just don't have that much though.  The whole Bible (like 70 hours), 600- 30 minute pod casts and all my music takes less than 20 GB.  The itunes software isn't too bad either.  There is a lot of free stuff there like pod casts on your favorite subjects that can be set up to download regularly and automatically.  I think the Apple MP3 program is nice and refined.  Mine works great on Vista and previously XP.  I hope you have the same good fortune.

<Title>Quite disappointed
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I switched over from Creative's Muvo Slim to iPod 80 GB Black. I had been using the Muvo since last 2 years switching to iPod was a little tough for me in beginning. It lacks lot of features, it lacks compatibility, it's not comfortable. I mean it's like slavery, well that's how I really felt everytime I had to switch on my system to sync it with iTune that to from my profile.   Though I bought it for myself but it feels that it does not belong to me. As if it belongs completely to Apple of to Mr. Jobs for that matter. The reason I say this is because, I am a developer, I work for best of the best web designs, I talk about Open Source, I talk about Web 2.0, Simplicity, User centric applications and design. The simplicity of iPod is limited to the look and feel. The internal functionality is completely of it's own, might be good for people using MAC. But it's complex in operation. I feel it lacks flexibility.  I was reading a book recently and found out that people like to be a part of the iPod cult, flashing the white earphones. There are many excellent products available, I recommend Creative not just because I used it but because I could connect it to any machine, could arrange songs as per folders, can delete the songs from the device itself, you would be satisfied with it because of what it is and what value it gives you NOT just because you belong to a cult. I had no choice but to buy Bose earphones to listen to iPod. The audio and video quality of iPod is great (depends mostly upon the quality of songs). But the iTune thing I hate most, it takes most of my time trying to arrange things.   The learning curve for iTune and iPod sync is the worst part for busy people like me. May be this is the reason it's a kit amongst the teens. The concept does not even resemble something that I can get from my memory and use to learn it. Learn to use something completely new from scratch, if you are a busy person ask your secretary to arrange things for you every time. God bless you!!!

<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son got an ipod for Christmas.  Less than two months later, he goes to use it and the screen is messed up on the inside.  He didn't drop it.  There is no sign of any damage at all on the outside.  So, we went in to the apple store and they said we needed an appointment. We made one for an hour later (the first one available), came back, waited & waited while various people went on break, usually only leaving one guy on duty. We finally get up there. The guy said that, if you carry the ipod around (actually expect it to be portable), it's common for the side to get "pinched" which ruins the screen and they consider it your fault. To fix it out of warranty was $149. So we're out $299 but there's no point in throwing good money after bad.  I guess I should keep an eye out for a class action suit.

The only thing is my motorcycle has an AUX input that will connect to the audio system (Honda Goldwing) an after about 30 min or so it will lock up.

<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I upgraded from a first generation Mini, so the storage space is a real bonus. In short, I am pleased, so far, with the look, functionality, and features.  Some complain that this device should have wireless capability, a voice recorder, and a radio, but I don't have a need for any of those things in my portable music player.  The scroll wheel doesn't work well (hesitates) when working in any screen that contains graphics. Otherwise it works fine -- when I scroll through my Artist list, for example. (BTW, beyond the novelty, I see no use for the Cover Flow.) I am hoping that updated software will address the scroll wheel problems. I am still impressed. The Classic cost me the same as my first-gen mini and has twenty times the storage, is comparable in size and weight, has  a full color screen, and photo and video capabilities. Maybe there is better technology out there, but, for now, I am still a fan of the Ipod.

<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine to use with the Monitor Audio i-deck speaker system and so far I can't fault it. Its very easy to use and the sound quality is excellent with this setup.  Currently I'm ripping my CD collection at 256kbps, which produces near CD quality. My only quibble is that it takes a long time for itunes to rip the CD's - but this may be my incompetence rather than anything to do with the product. However, once the iPod is connected songs are uploaded very quickly.  I haven't tried the provided earphones yet, but from what other users have said these are not worth bothering with. Compared with a previous HDD/mp3 player I bought this is vastly superior in every respect, and I now understand why Apple dominate the market for these players.

<Content>I come from a 5 ipod family.  I was very excited to hear about the new "Classic" being released due to the large capacity of it. Went out and bought a 80 gb for my daughter and a 160 gb for myself. Brought them home,  plugged them in and it was nothing but downhill from there. Syncing problems, freezes, and overall very slow performance. Went straight back to where I bought them and got 2 more. Same results. I keep up on the discussions section of Apple's site just to find that this problem is everywhere. Still no fixes as of 10-12-07. As a matter of fact, I am very disappointed in Apple's "hush, hush" attitude when it comes to acknowledging  that there is a problem. I want nothing more then to have this product work. Unfortunately it is a huge disappointment and so is Apple. Shame on Apple for their handling of what is obviously a poor product. I would recommend buying an earlier generation ipod or look to another manufacturer. If I could rate this product lower then 1 star I would!!!

<Title>Um... Apple?
<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My last iPod was a 3rd generation unit with 40GB capacity. Its performance over the years (and still in my car) is excellent. I replaced the battery last year and it's like new. However, my music collection is getting very close to exceeding the 40GB capacity, so I purchased an iPod Classic 80GB.  First, the good: The screen is excellent for both movies and photos. Audio quality is excellent, as expected. Battery life seems to be better than advertised. The new user interface was rather slow and cumbersome, but Apple has resolved that issue with the latest firmware update.  Now the bad: No Firewire support -- just the slower USB2 standard; older iPod games do NOT work with this model, so if you've purchased games for your 5th generation iPod, they will NOT work and you will have to purchase them again -- once the authors re-write them; your VIDEO accessories (e.g., TV output cables) will not work from your 5th generation iPod (though the dock from my 3rd generation works fine).  I believe Apple has made a BIG internal hardware change with this new iPod. With no backward compatibility for purchased games and no backward compatibility for video accessories (this includes the portable LCD screens that the iPod can connect to), Apple has got a potential for an uphill battle. Most of these things did not affect me because I had such an old iPod that didn't support games or video output, however many people upgrading from the 5th generation iPod will have a nasty surprise.

<Content>It's going to break in a year or two anyway, so buy the cheap one, preferably from another company.  My Sony walkman from 15 years ago still works fine, but the iPod died after two years.  I would never buy an Apple laptop because I'm so disappointed in the iPod.  The iPod is a total ripoff.  Since there are much cheaper products available, Apple must be marking up their products to an insane extent.  Although Apple ethics were great twenty years ago, I no longer respect them.  Brand loyalty is the only thing Apple has going for them, so they better make sure their products are high quality.

<Title>bad reviews are misleading
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I read the bad reviews here and they are all very particular and specific and odd (i.e., the problems these people are having will probably never happen to you).  This version of the iPod is probably going to be the last in its line before they switch over completely to the iPod Touch version.  But when I was trying to figure out which one to go with RIGHT NOW, the Touch is 400 freakin' dollars and it only has 16 GB on it!  That's nothing as far as I'm concerned - maybe I'm spoiled but I like putting all sorts of things on my iPod besides my entire record collection which is around 35 GB right off the bat.  The iPod "Classic" is not perfect or ideal (starting with its stupid name)- the ideal would be an iTouch with 80 GB or higher - but its pretty sweet.  The games on it work really well once you get used to the wheel, as far as I know there are no games on the iTouch.  The video looks really good on the iPod Classic too.  As far as the meat is concerned which is the music, the cover flow works fine - all that stuff about it being too sluggish is b.s. - the sound quality is really good and it comes with about 20 preset EQ settings which are nice.  Sync with iTunes is really easy and almost fun and in short its just really simple to use and does the job.  My advice is to get this one and wait for Apple to release an iTouch with more GB later, which might take awhile but I just have a hard time paying 400 dollars for 16 gb just so I can move an album cover across the screen with my finger.  p.s. yeah, the itouch has the wi-fi internet capability but I have trouble digesting what I read about it, like no java - that's a big setback, most of my favorite websites rely on that -otherwise I'm just looking at an incredibly shrunken version of a website and that doesn't really do much for me.

I contemplated buying the Ipod Touch, but was afraid that I would bang it up taking it to the gym and everyday use and $400.00 is a little too steep to shell out for an Ipod with only 16GB although the features are impressive.  Right out of the box, the Ipod Classic is very user friendly in syncing with Itunes which I love.   Not having a video Ipod before, I am very impressed and glad that I waited for the 6th generation Ipod.

<Content>Okay. I must say whoever gives this product anything less than 4 stars is a complete and utter retard. Really. This is the best product out there in terms of mp3 and video playback devices. There are many out there that make up a list of complaints and they are all so repetitive. As for the odd problems about freezing and the screen just turning black, it'll probably happen once ever couple of thousand Ipods or so. In other words, it'll probably never happen to you. The complaints I hate the most are the ones about the album covers. I have one thing to say to you. SHUT UP! If you want the album cover, go to the store and buy the CD. That's it. And as for you people that have legitimate problems, that's why this product comes with a warranty. Get it replaced and stop complaining about the stupidest things. I've never had one single problem with my Ipod. That's because I take care of my possesions. So for all of you out there looking for a really great mp3/video player get this. There is no equal. Except maybe for the zune but there's only one button on that thing and personally, I like the flawless clickwheel. Basically, if you take care of your Ipod, it'll stay in working condition.

<Title>Sweet piece of technology!
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So this is my 1st IPOD and it is everything I hoped it would be. 80 GB's is very adequate for what I needed it for. If you plan on using an ipod for just MP3's, you may want a smaller size, but since I have all of my music, photos and videos on it, it is perfect. This can easily be used as a portable hard drive if needed.  The shiny, chrome, metallic backside looks awesome with the black front, however is very prone to scratching. I have recently purchased a case for it that will inevitably save my ipod from reckless drunks and spilled beverages.  I had heard that this generation was slow and no good overall, but I am hear to say that this is a great buy. The screen is big enough to watch short videos and even has the ability to utilize an AV out to playback on a tv or desktop monitor. This also works well with slideshows that you can play to music if you so choose. I have heard/read several reviews that state that the coverflow function is overated and slow. Well.... it is. First you need to find all of the artwork, then download it. But the real hassle is trying to find music based on the cover artwork. Even if I had taken the time to setup and find the artwork, I would rarely, if ever, utilize that function for searching for music. Searching by album name or artist name is much easier and efficient, especially if you don't know what art you are looking for because you didn't actually buy/own the physical album.  Overall, I am satisfied with this IPOD and would recommend buying this model, especially if you intend on using it for more than just MP3's. In the end, I would also recommend buying a case for this not just because it will scratch easy, but also because for $250, you can't be too careful.

<Title>iPod Classic ... BOOOOOOO!
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am very unhappy with my new iPod Classic.  The iPod itself isn't the problem either. It is the decisions that Apple has made concerning this product.  I upgraded from a 5th generation Video iPod to gain some more storage space and enjoy some of the new features. I have had my 5th generation iPod for about a year now and have quite a collection of accessories and games.  I was disappointed however to discover that none of these items are now compatible with the iPod classic.  Cubis 2, Lost, Mini Golf, Ms. Pac Man, Sims Bowling, Sims Pool, Texas Hold 'Em and Zuma (some of which I purchased recently) will not work on my new iPod Classic. That's $40 in games, now no good to me.  My disgust with my new iPod grew when I plugged my iPod Classic into my DLO Home Dock Deluxe (The one I purchased to upgrade from my DLO Home Dock because I was not able to navigate videos on the TV screen with the original version, thanks to Apple) only to discover that my iPod Classic is not compatible! Nor is it compatible with any other system other than Apple overpriced $50 A/V Cable.  I also purchased a $300 pair of i-Vue video glasses for iPod, that of course also will not work with my new iPod Classic.  I urge Apple to correct this horrendous shortcoming in the next iPod firmware update.  This seems to be a trend with Apple ever since they decided to suddenly drop firewire from the iPod line up after convincing us that firewire was the connective cable of the future. Apple seems to only be interested in gaining market shares, current customers be damned!  I'll think twice before my next Apple product "upgrade"  ------------------------ Bill Roark Apple User since my Apple IIe

<Title>One of the best purchase choices I've ever made!
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>What started out as a spontaneous purchase choice has turned out to be one of the best buys I've made in a long time! I had not planned on replacing my 5th generation unit until my Apple Care Protection Plan expired. However, when it was accidentally dropped in my parking lot at work and then run over, I was forced to make a sudden upgrade. I was a little hesitant in investing in another Apple product because of all the problems I had been having with my previous two. Yes, that's right I said two! I had only owned my first iPod for about two months before it started to freeze up on me. So when I took it into my local Apple Store then gave me a refurbished player and the problems seemed to get worse. In fact, the very day my previous iPod got destroyed, I was actually planning on getting it checked out to see what they could do for me. But enough about my previous iPod, lets get to the new one.  For starters, I'm extremely pleased that Apple discontinued making iPods that have less then 80 GBs of hard drive space. The reason I say this, is I happened to have a rather large music and video collection. So the benefits of this extra space are endless for me. Another thing I really love is the design. This until holds 50 GBs more space then my last iPod and it's twice as small. This makes it beyond convenient for me to haul it around and just stick it in my pocket. I also love the 2.5 inch screen. Like I had mentioned before, I love watching videos on my iPod and this way I do not have to lug my laptop with me where ever I go. I also own conversion software that can change any video I have in my collection to an MPEG format. This is a nice feature for my video collection and my wallet. The one thing that makes this unit stand out from any of the other previous iPod models is the battery life! I can not tell you how wonderful this is for me because I constantly fall asleep while listening to my iPod. But the most noticeable upgrade for any Apple user is the software changes and the touch wheel. The new GUI that is implemented on my unit is definitely eye catching and easy. And the touch wheel is even better then my last unit.   There is really only one thing I would change about the new iPod and that's the GUI. I'm one of the few that does not like the split screen menu with my artwork changing in the background. I'd rather have that as a screen saver option then integrated in the menu. I also believe that the cover flow is a pointless option to have. I have never used it and probably never will. And my last gripe is the screensaver that pops up after you've been listening to your iPod for a while. I would prefer to see what I'm listening to. Call it a control issue if you'd like, but it's just plain annoying.   Over all I really love my new player and wouldn't change it for the world. Goes to show that spontaneity can be a good thing!

<Title>IPOD Classic 160 Gig
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My first and last Apple product.  The click wheel is SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!  Surprise - the TV out works only with expensive Apple cables - I bought the $50 cables they are terrible.  They are cheap and slippery - very hard to use.  No remote control of video.    Just got a gift of a 80 gig Zune.  Stuck the IPOD 160 Classic in a drawer - the Zune is MUCH better.  Zune has video out - video remote - is faster than the IPOD - has a bigger and better screen - etc..  Wish I could get my money back for the IPOD.  DO NOT BUY the IPOD 160, it is a waste of money.

<Title>Nice iPod, but....
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always desired this music (and video!)player. When I saw the new release with 80 GB (a lot of memory) instead of 30 GB I purchased it inmediately because All my music from CDs and mp3, and the videos can be stored in this device. Now I'm enjoing it and I like it. Good for Apple.  Unfortunately, it's something wrong: In release 5.5 the video output from the iPod to a TV was a simple cable connected in the headphone jack, and now, with the new version I have to PURCHASE a dock station to connect the iPod to the TV. and it's not only the cost of the device, but the fact you have to carry this dock st. to another place if you want to show your videos to your family or friends. With iPod 5.5 you only use a simple cable you'll carry in your pocket. Bad for Apple in this fact.

<Content>Please enlighten me.  I recently bought an Black IPOD and received one with a white earpiece and white charger. I called Apple to return it and get a White IPOD but they want to charge me a 10% restocking fee. Wish I had bought it from Amazon instead. Do not buy from the Apple store, they will charge you a restocking fee if return it for any reason.  Daniel

<Content>Latest firmware upgrade can cause the internal HD to continue running after shut down, which of course runs the battery dead.  User interface is slow at best, coverflow is almost unusable.  It never ceases to amaze me what Apple gets away with yet is still loved by everyone.  Update: if you do NOT use Coverflow to select an album for playback, the battery draining bug will not occur.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just upgraded my 3rd Gen Ipod the "Classic"  I was already using iTunes 7.4, so uploading all my music and photos was a breeze.  I love being able to use the ipod as a backup for my all my photos.  At first I didnt like the split screen menu, but now Im starting to like it.  I like how you can preview photos and album covers.  A lot of people have complained about the cover flow. Since most of my music is from ripped cds, I dont use it.  I downloaded a couple of TV shows and the picture is very crisp.  But I couldnt use it to watch a movie...screen still too small.  Battery life is huge, and the metal enclosure is very sturdy.  I also love the search feature.  My only complaint is the click wheel.  It seems my 3 year old ipod's wheel is more responsive.  Other than that, I love my new ipod!!

<Title>Bought this one and found the issues (as expected...) 
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Why did I buy this one? I have a 40GB iPodphoto and it got full. I have 9954 songs in it. I could not add any more since a few months ago and I would like to have more capacity.   As many reviewers commented, the system does not respond smoothly. It looks something similar to what happens to your old PC running latest resource hungry software. I suspect this is due to not-enough hardware resource such as logic processer, memory or system design itself, or otherwise resource consuming software. I think Apple should have used more powerful hardware to adjust its capability and to bring better balance to its system. That might increase power consumption and heat and size of the iPod but anyone will get more and more irritated gradually if he/she sees slow interface everytime he/she uses it. Every little makes a mickle.  Its UI design almost remains the same and looks OK but what matters most is the user experience. Unlike PC, you cannot increase memory to boost the performance of iPod. Only Apple can do it. But their profit margin is expanding. I feel there is something wrong here.  Otherwise, software UI looks almost the same as the previous version. I basically like it but sometimes feel that it would be nicer if I could change the sequence of the recent added songs and purchased ones, as the songs in the added albums are shown and played in a reverse order. Bottom line - no rush to buy expecpt you need more capacity. Hope Apple will update the software to solve this problem. - may be just a wishful thinking -     Two stars.

<Title>Latest Generation has problems
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This latest 6th gen seems to have some OS problems. It works, but the interface is very slow. Also, when listening to podcasts (or any music really), selecting a song to listen to often fails to start the song or podcast and has to be pressed again, or it will play the next song instead. I have a 5th gen 30GB which has neither of these problems. It's very annoying. I don't think I could live without an ipod these days, but I wish they'd spend some more on quality control.

<Title>It all depends on your level of expectations..
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My review is gonna be a little long but I hope it brings some light to people who don't know whether to buy or not this product.  The classic is nothing more than an update to the 5th gen ipod. Like ANY update in the world, it adds some new features, cuts others and changes others. Plain and simple. I don't consider it fair to judge it a bad device just because you had the expectation that the classic was gonna reinvent the wheel and solve all world problems.  In my opinion, the only thing I really think that should be improved is the sensitivity of the clickwheel. I loved the way it worked on my previous 5g iPod and in the 6g it's not as responsive.  It fits in my Iskin Evo3 which I used for my previous 30gb (I got the 80gb model). It even feels a little less tight in it meaning it's gotta be maybe a hair thinner than the 30gb. I had to cut the part that covers the clickwheel because it doesn't work anymore through anything (I uploaded a picture of it). In the 5g I could change the volume even through my jeans. The 6g should be touched directly to browse or change the volume.  One welcome feature is that you can change the shuffle mode (off/songs/albums) while playing your music by pressing the center button and without going to the main menu.  Another welcome feature is that you can change the brightness of the screen while watching your videos (then again, by pressing the center button).  One very nice thing I found out is that with my ExtremeMac Tango speakers (since speakers use some standard commands I guess every speaker out there can do the same) if I put the ipod into the much criticized cover flow menu, I could actually browse through my music by pressing FF or REW on the remote and select an album (by pressing play button on the remote). If you selected an album by mistake, just click rewind and it goes back to the cover flow menu and just keep on browsing until you find what you're looking for. This is a very welcome feature since you'd be able to browse by the album cover remotely, select an album and when it finishes you could select another album of your preference without touching your ipod!  What I think of the cover flow? Ok, it's a little slow but I don't think you're into a race with someone to see who finds their music faster. And when I say slow, I'm talking about maybe a second at the most to show the unbuffered covers.. and it happens just when you browse very fast so it needs time to buffer the unloaded album covers. Keep in mind that this little device has more storage capacity than many laptops and desktops out there. There can be lots of information stored in it. Even computers hesitate when showing the thumbnails if you go into a folder full of pictures.  I've read some criticisms about the cover flow menu saying that it should show only the albums instead of the tracks because if you got a large amount of music, it could be difficult to find what you're looking for. Well, this is partially true: if you're looking for an album and you see its cover while browsing because you ran into one of its tracks, just click on it and it will show all tracks in that album so in an album with 14 songs, you got 14 chances to find it. I agree it would be easier and faster if only albums were shown but I don't think it's that bad.  You can't put the album artwork in full screen anymore. No big deal though.  After a couple of minutes, the screen changes to a "Screen saver" mode which shows the current time and the remaining battery life. I'd prefer to be able of seeing what I'm playing instead of the hour but then again, no big deal.  I've used it with the ExtremeMac Airplay FM transmitter and it works but when you push one of the buttons to change the transmitting frequency, it only changes the station one time and then freezes for a couple of seconds. You have to wait until the screen goes back to what you're playing to press it again. This is gotta be some software incompatibility problem since the airplay uses the ipod internal software and screen to show the stored stations and information. It's nothing serious but I hope this would be fixed in the next updates.  With the griffin itrip it worked fine since this one has its own screen and don't need the ipod to show anything through it.  Before update 1.0.2 menus were slower and battery life longer. After 1.0.2 I find menus a little faster but battery life a little shorter. Still, it's endless! Just to test it, I left it playing for more than 20 hours and battery only reached half. Haven't tested with long videos but when playing short video podcasts battery power doesn't drop like the 5g did after playing one or 2 videos. It doesn't drop at all indeed unless you watch a long video or browse thoroughly through videos.   Haven't even gone to the games menu because I use my ipod mainly for listening to music. I haven't tried the video out neither for the same reason. I think is much more than a hassle to convert a video for the ipod so I can play it in a TV. Apple should drop this "we-are-so-picky" thing and accept standard formats like avi and mpg!!!  Well, in summary, this is my personal experience and opinion. I respect the other opinions and by no meanings I'm trying to make a dispute here. Just thought it was worth it to make some things clear. My rating would be between 4 and 5 stars out of 5.  Pros:  - It may be a "less-beautiful-to-some-people" aluminum face but it's much more resistant. I prefer it to be this way though: what's the use of it being beautiful if you have to put it into a case immediately because it scratches so easily and gets ugly so fast? to my taste, it looks very nice indeed.  - Battery life - Storage space - Price - Nice menus - Thinner than the 5g  Cons:  - Not-so-responsive clickwheel - Some software-related incompatibility with -SOME- accessories that worked even with the 5 /5.5 gen

<Title>Underrated
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A couple of months ago my 5g 30 GB iPod video was seriously damaged after a nasty fall and i decided it would be easier to get a new one than repair it, plus my music library is about 50 GB now so I needed more space anyway. At first I was dead set on buying the classic but when bad reviews started coming out, I started to reconsider. I went to an apple store to check it out and compare it with the 5g , and though I did find it slightly slower than the previous iPod, it wasn't anything major (browsing the artist, album, or song menus was just as quick on both iPods, the only noticeable difference was when moving from the main menu to the music menu). Convinced that the reviews were exaggerated,  I decided to buy it. Having used it for about a month and a half now, here's what I think about the iPod classic:  Pros: - Great battery life, gives a bit over forty hours of playing time. - Anodized aluminum casing, no more annoying scratches (at least on the front) - Great new interface makes browsing very enjoyable - Very slim, fits easily and comfortably in your pocket - Large storage capacity   Cons: - like I said, slightly slower than 5g - the click wheel, while working completely fine when used directly, can be unresponsive at times when used through a cover - cover flow, while being good eye candy, is not very useful; though the new firmware has sped things up, it drains the life out of the battery in no time (compared to the 40 hours I got using the normal menu, I got only about 6-8 hours with cover flow). I think the reason for all this is the hard drive; when you browse, the drive has to churn very quickly, draining the battery. This doesn't happen with the Nano, the Touch, or the iPhone because they all use flash memory.  Bottom line, if you have a large music library, ignore the negative reviews, because this is the best large capacity mp3 player on the market. If you have less than 16 gigs of music and don't mind spending a little extra, go for the iPod Touch.

<Title>Best Toy I've Bought in Years
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It took about a year for my sister-in-law to convince me to spring for my first iPod (or any other type of portable music machine) and it took about a day for me to fall in love with it. I can't offer a highly technical evaluation for I have only the one...nothing to compare it to...but for the pure joy of hearing my music in such a compact and portable device, I can't imagine much better.  I've now purchased Inport Deluxe and am in the process of converting several hundred cassettes and LP's into iTunes.  I thought they would be lost but am delighted to have them back!  Just received my Bose portable SoundDock and first impressions are that it is an awesome marriage!  And now, instead of fumbling through dozens of CD's on long road trips, I only need to take my iPod and FM converter and I'm in music heaven.  Thanks Apple...I love it!

<Title>I love my iPod
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I first considered getting an iPod, I really didn't think I'd use it often enough to justify the price. In fact, my husband bought me one a few years back when they were going for $400 and I made him take it back to the store! Then I got one this past December.  It turns out I use my iPod Classic every single day. I love everything about it. I enjoy manually managing my music through Winamp (not a fan of iTunes although I must use it for photo transfers) and listening to my music in the car during my commute. In fact, I haven't used my car's cd-changer since getting the iPod.  I really love the cover flow feature and use it almost exclusively to access my music because I like seeing a visual representation of my albums. I have over 2000 songs currently on my iPod and have enough space to easily add at least three times that much before I will start running low on space, and all my MP3s are ripped at 320kbps.   I'm an amateur photographer and I like that I can dump my photos on the iPod to show to friends and family. Ever a list maker, I utilize the notes function as well to keep running grocery and to-do lists that I can update at work and home.  Podcasts are pretty cool too. They are a great way to discover new music or watch short comedy clips or news.  The iPod is definitely one of the best "toys" I've purchased.

<Title>Nearly Flawless
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had lots of experience with iPods and Apple in the past, as this is my 3rd iPod. No, it is not my 3rd because the others were bad, it is the 3rd because I stay current with the iPods. So anyway, when I recieved mine, the first thing I noticed was how slim it was. The polished aluminum front is beautiful, but the silver back is kind of annoying, because it shows fingerprints. Anyway, I have had almost no problems with it thus far, except that the Cover Flow option is sometimes a bit slow showing the album covers, and occasionally when I play a song, it will show the wrong album. (For example, a Stevie Ray Vaughan cover, but an AC/DC song.) Anyway, that has only happened a few times, and it doesn't really matter anyway. iPods are somewhat weak against dropping them, so I purchased and aluminum case for it, and it is amazing as well. The one other problem I've had, but I'm not entirely sure its a problem, is the fact that I thought it had approximately 24 hours of music per full charge, and I dont get near that many. Anyway, other than that, I've had a wonderful experience thus far with it and I plan to keep doing just that. Enjoy!

<Title>Freezes with iTunes
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just returned the one I bought yesterday.  There's a problem with the interface with iTunes and it ends up using 100% of your cpu capacity over and over again.  It took me 20 minutes just to make a 10-song playlist!!  According to the support guy I spoke with on the phone, Apple is aware of this problem, but is not talking about it.  The salespeople claim to know nothing, but were very quick to give me a full refund without a restocking fee.  I've seen threads on several forums online discussing the issue -- it appears to be fairly widespread.  Anyways, my three-year-old iPod conked out on me, so I don't have time to wait around for Apple to fix a problem they won't even publicly acknowledge.  I bought an 80gb 5th generation enhanced - a little more expensive, but I know it works, as my partner has one.

OF course APPLE has to produce a brand new ipod! I mean seriously, the disappointment grows each day when I find that new designs are coming out (this one not to my liking). I'm not a big fan of this aluminum casing either... I prefer the smudging cover of the ipod video. And the colors... The Black one looks so dull it looks like a fake casing or something that sells as the fake ipod... Silver looks nice on the NANO, but White looks better on the Ipod video...

<Title>Goodbye Apple...
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Recently purchased the silver 'Classic' 80 GB as a present. Everyone was impressed by the 'metal make-over', but the new owner is currently figuring out his new toy so please stop reading if you want any more [technical] details otherwise than that it's made him very happy...  I'm afraid it will be the last Apple I've bought. Don't get me wrong, I love my twin 5.5 gen 80 GB iPod [my prClassic 160 GB concept...], adored my iMac, but it's REALLY starting to annoy me that mr. Steve Jobs seems to think that the USD and the Euro are the same currency.   They are not.   Thus we Eurolanders pay 500 USD for the 160 GB Classic, 600 for the 16 GB Touch or 4000 for an Apple notebook Pro.   All this quite amazes me, because when Apple would charge the REAL [ = American] prices -175 Euro for the 80 GB Classic, Yippee! 245 Euro for the 160 GB, Golly! 275 Euro for the 16 GB Touch, De-Lovely!- a mindblowing number of individuals in Europe would be converted to devoted Applelites, which -besides being great for Apple- wouldn't be a bad thing since I consider Apple as one of the many American representatives that culturally enrich the world [don't bother me with the hamburger-culture clichand worse blah blah].    But no.

<Content>What more can I say if you love music get this product. I have not really put it down since I had it. Its nothing better than being able to download almost your whole music collection and being able it take it on the road without any hassle. 80gigs for 249 is hard to beat especially when the 80gig use to go for more than that.

<Title>Apple ignores problems with this classic
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first iPod was the Black 4-gig Nano.  I loved it except that I had to keep removing content as I purchased new CDs.  I guestimated how much content I own in CDs and purchased the 80gig classic in September.    At first, having only loaded a few gigs worth of material, things seemed fine.  After I'd gotten the 30+gigs of tunes on...problems became apparent.   Using iTunes to manipulate content on the iPod Classic is horribly slow.  If I create a playlist, for example and go to drag tunes from various artists, the processor peaks at 98 to 100%.  The mouse isn't able to click on anything else in iTunes for 30 seconds.  Timing things I've seen it peak cpu load 10 seconds after moving each title to a playlist and stay peaked for about 30 seconds.  This never happened on the nano.  So I ventured onto an apple forum that a google search pointed me to.  Many others there have the same problem on both OS X and Windows platforms with both the 80 and 160gig classics.  Turning on/off artwork doesn't alleviate the problem.  Folks who got replacement iPods continued to have the same problems.  When I went to add my post, I saw the list was locked from further posting so I created an account and a new posting.  Apple removed my post and sent me a generic email saying it violated their policies.  I hadn't used profanity and didn't state anything untrue.  When I posted a message to their feedback form, it told me I wouldn't hear back from anyone but that someone would read it.  Whatever that is worth.  As a computer technician experienced with supporting lots of devices and software, it appears to be a problem with the iPod Classic itself.  It is like it goes in a powerdown/power-up mode with each user input.  That is the case when using it stand-alone as well to navigate the menus and pick a tune, change the volume and so on.  Apple needs to acknowledge that there is a problem then fix it.

<Title>Expensive But Great Product
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this iPod for its ability to play videos, and it does that very well. Although the picture is small, the video is sharp. The headphones that come with the unit have very good audio quality. You probably won't want to watch movies on the small screen all the time,so there is an AV cable that allows you to attach the unit to your TV so you can watch movies on your TV. To make sure it's compatable, you should buy the cable from the iTunes store. At 80GB the iPod is large enough to hold all your music and also quite a few movies at the same time.  The only disadvantage is it only works with the iTunes software and it only plays music and videos purchased from iTunes. It won't work with Amazon Unbox or Movielink or any of the other download services. I have heard there is software out there than can convert other audio/video files to the iTunes file format, but I havn't tried that yet. It charges while connected to your computer which is convenient,and I have found the battery life to be quite good. It's expensive and there aren't many discounts out there. I found the best deal at Amazon at $249.95 with free shipping. If you are looking for an all purpose player to play music and also movies, I think you would be pleased with this one.

<Content>We bought a portable DVD player with an iPod dock a month ago specifically for this new iPod, but Apple changed it's software so that none of the new iPods can be shown on older/unapproved DVD players! Also, if you want to plug it into your TV, you have to drop $50 to buy a specific cable! The iPod Classic will ONLY show video on equipment that has a special chip in it supplied by Apple. Don't waste your money unless you are willing to buy all new equipment to show the videos on!!!

Thinner and lighter than my 60GB with video, and the navigation is superior. I really enjoy cover flow. I can finally get my entire music library, over 1000 CDs, on one tiny device. Amazing. Those who do videos may want to spring for the 160GB version, but this meets my needs perfectly. The new iPod touch is impressive, too, but the capacity is too limited. When Apple comes out with the 80GB model I'll be the first in line.

<Title>VERY HAPPY!!
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok so i just bought the i pod classic two days ago, After having originally bought the 16 gig i pod touch and returning it for the high price, the low capacity and the lack of external volume control. Before the classic i owned a 30 gig i pod video and let me just say i believe that this is a true step up! for having 50 more gigs of space its is just a little bit thinner which is great. also the aluminum finish in the front is very appealing and it seems like you can finally say goodbye to all the terrible scratching to the front of the i pod. The rear is still made from the ridiculously shiny and fingerprint/smudge/scratch prone material. all in all i give it a 9 out of 10 for looks. my only complaint is the back.  -Now for the actual i pod interface i really enjoy the cover flow but im having a lot of trouble with doubles of the same album picture coming up, and when i don't have the album name for a certain song all the songs that don't have album names are bunched together, which for me is definitely a minus because i now find myself using cover flow less. One thing i do really like is the whole split screen aspect, it isn't that big of a deal but it makes the i pod look really nice to have all the album artwork showing itself at random on the right side of the screen. also i haven't had any problems with my i pod lagging or moving slowly as some people are saying (i only have about 3000 songs and 40 something videos).  -The video quality on this i pod isn't that big of a leap from the old generation i pod except that this one has a much brighter screen and the videos are at a slightly higher resolution, also the battery life is phenomenal, in Two days i listened to about 5 hours of music and watched a good 3 hours of videos and still have 50% of the battery life remaining.  -Apple is really stripping down the boxes on the new generation i pods, you can no longer find an i tunes disc included and are required to download it from the internet. also in the box are the new i pod headphones (same from the i pod 5.5 g)(i also suggest getting better headphones for the i pod seeing as these wont last very long!) the Usb cable, 2 apple stickers, and a very small users guide. -One gripe i do have about this device is the sensitivity of the scroll wheel, apple made it so that you have to press down really hard on it to get it to respond, when i first got it i thought i had gotten a broken one because i was so used to just lightly tapping on my last i pod, But it seems that after using it for a little while it either gets more sensitive or you get used to the added pressure to the point where it doesn't seem to have a problem at all. so don't give up on it right away when you notice this! -ALL in all i am very happy with the purchase i have made. The battery life, The sound and the huge amount of storage is an amazing value for the price. if you are thinking about getting a new i pod or replacing an old one and need more than 16 gigs i really believe that you can't go wrong buying this i pod!

<Title>Neat product
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like almost everything about this product.  I wish the battery life were a little longer.  I love that it is lightweight and holds my ENTIRE CD collection (which is not small by any means).  I'm not a big fan of the fact that one must play defense when syncing new songs/videos to it.  It is rather easy for someone who isn't paying attention to accidentally and permanently erase all the content from the iPod (or rather from iTunes and subsequently the iPod), and that particularly sucks if one has transferred all one's CDs to the iPod/iTunes and then sold/tossed out the original CDs.  You gotta be careful!  What's also neat is that the iPod comes with a pre-loaded trivia game.  The movie trivia game has a few errors in it (text, not program) but the MUSIC trivia game is pretty cool in that the clues and questions are about the songs in your iPod library.  You are being quizzed on how well you know your favorite music!  Pretty neat!

<Title>iCrock - the iPod NOT
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only possible saving grace about the new iPod Classic is that it does have the potential for a firmware upgrade to fix at least some of the more glaring problems. I think the other reviews have spoken to the issues well but I did want to chime in on the audiobook issue since that is to me one of the most bizarre aspects of this non-product.  I have used every version of iPod from the first generation on (not nanos or whatever just iPods) and this one has definitely broken audiobook organization. On every previous model I simply went to "artists" and selected the name of the author and then had a nice list of the books (using the "album" attribute for book title) and then I could select the part of the book that I wanted to dive into which I could title using the song title attribute. I never ever found the straight audiobook listing particularly useful.  Now I've got to use the amusing "search" mechanism or spend a bunch of time screwing around with playlists to try and put some order in the chaos that some misguided engineers have introduced.   Playlists are extra work that wasn't needed with the prior User Interface and only a partial measure at best since one is still looking at a list of book parts rather than a list of books - obviously playlists were designed for a different purpose than trying to rescue a misbegotten UI design.  The search is actually broken. For example I search for Asimov and the search results report every single one of the audiobook files that I have (500+) not just the ones with "Asimov" as a value of some attribute.  I can not for the life of me understand how the current audiobook category behavior ever got signed off on by QC and usability reviews. The iPod Classic as it stands now is almost exclusively a music box rather than what I used to have which was a library of audiobooks. I do have music on my iPod but I rarely ever listen to it; rather, I spend hours each evening and in the early hours listening to various books some in [...] format some that I've converted myself from CD or cassettes and so on.  This is without a doubt the most completely non-user-engineered downgrade to an otherwise sterling product line that I've ever seen!  If you need a stylish 80GB or 160GB external hard drive this may be the product for you.

<Content>I read through most of the reviews before purchasing my silver iPod Classic.  Needless to say, it made me very nervous about buying one.  But due to my previous experience with an iPod, I went on ahead and ordered it, and I am glad I did.  I had an iPod Nano and loved it, but quickly ran out of hard drive space.  I got another mp3 player, but I missed the ease of use of my iPod.  I love my new iPod Classic.  It has worked perfectly since I bought it and has never lockup up my desktop.  The weight of it is a big difference from my previous iPod, but I have gotten used to it.

<Title>great! 
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This generation of ipods have reached the greatest capacity out of the same size of 30 & 60 gb past generations. Though those oldies have the capability of sending video through the dock and also the miniplug, via a special ipod video cable (miniplug -with 4 divisions- to three rca plugs: 2 x audio & 1 x video)Seems that newer ipod classic only sends video though the bottom dock connector, which is a bit of a drawback (this is why i put only 4 stars). The black face is not crystal polished like oldies, but smoothly satinated and softly curved to the edges, this seems to be more resistant to scratches, at least to the eye. Other thing is the wheel, it seems like old control wheels were more sentitive than newer ones, but when you get to dig it, that's solved. Unless you get the one with the older square box package, most new classic ipods come with a smaller box, no soft bag or cd included, so you will have to download latest itunes version online, free, of course.  All in all, it's great memory capacity and fair price blows away any doubts or comparisions with older models and other brands, the sound quality is superb, as with any ipod, and has a newer interphase so cool, which displays the sleeves of your music, video or photo collection at the right side while you surf on each category, as a slideshow. All the features have new sleek icons, and songs can display any picture of your choice. If you dont own any mp3/video player yet, or if your old ipod has reached it's full capacity, don't hesitate, this is a great choice for all those gigaeaters!

<Content>I held out on getting an iPod for the last 3 years, telling myself and my friends that "I don't need it my old trust 1 GB SD card expansion slot mp3 player was good enough!" Well I will say now that I was wrong! The iPod Classic is one of the best electronic devices of this decade. I call it a electronic device b/c it bundles a high quality mp3 player,a photo viewer, video viewer, great screen for all your viewing, a great organized software interface to access everything,sleek,thin casing that fits in my back pocket unnoticeable,and last but not least an 80-160 GB Hard drive to hold all of my growing music (now 10 GB) and video, photo, and audiobook library (20 GB). Not to mention the ability to play some somewhat fun games and store all your important documents on a drive biggest a laptop. When you purchase an iPod you're not just getting an music device you are getting a new friend in the digital world.

<Title>Thanks, but no thanks (No library audiobooks = no Ipod for me)
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Ipod because my Zen Micro can't access my computer anymore, though it still plays. As soon as I heard the Ipod I thought the quality of the music wasn't the same. I listened to the same song on the Ipod and Zen to compare, but I was willing to pass on the slightly worse music quality. I had trouble figuring out how to transfer movies into the ipod but I was willing to play around until I figured out. I a sense that Itunes had me controlled (with the Zen I could drag and drop items into the software window in my computer and that was enough to transfer).   One of the main reasons I bought the Ipod was so I could continue listening to the books I download from public libraries; it turns out that the libraries' website asks Ipod listeners to click on a link that tells them that due to Digital Rights those audiobooks can't be played on the Ipod! The website has a list of compatable MP3 players and the Creative players are in it. I have reset the factory settings on the Ipod and wrapped it back up because it is going back to the store. Thanks Apple for waisting my time :( I will buy a Zen Vision M (green) because my Micro was amazing, and I will take even better care of it now that I know what a precious commodity it is. Too bad (but no wonder) the Zen Vision M is all sold out right now.

<Title>Not ready for prime time
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are 2 major shortcomings to the new 160 classic:  1.  If you have been using prior video Ipods as sources for video devices (e.g.the My Vu) then it is highly likely the classic won't work.  Apple has added an authentication chip that makes the new classic incompatible with most older video devices.  You can find documentation of this on the web and if you call Apple support.  2.  On the Mac (at least, haven't tried on a PC) if you have a large music collection (presumably why one buys the 160) synching is unreliable and painfully slow, as is attempting to eject the IPod.  Itunes often freezes and one needs to do a "force quit" and restart.  The firmware updates do NOT fix this problem to date.  I'd suggest searching the Web to confirm these observations, but my view is that this is a crippled IPod (regarding the video) with the overall quality of a beta device.   DO NOT buy it if you are trying to get a larger IPod to handle large video or music libraries.  Recalling this is basically a tiny hard drive, Apple hasn't gotten the hardware or software right and iced this with crippling the video capabilities of the device without telling anyone before hand.

<Title>Needs a firmware update
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ipod classic 80gb is my first ipod, and don't get me wrong if it worked properly I would be giving it a 5 star w/o a doubt.   First I loved the UI and personally since I never owned an ipod before the clickwheel sensitivity was fine for me. I only address these issues first b/c  they seem to be the 'major complaints' from the loyal ipod crowd.   My problem arose when about 1/3 of my library wouldn't fully play. Now some songs played w/o problem, but 1/3 would begin to play and at some point during the song it would skip to the next song. At first I figured this was just a minor issue caused by a syncing issue or whatnot. After personally trying to fix by resyncing, and even reimporting a portion of my library to itunes,I decided to do a little research. Upon looking at some ipod forums and even here at amazon I found this was a recurring problem. Upon deciding to take the wonderful apple customer service pages' advise, I decided to fully restore my ipod. The only thing this accomplished was moderately solving my problem by totally destroying my hard disk and eliminating the ability to sync the ipod at all.   Needless to say I have returned it for a full refund and will either wait to see how the new Zune 80 gb pans out or wait for a permanent fix from ipod. Which from there website doesn't seem to be in the works since the only place the on the site where it is mentioned is by the other jaded customers.   The last thing I would like to say is I would be happy to buy a refurbished 5.5G ipod if the current price on them wasn't rediculously high compared to the superior design (other than firmware) of the classic. I mean come on a $50 discount for the old design with a scratch seeking face and 50 gigs less storage.

The Zen is a great player but I have always preferred the scroll wheel for no-look menu and volume navigation. Also, I have always used iTunes for my Podcast catcher. I really wanted the tight integration with iTunes so I could better track new/unplayed podcasts versus old/played ones and just sync it with no fuss. The Zen software is simply no where near as complete as iTunes for managing Podcasts. There are other great podcast/RSS catchers out there but none of them are 100% integrated with the hardware the way that iTunes is with iPods.  That integration is the main reason I picked up an iPod. For about the same price as a Zune, you do not get the radio but you do get the best Podcast management in the biz.  On to the player...   This player is perfect for the way I use it. I listen to a ton of podcasts in the car, on the go, at work, and on my home stereo. I don't listen to podcasts when I work out but it I did I would NOT recommend the classic but a flash based iPod instead.  The classic has great sound, great battery life for music, and the best no-look volume control etc. Its also about 10 times faster to go from no power to playing than my older Zen:M was which is great. 80G is way more than I need but its nice to know if I go on a trip I can put a bunch of movies on there etc.  As far as the Cover Flow not working well, thats true but I would never use it anyway. For podcasts smart playlists are the only way to go. You can have playlists of Recent or New podcasts, unplayed, random etc. And the last played and play count synchronize with the iTunes which is critical and its all fairly easy to set up.  I also have it docked to my home theater which is a nice way to watch some video podcasts and charge it up. Having tons of accessories is also a huge benefit to getting any iPod. Sometimes being popular has real benefits. Take a look for Zune accessories and you will see what I mean.  As an example of how well this product works for me, I bought the iTouch and returned it because its simply to much of a pain to navigate and change volume if you use it in the car. Simply to clumsy for just listening to music. So if you are a podcast fanatic, and want the best playlist management and no-look controls, this is a great way to go.

<Title>No problems
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got mine and after reading all the negative reviews, I'm a little baffled. It works just the same as my old 30g. Click wheel is the same, works fine, and you don't HAVE to use coverflow, just scroll down and select "Artist" "album" or "song" to select from the list, no issue, doesn't require any extra effort. No problems whatsoever. I took it out of the box, plugged it into my computer, and synced my entire music library onto it in 20 minutes. Holds everything I have and barely put a dent in the 80g capacity. I'm lovin' this thing. fits perfectly in the leather case that I used for my 30g. only issue is I could use a little more volume output, but I expected that, most players these days are a little low on the volume than I would like, but I have a headphone amplifier for that anyway.  Money well spent. I'm happy

Can't believe how good this player is.  Great build quality, features & sound.  No complaints whatsoever.  For those who grump about the sound, 2 tips:  invest in a decent pair of headphones (e.g. in ear Shures)and rip your music at a high variable bit rate.

<Content>From the sleek sexy design to the easy to use hardware and software, the iPod is at the top of the MP3 game for a reason. This generation of the iPod Classic is as good as it gets, with the extra storage space and the inclusion of Cover Flow.   If you have a large music collection and want a little style to go with your substance, pick up an iPod Classic. You won't be sorry.

<Content>This awesome little device is the BOMB!!! With tons of space,(This baby can hold lots of music,I mean lots, and the main reason I bought this,no more bulky portable CD players that only let me listen to one album at a time!!!) Easy to use(the thumbwheel takes a while to get a hang of,but you'll get used to it!!!,but NOT recommended for young kids,one drop on the floor or one good whack could probably take it out of service for good!!! I just bought a clock radio that lets me dock mine so now I wake up to the music I want to wake up too!!! This baby is so small but hold so much,it will probably hold most of my CD collection,and I have a pretty large one!!! Never used it yet for movies,TV shows,or Podcasts,but maybe someday,I love mine for the music,It's a jukebox in the palm of my hands!!! Groovy!!! Two thumbwheels up!!! Way up!!! Five stars!!! A+

<Title>Great model (unless you get a defective one!)
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This classic was an upgrade to a really old 40GB iPod (I don't remember what generation, but it was right before the color screens came out).  MY DEFECT: When I got this iPod, I was blown away by the screen resolution, video playback, photos (and automatic photo sync-ing), and all the other stuff my old model didn't do.  BUT, whenever I left it sitting for more than a few hours, I had to perform a hard reset just to turn it back on.  Apple was very good about exchanging it, but I was a bit surprised that they didn't offer anything for my inconvenience.  The new model works like a charm--no problems to speak of after a month of using it.  RESPONSES TO OTHER COMPLAINTS: It's true that the cover flow lags a bit, but the other things people are complaining about are VERY minor, if not nonexistent.  If you already own a 5th generation, YOU DON'T NEED AN UPGRADE!  Somebody was complaining about the backlight not turning off while he was charging.  I don't have that problem--maybe he needs a reset or software update.  Somebody also complained about the split screen cutting off menu names, which is completely untrue.  None of the menu names are cut off due to the split screen!  When you browse at the playlist, name, artist, genre, or song level the split screen goes away and you see the whole name.  One valid complaint that I haven't found a solution for is the screensaver.  When you start playing a song you see the name, artist, album, elapsed and remaining time, and cover art.  But if you don't touch it for about 2 minutes, a screensaver comes on.  All the screensaver shows is the time of day and battery life remaining.  You have to touch the iPod again to see the other info.  FEATURES I LIKE (that are new for me): I like when you're scrolling through a really long list (like of song names), that it will automatically skip alphabetically through the letters if you start scrolling fast.  It's hard to explain, but it will essentially jump straight from the J's to the K's to the L's and while it does it has a big "J" then "K" then "L" on top of the screen.  Another feature I like is that it remembers the last playlist you were browsing, even after navigating through different menus.  Last, but not least, the Search function.  If you have a lot of music like I do and know the name (or part of the name) of a song you want to play, you can use the search.  It's just like in iTunes--just start entering letters and it will match all songs or albums that contain those letters.  BOTTOM LINE: Like any new model it has its bugs that Apple is already working out.  I was unlucky enough to get a defective model the first time around.  If you have an old iPod like I did, this is a wonderful upgrade.  If you have a 5th generation, you have no excuse for even reading this far!  You either have too much money or too much time on your hands!  Hope this helps!

<Title>It's Good, But...
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a 5th Gen iPod that I totally loved but had to replace it after it died. So I went out and got the iPod Classic. Boy do I miss my 5th Gen!  The video on the Classic is very good. I haven't had a problem with any of my movies, TV shows or podcasts yet. The only thing I don't like about the video is that it doesn't sort the music videos by artist and instead just lists them all in alpha order. I found that disappointing.  My two biggest complaints with the Classic is the sound quality and the clickwheel. The clickwheel response is completely slow and I've had it a few times where I had to turn it off and then back on to get it to respond. This gets frustrating very quickly. The audio quality (I've noticed this ONLLY on the music; not on video playback) is much lower than the 5th Gen. The sound isn't as clear and there is a lot of noise. I even bought a new set of headphones and it didn't help. This brings my star rating down quite a bit because it was the first thing I noticed with the Classic.  Overall good points of the Classic: - The silver brushed metal design doesn't collect as many fingerprints as the white and black versions of the 5Th Gen - The screen seems to be brighter, which makes the video more crisp - The battery life is longer than on my 5th Gen - The clover flow is a nice feature  Bad points: - BAD audio quality as opposed to 5th Gen, Nano or Shuffle - The music videos are not sorted by artist which makes the navigation through them annoying - The clickwheel is HORRIBLE and will cause you great frustration right away  Overall, the 5th Gen is MUCH better. I will keep the classic and just pray that Apple comes up with a firmware update.

<Title>Getting better everytime
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The same good iPod (5G or 5.5G) with a new scratch resistant aluminum front. The new GUI is the best improvement, I always wondered why the ipod menus (the older ones) where so boring, I think they didn't correspond to the good design and and features of the device (and every Apple product). Another PRO is the new 80GB storage, a good number, with the 30GB you had a lot of songs and video but -in must cases- not all your librarie, now you can and even save a little space to carry documents and stuff. The included games are very good, they look awesome. The videos look better than ever, smoother and brighter.  CONS: just one: New unscratchable aluminum front, same old too-scratchable fancy steel back.  Come on Ive, you can give us something more resistant, it almost scratches itself. I know, it invites you to be nice with it, but it's very frustrating to have it "personalized" in two hours of normal human use.  P.D.: 160GB is pervert!

<Title>Would be Great w/ an iTunes Alternative
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iTunes (PC version) - Wow, I haven't seen corporate software this crappy in years!  Even without its critical bugs like locking up, taking WAY too long to start or do anything, constantly forgetting all your settings (like don't try to update my firmware with the new WORSE version every time I connect, or leave my music alone and just let me sync video, ...) this program has very little power to manage you music (tags, compilations, etc.); and what power it has it decides for itself how to use; i.e., forget about any flexibility in presenting your music collection in a way you like.   The only thing it seems good at is resetting my iPod after it screws it up, so I can start fresh with Media Monkey.  I could go on but it would just be more ranting.  Fortunately, you can get the beta release of Media Monkey 3 for free, and it feels like much less of a beta than iTunes.  There is just no comparison as far as power AND usability goes.  BUT as far as I know, you can't sync video.  I have tried to copy video only with iTunes, but before it does anything iTunes likes to sit there endlessly telling me to wait as it is happily deleting the 80 Gigs of music it took all night to upload with Media Monkey; despite the fact that I have selected manual sync and un-checked the sync music box.  I don't know how many times I have had to leave home without music because I was stupid enough to let iTunes touch my iPod.  The iPod hardware seems pretty good, although the LCD died on my first one.  It's sluggish to respond when you operate the wheel.  My girlfriend is convinced it doesn't work it all.  It does work, it is just amazingly slow at times.    I almost gave it 3 stars because 160 Gig is SO COOL!  I love having all my music, podcasts, a few ripped DVD's, and tons of room left for PC data to boot.    But I really wish I didn't have to deal with iTunes for video - I'm about to give up on video for that reason, actually.  IF SOMEONE KNOWS OF A NON-ITUNES WAY TO SYNC VIDEO PLEASE POST IT HERE!!!  ~thanks and Good luck        12-7-07 I'll add that now the iPod won't play most of the podcasts I've downloaded.  I used Miro and Media Monkey, both with Media Monkey's built in podcast functionality, and by moving the podcasts into my music.  Neither way worked, either if the file was downloaded my Media Monkey or Miro.  I tried subscribing to some podcasts with iTunes but it was a catastrophe so I gave up.  It would be nice if even that worked in iTunes so I could watch video podcasts...  Also sometimes iTunes thinks it needs to re-format my iPod, then it forgets about it if I cancel out and re-connect.  I may "upgrade" to 1.03 firmware I hear is out, 1.02 locked some hard drives on.  And get ready for Quicktime to take over your PC.  I found a Firefox guide where I finally got it to quit playing mp3's instead of letting me download them.  You have to manually delete .dll files it puts in your Firefox folder.  Just like iTunes, when you tell it not to do something using program "options" it just thinks your kidding and ignores you. Nice.  So far I hate Apple even more than Microsoft.

<Title>Still Top Tier
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Despite some drawbacks, the iPod Classic remains at the top of the pack.   Cover Flow is somewhat frustrating. Mine isn't as slow as some, probably because my iPod album set isn't as extensive as my past CDs. Still, it's frustrating to not have cover art for half of my albums. Yes, I can manually add it and I have for some, but it should be automatic. Not a feature I use much for music, so won't miss it too much.  The unit sits easily in my hands and I have it in a protective rubberized cases that fits it snugly. It works well even though I too think the wheel seems less responsive.  We have had a Nano and previous "classic" 80G. Almost got another Nano, but went with the new 80G Classic (the 160G is just a little too big for comfort and fitting in laptop case).  The screen is very good and the frame rate is very good. No problems listening to audio and the noise level is very low (certainly usable for host headphones/earbuds).

<Title>Do NOT buy until Apple admit they have a problem with their battery life
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had two of these devices (the second was a replacement due to poor cell life), and both have had very poor battery life. With all of the suggested power reduction recommendations made by Apple (no EQ, no back light, no jumping from track to track, etc), I can confirm that I have had no more the 3.5hrs audio playback (50% volume).  Video play back lasts about 1.5hrs, although the screen looks great.  Cover flow is a nice concept, but it adds to the battery drain in a big way, so I've had to avoid using it.  My older photo iPod lasts many times longer. Apple are great at their novel GUI design, etc, and the device is iconic. However, their battery issues have been around for at least a 2-3 of years which, being the big company that they are, they should be ashamed about.  This last iPod purchase marks the last time I take a risk with an Apple product. I had really hoped they'd sorted this issue out by now, but instead I feel very disappointed.  Having had two units suffer with the same poor performance, I am either particularly unlucky, or they do have issues.  Do yourself a favour and do a little more research before making the plunge.

Most compliaints begin with either a souchwheel problem, a software problem, or a video out problem which is stupid. The souchwheel is fine and maybe lags a little but it is breley noticceable and the only time it gets annoying is in games, other than that there is nothing wrong. Thee software was just updated to 1.0.3 and I am sure apple is on its way with more. Finally, is it really too much to get new cables or just buy/download a copy and burn it to a disk to use. I am shure all of the complainers have limewire.  The complaints are pointless, just get one and ignore them. Who really complains on amazon for stupid reasons? I can answer that, people without a life.  This is an amazing ipod and anyone would be happy with it.

<Title>The New Firmware seems to have ironed out A LOT of the bugs others have talked about!
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>**Before you read some of the negative reviews, please consider this was BEFORE the new firmware update 1.0.3 came out so unfortunately they had unresponsive clickwheels, itunes messing up etc. Also some people simply did NOT upgrade their firmware for whatever reason but A LOT of those problems have been fixed with the new firmware so UPGRADE YOUR FIRMWARE AS SOON AS YOU GET YOUR IPOD! It will make a BIG difference!**  Ok, on to the review..I just got my 80 gb ipod classic recently with a 3 year extended service plan, immediately got itunes version 7.5 and upgraded the firmware immediately to 1.0.3 which seems to have taken care of A LOT of bugs people have been reporting. It must have because I am not getting ANY of the problems other have reported such as laggy clickwheel, itunes freezing etc. The clickwheel is VERY responsive, only a light touch is needed and scrolling through cover art was very quick! No problems whatsoever with the clickwheel. I also have had no problems copying files to itunes and transferring them to my ipod. The ipod itself is a thing of beauty, love the non scratchable surface but the back of the ipod is where you can see all the fingerprints etc so get a good cover for it. The slimness of it is very sleek and heck this ipod just looks cool. I got the ipod up and running in no time after I transferred my music over. Love the search feature as well. There is a lot of features, settings and extra's. Heck I even like the clock.   PLEASE NOTE:TURN OFF & DON'T use the EQ (equalizer setting)if you want normal distortion free sound. I was using the EQ and wondered why a lot of my songs had distortion. I thought it was due to the bad sound everyone was talking about until I turned OFF the EQ. Upon turning the EQ off, the distortion vanished completely, the sound was just fine, pretty good in fact. It's a shame that you have to turn off the EQ settings to get good sound. Hopefully Apple will fix this with a firmware update.   I almost got one of the itouch ipods but the very limited space is what kept me from doing so. 80 gb is plenty of space for my music, a bit of videos etc. It might not have wifi or a touch screen but it's got tons of space for my music and that's what counts! I love my ipod classic, can't find much to be picky about except for the sound when EQ is enabled. It does exactly what it's supposed to, is easy to navigate, videos look crisp/great on it and most of all it holds a crapload of music. Just remember to upgrade your firmware to the newest version, disable EQ and invest in a good pair of headphones. One of the best things about the ipod classic is that because it has so much space, I don't have to worry about how many mp3's I put on it. I've never downloaded so many mp3's in my life! I literally put my entire collection of mp3's on it and still have tons of space left. Overall, I rate the ipod classic 80 gb (black)...absolutely superb.

<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Its cheaper and thinner than the last gen and also has the "cover flow" feature seen in Itunes already. I will have to say that the click wheal is not NEARLY as sensitize as the last one and that bugs me, especially since i had to cut out the plastic wheel cover from my old case even though it worked flawlessly with my gen 5 80gig. Overall its still an AWESOME mp3 player for a decent price.

<Title>Great I Pod
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This I Pod, is a big improvement over the 5th Generation. The biggest change is the battery life. I watched alot of videos all day and I only lost like half of the bar. I really like how organized this IPod is. All in all, if anyone wanted to get an IPod Video for the first time, definetly get this one!

<Content>I received my iPod the other day from Amazon and absolutley love it!  I can't be happier.  It's a great little product and I'd recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in an mp3 player.  I still have a ton of music to put on it, and so far it's great.  I received it from Amazon in an extremely timely manner. It makes me happy just to look at it.

<Content>This is my first experience with an MP3 player, though my kids and several friends have MP3 Players that I have used briefly.  But after reading all the reviews of the MP3 players available, I decided to go with an Ipod - and I'm glad I did.  I love my Ipod!  It is very user-friendly, has great storage space, the sound is good, the battery life is excellent, and the screen (which, at first, I was concerned would be too small for my (ahem) older bespeckled eyes) is actually very sharp.  Since I spend a lot of time in my car, I especially like that I can listen to my Ipod in my car with use of an inexpensive casette tape adapter.    No product is perfect, however, and the Ipod is no exception.  While I personally don't miss this feature, it seems to me for the price, Ipods should include radio. Most competitors have managed to include FM radio in their products - why not Apple, I wonder?  Also, Itunes - a wonderful software IMO - has a plethora of music, podcasts, and music videos available, but could improve on TV show availability (I haven't looked for movies or books yet).  At the very least, Itunes/Ipod could be more flexible with the format type it supports so a user can download TV shows or movies, etc. elsewhere, but still be able to play them on his/her Ipod regardless.  All in all, I really love my Ipod and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality MP3 player.

<Title>The best for the money
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After purchasing & returning a Zune due to Microsoft's lack of listing necessary system requirements, I bought my daughter this iPod. It was recommended by several techs at a local electronics store as reliable & easy to use. It took maybe 2 minutes to have it up & running, & my daughter loves it. The amount of space available ensures she will always have her favourite music & videos ready. The screen size is excellent & the picture quality is crystal clear.

<Content>This is a must have device especially for fellow commuters who ride the train or bus.  Nothing like being able to watch one of your favorite movies while going home.  Easy to convert your home DVDS onto your Ipod.  Tons of storage for your favorite photos, movies and music.  Easy to operate and the sound quality is fantastic.

<Title>Good things,
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this Ipod as a gift at Christmas time for my girl friend.  She loves it. She used to carry around the old one.  I was told by Apple, if I wanted to save money and return the old one?  It was still cheaper getting a new one from Amazon and saving the old Ipod!   Having one of anything never works out anyway.  No, its good because now we can leave one in the Ipod alarm clock and the other she carries around with her.     Thanks Amazon,  Satisfied customer.

<Title>Great Ipod but a Bear to Set Up!
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the second Ipod I have owned. The first one was a second generation and began to "freeze" and lose battery life. The new one has fantastic video capabilities and holds an amazingly large amount of music. It was also the most frustrating Ipod to upload, and I was assisted by a friend who is an IT Manager. The entire process took 12 total hours, including several hours on the phone with Apple Customer Service and finally a trip to the new Apple store in Manhattan with both the Ipod and PC in hand. As of now it is approximately half completed and requires yet another visit to the store.
