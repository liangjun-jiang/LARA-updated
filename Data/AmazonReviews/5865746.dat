<Title>Humming Sound
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Do not purchase this item.  The speakers hum really bad and it doesn't have easy to use preset buttons.  The humming sound is what makes it really annoying to use.

<Title>Overheats, won't play
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The cassette door wouldn't open and if I played mp3s for about 2 hours, it would overheat and wouldn't play anymore until it cooled off for an hour or so.
