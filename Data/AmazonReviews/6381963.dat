<Title>My bad experience
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got an iRiver clix right when they first came out over the summer 2006 (perhaps that was my problem). I really liked it, it was cute easy to use and I found an armband that I could get to take it to the gym with me. Within a week it stopped working. I got to the gym and went to turn it on and it wouldnt start or anything so I figured maybe I didnt charge it. I connected it to three different computers and nothing worked. I didnt understand because it had worked the day before and I never mistreated it or anything. I went back to the store and the swapped it out and gave me a new one. That one was working great and performing well until about 6 months later when it too did the exact same thing. This time I took it back to the store because I had purchased a 3 year extended warranty on it and was told that they would swap it out again. Well come to find out that store is no longer going to carry the iRiver Clix so they didnt have anymore in stock. I had to get another mp3 player of equal or lesser value, the choices were limited of course but what can you do.  The player is nice, I liked that it played video and pictures and had a built in radio, something not all mp3 players are designed with. If it hadnt done the same thing to me twice I would have given this player 4 stars. Im not sure if it is some design flaw or what but it was extremely frustrating. If you do purchase the player I would suggest getting an extended warranty, just in case you run across a problem similar (cause a 200 dollar mp3 player that dies in a matter of months and isnt covered would just be horrible, well at least on a student budget). Ok well thats my story, wanted to throw it out there since when I bought it it was new and no reviews.

<Title>Nice if the battery worked and if it had better documentation.
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Besides VERY POOR documentation in showing new users how to use the features and menus, this unit would have been nice if you like a SMALL unit.   Unfortunately, I returned my unit because the battery only charged for 3-4 hours of use.

<Title>Plusses and Minuses
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Personally, I really like it and I kind of had a hard time finding things I didn't like.  + Great sound quality. + Beautiful screen, a little small but it does the job. Very high resolution. + Intuative interface. The controls are very easy to learn. + Clock is displayed at all times. + Many preset equalizers and one customizable. + Pictures can be applied as the background. + The screen's orientation can be portrait or landscape. + Smart button: It can control one command, that is cuztomizable on the fly by holding it down. (Play/pause, Main Menu, Shuffle on/off etc.) + Text viewer. It's just plain handy. + It's very small, convenient to hold, and very, very sexy. + Displays next track, progress in to the song and total song length. + Album art is displayed on the Now Playing screen. + The battery meter seems to be reliable.  +/- 4 gigs. For someone with a huge colleciton of music, this may not be for you. If you want access to all of your music on a whim, then go bigger. For people (like me) who have smaller collections, it's great. +/- Rechargable. One cannot change batteries when they are dead, so it has to be plugged in, and eventually, it will be a paper weight because rechargable batteries die.  - Having to use Media Player to synch files (although that seems to be a falsehood. Opening the directory allows one to drag and drop files to the device. They seem to play normally. (So + then?) - Movies are in AVI format only. Find a converter for other formats. : ( - The text viewer does not have word wrap, so it breaks words up. - Text viewer does not recognize enter spaces in documents. - Straight out of the box the only way to recharge it is by leaving it connected to the USB cord. (wall charger is available 20USD from the website)  + It is not an Apple product.

<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Technology never stops moving forward, I guess. This little gadget is awesome! Slightly thicker than an iPod Nano but still tiny, it supports music AND video (not to mention FM), has a cool interface, comes with a protective case and is the price of an iPod. I am stoked!

<Title>Love it for the gym & walks
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have two players.  The more elaborate Creative Zen W and this one for the gym walks and I keep it in my purse when I am stuck somewhere.  It is the easiest interface and ssooooo easy to use in the gym.  No stopping on machines to move to another song just a click and you maneuver through the menu.  Can't be more user friendly.  I love that it's light and adaptable and now that they make the plastic clip holder I am in heaven.  This is my second I-River and it is making my friends think twice about the cult that is Ipod.

<Title>iRiver Clix-4G is The Best
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered the iRiver to download books-on-tape and it really works great.  It is easy to use and has enough storage to hold my pictures, my address book and an entire large book.  The iRiver was recommended for use with books-on-tape by an online vendor.  It is very user friendly and I think I will be using it for many years.  Oh, I also have a few songs on it too.

I would recommend this mp3 player to anyone interested in something small that will hold a lot of songs and that you can use anywhere.  Thanks to Amazon too for having it, it's very hard to find in stores.  Great job all around - thank you.

<Title>Their customer service is nonexistant
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yeah it's cool but.....their customer service SUCKS!!!! My Iriver's battery doesn't last long at all. I tried calling their phone number twice. Both times I hung up after thirty minutes of no end in sight EXTREMELY frustrated. THE only way to reach them is through email it seems, so that's a couple of weeks wait.   Which is ridiculous for a device that cost $200.  I'm regretting not getting an Ipod. (Which is quite hilarious because I got an Iriver thinking it would be better than an Ipod.)

I have owned a Nano before, and IFP-890T mp3, so this is my second time using a products of Iriver. I RECOMMEND getting this mp4 rather then a Ipod Nano. This can play videos, pics, and Fm Radios, ETC

<Title>Scanning is not bookmarking...important
<Date>Sat Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is, to my way of thinking, a top of the line device for carrying pictures, music, and books.  But... and this is the biggest problem, books will only be accessible if you use the elongated method of scanning and if the book is longer than 18 hours it will scan back to 0.  This means for a 21 hour book, you are forced to listen to the next three hours or to turn it off and never listen to anything but the book for the next three hours.  The minute you want to hear music, you lose the ability to go back to point A.  Unlike the Creative Zen, it does not have a book mark feature.  But you can see the information on a large and editable screen that is held in the palm of your hand.  It is very accessible and easily stores information and recordings.  I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of a bookmark feature and the 18 hour problem.  Then I gave it 3 stars because of the response I don't have from iRiver about the annoying 18 hour scanning difficulty.

<Title>EXCELLENT OVERALL UNIT
<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would highly recommend the IRiver Clix (1st generation as I haven't tried generation 2).  After doing much research and discovering the IRiver was rated higher by CR magazine, I selected that one.  It has a large viewing screen, great color, games, etc that I use frequently.  I have noticed the games seem to drain the battery life a little more than the music.  Battery life is still excellent.  The two semi-negative features(which I don't really care about) is that the FM feature only picks up a few channels and that there is no shuffle capability.  You are either searching by artist, album, genre, or song (which is alphabetical).  There is, however, the option to download playlists which is nice.  One negaitve that I did care about was that the availability of the product or accessories for it were pretty much limited to online (IRiver has a website but I found the same products on Amazon for cheaper)I would also recommend purchasing the IRiver FM Transmitter to use the player in your car.  It is so convenient and affordable.  Pick up a silicon case and protecter sheet while you are at it cause you won't find them in stores either. Hope you enjoy it as much as I am!

<Title>The Ultimate MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a lot of research and found the perfect MP3 Player, the iRiver clix. It is everything I read about and more. Here's my comments on it's different features...  *Sound: Best I've hear from any MP3 player. *Interface: Unique and very simple to use. Looks very cool. Displays the actual album cover. Comes with cool wallpaper that can be set to automatically change daily. Easily synch from Windows Media Player. *Video: You can download a converter from the iRiver wesbite that easily converts any video. Very nice. *Tuner: Has an auto preset feature. Sounds great. *Photos: Look great. *Extra features: Text reader is nice. You can record external sounds and input from another device. Has an alarm clock. Comes with several Flash games. You can download more free one's from iRiver.  I highly recommend the cradle device accessory. It comes with a little remote and turns your MP3 player into a very cool alarm clock. You can wake to different sounds or music. You can also play music and watch videos out loud.   Erik

<Title>iRiver Clix Gen 1
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Over-all, the player is a smart design. A few glitches though, with the subscription service. Having trouble syncing music or audio books and flash games to the player.  Dont know if its on my end, or a glitch in the player. The player is easy to navigate, easy to use, and is a lot more advanced than my old Dell player that I bought several years ago. It just isnt syncing well with the Urge subscription service.

<Title>Good product, bad customer experience
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used the IRIVER CLIX 4GB or about a year. I really enjoyed this product. With that said, the product had a major shortcoming despite its other nice features (nice features include it's size, weight, accessories list, clarity of screen color, easy UI and navigation) and that was its dependency on the URGE music subscription service and Windows Media Player. Recently, URGE support was discontinued and the device was migrated to use Rhapsody as its music subscription service. Rhapsody seems to be an adequate service, however, the device was not compatible with Rhapsody. Although customers were notified, there were backwards compatibility impacts with this change and this was NOT made clear in customer notices. Apparently, URGE uses a different authorization system than Rhapsody and ubscription service change was not backwards compatible. The cut over from URGE to Rhapsody was a mandatory cut over; customers were not given the option of staying with URGE and as Rhapsody music subscription for a variety of reasons was not backwards or cross-compatible (different authorization model and lack of metadata information provided to Rhapsody during the migration - this information is based on information provided by Rhapsody customer support) the player no longer synced properly. When I called Real (owners of Rhapsody) customer support to see what the problem was, they explained that my player was not compatible with the new service and that I had to either buy a new player or go with a different music subscription service. I decided, based on their recommendation, to try using a subscription service alternative from Real (the same company that owns Rhapsody) but this was not really a subscription service at all but a 'buy it and sync it' service similar to ITunes but without all the additional features and a 10 song cap limitation built in.   I am giving IRIVER 1 star because I cannot give them zero stars. They did an extremely poor job in handling their migration from URGE to Real and left me with a player that, for my purposes, is useless. Negative points:  * Migration without backwards compatibility between the old system and the new one negatively impacting some customers (like me). Zero feature parity between the new system and the old one on higher order of magnitude features like syncing made my player useless. There was no backup plan for customers that did not necessarily want to switch to Rhapsody OR shell out for a new player. Migration should be seamless. Minimally, top features should be preserved and there should not be such a huge dataloss issue. * Never told me I'd need to buy a new player so it wasn't clear until the player simply refused to sync or play tracks * Crappy follow through and poor customer service on the issue, no real attempt to customer compensate whatsoever * Poor attention to customer satisfaction and effectively arrogantly results in unexpected and unwanted costs   I don't know that I will ever buy from IRIVER again due to their lack of respect for the customer as reflected in how they handled this situation. I am currently using an IPOD + ITUNES. Truthfully, I preferred the IRIVER when it WORKED but now it is just an expensive paperweight sitting around my house gathering dust and I won't let their inability to manage their product delivery to customers force me into paying them another $150+ for another player that I wouldnt' need to buy in the 1st place if they'd cared a bit more about their customers.

<Title>Great alternative for those who don't buy into the iPod hype
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Fantastic mp3 player. The screen is bright and sharp, making it a pleasure to view my photos on it. Plays every kind of file I use, and the sound is terrific. The FM receiver and Flash game feature are extra bonuses. I don't need something with 80 GB of storage so that I can listen to every song I've ever bought in my life, so the 4 GB  capacity is more than adequate. About the only complaint I have is that Windows is required to sync, but even this isn't able to bring it down below five stars.

<Title>Wonderful for Audible Books
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After literally thousands of hours of use, my beloved Rio Carbon died - or at least you could no longer adjust the volume.  It could have had something to do with my dropping it on its head on a tile floor.  To my distress, I learned the company that produced this device had exited the mp3 device market.  On a day we were snowed in, I spent hours researching the alternatives and in the end settled on the iRiver.  I had owned an iRiver CD player for a number of years and liked both the device and the company.  All possible accessories for this toy exist from a mini docking station to an all-in-one fm transmitter.  The download of audible.com books came hassle free (unlike with an iPod) and the sound quality for the spoken word is excellent.  My coveting husband gets one for Christmas.

<Title>FANTASTIC Little Device.
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It has everything that I could ask of an mp3, all in the cutest package. Aside from the fact that it IS adorable, it has great functionality, and a very intuitive interface. I've heard complaints about the low fps for it's supported videos, but I uploaded Dane Cook's "Vicious Circle" onto it, and the quality is great. Note that the clix is picky about it's video, so all you have to do is download a small 3rd party program called iRiverter. It's really easy, and I don't know why people are complaining about it.  I have but one qualm about this device, and it actually lies with the software. Windows Media Player is a horrible program, and you'll find yourself switching between putting files onto the device via Windows Explorer and WMP.  And... that's about it, really. I say buy it, 'cause it really is worth it.

<Title>WOW, great for Audible books and FM and MP3
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a tough reviewer and rarely give 5 stars, but this product earns it.  When I first opened the package and saw the Clix, I thought that it was too small.  How can they put much into a small and light package like that?  Well, they definitely did.  The interface is better than the iPod's.  You push an edge of the screen to navigate and set options.  It is very intuitive and I have done a lot without reading the manual.  The FM capabilities are amazing.  The auto-tune to set the presets automatically picked up all the stations in my area perfectly -- no mistakes.  I could then delete the ones I don't want.  The high-resolution display does a great job of displaying all the presets with a verticle line and indicators where each station is.  When reaching the highest setting, just push up again and it goes to the lowest, which is what one would want.  ALL the stations in my area came in very clearly.  For Audible books it's great, and loading to the device doesn't require iTunes (desktop) which is inferior to Audible's [...] desktop program.  With 4G of storage, I can put all of my audio books on it.   It works great as a MP3 player. The sound seems better than my 5G 80gig video iPod.  For me, I am going to use it for audio books and FM.  I use the iPod for music because I can store 80gig on it.  I definitely recommend this product.

<Title>Dare I say ... better than an iPod?
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Blasphemous as it may sound to the Apple worshipers of the world, iRiver has created a portable entertainment device that trumps the iPod. It has a slick design; the sound quality is superb; it's easy to use; it's got a nicely sized color screen for watching video, viewing digital photos, or reading text files; and it even comes with some Flash games. Also it has a longer battery life (25 hours) than either the iPod Nano or the fifth-gen Apple iPod.  The only drawback it has, in my mind: I'd like to have more than 4GB of memory. I can certainly see myself wanting to put video on it for longer trips.

<Content>I have an IPOD nano and this Iriver Clix 4G and I now prefer the Clix. It's simple to use, light, small, and encapsules a lot in one device. The display is crystal clear, and by my non-expert standards, has great sound quality. I absolutely love it. The accessories choices available for the Clix are also excellent. It works great in my car and has excellent battery life.  My only mild concern is that it is not a truly cross-platform product and depends on Windows Media Player.

<Content>the clix is one of the best looking mp3/video player i owned. very intuitive menu system and great sound and video quality but when it comes to synching podcasts look elsewhere, ie: ipod. It also suffers from a battery charging issue. It looses charge very quickly even if not used and will not vharge unless it is totaly discharged. Their customer support is not responsive to be polite. Mine got broken and I tried calling them several times but other then a very annoying recording wasn't able to get anybody to answer. after 2 emails and a week i finally got an email back saying my broken clix is not covered under warranty. they didn't even offer to fix it for a cost.  In summary, i liked the clix but after my experience i will not be getting a new one.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player. I like it for its small size, ease of use and many features (like FM radio and recorder). I have shown my iRiver Clix to ipod users and they all have been very impressed with it. I decided to go with the iRiver Clix because it supports the ogg file format. The one negative I have is that the Clix is set up to work with MS Windows Media Player. It took some effort to get WMP to recognize ogg files (a registry change was needed). However, after that bit of effort, I now am able to use my ogg files with meta tag data and album art. There is a guide on misticriver.net that will walk you through this process. Now that I can use my ogg files, I am very happy!

<Title>Grate product
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So I did my fair share of time researching my next mp3 player. It was between a Ipod or the little marvel. Looking at overall features, right out of the box and set up and ease, was something that I did. The clix took the cake once all was said and done. I mean it doesn't get much better than this little media player. The only thing that I did find negative was the front of the screen. It smudges with finger prints just like the sony psp. I easily fixed that by putting a screen protector over it and problem solved. If you looking for a grate product and works with windows media player then you found it. I just can't see myself selling my soul to the apple ipod trend. Iriver came out with a grate product and one very satiated customer.

<Title>Simply incredible
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For those people who are reading this and wondering what MP3 player to buy...hold on let me speak slowly...this...is...your...player. No...need ...to...keep ...searching. Seriously, I have told countless people about this innovative player and for some reason people are convinced that the ipod is the only route to take. I am not going to sit here and lie. Yes, the ipod is by far the most popular mp3 player on the market...however it is definitly not the best. The clix offers more features, an nicer interface, and is just much more portable in terms of size. Their is an FM radio (no ipod does not have one.) Really entertaining flash games (no ipod does not have that.) It supports texts (yea you get the genneral idea of where this is going). Bottom line is that this is by far the better buy if you are looking for a player that has everything an mp3 player could possibly have. I have never been happier about a purchase..and I feel you will feel the same way.
