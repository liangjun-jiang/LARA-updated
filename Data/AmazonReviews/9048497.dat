<Title>HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE!
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again. How many versions do you need???  First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again. Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!

<Title>ipod DOA

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPNB52/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-2136909-3390043">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Pink (2nd Generation)</a>  Could not get it to sync, charge, etc. The only thing it said was "Do not Disconnect". Sent it back and, after a few days, Apple returned it with upgraded firmware, but did not admit there was a problem. Works good now. Note to Steve: I have used DHL for electronics returns twice and have had miserable service both times. Please use a better freight company.

<Title>Awful product, awful customer service.
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first experience with an apple product and it's going to be my last.  Heard a lot of hype about iPods and I was going to upgrade my Rio so I bought an iPod.  HUGE mistake.  It arrived Saturday.  It didn't come with software, the software had to be downloaded.  Since I had just ordered a new computer I had given mine to a relative going to school my old, old computer didn't have the os to use the iPod software.  On Monday I set it up on my work computer until my new computer arrives.  It didn't work.  Kept telling me that I had to restore factory settings - it was brand new!  Got someone on the phone in customer service, he said that he had had at least seven calls (!) so far that day on the same problem.  First told me that if I had an apple computer I wouldn't have a problem, nice attempt at humor but not exactly welcome.  Then told me that there was a problem with the drivers for the USB port.  (Funny how it's always the other products fault -this supposedly great technology is being waylaid by a USB port - not exactly great technology.)  He got it to work by running me through a long list of procedures.  Great, thought the problem was fixed and was able to download music from the iStore.  Yeah, not quite fixed.  Had it working for about 24 hours when I decided to add more music.  When I connected the iPod it again insisted that I restore the factory settings, which wiped all the music off it, then it kept telling me over and over that the factory settings needed to be restored, but wouldn't actually work.  Called customer service again.  This time they told me that I had to send it back to them and in 7 to 14 days they would send me another one.  Yeah, right.  Talked to a friend who has an iPod, she doesn't have a problem with her iPod, but her iPod came with software.  Several of her family members also bought an iPod, but they had to download the software and they have been having continuous problems ever since.  I checked the website to see if I could get the software that came with the product and the site basically said that you were out of luck if you couldn't download it, that you'd better borrow or buy another computer to be able to run the iPod.  That is the most ridiculous and pompous thing a company could write about their product - that you must spend at least a $1k to make an mp3 player work!  DON'T BUY THIS (unless you have an apple computer) because it really doesn't work and it's extremely frustrating dealing with all the problems in a product that should be plug and play.  The new Rio is less expensive and I never had a problem with the software or hardware.

<Title>Good product with minor issues
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third iPOD nano purchase (second from Amazon). All were for my kids and the kids love them. I did have to get this one replaced due to a defect but Amazon replaced it  promptly. This review does not address the "coolness", music features "shuffle, etc.." and functionality of the product since I don't use it at all. However I played with a it a bit and it looks very well designed and made, I wish the headphone volume could have gone higher. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:  1) Very expensive compared to other brands 2) Did receive one defective unit and I had one needing repair in the past

<Title>Apple Customer Service is for the birds
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this ipod for my daughter as a christmas gift.  The setting up of the ipod can be very confusing and frustrating but once that part was over she has really enjoyed the ipod.  PROBLEM:  Thier customer service bites, we have had problems on and off and really have not had any helpful guidance from apple custumer service.  Recently her ipod was dropped and I sent it away to be repaired (paid the 30.00! shipping fee) and it has been returned to me because it is not covered on warranty.  They won't even tell me what is wrong with it, I now have to drive over an hour to an apple store to find that out. Why charge 30.00 if I can't even recieve a report of what is wrong with it an an estimated repair cost.

<Content>I hesitated to order a reconditioned iPod but decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. The poduct came in a very timely manner and was in pristine condition. One of the earphones did not work correctly so I contacted the seller.  They mailed another set to me immediately. I will not hesitate to buy from them through Amazon again.

<Title>Apple and Microsoft
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had mine for about 2 months then i went running with it, then all of a sudden it went "hay wire" showing an unhappy face.  When i tried to restore it it showed up a "1418 error" saying it couldn't perform the function.  So I had to send home to my brother in California so he can take to an Apple store because they don't have an iPod store in Aomori, Japan.  I would much rather send it back to Apple so they can replace it, but whatever...The cool part is the support but on the other hand you think they would make these things a little bit more tougher so someone who actually works out can use'em...Or Maybe i just pushed to hard...All and all this hasn't turned me off from Apple it just boiled my blood a little bit, that's all.
