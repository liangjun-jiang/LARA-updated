<Title>Great Value Player

<Content>I just got this today and it is working great. The buttons can be unresponsive, or just take a while when you push them, but that is to be expected for an mp3 player of this value. This is great if you like recording off the radio, like me.  There are 3 recording settings, all WAV unfortunatly. Low is best for radio talk shows. Normal and High are great for music.  Overall a great value player

<Title>Not What I Expected

<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my daughter for Christmas. The reviews were decent, and Coby claims it's MP3 players are compatible with Mac computers/operating systems - I do not have a PC at home, so this was important. It also seemed like a reasonably priced option, and the speakers were a big draw. My wife & I did not want to spend $150+ on an iPod for a 9-year old's first MP3 player. I spent many hours trying to get either of my two Macs to recognize the thing was connected to a computer. There was no software in the box, no real instructions for use, and the whole thing was extremely cheap and plasticky. I knew just by holding it, my daughter would never be able to keep it from breaking if she used it more than a few times. In the end, I had to run out to the Apple Store at the last minute to purchase an iPod. Even the cheapest iPod (Shuffle) is a much better & more substantial option. It couldn't have taken me more than 15 minutes to get the iPod loaded with music. Spend the money. Go with any Apple product. They just work - and they aren't junk.
