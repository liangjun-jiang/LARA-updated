<Title>Works Great!

<Content>Great Value. I still can't get over how it sounds terrible until you get in the water and then sounds really good. I wanted something basic, that could play 20 minutes of music while I did laps in the pool and this is just what the doctor ordered.  I already own an iPod that I didn't want to risk in a waterproof housing, so I wasn't after something really cool with lots of bells and whistles. The fact that it doesn't have rechargeable batteries has not been an issue. I've only changed the battery once so far, as I only use it about 3 days a week for 20 minutes or less, I'm glad to have one less thing to worry about keeping charged up. If this one broke, I'd buy another right away.

<Title>Keeps me swimming
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before I bought this player I loved to swim but it got really boring without some sort of distraction.   Now that I have it an hour and a half swim goes by like nothing.  The only issue that I have, and it's a small  one but annoying none the less, is that if the headphone cords go then you have to buy an completely new unit. But that is a small issue compared to being able to listen to music while you swim.
