<Title>Great item
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product works great. Plugs directly into your computer. Software works well. 26 albums on a device the size of a pack of gum is great. Samsung needs to get compatible with Audible and other digital book services, however.

<Content>i was going to get an ipod shuffle but i am so glad that i got this!! it holds a lot of songs, and has a very clear screen so you can see what you are listing to. you even have a menu and can pick the songs that you want to listen to at the time instead on not knowing what is playing like the ipod shuffle. i really like how you plug it right into the computer, it was so easy for me to do it! i just had to drag the songs over and it went on! my only complaint is when you are listing to the song and go on the menu to find a different song or doing something else while listing to the music there is a beep. i really like it how there is a "hold" switch so when u put it in my jeans pocket or turn it off the buttons cant be pressed. that is really nice. but the pink doesn't look like it does in the picture but it is still pretty. the radio works great, and the voice recorder is fun! this would make a really great gift, it was really fast shipping and is super, and easy to use. you should really buy this item over the ipod shuffle, it is so much better. Age Recommended- 10+ ENJOY!!!

<Title>Great USB connection - terrible touchpad
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The USB connection is great - just press a button and the connector pops out.  However the touchpad that controls volume, rewind, and fast forward are very tricky - they are not raised from the face of the player so you can't know where to press without looking at them, and they are very sensitive.  They are basically impossible to use at night - if you try to turn up the volume and place your finger in the wrong area you will end up skipping to the next track.

<Title>Don't hesitate...you can't beat it for the money
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a sharp little device (I have it in black), it's easy to set up and use and 2gb is a lot of space to fill.    Several people have made note of the "sensitive touch-pad", and this WOULD be a real concern, but Samsung has either fixed it, or the previous reviewers didn't notice that there is a "hold" switch that disables the touch-pad.  This is a great feature, because without that switch the touch-pad would be really annoying. And, even though I have large fingers I can still easily maneuver the volume and search controls.  The sound is excellent.  Even as I'm writing this review I'm hearing things in a song I've never heard before...maybe it's just that I'm hearing it through headphones...but the music sounds great.    My only knock on this product is that the USB plug appears to be an accident waiting to happen.  Once it "pops" out, there's no cover or guard to protect it.

<Title>MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This little guy is a great option for people who don't want/can't afford an iPod. It has a great amount of storage space and I use it to save a lot of my schoolwork. It's also extremely durable. I've dropped it, sat on it, and watched it fall into a glass of apple juice and still it works perfectly. I only have two qualms with it though. One, is the obscenely short battery life. I think it's about 3 hours, whereas my previous mp3 player had 6 or 7, it's not something to take on roadtrips, unless you have a laptop available. The second, less important item is the extremely sensitive touchscreen, but it's easy to get used to and there is a hold button.

<Title>It will NOT work as a usb drive. 
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Note: This YP - U3 will NOT work as a USB Drive. it used to work, then Samsung & Microsoft Teamed up to update the firmwire in this device, it can NOT be used as a usb drive now. and it ONLY work on windows XP (not even 2000), no linux, no mac.   And you will need Admin privilege to install the driver. (so if you want to transfer file between computer, this thing won't work).   I am IT engineer so I did a lot research on this and managed to update the firm ware. But it is such a hassle. I won't buy this thing if I know in advance it won't work as a usb drive.   I repeat, It will NOT work as a usual usb drive. you will have to install drivers on the computer. The description in Amazon in not accurate.   if you have a firm ware early than 1.07, it might work. most of them are 1.11 now.   Hope this will save you some money and time.
