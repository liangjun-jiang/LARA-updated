<Title>Easy to use

<Content>This is my first mp3 player. I wanted something inexpensive to try out. It's very easy to use and I only paid $30 for mine. But once you get the hang of it you will want something a little more advanced. But beware, my light went out in about a month and the earplugs were uncomfortable, I bought new ones.  
<Overall>3
