<Content>For all those who are looking for a slick, light & robust music player. This toy is for you. I have been using it for around more than a year now and I really love it. Goes on for 3-4 days with around 2hrs of USB charging. Except the limited 512Mb capacity everything about it is pretty good.   
<Overall>4
