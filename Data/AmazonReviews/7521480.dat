<Title>Better than I expected
<Date>Sat Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did my research before purchasing this item... looking for something within a hundred bucks(preferably) and something that had great reviews.  I narrowed it down to a few MP3's, and both my daughters prefered the zen nano plus 512.  It arrived quickly, and its been a week since they received it and they LOVE it! The sound is great, to get songs in there is easy and fast, and functions are simple. I fully recommend this to anyone shopping for an affordable mini MP3 player.

<Title>XM recordable units beware XM Lovers rejoice
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my 2nd Creative Nano which I upgraded due to space issues and wanted to record Opie and Anthony every day as MP3 files.  I had been recording to my Archos Portable player, however it records as a wav file and then I had to take time to convert the files to MP3.  Now I just plug the Nano to the back of the XM out and his record, dump the files to my hard drive and have them to email, and record to CDR to listen to in the car.  I can record over 12 hours in 96kb format which is excellent for talk radio.  I have recorded songs in the highest format, however satillite is clear but transmission is not "CD quality", but if that does not bother you then just record hours of XM/Sirius and drop it to your hard drive as well.  Also realize that when you record on a portable unit, you cannot drag the files to your computer due to copy write law.  Zen Nano will allow you the freedom to share your recorded items.   The downside to recording XM shows is that there is no timer and of course you would have to leave this plugged into a cradled XM unit..if there was then there would be no reason to purchase a XM2Go.  I have to leave the MP3 player recording and filter through my MP3 files after I drag and drop and then rename or edit them.  In general this unit is fantastic, small, cute, battery life is great and you can change out rechargables as your leisure instead of worrying about proprietarty batteries.  The menu knob is small if you have fat fingers.  FM radio sucks in general, but I used this when I was in Puerto Rico and did not want to listen to my files and found some great music.  The sports band is awesome if you want to work out.  The only negative is that if you are listening to a song and then go into another music folder to see what is in there, it will automatically play what you are looking at.  What can you expect - Cheaper and more usable functions than a Nano, and if you want to record satallite radio without spending on a portable recordable unit...then this is your best bet.

<Title>Great!
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item a few months ago and it works great! The AAA batteries last a long time. Adding songs is so easy, you can synch songs onto it via Windows Media Player, you don't even need to use the software. In terms of making a playlist, all you have to do is title your songs with the number you want them to be. For example if your song is "mysong.mp3" all you have to do is title it "01mysong.mp3" and the next "02myothersong.mp3" and they will be in that order on the mp3player. If you want to put another song in between just title it "015myotherothersong.mp3" and no problem it works. I also recommend converting your files you want to add into .wma format. You can decrease the file size significantly and over normal decent headphones the audio quality is not noticably different at all. This way you don't even need a 1GB, I got a 512 and it fits tons, I haven't even filled it up yet. I really recommend this player!

<Content>This is the first mp3 I have ever had and I am so glad I didn't buy the trendy 200 dollar ipod.  It is easy to load and remove songs.  There is an FM receivewr and mic recorder.  I have used it extensively while jogging and have not had a problem.  Small and unobtrusive.

<Title>Much better than Ipod
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought an Ipod shuffle but it went dead within a week. The 512MB Zen plus is a great product. I haven't messed around with the mic recorder yet, but the zen plus has lots of good features.   The Zen plus is Windows 10 capable, and I use it to transfer songs to the player. The Zen Nano plus is a durable player with lots of features and a reasonable pricetag.  Only downside is that's it's made in China, but then again, what isn't these days.

<Title>Thanks, Hershon2004!!
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If it wasn't for reading Hershon2004's review on this really cool MP3 Player, I wouldn't have been totally convinced to buy it! I also went as far as to buy a pair of Koss headphones and Hershon's right --- the sound is INCREDIBLE! (I don't like those earplug things that came with the Creative Nano Plus). Unfortunately, I DID have to install the CD that came with it because for some reason, the music wouldn't download properly (unless I was doing something wrong).  Anyway, I DID eventually download all the music that I have stored on my computer into the Nano Plus and once I figured out how to use the Scroller, I was in HEAVEN! The sound coming from the Koss headphones was AMAZING! I was hearing instruments from certain songs that I'd never heard before and I LOVED it! The fact that this MP3 Player is SO light, and SO small that it fits ANYWHERE is amazing! I don't even think I need to use the armband that came with it because I could just slip it in my pocket when I'm working out (which is the ORIGINAL reason why I bought it, in the first place)! This is my first MP3 Player so I can't compare it to anything else (which is the reason for the 4 stars, instead of 5). All I know is I'm in love with the Creative Zen Nano Plus and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to fork out the funds for an Apple MP3 Player. This suits my needs perfectly!  Thanks, once again, Hershon2004!!!

<Title>It really rocks!
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I already had a Sony minidisk player.......but the zen is ligher and comes with the advantage of the box and armband......awesome sound quality and the FM tuner is sweet....whenever you get tired of the mp3s you can switch to a station and listen something unexpected!.....helps me keep my mp3 collection updated by introducing new songs!......also, you can use it as a portable harddisk....for those last minute files while you are leaving the office!.......for a small gadget, it packs quite a punch! My only criticism, the controls are packed with too much functions.....oh well, I can live with that....nice toy!

<Title>Customer support ate my player
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I paid $99 for this player but it worked for less than five months. Then suddenly stopped registering that there were any recorded tracks. FM radio still worked fine -- until customer support instructed me to install updated firmware. Then it became completely nonfunctional and the computer won't even recognize that a player is attached. Customer service takes no responsibility so I'm left with nothing for my money. I should have returned it early on when I called customer support with a set-up question and they claimed that the device doesn't support downloaded radio shows (something it did easily once I figured it out, until it completely stopped working). Don't buy this product and if you have one don't trust anything customer service has to say.

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is great because it interfaces easily with my computer; the large storage capacity is just what I need. This unit has a lot of features, but I especially like the recorder and the USB flash drive option. The recorder is handy for recording quick notes on the fly, and the recorder function works very well. The player uses a separate cable to interface with computer, and that works out very well for people, like me, who have rear mounted USB ports on their computers. The sound quality is great and makes it sound like I'm at a concert. The ear buds are too large to stay in my ears, so I use other headphones instead. This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it to all. :)

<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Be careful when you open & close the battery lid, my son he is 12 and he broke that little thing on the lid on the first day he use it, luck it came with a plastic case, so it can still hold the lid. Other than that this is a great product.

<Title>Excellent little unit.
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using this player for nearly and month now and truly LOVE this unit. It's physically very small (in many ways it's smaller than the iPod Nano!) and the sound quality is quite good even with the headphones Creative provides with the unit. The inclusion of a built-in display is very useful, especially when you configure the internal features of the unit. Because it is a device that works under Microsoft's "Play for Sure" specifications, you can also play back DRM-protected .WMA files downloaded from many commercial music web sites such as the ones offered by Wal-Mart and Yahoo! Music.  I would recommend a couple of things though--consider getting rechargeable AAA batteries since the unit does use up AAA batteries fairly quickly and also for maximum sound quality, get a good "in ear" earbud headphone such as the Panasonic RP-HJE50 available on Amazon.

<Title>Creative MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my player today, and I haven't been able to put it down. It's fairly easy to install, as well.   You do need to get rechargable AAA batteries, this eats batteries up pretty quick. That's really the only gripe I have with the player; Other than that, it's so much better than my previous MP3 player.   If you're looking for a decent MP3 player, I highly recommend this product. It's definitely worth the money.

<Content>This is a great little player.  All of the songs are very clear sounding.  We couldn't use Napster though, it kept saying that it wasn't compatible.  The headphones aren't comfortable either, which is a minor thing.  My son has this player too, and he thinks it's great.

<Title>My wife loves it
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife wanted a simple mp3 player that she could work out with, and she's very happy with this.  The included arm band and protective sleeve are perfect for her when she's jogging or on a treadmill, and the sleeve has a belt clip that's nice for when she's using weights and does not want something around her arm.  The only complaint is that the included earbuds tend to fall out when she jogs.

<Title>It's OK
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sound quality is ok for my purposes.  I just use the player for listening to podcasts while exercising, so audio quality isn't a huge concern and I can't really comment on it.  Main complaint is that the power/pause/play button is perfectly positioned to be accidentally pushed when you are squeezing the belt clip to attach or remove the device.  Also, the display light is very dim, and navigation is somewhat difficult.  FM radio reception is very weak, but that's probably to be expected given the lack of antenna surface area.

<Title>Very convenient, multi-talented MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I actually have never owned an MP3 player until now, so I don't have much to compare the Creative with. But I can tell you it's great to have a small tool that can do so many things. The radio reception is fuzzy at times and the battery life is pretty bad with the wrong batteries, but overall it has a great set up with helpful file folders to organize, great recording capabilities, plug and play option if you don't want to install the CD on every computer you use it on, and so many ways to connect it to your computer and other hardware.  If you're not looking to break the bank purchasing a quality MP3 player then forget about iPod and go with Creative. (BTW: My player was red not black, but I'm sure the black one's just as high quality)

<Title>Not great
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a small cheap Mp3 player and I didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. I saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so I decided to buy it. When I got the Creative nano I was really happy with its preformance until I tried to put my subscription music onto it. Thats when I learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money.  After that I started realising all of its imperfections. You can't use the FM radio in the car without hearing mostly static. You can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. Don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this Mp3 player but I still would definately not recommend it.

<Date>Wed Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have two Creative Zen Nano Plus MP3 Players. One I use just for my metal music and one for old rock and country songs. The player worked for awhile just fine. After a few months, the player turned into crap. Every song on the player was deleted and I tried to turn it on, but it refuses to turn on. I tried to find an answer on Creatives website but I couldnt get an answer and I couldnt email the company. While my other MP3 player works just fine, this player I bought sucks. A waste of money.
