<Title>Electronic Moron Finds Love...
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I have seen two pretty bad reviews here and let me tell you, those people are doing something wrong!  I have had my Sony Network Walkman for 2 days now and I LOVE IT!!   This is my first Mp3 player and being the technology idiot that I am, I was afraid that I would get this thing and it would take me days to figure out how to use it.  Well, within 15 minutes I was beginning the process of transfering the better part of my music collection onto this itsy bitsy tiny little thing.  It was so easy to use the software.  It even came with 5 free music downloads from SonicStage.  The thing I am most impressed with is the sound quality.  The only songs that suffered any quality (only a little bit) are songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs.  Understandable.  But the rest of them are crystal clear.  You can adjust the eq only a little bit, but for me, its enough.  I like the bass a little heavy and this player satisfies that.   All in all, I believe that I got really got my money's worth.  This absolutely a great purchase, I love it, I love it, I love it!

<Title>Hard to go wrong with Sony, LOVE this one!
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this little tiny MP3 player. I really have no complaints about it. The software is easy to install and user friendly. The MP3 player itself is so small and lightweight yet easy to operate, even while running. It never skips either. I loaded music on it right away when I got it and was amazed at how easy it was to convert my music files to their sony software and then the transfer was a snap. The sound is great and I am using basic headphones from a previous Sony product. Possibly could be better with better headsets, but who knows, the sound is plenty for your ears. I highly recommend this one. For the price you can't beat it!

<Title>Make a smart informed choice instead of going with the flow
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You can go with the flow and buy an iPod or you can be smart and buy this awesome device with superior technology.  Here's a side by side comparison with the 1gb iPod shuffle:  - Number of songs:  iPod (240), Sony (680) - Battery life:  iPod (12 hours), Sony (70 hours)  It's not even a contest!  You don't even need a brain to figure this one out.  You'll waste 6 batteries on a Shuffle for every one on Sony.  I've never listed to a Shuffle but I can say the quality of the music on here is awesome.  However, I must admit I do own stock in Apple because I know all those dumb people out there will continue buying them!

<Title>Excellent MP3 player overall
<Date>Sat Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Despite all the reviews out there warning about file transferring and sony mp3 players i decided to get this b/c it was the most banf for the buck.  The mp3 player and software are actually both pretty easy to use.  You just basically load the songs onto the software and transfer the songs onto the player.  Simple as that.  The software can convert the songs from mp3 format into atrac3-plus format when you are transferring songs, so that way the player can hold more songs.  I've uploaded a little over 500 songs onto my player at 64-kbps and the quality isnt noticeably different from my other mp3s.  Another good thing is that navigation is pretty easy on the mp3 player.  You basically organize your songs into "groups" and you name your groups, e.g. rock, sum 41, r&b, etc., and you can just browse to the group you want.  And you can shuffle/repeat the group you want or all the songs in the mp3 player.  You can also browse song-by-song, which doesnt take too long, the navigation goes pretty quickly when you hold down the buttons.  The battery life is also very good.  You can use the thing on one AAA for more than 40 hours.  The mp3 player also resumes the music you were playing immediately when turned on. So overall a great mp3 player, but for the following:  it takes a long time to organize and transfer songs onto the player, took me an entire day to do that.  Plus, although the group navigation kind of is adequate, i wish this player supported regular playlists.  I guess thats the drawback with flash mp3 players.  If you dont travel alot and can put up with charging, I would definitely suggest shelling out a few extra bucks for a mini harddrive player.  But this is a extremely good player for those taking trips where charging isnt covenient.  Another negative aspect as that the player is kind of flimsy.  Looks ok, but it doesnt seem to be extremely sturdy.  The player is extremely light, even with the battery installed, so goes good in your pocket or whereever.  I also own a larger 20GB harddrive mp3 player and I like this so much better.  It's lighter, and battery life is awesome, and just seems to be more hassle free.  Further, with the larger, i felt i was carrying around a ton of songs i never listened to, while with this, its always playing my favorite songs (sum 41 rules, btw).  Well, over all a terrific player.  Well worth its price.

<Title>Yes, it plays MP3 directly and yes, it supports drag-and-drop
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Some of the reviews here contain materially false information.   This player plays MP3 songs directly, without the need to convert them to ATRAC3/ATRAC3plus format. This is covered at great length in the manual.  This player supports drag-and-drop for MP3 files. The SonicStage software is only necessary if you want to work with ATRAC. Look online for the appropriate version of Sony's "MP3 File Manager" (version 2.0 as of this writing).  For those who want to work with ATRAC, SonicStage is a stable and reliable application, when used in a stable and reliable environment. It is best to use Windows XP, install the lastest updates, use virus-checking software, and avoid running software from untrusted sources.

<Title>Easy to use, great sound, lots of songs, what's not to like?
<Date>Tue Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really don't understand the hyperbolic criticism of Sony's SonicStage software.  It took me all of five minutes to figure it out, without even looking at the manual.  Clearly, some of the reviewers here have failed to read THEIR manual.  There's no requirement to use SonicStage;  your PC will see the NW-E107 as just another USB-connected storage device.  Use Windows Explorer to drag and drop your MP3's, if that's the format you like... this unit plays them just perfectly.  I suppose if you have a humongous library of MP3's, and for some reason you really really really wanted to be able to manipulate them through SonicStage, you would become frustrated that you had to first "transfer" them into the SonicStage library and put them in a playlist.  But this really isn't the best use for the included software.  The advantage with SonicStage is realized for someone just starting with assembling a collection of portable music files.  The ATRAC3/ATRAC3plus compression algorithms designed by Sony allow you to cram an incredible amount of music onto this tiny podlet.  It's really remarkable... I'm currently walking around with 27 full-length cd's on mine.  This is plenty for me to choose from when I go running, or have to get on an airplane, or have an extended stint at the old computer keyboard at work.  The unit weighs practically NOTHING; the packaging it comes in weighs more than it does.  Even with the AAA battery in, it simply disappears in a shirt pocket, you don't even feel it there.  It's great when working out; when I'm out running I just pop it in the pocket of my shorts.    The controls are simple and intuitive.  Is it "feature rich?"  Gee, I dunno... it plays the songs, lets me access them easily, lets me shape the treble and bass (you get three preset levels, one the flat factory setting, the other two user configurable... I have one setting for general use and one for inside the motorcycle helmet).  You can preset a volume level that will be your default whenever you fire it up.  There's some other stuff it does, but that's all I ever need, so I haven't spent too much time monkeying around with the other features (lots of byzantine repeat modes that I would never use in a million years).  I program computers all day, the last thing I want to do is have to program my personal stereo.  I'm giving four stars instead of five because the little plastic plug that covers the USB port is kind of tricky to pry open, and because there's no way to clip this thing onto your clothes if you happen to be without a convenient pocket.  Also, I'm not totally sold on the earpod headphones... but I have a pair of Sony PSYC headphones that I love, so no biggie.  Otherwise I am totally pleased with this purchase.  Under $150, and I have triple the song capacity and triple the battery life of a $300+ iPod.  For me, that's worth sacrificing all of the file-sharing-with-friends features that probably appeal more to kids in high school and college.  I just want to listen to music.  This little guy does the job for me.

<Title>The Truth According To Zowie
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>"Flawed Fatally" and "SonicStage Suicide" are pretty much right on in their appraisals.    The hardware is awesome.  I don't regret getting this gem.  I just squeezed 20 albums on this puppy with roughly 250+ songs.   And the battery life is spectacular - Sony must employ some of the best power management experts on the planet.    However, and this is the big frustrator, the Sonic software IS the worst piece of crap I've ever used, going back to the DOS days of the '80s.  It's horrendously slow (almost like watching the grass grow), weirdly inaccurate (in it's gauges showing transfers), unintuitive, and basically a scam (my opinion) to get you out to their website to sell you more music.   BTW, since the instruction manual says you can't drag-and-drop MP3s and have them play, and since I tried this and it in fact doesn't work just as the folks at Sony truthfully say, don't believe that you can despite what other reviewers here say.  What you can do is drag-and-drop files, so you could use this as a portable memory stick, but they really don't play... at least I haven't been able to get them to play.    In summary, however bad the software is, the hardware is still amazing and I hope that I won't have to interact with the software too often.  I even went out and downloaded the latest software from the 'net, so don't think this is just an outdated review and new software might be available.  I suggest to Sony that they skip from version 3.2 straight to 5.0, fire all the developers of the present software and go get a team who can whip off something worthwhile.  And, develop drag-and-drop for MP3s.

<Title>DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE CRY ON HERE THIS IS THE BEST EVER
<Date>Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>IM NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND WRITE A REVIEW THATS VERY DETAILED, SOME PEOPLE ALREADY DONE THAT SO WHAT IM GOING TO SAY IS SIMPLE AND EASY. THIS MP3 PLAYER SIMPLY RULES, THE HEAD PHONES IS SO SO. THE SONIC STAGE  SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH THE MP3 PLAYER IS SO EASY TO WORK, U SPEND 3 MINUTES READING THE CARD TO SHOW U HOW TO ATTACH THE MP3 PLAYER AND HOW TO COPY MUSIC FROM YOUR PC ETC. ITS SO EASY FOR ME I BOUGHT THIS CD PRETTY MUCH TO RIP MY CURRENT CDS ONTO THE PLAYER... IT WORKS GREAT ALL U GOTTA DO IS INSERT THE CD  AND IT READS IT STORES AND ALL VERY FAST.  IF U RIP A CD U BURNED U CLICK A SEPARATE BUTTON CLICK  IMPORT SONGS AND THATS IT U ARE DONE, LABEL THE FOLDER AND ITS FINISH. DONT SEE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CRYING CAUSE THEY CANT FIGURE THIS OUT. I DID TONS OF RESEARCH ON THE NET BEFORE I GOT THIS MP3 PLAYER AND IT SIMPLY ROCKS. ONLY THING THAT SUCKS IS IT DOES NOT COME WITH A NECK STRAP BUT I HAD A OLD DIGITAL CAMERA THAT HAD A NECK STRAP THAT I FIT ONTO THE MP3 PLAYER SO PROBLEM SOLVED. 5 STARS FOR THIS PLAYER

<Title>Buy the Right Thing!!!
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After some careful research comparing players, I decided this Sony was the right player for me because 1) I primarily want to add music from my CD collection, and this software, despite everyone's bellyaching, produces MUCH better sound than IPOD's.  I earned my living as a music critic for svereal years, and the SONY sound is absolutely excellent. For classical music there's no comparison. 2) I travel overseas a lot and the ease of changing a little AAA battery, which lasts for 50 - 60 hours, is wonderful.  I know I'll have my music because I'm not dependent on finding outlets with the right plugs and risking blowing up my player on a bad voltage connection.    Many of the complaints seem to arise from assumptions made about the player and capabilities it was not intended to feature, rather than product which doesn't live up to its claims.  I've just bought a new SOMY Walkman A3000 20 GB because I want more storage, but I will keep this little beauty because it's the only one I know that runs on a battery. I'll also replace it if I can, should it's life run out before a newer version is available.

<Title>Player is great... but don't count on finding armband
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have loved the unit itself.  I had a minor issue in which I had to send it off for warranty work a few months after the purchase.  It has worked great & I have enjoyed the quality of the MP3 player itself.  The problem is that after less than 2 years of it being out, it is no longer possible to find the armband to carry it in.  I have looked all over the Sony website & called their Sales department.  It is not available anywhere.  I have used the Google search engine looking for any place that might sell it.  Amazon has a listing for it, but does not have any to sell anymore.

<Title>Awesome little player but something goes wrong 6 mos later
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this little MP3 player from Sony!I have two of them. They are perfect for working out...BUT something majorly malfunctions after about 6 mos of use! When the player gets ready to go haywire, the battery will go dead- which seems to be an easy fix;I've replaced them successfully numerous times before, but this time when the battery is replaced, the player seems to lose its mind! The display reads "Data Access" and will not stay on for more than ten seconds, and flashes Data access every  subsequent time it blacks out.Within an hour or 2 of this happening, it ceases to work at all.When this problem felled the second player of mine yesterday,it popped loudly. I happened to be listening to it at the time. Sony charges a flat rate of $77.00 on any repair plus whatever costs might arise if they fix it,so there's little point in trying to repair one of these since you can go buy a new one for about the same price.There is apparently some design flaw,but these little players are AWESOME while they last. Just wish Sony could get them perfected...

<Title>Great player...CAN transfer mp3s without using SonicStage
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player works great. I have owned it for a little over a year now and it has been going strong. I wanted to clear up a few misconceptions that older reviews seem to focus on...this player DOES NOT have to be used with Sonic Stage software...at some point, Sony included a download in their updates section that allows you to download an mp3 transfer program. Although it's not as nice as the drag/drop format of a newer player, it sure beats importing to ATRAC and then converting to MP3. You can find this download on Sony's support site at:  http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=NWE107&upd_id=1936&os_id=99  For some, since this player doesn't have any functions like voice recording, fm player/recorder or sleep timer that some of the newer players now have it may not be worth it to buy this model. For people like me who just want a simple mp3 player, nothing else I've seen comes close to touching the 60 hours of playback time that I can get from one single AAA battery. (I also own a Sansa m240 mp3 player and only get 16 hours from the same size battery and can take the dead battery out of the Sansa and it will play another 5-6 hours in this Sony!)

<Title>Fake mp3 player!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got mine (512MB, blue version of this) from Sonystyle.com just yesterday. After playing with it for a few hrs here are my impressions.  First and foremost the mp3 playback quality is atrocious. 128kbps files sound like 64kbps or lower. Even my no-brand-name cheap mp3/cd player has better mp3 quality.   I suspect the codec/DSP in the Sony are still designed for their propreitary ATRAC3 plus format with a secondary mp3 support. In fact converting a mp3 file to Atrac3plus (with included software) sounded better than just mp3 file. Inspite of this hassle, it was still below mp3 quality from other players.   The battery life seems to be in line with the specs listed by Sony. No complaints on that front. The backlight LCD display is a nice bonus too. However size/volume is significantly more than the iPod Shuffle.  The user interface is more loaded than such a small palyer can withstand. As a result it more cumbersome and confusing than Apple/iRiver players.  In short this awkwardly named "mp3" music player is a step in right direction for Sony but is still below average. Price is right but not the quality.

<Title>Very good sound quality, less than an oz, long battery
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This new line of flash-based, coin-like (but they are thick coins, esp. in the waist!) MP3/ATRACT players from Sony are the latest models of their Psyc line of digital music players.  The new-age styling of these MP3 players does psyc you out. Which is not a bad thing, as they are more euro-cool than the rather bland and boring iPod and the downright butt-ugly iRiver. The more I look at the Psyc, the more I like its looks.   The new silver Psyc MP3 player features 1GB of flash memory, which is great for those of you jogger jocks out there. You can shake this thing violently and it won't skip a beat, unlike those hard drive-based players. Before you insert an AAA battery, the Psyc weighs in at an amazingly light 0.9 oz. -- that's right, folks, it's less than an ounce! With the AAA battery, my guess is it's about 2 oz. It's very small although, relatively speaking, it looks a little thick -- esp. in the middle area where the single AAA battery resides. (About 0.75 in. at its thickest part.)   What, you ask, it uses an AAA battery? Yes my friend, and this one AAA alkaline battery can power the player up to 70 hours! That's almost three full days of continuous playing. The phrase "up to" here means that in order to get all 70 hours of playing, you must 1) play ATRAC3Plus songs encoded at 48kbps and 2) do not press buttons or do random play (i.e., just leave the player playing sequentially). In the real life we like to skip a song, fast forward, random play (a.k.a. shuffle play), turn it on and off and on and off, and most importantly, we play MP3 songs. All these operations reduce the battery life. Given my experience with previous Sony MP3 players, my estimate is one good AAA battery should last you 40 hours or more. (With my beloved Sony NW-HD3, I routinely get the advertised battery life of 30 hours even when playing MP3 files.)   Of course, the use of AAA means you get an abundant and ready supply of cheap power source, and you can trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet.   The Psyc also comes in three other colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version).  It has a nice, sharp backlit LCD screen, so you always know what you are playing as opposed to having to guess as on some other certain MP3 player. It plays MP3 as well as Sony's ATRAC songs. If you are an ATRAC fan you'll like the sound quality of this little player; it's at least as good as Sony's MD players. For MP3's, the sound quality is a bit "muffled" compared to my NW-HD3 20GB player, but still quite good if you pair it with a good pair of headphones (i.e., ditch the stock earphones).   Sony still has a long, long way to go in the user interface department, as this has always been its weakness, whether it's digital music or digital video or anything else. The Psyc is not hard to use; its basic functions are no-brainers. But, for anything beyond play/pause/skip, its interface, whether on the unit itself or on the PC transfer side, is still not polished and was clearly designed for a Japanese audience -- Japanese consumers reportedly love to play with complicated gadgets; no surprise given how elaborate sushi-making and origami are. We American consumers like things that are elegant and simple, and Sony has a lot of room for improvement in this regard.   In short, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the new Psyc flash-based MP3 players. They are stylish and lightweight and lasts forever on cheap AAA batteries. They have good sound quality and are priced right. Just be prepared to spend some time with the manual and experimenting a little with transfering music. If you are stuck, you are welcome to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions.  Recommended.

<Content>There's a few things too look for in a flash player. Long Battery Life. Check. LCD Screen with International Language Support. Check Good Navigation. Ah, good enough. Price. Check  Easy to put songs in. This is the major one.  Here comes the doozy. YOU can only use SonicStage Software to put files into this 'chine. No drag and drop. No drag and drop. What happens if you want to port stuff over to say a school computer? Nope. Say you want to port stuff over to friends place. Nope. Say you want to port stuff from your friend to your place. Nope.  That really sucks. Flash is more expensive than Hard Drive MP3s. If you cant use it as storage as well as listening to music then it's not worth that extra cash wedge, battery life or no battery life.

<Title>Blows away anything else in it's category
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is amazing for the category it's in.  People complaining about it are comparing it to hard drive players but this is a flash memory player so it'll never skip.  The sound quality is excellent.  Of course you need to use Sony's Sonic Stage program to put music into it but that's what makes this one so much better than the others in it's category.  Sony's program compresses the music file so you get almost 700 songs in the 1 GB memory.  Compare this to the Apple iPod shuffle which is also 1 GB and only holds 240 songs.  Plus the iPod plays at random and doesn't have a display to show you what's playing or choose what you want to hear.  This blows the iPod out of the water for the same price.  I'm very happy with this player and will eventually be moving up to the 20 GB Sony hard drive MP3 player which holds 13,000 songs compared the Apple 20 GB player that only holds 5,000.

<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I got to say that I has a iPod Shuffle 1G, and the change to the new Sony Sony NW-E107 Network Walkman 1 GB was awesome. This unit has a great sound quality, you can control the bass and treble levels. The earbuds are pretty good, sounds great.  The buttons and display are fine. The LCD display it's no that clear and the buttons are quite complicated to command, you need to take the hole unit in your hand to control the player.  The battery, the best. You can have up to 70 hours of continuous playing with only one AAA battery. And if you go for a long trip or something, you would get there with batteries, and if not, you can replace it. Great.  The software. The bad part of the movie. I thought that iTunes was lame, but the Sony's SonicStage it's even worst. Quite complited, not friendly, not good.  The other ugly part of the unit it's the transfer speed from the computer. With USB 2.0 you can transfer below 1Mb/s.  I think that the bad parts can't compare with the great ones. Sounds great, superior battery life, good earbuds and good looking.

<Title>So many whiners...
<Date>Sun May 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this and have been playing with it for a few hours. I don't have any idea why all these people are whining. Their major complaint is that the software is hard to use. That just blows me away. If you have the technical skill to navigate to amazon.com, then you will be able to use this software with no problem.   The player itself is completely amazing, though. I love this to death. It is much smaller than the pictures lead you to believe and it is feather light. It blows my mind how this thing weighs less than the AAA battery that is used to run it! Everyone says the battery lasts up to 70 hours, too. I havn't had it long enough to check that, but from what I've seen with it on for the last few hours, it has't run down any. Control is pretty easy, too. The sound quality is great, and this little thing is LOUD. It can go high enough to be too loud, and that's something I like in an Mp3 player. It also has a feature to automatically adjust the volume between songs. That's a nice feature since some of the songs I own are quiet and hard to hear and it makes them all equally audible.   I havn't owned this thing for a full day yet, but I love it to death! This is a spectacular Mp3 player, even if the other reviews make it seem like an inferior product. 5 Stars!!

<Content>My iRiver IFP-195 finally packed up the other day so I began looking around for a suitable replacement. iPods have never appealed to me due to battery issues and sound quality and iRiver's latest products do not support Windows 98 so I decided to check out Sony's latest offerings. That's when I came across this wonderful little player.  I don't download music, I just convert my own CDs so I wasn't concerned about any alleged MP3 issues (although it obviously does play them). I had previously converted my CDs to WMA for the iRiver and so once I got this home I converted some of my favourite albums to ATRAC3 (132kbps) to see if they sounded as good.  Not only did they sound better, especially the bass, but unlike MP3 and WMA on the iRiver there were no added gaps between tracks. This meant that I could finally listen to albums like Oxygene and Equinoxe without the annoying split-second gaps between the tracks on the CD. It was worth it for that alone.  As for SonicStage, I don't understand why people have a problem with it. You put a CD in, convert the tracks to ATRAC3 (or ATRAC3Plus), plug the player in and copy the tracks across. Once on the player you can move the albums around. It's not rocket science and I actually found it to be better than iRiver's Music Manager.  In summary, I think this is a wonderful player which far exceeded my expectations.

<Title>Small slice of audio heaven

<Content>I've had this player for a few weeks now and I must say this is the BEST investment I have made! It really is an adorable little device that packs a HUGE audio punch. The sound is superior to any portable music player I have tried, and you can fully adjust the treble and bass to how ever your preference prefers. For such a small device, it has many features that make this device very interesting and enjoyable to work with and listen to. It's also a handy, portable, plug-n-play storage device that allows you to drag and drop files.  I read all the reviews I could before I purchased this device, and many people complained about the lack of drag-n-drop of music files. Sony has made such software capabilities available for past players, so perhaps they will for this player in the future as well. For me, it doesn't matter because Sony's SonicStage software just is NOT that big of a deal for me to use. Over the years I have amassed a HUGE MP3 collection of my own CD's and CD's I check out from the public library (a better option than downloading if you live in a larger Metro area with a HUGE music collection in their library). It is quite simple to get the music on the player. I imported the MP3 versions into SonicStage, converted them all to ATRAC3plus 48 kbs and dumped them on to the player.  I'm fairly picky about the quality of music I listen to, but I can NOT state firmly enough how absolutely GREAT the sound quality of even 48 kbs of the ATRAC3plus versions sound on this player. By converting my MP3 collection to the ATRAC3plus 48 kbs files system, I still have my MP3 collection AND a MUCH reduced in file size set that I can burn on to CD's for a backup. Blank CD's are inexpensive, and it's good to have another backup of my music collection. By converting my MP3's to the ATRAC3plus system, I now have around 750 songs on my Network Walkman player. Sony indicates 695, but there certainly IS room for more than that. It's just AMAZING that I can listen to my music on this player at work for two weeks and not hear the same song twice AND all of this from one AAA battery. INCREDIBLE!  Yes, it will be nice when Sony finally gets the armband released for this player, but I have a brain and can figure out a way to make my own until then. That's called ingenuity.  ;-)  If you want an FM tuner, Sony has a 1 GB player with that feature either out or soon to be released. I purchased this player because I do NOT want to have to listen to the radio. I just can not say enough good about this player. The onboard features are excellent, the operation of the player and yes, even the SonicStage software are quite intuitive if you take a few seconds to actually make the effort to look (and heaven forbid - read!) through the menus. I have an older and slower computer and when I imported and converted my MP3's, it did take a while to convert them to the MUCH better sounding and efficient ATRAC3plus 48 kbs, but I simply began the process right before I went to sleep. When I woke up in the morning they were done and transferring the ATRAC3plus 48 kbs files on to the player was very quick, even with my slower USB 1 transfer capabilities. It was literally only a matter of minutes to fill up my player with over two weeks worth of high quality sounding music pleasure.  If you don't care about listening to the radio, you don't need your player to be a mini-recorder, you don't mind having about two week's worth of music to listen to all from one AAA battery, then I HIGHLY recommend you purchasing this player. I have absolutely NO regrets and am 100% satisfied with my purchase and the performance of this player. Thank you Sony!
