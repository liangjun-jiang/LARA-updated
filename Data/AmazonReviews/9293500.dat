<Title>Great custom service
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I won't repeat how great the player is.  What I was amazed was the custom service.  While trying to connect this to my mac, I accidentally erased everything on the player and froze it.  Called tech support number off Sandisk website, get connected with someone (US based) within a minute of wait.  He walked me through, reformatted it, and got it to work within ~15 minutes.   I don't even expect this kind of custom service of $1000's purchases, let alone a $40 player.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm new at the mp3 player game (very old fashion) and I bought the Clip only for the FM radio feature.  My wife promptly stole it, downloaded pod casts and music and I haven't seen it since.  She loves it.  (I now have to get another one.)  I was amazed at how tiny it is and how superb it sounds and works.  My only objection is not having a one click method of selecting my FM presets (unless there is one and I can't find it) and not being able to list the FM presets in priority order.  Displaying the station ID along with the number would help too.    Of course I realize that this is an MP3 player first and an FM radio second.  Even for 2nd place this thing is fabulous!

<Title>Excellent buy!!!
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was in the market for a small, affordable mp3 player so that I could have something to listen to while working out. I had originally wanted the Clip when I decided that I was going to buy one and then started looking at the Zune 2nd gen that just came out and was also looking at the Sansa e260 but just couldnt make up my mind. I finally got sick of toiling over it and just bought the Clip when I saw it was on sale.  I LOVE IT!! It was so easy to sync my music onto it and its just as easy to play the song you want to play! It is VERY small and clips tightly to anything you want it to stay on. I go walking and jogging a lot and it works perfect for me! The only regret I have is that i should have gone for the 2GB version. The pink one looks much cuter!

<Title>Just hold it; you'll be sold
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Fantastic doesn't even begin to describe this player. It's slick, afforable, droppable, and easy to use. I took this bad boy to work, and the next monday, 3 of the middle-aged women I work with showed up with one of their own.   Pros: Price. Interface. Features. Feeling smarter than those retards at the gym with a crappy, overpriced Shuffle on an armband (the clip on the back is stronger and more versatile.)  -Nobody's mentioned the handsome blue light the interface makes, so I will: I love the blue ring. It's the kind of high-technology glow that just has you at "hello".   -The microphone is surprisingly high-quality. Doubt I'll use it much however.  Cons:  - Like so many other players, it's really determined to use ID3 tags. Individual tracks, foreign music, and techno mixes all end up in the "Various Artists" category.   -Though they're standard for players nowadays, the shape of the earbuds makes me uncomfortable, and I can't help but worry a lotta sound is leaking. Though this is a strictly personal thing, shelling out another Clip's worth of dough for comfy phones makes the bargain here negligible.   -The reception on the FM radio is rather awful for anything but the mightiest broadcasts. Not recommended if the FM is your main reason for purchasing the Clip.

<Title>Sansa Clip 1 GB - Great MP3 Value and Performance!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa Clip 1GB is a great value MP3 player.  It has the same capacity as the iPod Shuffle at $35.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can get the 2GB version for $25-40 more.  Pros -  + good sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner (20 Presets) + voice recording   + nice design with color options + Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via software + 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Clip Plus  Cons  - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles - for just $20 more you get the 2GB Clip with added features  The new Sandisk Sansa Clip has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the compatibility, feature, and price benefits of other MP3 players.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.    The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced VERY well for the holidays.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.  The rechargable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The earbuds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only time will tell; so far it's holding up nicely.  The Zen Clip also has a larger 2GB option. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJ5MQG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Sandisk 2GB Pink Sansa Clip</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Overall, an awesome starter unit that deserves a try.

<Title>Somewhat Disappointed
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first got this item I was really impressed and thought I had made a really excellant purchase. The item is very attractive with an excellant design, and despite what some others have said I found the sound quality to be good. I also found it to be too loud, however, and since the device only allows for "normal" and "high" volume settings I was not able to lower the sound to a level I could tolerate in bed. My primary use for the device was to be for at work and for workouts at the gym so I tried to overlook this. I was pleased that the device has such a nice, bright display, records songs off the radio and had a clip for my clothing.  The thing that made me return it, ultimately, was the fact that it would not download any music files from my computer! I tried at least 4 times, and my computer clearly showed the music transferring to the Sansa but when i later tried to play it on the Sansa it was nowhere to be found. I called Sansa direct and no one answered the phone. So then i emailed them and got some good Customer Service that way but no one was able to offer a solution that actually worked, though they did try hard. Another problem with the Sansa was that after the first day or two it suddenly wouldn't stay charged more than about an hour; it's charge life kept getting shorter and shorter. It's supposed to be good for 12-15 hours after the last charge-up but mine clearly didn't-and I was not even playing it continuously. I also found that it was unable to get much radio reception outside the city limits, which doesn't bode well if your local gym is on the edge of the city. I was lucky to get maybe 2 or 3 stations tops there, and none of them the ones I wanted.    I think in the future I will look for a player that has a longer battery charge life and better volume control, in addition to finding one that downloads files. This one turned out to be nothing more than a glorified radio, I am sorry to say, and failed even at that in some ways. I'm guessing it's going to cost me more...   Anyway, given the mostly positive reviews on this little player, maybe your experience will be different than mine.  Just don't throw away the packaging or receipt right away when you get it home, in case you have to return it.

<Title>Wow - Who needs an Apple Ipod!
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, when my daughter broke her Ipod, I felt like the only thing I could do was hand over mine...and I pouted for a whole 5 minutes, until I found this little gadget - the Sansa Clip.  Wow!!  Who needs an Apple Ipod??  For approx $70 less than an Ipod I got the same size memory (1GB) PLUS a radio and a little voice recorder.  It plays for 14 - 15 hours, and the sound is unbelievable. Also, it is so small - and has a great clip on it.  I just attach it to the back of my name tag at work and off I go "whistling while I work".  Doesn't get any better.  Never heard of "Sansa" before - but that namebrand has just replaced "Ipod"in our house....oh, and did I tell you....my daughter (the name brand fanatic) is now jealous of my MP-3 player. lol

<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was bought as a gift for my 12-year old son.  He seems to be very pleased with it, and the number of complaints and "tech support" questions (to me) have been almost zero.  So I'd say it was a success, and the size and price were suitable for that age.  Yes, he will outgrow it someday, but we all know that these tech gadgets are typically short-lived anyway.

<Title>An extraordinary value
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a player for the gym or for a run in the woods this is a good fit. Super light. Very easy to sync with Windows Media player (version 10 and up); bright screen allowing navigation through your playlists and albums. Good for long podcasts or audio books where you want to resume where you left off. Decent FM radio. May not be as cool as the Apple clip, but I have better ways to spend my money. BTW, you can recharge with a standard mini-USB charger (not included) which is a lot easier than charging from your computer.

<Title>Excellent sound, nice player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just recieved this player a week ago. The sound is by far the best I have ever heard through any of the portable devices that I ever owned. The stock speakers are good enough for day to day hearing and bring out the sound quality. However, I am sure that that the sound is worthy of a nicer set of speaker.  Size, batter life, and menu options leave nothing to complain about (considering the price). I especially like the ability to add songs to the "go-list" (an incorporated play list) and the ability to rate songs on the player it self and play highest rated songs.  The player syncs well with Windows media player on my VISTA laptop. The rating and all are transferred perfectly. Furthermore, it is always possible to directly access the player, which makes the player extremely flexible (especially compared to the IPOD).  The clip has great utility, and the whole system seems to be stable, reliable, robust, and cheap enough! Well worth the 5 stars!

<Title>Cool, but has problems
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It had problems immediately like previous reviews. Kept turning off because of low battery even though I charged it forever. I set it aside for a day, then reformatted it by holding the button for 20 seconds while turning it off. Now it works, although not like it should. Also, my computer wouldn't recognize it. Try turning it off, putting it on hold, and holding the center button while plugging it in, but don't just let go of the center, keep holding it until your computer recognizes it. Then you can go to sansa and download the new upgrade. Besides all the problems, it's cool because unlike the shuffle, it has a screen so you can see and choose what you listen to. It also has a radio so you can listen to the tv's at the gym, which is clutch.

I was looking for an mp3 player and trusted this brand because my daughter received one for Christmas that has unfortunately has already been stolen.  it was good while it lasted though.  What I also like about this device is the fm radio capabilities as I enjoy listening to NPR occasionally while not everyone in my life is interested.  I really don't have anything negative to say about this player.

<Content>This is my first MP3 I've owned and I love it.  It seems really easy to use with the drag and drop folder. The FM tuner is great receiving the channels where I use it to watch TV at the Y while I work out.  My only issue is that it stopped working when I got it all sweaty during my workout.  A couple hours later, it started working again.  By design, it clips onto your clothing.  On the treadmill,  the clip wasn't strong enough for my arm so I put it on my neck line.  I worked up a good sweat and it stopped working.

<Content>I'm not interested in looking at pictures or watching video on a tiny screen.  All I want is a device that will play my WMA-format music and that I can use in the (noisy) gym where I work out. Small, light, easy to use, hard to accidentally turn on or off, great-sounding, with a bright screen and built-in clip -- the Sansa Clip meets all my needs better than most mp3 players and at much lower cost.    The earbuds provided with the Sansa Clip are serviceable, but I use separately-purchased in-ear buds (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FUESSU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black</a>), since they help reduce the competition from gym noise.

<Title>A lot of bang for your bucks.
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This refers to the 2GB Sansa Clip.  I own an ipod 30GB, but I have to get the Sansa Clip because iPod does not play protected WMA format offered by Netlibrary and OverDrive.  I am very impressed with the features of this little gadget; it beats the iPod shuffle by A MILE.  For $60 (I got mine at Best Buy for $45 on sale), you get a little display (believe me it is important because I owned the first generation ipod shuffle and it was mad as hell when you are away from your computer, pushes the Play button but nothing happens).  You also get equalizers, FM tuners, protected WMA support (very important to me).  I will say the music sounds more lively as well.  I do not give it 5 stars because it is not as sturdy and well-built as an ipod.  It looks very nice but it is very fragile.  This is expected because Sansa needs to make money to stay in business, isn't it.  In terms of software, you need a bit of tech savvy to use it, unlike Ipod, where things are expected to work out of a box.  For example, you should know how to update the firmware, to re-format the gadget, and to use Windows Media Player to sync audio files (for mp3, just drop your files to the Music folder, though).  I downloaded a 4kbps protected WMA  file and never got it to play until reading the specifications: the WMA has to be sampled at 16 kbps or more.  So I downloaded the CD quality version of the file from Netlibrary and it plays fine.  In a nutshell, I highly recommend this player: you get everything you pay for and some.  Don't buy the shuffle, Period.  If your budget allows, spend a little more (about $130 plus tax) for the ipod Nano 2nd generation.  Having said that, I would say ipod Nano is not an option for me because of the protected WMA issue.

<Title>Great player and value
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first MP3 player I have owned.  I own 1000+ CDs, and at age 37, consider myself a bit of an audiophile.  I have listened to some songs from my phone, but never took the plunge to a dedicated MP3 player. Even after a few days, I don't know why I put this off.  First, moving music to the player was remarkably easy.  I just plugged it in, and the player showed up in Windows Explorer.  I copied MP3s from my computer, with no specific directory/file structure to follow, and they showed up, sorted correctly by artist/album/song, etc. No extra software to use!  No iTunes or WMP or Rhapsody or LockYourMusicIntoOurStore stuff!  Second, this is a fine interface. Yes, it is text-only.  But that is how I always listened on my phone anyway, I scrolled through the album titles and when I found the one I wanted, I hit "play". Naturally, if you REALLY NEED to see cover art, get a different player.  But if you are buying music, and not cover art (and also not little plastic disks and boxes), then get this player.  Now I have already purchased eight albums from Amazon in MP3 format, with no problems putting them onto the player.  Great playback quality, easy to use.  I won't go back... I can't go back...

<Title>Nice unit
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use mine to listen to Overdrive and NetLibrary audio books while driving.  Connecting to car audio with cassette adapter.  Works great.  My advice: put the numbered book parts in order into Playlists (one book per Playlist) using Windows Media Player and synch those with the Sansa Click device.  Also, go to the Sandisk web site and install their "firmware update", and download the product manual pdf since you don't get a printed manual in the product package.  What I like about the device controls is that you stop the book just by clicking Pause, and the player turns itself off a minute later - handy while driving the car.  When you want to resume the book just turn the player on with the slide switch and click Pause again.  Neat.

<Content>Nice player, easy to use, good volume, lots of options, I really like it. Only one problem, the random mode on it SUCKS, you can play the songs in order by tittle, or artist, you can make playlists, and more, but the random just keeps repeating the same songs. Oh well, still really good for the $.

<Content>The Sansa Clip mp3 player is my first mp3 player and at first I was worried that it would be challenging to learn to use. But It is very easy, very user friendly. I am not too great with 'newer' technology, so if I can learn to use this very quickly, anybody can!   The sound quality is great as well. I also love the clip on the back which is just right, not too tight and not too loose.  Excellent price too for those of us on a budget. :)

It is small, has a clip to attach to your shorts, or what ever, easy to operate, and even plays the radio.

<Content>This player is one really cool, top of the line best for the money mp3 players. I had a apple nano, and a top of the line zune.  For ease of use the clip blows the others away!  I research things before I buy, even cereal (just kidding)! I also had a sansa before, so I was familar with it.  If I was forced to find one negative, it would be that there is no expansion slot. Otherwise spend your hard earned bucks for this player and know you got your moneys worth!!!!

<Title>Great Value
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this to use on the treadmill.  I orginally wanted to buy the I-Pod shuffle, but I was not very impressed with it.  I found this on Amazon and based on the reviews I bought it.  It is a great player, simple and easy to use right out of the box.  Music is easily downloaded by simply dragging songs from your music folder into the Sansa's music folder. The screen is very handy and the sound quality is great especially for the price. I chose the 1 GB over 2 GB because I don't need an extensive song library.   If you are looking for something to use at the gym this would fit your needs.  I highly recommend it.

<Title>Great for Netlibrary Audio Book listeners (Overdrive audio)
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this little player hoping to use it for Overdrive audiobooks from my local library.  It seemed from the reviews that it might work.  Well I had problems the first week I had it but a recent firmware upgrade on the sandisk website fixed the glitch and it works great.  If you own or purchase one and want to use it for Overdrive audiobooks I recommend a trip to the help section of the sandisk website.  I found the forums (chat boards) more helpful than the actual helpdesk since I am a newbie to the land of MP3 players.  The helpdesk and the folks on the forums are very helpful, but upgrade to the latest firmware and you will be all set to run all the Audiobooks you could want.  I love this little player, it works great, takes up no room at all, recharges from empty in a couple of hours and holds at least 4 of my audiobook selections at a time and some music without any trouble.  I understand it comes in a 2gb version as well, so if you need more space go for it, but if you are looking for inexpensive and fantastic, this is it.  Also they have great support at the website.

<Title>great for this price
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought this for Christmas for our 4 year old. Before you laugh, check out the high dollar "kid" mp3 players that are way more expensive and won't allow anything but CD music to transfer over. My husband and I both use Apple mp3 players, and the Sansa has a somewhat similar look. The menu is great, song downloads are easy and don't require special software. The voice recorder is fun too. We aren't able to get many radio stations here, so we haven't checked out the FM part yet. The Sansa is super small and the clip is a great included feature. The sound is good and the lighted features are useful and fun.  We plan on buying one for some of our adult relatives, to get them into MP3's. If a 4 year old can figure out how to use this (downloading songs aside) ANYONE can handle it.

<Content>I bought the 1GB Zen from Creative right after Christmas, but when I saw this little jewel for the same price, I returned the Zen back to the brick & mortor store and purchased the Clip from Amazon.  And I haven't regretted it since.  This player seems to be built rather solid to me in spite of what some of the others said and the battery lasts longer than the Zen too. The sound quality is up there with the Zen as well.  What? Are you still reading this? Then stop reading and buy the Clip...You won't regret it.

<Content>The 1 GB model holds 15 audible books (downloaded from Audible.com), and it is wonderfully convenient to use.  I no longer have to change to a top with a pocket -- I just clip it on my collar and go out for a walk.  The sound quality is excellent, both with its included earbuds and the lightweight over-the-ear Sony headphones I prefer.  Recharging and synching with Audible Manager on the computer is also very convenient -- just plug the short USB cable into a convenient USB port, say on the monitor.

<Content>If you are looking for a simple MP3 player (either 1GB or 2GB) with a display and good quality, then this is the one for you.   It uses PC's USB port for charging, so it does not come with a charger, but you can easily get one from eBay or some electronic store for about $5 or you can even use some of the cell phone chargers which uses the tiny USB pin.  Yes, it is slightly bigger than iPod-Shuffle, but this one comes with a display and costs about half the price of iPod-Shuffle and with a better quality.  You can even record FM radio without losing any sound quality.  No software is required to copy songs from a PC.

<Title>Just Right
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was my first MP3 player, and I purchased it for use while exercising.  For this purpose, it seems to be just right.  The only problem I had was that the automatic sensing setting for USB didn't work and my PC wouldn't recognize the device when I plugged it in.  After fiddling around with it, and reading a few web pages, I was able to switch it to the correct mode. Probably a good idea to update the firmware in this little guy, which is pretty easy to do, but you have to get the USB working, first.    The Sansa Clip covers all the bases... The sound quality is good, display clear and bright, and build quality seems solid. It has a good sturdy clip.  Overall, it's well worth 34 bucks.

Only glitch was we have an older model computer, Dell 4600, and couldn't get it to accept Microsoft Service Pack II, which is needed in order to recharge the MP3 player from the computer.  But we fixed that by paying $30 to the Nerds at Best Buy, and now everything works smoothly.

<Content>I bought two for my children and after a family reunion where they show up with the Clip now their cousins, aunts, and grandmother wants one. Some of them were previous Ipod owners. I think it has a good design and features for a very modest price (under $40.00). The display is a big plus over the Shuffle. It is very easy to sync using Windows Media Player and its tiny size and rechargeable battery adds to its manageability. You won't be wrong on giving the Clip as a gift to practically anyone. After testing my children's, definitely I'm going to buy my own after finishing this review.

<Content>Sansa clip is dynamite.  You can easily find what you have stored on the unit and can play or pause or resume playing without interupption and without returning to the beginning of a song.  The only bad thing is figuring out the menus.  The directions are spotty at best, but if you stick with it, eventually you can figure it out and enjoy.  Much better than the IPOD.  You can even voice record and record off FM.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one of these for my wife. After I set it up and used it, I decided to get one for my self. First, the price is right. For $40, you get a great MP3 player. The best thing is that you don't have to mess with any new software - a feature I was looking for after having poor experiences with my son's Samsung. It also has features not available in the comparably prices ipod shuffle.  My clip is only 1GB, which is enough for me. I just don't have so much music that I need gobs of GB to hold it all. If I was to do it again, I might go for the 2GB although I haven't run out of space so far. Also, I was looking for something small I could use in the gym. The Clip works great for this purpose and you don't need any armbands or other accessories - the clip works great or you can just stick in your pocket. Finally, I was pleased that I could download podcasts from my favorite pastor. I wasn't sure I could do it but tried it out the other day and it worked fine. If you are looking for a simple, easy to use and inexpensive MP3, don't hesitate to pick up one of these gems!

<Title>Good MP3 for the cost
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this MP3 for my sister for Christmas.  She loves it.  She records her favorite new songs off the radio all the time, and loves that it is so small and has the clip feature.  For only $35, I could buy 2 cheaper than the ipod shuffle, and this has a screen and radio.    The only complaint I have is that the battery charge light never goes above 80% (even though it is fully charged) and that the battery only lasts 8-10 hours instead of the 12-15 that is says it should.  But for $35, what can you expect.  So all in all, a good player for the money. Recommended for anyone thinking of buying and ipod shuffle.  ;)

<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son and I bought Sansa Clip recently and are completely satisfied with it.  Pros: Small footprint with sturdy clip.  Crisp and bright thin film OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display.  Clear MP3/WMA sound.  FM radio digital tuning with preset.  High fidelity voice recording.  Long rechargeable battery life.  Light weight.  Excellent system level communication with Microsoft's Windows Media Player for organizing massive music files.  Charging battery and accessing files through USB port.  Workable as regular USB flash memory stick.  Large GB flash memory capacity.  Various operations selectable by menu driven procedure.  Cons: Consider to get better earphones as usual.  Sansa Clip can be tightly self-clipped to T-shirt or pants with no extra attachments even on physical exercise at gym.  The display contents are readable even under strong sunlight as well as at night.  Music attributes (so-called tags; Artist, Title, Album, Genre,,,) of each music file can be downloaded by Windows Media Player for free and transferred to Sansa Clip that displays them on OLED display. Unlike Apple, SanDisk is an original inventor and manufacturer of flash memory that is major electronic component of Sansa Clip.  Cost effective product with affordable pricing for everybody.  I strongly recommend.

<Content>This is a very good MP3 player at a great value. Good sound with the supplied ear buds, great sound with good headphones. I 1st hooked it up to my iMac to charge it -- big mistake. It froze. I went to Sansa's webpage and found several comments on how to fix it, none worked as written. Called technical support and they didn't quite know how to fix the problem but I reformatted the player on my Dell and installed the upgraded software and now it works great if I only use the IBM compatible computers. (I had to burn backups of my music off my iMac and load it on the Dell to download on the Sansa. A long process and a lot of work, but I really enjoy the player.) Wish it could get better FM reception, its just adequate.

<Title>Golden, once the firmware is updated
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this mp3 player in order to listen to Overdrive audiobooks that I download from the public library.  I have an IPod that I happily use with my Audible books but Ipods are not compatible with Overdrive.  The Overdrive audio software works perfectly with the device and books transfer very easily.     Updated:  Right out of the box, the player has a bug in the firmware and it will not fast forward properly though Overdrive audiobooks.  While fast forwarding I found it skipped to the next section of the book when it reached the  17-18 minute point. This was extremely frustrating as the "hold" feature also did not work when the unit powered off.  Twenty five minutes into the book, it would restart at the beginning of the section instead of the "hold" point.   Reading some comments here and in the Sandisk forums I found the SanDisk Firmware updater: http://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.aspx?CatID=1376 which installed easily on my computer.  When I plugged-in the Sansa it updated the device without any problem.   It will automatically look for firmware updates whenever when I plug it in from now on.   Now the player works beautifully with the Overdrive books.  It holds my stopping point if I remember to click hold and fast forwards perfectly if I need to find my place.   It has great sound, the FM tuner works wonderfully.  I love the small size and the clip feature.    There is not a reference to the firmware updater site anywhere in the product literature which is unfortunate.  Happily I was able to find the information I needed.

<Content>I owned a shuffle, but I got mugged (but seriously who takes a scratched 2nd gen shuffle?). Anyhoo, I got this instead and I must say its 100 times better. Sure, it comes with great features (ie: thevoice recorder) but Sansa also made sure to nail the basics. The disaply screen is an imediate advantage over the shuffle; its clear and easy to navigate. ANoter advantage is the ability to search trough songs (like rewinding and fastfowarding). The sound is great, too. Aside from all that, the simplicity of getting the music on this is fenomonal. I wasn't sure if i could place all the songs on my itunes account on this, but the instructions just said to drag and drop, so I did. It literally was that simple. Everything came on without flaw.   The ONLY flaw I can see is that the earphones it comes with don't seem to fit in the haedphone hack properly. They seem a bit too big. Anyone else have this problem?   Other then that, everything is perfect. You can even customize your music settings to your liking. If you are searching for an Mp3, but don't mind lack of video (why anyone wantd to watch movies on a screen so small is strgane to me) then get this.

All I had to do was plug in the USB cable and plug in the player, The computer recognized it right away. Since I had already created a Library in Windows Media Player transfering the music by synching was a sinch. As for the player itself it is a joy to use. Simple as can be. The only things I would have liked to have seen in the package were a case for the player and an A.C. adapter. It would have been nice to have the quick start guide mention how long to charge the player the first time. Also keeping the face of the player clean is a slight challange. The supplied bud style headphones are adequate and sound good enough, like many other reviewers I would suggest using a pair of headphones that you are used to. The sound is just fine, The FM sounds okay and has a difficult time with weak signals. The size and the price are what sold me on this player. I think it competes with the I POD shuffle and wins hands down.

<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>this little clip is AWESOME! i got it to go running with so i don't need more than 1gb of storage.  (I have an ipod video which is hard to go running with. It is too heavy & big.) Well anyway my sansa clip just showed up in the mail today. I immediately plugged it into my computer, synced it up to media player, put some tunes on it, and went running.  It is so light i didn't even know it was there.  I used my headphones that i already had because earbuds are no good while running. i'll probably never use them but it's nice that they are included.  The sound is fantastic.  I love that it fits in the palm of your hand or you can clip it onto your clothes.  It really does weigh next to nothing.  I put a lot of songs on it, more than i'll ever listen to while running, and it's still only half full.  There are several options of how to listen to music. (play by by artist, play all on random, make different folders to play etc) And it looks so cute & has a bright crisp screan. manuevering through the menu is easy. I can easily operate all the buttons.  and  it was so cheap!  I am thrilled  :)    My only gripe is that it doesn't sync to itunes & i have been using that instead of media player.  So now i have to move songs onto media player in order to get them onto the sansa clip.  that's a minor inconvenience considering all the benefits.

<Title>WOW!!!!
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing is amazingly small and light.  The display is not much, but it will hold 3 lines and is well lit and easy to read.  The menu system is good and lets you scroll through songs by title, artist and album.  It uses a standard mini-USB for data transfer and charging.  It requires no software or drivers as it uses Windows Media Player to sync songs.  This player has a few things greatly improved over their older ones (like the Sansa e260 I own).  It has about the best sound quality out of any MP3 player I have seen.  It also has a nice seemless quick fade from one song to the next.  I use my MP3 players for listeming to audio books in MP3 format.  Some of these are 20+ hours long.  My old player took forever to fastforward through, about a 20:1 fast forward, so yes, fast forwarding 10 hours would take about 30 minutes.  Now this one has a progressively accelerated fast forward that can run through hours of MP3s in 10 seconds.  Also when you turn off the MP3 player it will start back at the exact spot you left off and if it was playing when you turned it off then it will start playing automatically when you turn it back on.  It also start up in only a few seconds.  The only issues I see is lack of colors on the 1GB version and maybe a few more colors overall would be nice.  The only bug I found is that it does not change the hours on the time elapsed counter and leaves it at 0, but the progression bar is still right.  I was so impressed with the 2GB pink one that I got for my girlfriend that I got a 2GB black one for myself... yes to replace my more expensive 4GB Sansa e260.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.

<Title>The best small player
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the 2gb version of the Clip. I own other mp3 players but this is by far the best.  Few players have the features of the Clip for such a reasonable price.  Pros:  It's small- the size of a matchbox- and easily and firmly clips to shirt or pants.  The controls are very easy to use and the screen is easy to see.  The sound quality is very good when used with better headphones than those that came with it.  You can play and record from FM radio.  And, most importantly for me, it works with Audible downloads. It also looks good.  I have the red one and many people have asked about it and where to buy one. Cons:  The sound quality of the voice recorder could use improvement.  And, as someone mentioned, there's a glitch in the counter that impacts files that are over an hour in length other than Audible files.  Supposedly Sandisk is working on this and there will be a firmware adjustment at some point.  For anyone who wants a player with storage of 2gb or less, the Clip is the best available.

<Title>Why do people even buy Ipods?
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're reading this review, then I know just what you're thinking. You're in the market for an MP3 player, but you're utterly confused about what to get since there's only a few hundred of them out there. You probably are thinking, " Maybe I should just get an Ipod. ", because Apple's mighty music player can't be beat right? Uhh, wrong.   Forget the Ipod shuffle, or the Nano or anything else and get the Sansa Clip. I got mine after doing a lot of reading up on different MP3 players. I initially just wanted to listen to music while walking, jogging, or biking. I liked how the Ipod shuffle had a clip, but I didn't like that it didn't have a display or that it's primarily designed to be used with Itunes. The Ipod Nano was nice, but too expensive. Then I considered the Creative Zen Stone, but again it had no display, and had received some questionable reviews.  I was still going to buy the Zen Stone, because... well at $40 who cares? But, the salesman at the Staples where I bought showed me the Sansa Clip and mentioned that it had a display, and I decided to try it. Several hours later, I'm one extremely happy customer. For the excellent price, ease of use, superb sound quality, and ingenious bundle of features you simply cannot beat this little thing. Use the money you saved on this to get some other gadgets. Apple beware. You are not the King of The Hill.

<Title>This a great Music player!
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been thinking of getting a new MP3 player for a while now.  I don't need video (I don't like watching video on a 2 inch screen, I think a lot of people think they need this feature and just end up listening to music anyway), so I just wanted something small that sounds good, well this is it!  I bought the 2 Gb model and holds more than enough music for me (it charges off the USB slot on the computer anyway so its no big deal to add or take something off the player once in a while for new music).  I had an older sandisk mp3 player and it worked fine but this one just sounds so much better.  I have a decent pair of ear buds(Sennheiser CX300)and I am knocked out by the quality this thing puts out, sounds great when plugged into the input on my car stereo too.  No extra software to install, plug it in and Media Player 11 recognized it right away, super easy to add music.  Easy to use and you will be listening to high quality music in minutes.  Very small, light and the clip is very handy, display is easy to read in all light conditions.  This is a great buy.

<Title>This is the future of digital music players (version 2, now with less fluff!)
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have an iphone, but I needed to use a stand alone mp3 player for work so after getting sick of my old shuffle, I decided to research and buy a mp3 player with an fm tuner. My first purchase was the zen stone plus, which looks very sleek, but has a mediocre interface and no clip, so I couldn't hang it on to my jacket. So I returned the stone for the sansa clip 2 gig and ironically it was 10 bucks cheaper (I have the 2 gig for 60 dollars vs the 1 gig for 40), has a clip, easier to navigate than the stone, AND has almost TWICE as much battery life!   The interface works great and is very straightfoward. The big thing about this player though is that you can use the screen to choose which song you want to play, unlike the ipod shuffle. I do like the idea of random mix play, but there are always times where i'm annoyed and want to listen to a certain song, without skipping constantly to the preferred song.  The drag and drop works great and I used to use windows media player 11 to sync it which works extremely well. Headphones are horrible but it's like that with all mp3 players.  The most amazing (and will probably be overlooked) feature of this player is that it's integrated with the Rhapsody music service. The player can't automaticallly sync to the service even though it's supposed to. It can be a NIGHTMARE getting this to sync with multiple reformatting of the player through the software and player and this applies to all shipments. As a matter of fact every professional review couldn't get the player to sync with rhapsody.   If you are willing to give subscription music a chance (I personally thought it was a stupid idea myself but the player came with a 30 day trial of rhapsody) which is about (15 dollars as of now) your in music heaven. I don't want to turn this into a review of rhapsody but I will say that it's amazing to just think of an artist or song or genre of music and just drag it to the player for fresh songs. You don't "own" them, but have access to them as long as you subscribe and sync your player once a month to keep the songs on the player working. I have 100 cds and I'm sick of it, but now I can get fresh songs every time. I remember just guessing which techno cd to buy at the store years ago and paid about 20 bucks for it. Now I can discover all the techno music I want through recommmendations of techno channels and artists that sound similar because I wouldn't know where to start!  There is one big flaw I've encountered with this player and hopefully you never will. I used this thing a lot and it helps me get through the day. I've noticed that when I'm constantly switching songs it will ask me to sync up with a music service to continue playing my songs a few times already. I've heard that it can still happen even if you own the songs!!! This really annoyed me and it would be even more annoying if I was traveling with this player and all of a sudden it told me I couldn't play mp3s on it anymore until I go home and sync it to my pc.  So other than the occasional syncing issue, this thing gets 4 stars. I love the clip so much because it's small, stylish and has great battery life. No more clunky mp3 player in my pocket!

<Content>I just bought this about a week back after I heard of its release.  I have used various MP3'd  including iPods in the past and find them to be quite good but not exactly wowed by iTunes so I decided to give this a shot.  I have to say I'm not only pleasantly surprised I love the thing.  Much easier to use then the iPod/iTunes and better sound quality.  Some amazing functions that are not available on a lot of the other MP3 players.    If you're in the market I highly suggest this product, after having several players along with iPods, I would have to say they don't compare.  This product is going to give Apple a run for there money.

<Title>So cool, and so small
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought one of these for a Christmas gift, and a second one for my wife. What I really like about it is that you just drag and drop your MP3s into the Sansa music folder. No special software needed.     Sounds great, although we used earbuds we already owned, rather than the ones included.     It is slightly bigger than an IPod shuffle, but it has a very clear OLED display. Makes it easy to select the songs.

<Title>Sansa Clip: A Real Winner!
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Recently had my Sansa e260 4GB stolen, and was going to replace it with another e-series Sansa player.  I was leaning toward getting the e280 8 GB player.  However, after reading the reviews for the Sansa Clip I was intrigued and decided to get it instead of the e280. I wanted the 2 GB version, but Amazon didn't have it available at the moment, so I went down to my local Best Buy and bought it.    After 5 days of use, I have to admit, I'm really impressed.  It is very small, light-weight, easy to use, and sounds really GREAT!  No need to install any software because Windows Media Player syncs your audio files to the Sansa Clip quickly and without problem. You can also just drag and drop your files to the Clip if you wish.  Either way works just fine.  The only negative for me (and this is my own subjective opinion) is the earbuds that come with the Clip. Although I think the supplied earbuds sound pretty good, they are too big and uncomfortable for my ears, and don't fit very well. I bought a set of Jbud earbuds for under $20 (available at Amazon), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IG66VS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)</a> which are much more comfortable and sound better than the stock Sansa earbuds.  Another good alternative is the Coby earbuds sold at Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FOYMKU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Coby Super Bass Digital Stereo Earphones</a> which are a very good value for the money.    Sandisk has come out with a big winner here.  The Sansa Clip raises the bar for micro audio players and in my opinion, gives the most "bang for the buck" of any comparable device on the market at this time, including the over-rated  iPod Shuffle and the Zen Stone.  If you're still debating over whether you should get the Sansa Clip, I highly recommend that you wait no longer, and order it right now. I don't think you will regret it!  Addendum, Jan. 19, 2008:  I've now had the Sansa Clip for just over 2 months, and my initial assessment has proven to be true. With an attractive compact design, decent battery life, and really great sound, I love my Sansa Clip!

<Title>Perfect workout mp3 player
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a video ipod but it is a bit too big for me to work out with. I brought this mainly as a work out/spare mp3 player. I was surprise how good the sound quality is (using my shure SE210 headphones). It might even sound better than the ipod. This thing is also very small and light. I just clip it to my shirt collar and it stays on even after a rigorous work out and most of the time I don't even notice that it is there. The radio is a nice addition, too.   In terms of Cons (if i want to be picky): 1) It can't play by folder, but can make playlist very easily with Windows. 2) The screen doesn turn off when you charge with usb cable connect to your computer so seems to get a little hot after a while but if you are charging using wall/car charger it turns off after few seconds. 3) The volume and power slider is a little lose so if you shake it it makes a little noise.   Over all I am very happy with the purchase. It's a solid mp3 player for the price.
