<Title>Everything but the kitchen sink
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been looking for a replacement for my Ipod for a few months since it broke down.  I was interested in the other PVP's for their video capability but was reluctant to buy them because of their huge sizes.      I bought the Archos one night after reading about it in an article and reading the other reviews here.  I am glad that I did.  It is only 20 gig but cost only a fraction more than a Ipod with the same size harddrive.      The Gmini 400 plays mp3 well and sounds great. The screen, although small is one of the clearest screen I've seen.  Photos is clear and videos is smooth and colorfull.  It is so amazing that I could read the subtitles in most movies' and animes' as long as the font is not really small.      The games so far is not really worth mentioning.  It could play games but they are of the games for phones variety.      One thing that needs to be mentioned is that the software to convert videos does not sync the sound with the video properly.  Sound always came a second ahead of video. Exp..you hear someone talk before you see the mouth move.  This problem was solved by downloading the newest pocketDivx which have a setting already set for the Gmini 400.  The program is free and has more functions than the one that came with the Gmini.  The link is http://divx.ppccool.com/       Within the week that I recieved my player, I have shown it to a few of my coworkers and 3 of them decided that they wanted to buy one on the spot.  One of them already owns a Ipod that he loves.        If you only need to play music, the ipod is better and easier to use but if you want a swiss army knife of portable entertainment that works well and is about the size of an Ipod then this is the perfect solution.

<Title>Won't be needing a new mp3 player for a long time...
<Date>Thu Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In addition to all the reviews already written, I'd like to concur with everyone who thought this was the ultimate iPod-killer. The Gmini 400 is the same size as Apple's 40 GB iPod, but loaded with tons more extra features, as already told. I'd recommend this to anyone seeking an mp3 player within the iPod's budget range.   A few people have mentioned that a big downside is that it comes with no carrying case; I have recently purchased a case specially designed for the Archos Gmini 400 from Infusion Threads for $20, and since it was made for the Gmini, it works like a charm. It is slightly more expensive than most generic cases, but it'd clear cover lets you access the buttons and see the screen and all the ports are accessible without ever having to take it out.  (...) I am very satisfied with my purchase! If you're deciding whether to choose this over an iPod, i'd say choose this any day!

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned the gmini for 3 weeks and I couldn't be happier about the purchase. When I was considering buying it some of my main concerns were about its size (the machine itself and its screen), and the battery life.  When I finally saw the gmini I was surprised since I expected something bulkier and bigger, so its size is - to my belief - ideal. The screen looks bigger than I imagined and you can see everything in a movie with great detail, It really amazed me how you can get such a great resolution out of something so small. I though everything in the movies would look really small but that's not the case. So if the screen is one of your concerns it really shouldn't be. As for battery life, I really haven't had any issues with it, last time I tried it, it gave me 9.5 hours of music give or take, where as to video I really haven't tried it for more than 3.5 hours, but it will at least give you that on a consistent basis. It still had battery when I replugged it, so I'm sure it can give you more time.  As for its user interface and handling it, the basic things (playing movies/music, forwarding, volume) are really easy and intuitive to use, but some stuff (queing songs, playlists, repeat modes) you do have to check the manual for. On the other hand, putting files on it is a piece of cake, just plug the usb and open the drive from my computer, inside of it is a bunch of folders titled music, videos, photos, data.. so all you have to do is drag the material you want in your gmini to its corresponding folder; piece of cake. While getting a dvd to divx or xvid format is time consuming and sometimes complicated ( NO software for doing this is included), if you do manage to get your hands on a divx or xvid movie the software included in the gmini will "edit" it so it can be played in your gmini with the click of a button (by edit I mean make it have the right size and frames per second - maximum of 640-480 size and a 30 fps, if you don't know what this is don't worry just open your divx file in the software and click start and it will do everything for you, if the movie you have already clears the requirements its obvious you don't need to use this software). Overall considering your getting a portable device, the video feature is exellent for the gmini's size, you can really watch a movie no problem at all, and your also getting an exellent mp3 player, plus the extra features, it really is a great buy, I do hope this was helpful to you.

<Title>Owned Ipod and now Gmini 400
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I returned my 20gb 4g ipod because i saw this model.  Other than ease of use and build quality, the archos is better in every other better category.  Does an ipod display pictures? play movies, record, and play games?  I don't think so.  At about the samae price, only 20something more expensive, the archos is a great value.  It is a little hard to figure out at first, probably because I was used to the really easy to use ipod, but I got the hang of it really quickly.  This thing is awesome, i don't know why it's not getting mmore attention.  GET IT NOW.

<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Archos Gmini 400 is not made out of aluminum, it just looks like aluminum.  It is a stamped steel covering painted silver metallic.  The quality of the hardware is top notch, as is the add on FM tuner module.  I purchased an Iriver FM transmitter, it felt so cheaply made compared to the Archos hardware.  I am very satisfied with the Gmini 400.  Highly recommended.

<Title>A very progressive device
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did a lot of research before purchasing an mp3 player.  None of them are perfect.  Every model seems to have it's own pitfall: short battery life, clunky design, poor supporting software, poor navigation pathways, etc...  It is as if a ton of un-tested devices make it to shelves every year.  So I decided after some time to purchase the Archos Gmini 400 and I am very pleased with it.  This device is the closest thing to what the future will ultimately offer: full color screen, music, video,  videogames, photos all on one small device (the only things missing are a cell phone, a touch screen and wireless internet).  My computer recognized the device immediately and putting music on it is an simple as copying and pasting.  The color screen is very attractive but I haven't figured out how to get the album art to be displayed yet.  So far I have sampled the video capabilities on the Gmini.  Watching video on the little screen is pretty amazing, so I can't complain. If you are that into video then the Archos AV420 sounds like a better solution for you (has a bigger screen).  It comes with some pre-loaded jpegs.  One of them is an image of a red-spotted newt.  I have a few so that was a totally cool surprise and makes great wallpaper.  I have read that Archos has poor customer service which is too bad.  If they plan to make any ripples in the US market they are going to need to fix that.  Americans like to know they are buying a from a friendly company.  Hopefully Archos will expand and become more commercially available in the US.  Their products are very dynamic and they seem to have a better grasp of the technologies potential.   As someone who owns a lot of Apple's stock (but not an Ipod) I think Archos is great and hopefully will fuel other digital device suppliers to up their ante.    Pros (believe me, these outweigh the cons) : - Small as an Ipod but offers a lot more features. (even more than the 2005 models). - The sound is very good (I use Grado SR60s, you can hear everything in detail). - Is recognized as an external drive on your PC and plays protected files (This is such a huge, huge plus in my books).  - Very attractive aluminum design (doesn't look like a hotel soap bar).   Cons:  - Should have been offered in a 40gb/60gb Model.  - Smallish Battery Life/ No removable battery. - Buttons are stiff and navigating is rather unintuitive.  - Reformatting Video files (this approach needs fixed in future models).    *** Also I bought the carrying case that was listed on Archos site.  It looks great and protects the device really well.  The only down side to it is that it covers the car adaptor  power port (this can be fixed by taking it to an dry cleaner, with a tailor, and have them cut a circular hole for the power cord.

<Title>Better than the iPod, my iPod-weilding friend agree.
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a Gmini 400 for christmas, and this thing is amazing. It is by far the best portable media device on earth. The screne is incredibly bright (it lights up my dark room at night). The interface is top-notch, and is extremely easy to use. You don't need to use any crappy program or iTunes to get your music on the Gmini 400, you just drag the files. Way better method. Picture viewing is a great little feature to have, mainly to impress your buddies. And when your buddies have an iPod Photo, whip out a video and make them say "whoa". I have the entire movie "Equilibrium" on my Gmini, and it is very viewable. There are a few minor draw-backs: The button-cursor on the screen scrolls slowly, so navigation is for the paitent. (Hopefully a firmware update will fix this). The buttons feel a little loose-ly mounted, but only when you fiddle with them, and not under normal use. No [good] case is yet available. The official case sucks, and no other cases are on the american market. I (ironically) use  an iPod case that my friend gave to me, which fits the thing perfectly, so i'm happy with it.  get one, its the best

<Title>Best Archos to date... Same problems
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is Archos' best player to date.  The size (physical) is spot on and the layout of the controls are perfect.  These last few weeks have been a blast loading videos from my Tivo and DVD's onto the device.  I've even connected the A/V out to the LCD display in the van.  Kids love it!  Everything stated in the below reviews is accurate and I won't restate them here.  Now the bad news.  I'm an old time Archos buyer.  I've had the Jukebox series players and now the GIMINI 400.  The Jukebox players suffered from cheap electrical contacts and so does the GMINI.  They fail under normal use.  My player's down button failed in the third week and I am taking it back.  I don't plan on getting another unit.    Archos needs to step up the internal qualitity on their builds.  I anticipate that more people will also be getting their buttons repaired since this player can also function as a game device.  If your buttons haven't failed yet, consider yourself lucky.

<Title>Great for travel - plays MP3's and stores photos!
<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My partner and I are traveling for at least a year. I did many, many hours of research trying to find the best device that would both play MP3's and store photos. We've been traveling for 2 months now and the Gmini400 has been great. We bought some very portable travel speakers so now we can play listen to our music in all the various hotels we stay in. We have at least 70 albums on the Gmini and have been adding stuff as we travel. It sounds great.   We also take a ton of digital photos and it's super simple to download them to the Gmini because it has a CompactFlash card reader built in. You don't need to be near a computer. The color screen is not as quite good as the one on my camera and the pics come up a little slow but you can see the pics fine. Also you can plug it into a TV or computer to see them better.   We mainly wanted the MP3 player and photo storage but there are other cool features. There is a recorder so we can record our trip thoughts or whatever. You can play videos - although I can't seem to play the ones I've shot with my camera (Canon Powershot G5).  There are some games (not so great but I play them occassionally to kill time when waiting for busses).    The battery may not be as long as some but we did a 11 hr bus ride and listened to it off and on a lot and it didn't die.   It seems sturdy too - I've dropped it on cement a couple times.

<Title>Archos Shrinks Down To Compete with King Apple
<Date>Thu Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>While all of Archos's products have been great, the gmini really raises the bar. With a bundle full of features including full movie and music playback, as well as games and picture viewing, the Gmini 400 beats all other units of its type. Also the fact that it has a compact flash slot leaves it with unlimited storage capabilities. I have transfered and watched many movies on the unit with no problem. Music transfer is suprisingly fast and battery life has been great as well. I really feel that the Gmini400 has really overcome any product out there and while the price is slightly greater then some other units, its well worth it!

<Title>Why buy an IPod
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought it, love it!!! Facing the media bias in favor of IPods, I thought I'd give a word for my Archos Gmini 400. There was about 6 months ago a full on article about how IPods will add the feature of picture viewing on their equipment. Big Deal!!! Archos has been selling multimedia player able to dipslay pics and view movies for a while now. The argument of the form factor is not valid anymore with the Gmini400 which is as small as an IPod. The truth is this little player does it all and more.  I strongly recommend it.

<Title>Ho my!!!
<Date>Mon May 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the best mp3 player, photo viewer; game device; and video player. Or is it the best video player, photo viewer, game device, and mp3 player?. Like most all-in-one devices the buttons are design to be suitable for all tree functions, which makes it a little ackward to operate, it seems almost that the device was design mostly for game playing. Once you get the hang of it is very easy to navigate, although you have to hold it with both hands. >very good sound >videos play amazingly good, very smooth and if encoded at the right settings will sound excellent. You will need the divx codec  and pocketdivxencoder which are freelly available tools. when encoding video:   >run pocketdivixencoder, choose archos device in the first window, then on the next window that opens up choose the one on the far left hand side. then click ok when promps alerting you that the resolution is only up to 352x258. >change video quality to 15 >audio quality to 8 >output dimentions to 252x184 (click where it says change)  You are ready to watch videos, keep in mind that this settings are optimal only to be viewed on the device not so good when sending the singnal out to the TV. for that you would have to increase video quality and output dimentions, but when you do that also the size of the file increases quite a bit.  So rule of thumb better resolution bigger file size. The source of my videos where from files encoded mpeg2  The original file was 700 megabytes and it was reduced to a mere 70 megabytes. ( which is like half hour worth of video) I described here many things that might be helpfull for people that bought this thing with the intention to watch videos. Once you get the thing working you won't ever get tired of using it.  I use it all the time except for games, all in all an excellent gadget.

<Title>Greatest Gadget!
<Date>Tue May 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This Media Player is Fantastic.  I've settled with listening to my MP3 player at the gym for several years now. What would come in handy doing those long boring cardio workouts is to be able to watch a video right there, and not be stuck with whatever is playing on the TV gym.  The versatile Gmini makes video very portable.  I wanted something similar in size to an Ipod, but with much more to offer.  Music alone isn't enough anymore.    Portability was a big factor for me, so realistically, the 3.5" inch or larger screen media players seemed too bulky to watch videos doing cardio, then slapping it on my arm to listen to music working out.  This device is perfect.    Videos on The screen look excellent. After a quick lesson in converting files, you'll watch your 3 gig file shrink down to about a 300mb file with excellent quality.  Dragging and dropping files into the Gmini is simple.  Excellent sound quality.    This thing is GREAT.

<Title>Pretty good..
<Date>Fri May 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First impression of Gmini 400. I got this player 2 days back and here is my first impression.  The utility value of this device is amazing.This could surely keep you entertained for a while with its video capabilities and its primary function of mp3 play. Here is some information that could help your decision a) You can copy photos directly from your flash memory card. b) You have the ability to add this as an external drive to the pc and directly deal with the files. c) Audio recording is possible. d) Though there is NO inbuilt FM tuner, with the add-on it should be possible. I am yet to try this. I read this is a pretty useful add on and gives you the ability to record music off your Radio. Also the buffering feature of the add-on helps record the entire song, even if you could manage to start recording after the song has played for a few seconds. e) The video picture resolution is great and it is very much watchable. With the new firmware release (version 2.1 released in may-05) plays many of the video formats (.avi files). Please make sure to download and install this version of firmware or the latest before you try to play your own video files. Some of the movie clips that did not play initially worked after I installed this firmware. I heard this has fixed a few other bugs apart from providing the capability to play videos of many formats.  f) More information about this device, tutorials on many 'how to's, other expriences can be found at these links  www.gmini400.com -- a community site  www.engadget.com/entry/6213210442242855 -- more than 200 user comments.  The Cons..  a) The controls are not intuitive..should consult the manual often. b) THe back button does not always take you to the previous screen and sometimes takes you to the page where u initially came from..

<Title>Great product, but hope it's in perfect condition.
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Gmini at the end of May-- it was a great product and surpassed the iPods that many of my friends sported. >D Although the buttons seemed a bit flimsy, that was just a minor concern.  Unfortunately, earlier this month, the charger stopped working. My family and I called up Archos and talked to them about this problem-- guess what they told us? They wanted me to go to RadioShack, PAY them to look at it, and send the defective machine back. I told them no, it's their responsiblility to provide us with working products. We had to put up a fight with the representatives, and finally they said they'd call us later that day.  Ninety-six hours passed, and we got nothing.  We called them again and demanded they send us a charger. Yet again, after an argument with the operator, they said they would sent us a nother one and it should be at our doorstep by the end of the week. It arrived three days late.  And now, thanks to their stubborness, my Gmini has shut down and refuses to turn its power on. The thought of having to call them a third time and bicker with the reps makes me wince.  So, in conclusion, it's a great product, but you better hope it's in perfect condition-- otherwise you have to put up with one hell of a customer service.

<Title>Defective Hard Drive in New Unit
<Date>Thu Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>To help readers put my comments into perspective, my MAJOR reason for buying the Gmini 400 was to download CF cards in the field during trips,etc. so that I could re-use the cards in my digital camera.  I base my comments on this need and not for example, game playing ability.  1. This was not clear to me before purchase, the 400 only reads TYPE 1 CF cards.  2. The CF card slot needs to be used with care (due to design) since once could easily bend the pins if card insertion was hurried.  3. Takes a long time to charge.  I had new unit on charge for over 4 hours and it still was not charged.  4. Picture review is SLOW.  I shoot .jpg files that are about 5-6 mB each (8 mpixel) and they took about 8-10 seconds to be displayed. This is too long to review 100s of photos.  Also, screen quality is not adequate to assess image focus quality, etc.  5. I could not complete the download of even one card, so I can not accurately give download speeds.  But, this unit seems slow on downloading.  6. During my first and second attempts at downloading a cf card, I got the same error message - 'failure - error writing to hard drive. Please check hard drive' .  Since my MAJOR reason was photo storage during trips, I was not going to risk a bad hard drive from day one!  Unit was returned for refund and I'm looking at other options.  It may be good as a MP3 player, or to watch movies/play games (read other reviews - I didn't evaluate these functions); but I do not recommend this unit for serious photographic usage for downloading CF cards.

<Title>Great little gadget - worth every penny. Far better than iPod
<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>hi,  I have been looking for a replacement of my ipod mini 4gb for a while now but never saw a worthy upgrade except for the new 6GB version but its to expensive for an extra 2GB's. I finally decided to get a colour mp3/hard drive player but still did not know what one to get. I searched through all the ones i could find and then narrowed it down by spec and features and reliabilty. So i was left with the iRiver PMP, or the arrchos gmini 400. I finally decided to get the archos due to it being so small, lightweight and having a great design. As soon as i saw a manual, the unit itself, other documents, charger, AV cable, USB cable and earphones. I was suprised as the unit is so much smaller then i had expected. I started to load some films on the unit using the pre loaded software which is on the unit for easy installation when it is plugged in the computer.  I then loaded my music collection which was extremely fast as it ran on USB 2.0. After half an hour i was familier with the UI as i had read the manual but refer to it once more afterwards.  I am so glad i have bought this item as i can watch movies, listen to music, view photos and play games all in this device which cannot be matched by the iPod. The music quality is extremely good and clear in my opinion better than the iPod. The video playback is also amazing as you can take screenshots, bookmark it and FF and RW very easily. The photo viewing is also very good as you can zoom, rotate and edit photos There is only one game on the Gmini which is great for killing time and extremely addictable. I have not used the memory card reader yet so cannot review that.  So in conclusion this an extremely good music player, very good video player, excellent photo viewer and good portable games console. Although battery life is only 10 hours i have recieved 11 and a half hours and 11 hours for music playback. Anyone who is considering buying the iPod should not as this is so much better.

<Title>IPOD'S WORST NIGHTMARE
<Date>Sun Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just came back from Everest Base Camp, Himalayas... altitude at base camp approximately 5300 meters above sea level. Temperature approximately -15 degrees Celsius. Gmini working 100%  I have used my GMINI every single day, travelling across Thailand, India, China and the Tibetan deserts and mountains. This little gadget has survived sandstorms, snowstorms, HAILstorms... you name it. In Thailand, I would regularly carry it to the beach with me, lie down on the sand and listen away. I have now tested this unit for the last seven (7) months. Taken it through extreme temperatures, HOT n COLD, low altitudes and high altitudes... rain or shine, my litte Gmini is always there for me.   I also bought the Car Charging kit for the GMINI 400. EXCELLENT PURCHASE!!! Many places in Tibet don't have power, so I would charge the Gmini in our LandCruiser as we travelled across the country. Never did I ran out of power! Not even at Everest Base Camp!!! I even rode a horse from the monastery up to Base Camp, Gmini in my pocket... herding a pack of YAK, Gmini in my pocket!!! WHAT A RUSH!!!!!!!!  Video Quality: Excellent!!! I download or convert entire DVDs onto MP4 format. I also rip my favorite scenes from my favorite films onto it, no need to convert the whole DVD.  Audio Quality: Excellent!!! Amazing sound. I gave away the headphones that came in the box. I used SONY MDX earbuds from day 1. Still going strong. The sound quality was better than iPod's  Photo Quality: Excellent!!! The availability of a Compact Flash slot is an amazing thing!!! It does not cease to amaze other people. A friend of mine took an excellent shot of Mount Everest, no clouds, perfect National Geographic Shot... I asked him if I could have it. He said, sure, I will email it. Yeah right, I took out my Gmini and copied the shot, then used it as wallpaper on my Gmini.  Portable Protective Case: I recommend you get the protective case manufactured by INFUSION THREAD, beautiful and very useful.  This case has saved my Gmini thousands of times. I once accidentally spilled a glass of water on it, then it was saved from a hot cup of joe, and the case protects it from dust and scratches. Get yourself the protective case and a film to protect the screen.  Enjoy the GMINI EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Check out these useful websites: (...)

<Title>Very portable and versatile player...but not perfect
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this after a long time of debating whether to get the gmini, buy into the media and get an iPod, or spend a little more and get a slightly bulkier product that recorded straight from a TV (archos av420). I wound up getting this product for the following reasons:  - size: it is very portable, and fits easily in my pocket - as opposed to the bulkier models (AV 420 also by archos comes to mind). - versatility: it is able to play videos and you can view images, which is more than the iPod or ipod mini can do - hard drive space: obviously, since you will be watching videos on this,  it's important to have space. 20 GB fit about 4 seasons of futurama, a movie, 2 seasons of chapelle, as well as many of my songs and pictures.   I sacrificed the ability to record from a TV in order to get a slimmer more portable product. Overall I am happy with my decision to buy it, however there are some issues:  - music seems to lag sometimes, not sure if this is because my hard drive on the player is fragmented - issue with playing videos that you do not encode yourself..it will play some, and won't play others.  basically, you have to re-encode all your videos (it's easy to do with a free program). however, i understand other products have a similar problem - the games suck... but then again , if I wanted to play games, I would have gotten a PSP and not this.  Overall: Great product, I recommend it .

<Content>The Gmini 400 has exceeded my expectations. I needed a digital FM recorder with the capacity to record a minimum of 8 hours on battery power. I record convention talks which are usually less than an hour in duration. I then burn the sessions on CD's. The additional features;(ability to store and view up to 200,000 photos, play games, watch music videos, and download and store data from my PC) are fringe benefits. It was well worth the cost.
