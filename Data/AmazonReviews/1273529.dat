<Content>The FM tuner didn't work and downloading music was next to impossible.  I would have returned it, but my son threw out half of the original packaging.  I thought it would be a inexpensive option for my 10 year old, but it turned out to be a $20 piece of plastic.

<Title>Amazing Size MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Was looking for inexpensive MP3 player for my 8-yr old Step daughter as a Birthday present. This was perfect! Even smaller than the previous model. It's size is amazing. She is able to hang it around her neck, plug in her earphones and rock on! Also love the fact it has an internal rechargable battery. It recharges by connecting it to your PC via a USB cable (PC doesn't even have to be on!). Transferring MP3s from the PC was very easy. Great MP3 for any one looking for a "starter" one.
