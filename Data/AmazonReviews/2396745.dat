<Title>No power No music
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My girlfriend purchased the Sandisk this for me for Christmas. I was excited and loaded the entire space used for about a month then couldn't get it to charge on anyone's computer try mine hers and others no go.  I will spend a little more money and get something that won't break in a month. I had one that worked with Triple A batteries but only 128 MB buts its still ticking.   Not a very good product very disappointed. Not sure I will purchase another of this brand.

<Title>Works well when it doesn't reset.
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player because I needed a small FM radio to listen while at work. The tuner works fine but not perfect. It picks up reception from the headphone cord which is the reason for the so-so reception.  I like that the player connects and charges through a standard USB plug instead of a mini-USB socket that needs a small USB cable to use. The player recharges fine with any wall charger with a USB port. The cover for the USB plug fits firmly and blends with the rest of the player.   I also like the style of the OLED screen. There is a microphone and an option to record a FM station, but I never use those options.   My major problem with this player is that it resets all of its settings and preset FM stations randomly. Sometimes the player will be stable for a week, and sometimes the player will reset 1 or 2 times in a day. It's very frustrating to search and preset all of my favorite stations after a random reset.  Another problem I have is that the "Play All" option for MP3 music automatically sorts the songs by the reverse order that they were loaded into the player. This makes for a tedious time loading up multiple parts of a podcast in correct order to the player.   An obscure problem that I ran into was that it makes Winamp crash while it was plugged into one of the computer's USB socket. Deleting a file in Winamp that syncs it to MP3 players solves that problem.  The player claims to have 15 hours on a full battery recharge. The most time that I'm used the player on one fully-charged battery is about 11 hours.  This player had great potential to be a great MP3 player, but too many problems had ruined that opportunity. Overall, if I had a second chance, I would not buy this player again.

<Title>Nice, small, but annoying
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like this MP3 player a lot because it fills my needs, but it has numerous minor issues that really makes it the most annoying electronic device I own.  I was looking for a simple and small MP3 player to use while exercising.  I didn't need half a TB of internal storage for all the MP3s I own.  I wanted an internal battery and an easy means of adding songs to the device.  The Sansa Express with its 1GB space and built-in UBS plug fits those needs.  The battery has a long life too.  Where the Sansa fails is in the little details: It's obnoxious.  It's always doing what you don't want it to do.  For example: (*) Most of the time when I turn it on it forces me to select my language instead of continuing the last track it was playing.  (*) It's difficult to turn off.  OK, manufacturers refuse to use a switch for turning off electronics anymore but why must I hold the power button for so damn long just to turn it off?  Turning this thing off is often a battle of wills between man and machine.  (*) After adding new songs to the player it's difficult to actually play them because they don't show up in the default playlist until you explicitly play them somehow. This is very annoying if you load some songs then go for a run because you'll find that you can't get those new songs to play without playing in the menu using a screen that's hard to read in the sunlight while moving.  (*) FF and REV are poorly implemented  (*) Connect the player to the PC using the USB drive and then remove it.  The device will immediately begin playing audio!  After removing the device from the USB port it should turn itself off.  What's strange is that this automatic playback function is what should happen when you manually turn on the player, but when you do that it goes into the language select menu.  So not only does removing it from the PC turn it on, it turns it on in a way that's better than the actual on button!   I suppose I could read the manual to see if any of these annoyances can be avoided, but a device like this should be intuitive and self-explanatory.

<Title>Terrible, just terrible!
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased my Sansa Express 1 GB six months ago. I am sending the unit back for the third time. They just keep dying and dying and dying. The first unit was the best - it worked for almost six weeks. Initial problems with unit number one were related to software/firmware upgrades but by the sixth week it just quit working. This unit was not abused - it probably had a total of 20 hours actual playing time.   Sansa support is relatively good but don't call them. When I first had problems I would call and talk to a tech but there was a significant language barrior. In one instance, the tech kept telling me to 'press the silver bullet...., press the silver bullet...' After a minute or two, I realized he was talking about the small, square metallic looking button on the front of the unit. After that, I strictly communicated by written message.   Customer support is good but turnaround times are slow. First you have to get them to agree to a replacement. Then you have to get a RMA, ship the old unit back before they send a replacement unit. All together I've managed to use my Sansa Express (and replacements), maybe, 30 hours in six months. - If someone gives you a Sansa Express it is because they hate you. 'nuff said.

<Title>Doesn't fit me
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this for a few months and while it works as advertised, I haven't been overly happy with it. I've tried it with both XP and OSX and can't get it to work correctly with either. It won't unmount from either system and I haven't been able to get the firmware updater to run. However,  I haven't lost any data by pulling it out from the USB -- yet. I listen to mostly OTR shows, usually 15 - 30 minutes long and 5-8MB in size. I listen to a show and then delete it - however, the Sansa doesn't allow any way to delete except when plugged into a computer.   And maybe it's my age, (however a good design should work for everyone) but I've never been able to figure out exactly how the buttons work. Sometimes it will fastforward through a selection and the next time it seems to skip to the next selection. In addition, the Sansa seems to be of its own mind when organizing OTR files. Artist and album come from some metadata tag that I haven't discovered yet.  I've had no problems with charging and use a cheap set of earphones - OTRs aren't known for hi-fidelity, so I don't lose anything there. Putting the lanyard clip on the cap is almost criminally stupid. If you wear it around your neck, you're going to save the $1 cap and lose the $40 player when it gets loose.  All I want is a cheap player, 1GB or less, AAA powered, that will let me listen to long-playing, low-memory intensive files one-at-a-time. I don't need FM, voice recording, fancy graphics, multi-colored screens or rechargeable batteries that can't be replaced.

<Title>Great MP3 Player!
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 Player is really, really nice.  It is sleek, small, and the sound is amazing!  It holds around 250 songs.  You can record you voice!  The voice recording feature is actually really nice and it doesn't sound scratchy like some do. It can also play FM Radio that it picks up well off the air.  It is very easy to download songs on to it also.  Downloading is extreamly fast, it takes anywhere from two seconds through fifteen seconds to download a song.  It also fits in your pocket perfectly.  Here is what I rate for different things.     Sleekness: 5 Stars  Size: 4 1/2 Stars Shape: 5 Stars Sound: 5 Stars Radio pickup: 4 1/2 Stars  Over all: 5 Stars   If you are looking for an inexpensive, sleek, small MP3 player that sounds great, then this is for you!

<Title>Why Im VERY HAPPY with my Sansa Express
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really enjoy the express because it's a direct connection. I used to have the original apple shuffle which was also "express" in that you didn't need a dock or cable. Thats why I liked it, however it didn't have FM or expansion capabilities and was pretty bare bones. On the bright side, the original shuffle did have good sound unlike the 2nd iteration. So basically I was looking for a direct connection player without wires and for whatever reason Apple's new shuffle was not direct connection so it wasn't a candidate. I heard about the sansa express and took a chance on it because it was direct like my old shuffle which was very convenient. The sandisk sansa express has exceeded my expectations and to be honest I use it more than my other players now. Its like the original direct usb connection shuffle but not bare bones. I couldnt be happier to have a first generation shuffle like player WITH a screen and FM. No wires, no hassle and now that I use yahoo for podcasts, no more itunes. Itunes took forever to recognize my old shuffle for some reason so that nightmare is over. Don't get me wrong, I still like some Apple players like the video iPod, but back to sansa express: The sansa express also can be expanded so for few bucks more, you have a bigger capacity player thanks to the SD card slot and the cheap sandisk micro cards. So to summarize, its easy to use, can be affordably expanded to hold more songs or books etc., has really great sound quality, has FM and a sensible menu system, and is relatively inexpensive. Next time you get out all your wires with your Mp3 player, think about just plugging it in directly to the usb slot on the computer and filling it up in seconds... trust me, its a lot nicer to have a direct connection...very convenient for travel and working out or anytime,  because really, who wants the hassle of cords ?  Added: I wanted to add that the FM reception is excellent and that the player looks great and is designed with high quality components and casing. IMO, this is by far the best small sized mp3 player available today for the money.

<Title>Sleek, slim, but awful shuffle support
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Sansa Express last week as I was looking for a very compact flash-based music player with a screen. The Sansa Express was the only one that really fit the bill.  I'm very happy with the size and storage capacity. I'm supremely annoyed by the shuffle support. One of the other reviewers mentioned it as well, but it's worth repeating: the Shuffle functionality is terrible. If you play all music and turn shuffle on, you'll wind up hearing the same subset of songs over and over again. I have 1GB of music loaded up, but keep getting the same 15-20 songs played. As far as I can tell it has something to do with powering off the unit in the middle of the playlist. When powered on it doesn't pick up where it left off: rather, it goes back to an earlier portion of the song list.  It's a shame, because otherwise it would be such a great player :(

<Title>Linux-compatible, inexpensive, expandable, but no ogg...
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay.    I bought this because it was inexpensive, had lots of features including a nice display, was small, and would work for travel without lugging cables.  I believe the sound is very acceptable and I have no problem with the included headphones.  I wish it supported ogg, but it does work without any difficulty on Ubuntu Linux.  Note that if you go to delete files from the player under Ubuntu (and perhaps under any Linux distro) it will actually create a hidden file on the player called ".trash-" rather than immediately destroying the file.  So you have to click on View-Show Hidden Files to see it next to the Music directory.  If you delete that directory, it will really go away freeing up space on your player.  As for fingerprints, sure, they can be seen, but I personally don't find them a problem.    A good player so far.

<Title>Very disappointed
<Date>Sat May 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a below average MP3 player.  The radio reception is poor, as is the sound quality.  Note that you can NOT delete files directly from the Sansa Express!  You must first connect it to a computer's USB port to delete any files.  I confirmed this with the online instruction booklet that curiously does not come with the device.  This means that if you record voice or audio on the road and you're not near a computer, once the device is full, that's it -- no more recording because you can't delete anything from the player itself.  Also, note that the player only recharges when it's attached to a USB port.  It takes about 2 hours to recharge (and about half that to discharge), which means that your computer has to be powered up and running for the time it takes to recharge!    The player will not recharge when plugged into a USB port if the computer is shut down or in sleep mode.  This is a waste of time and certainly not an environmentally friendly way of recharging.  There are so many other good MP3 players out there, in my opinion, this one is a curiosity and no more.

<Title>I previously loved this player but a few days later....
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sorry, the menu button on the player jammed after only 4-5 days of very occasional use! The style and functionality of this player is awesome but the buttons on it are tacky and wear out way to fast! As much as I want to keep or exchange it, I'm returning it and sticking to my screenless 2nd gen shuffle. The buttons on that feel much better and I guess I don't really need a screen because those usually distract me from actually listening to a song instead of constantly picking one to listen to!

<Title>I've gone through 2 of these
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Beware of this player!  I loved this thing until it broke (wouldn't power on).  I loved the size, the fact that it had a full-on USB connection, the PM tuner.  So, I returned it and bought another... mistake!  My second one lasted 2 days.  I didn't abuse it or anything, so I can't help but think it must be an issue with the Sansa Express product line (or perhaps a bad batch?)  Someone else mentioned that you can "overchage the unit" on their review.  This sounds bizarre.  I can't imagine that this can be true, but either way, this unit is not the one for me.  I'm returning the second and going with something else...

<Title>Terrible for podcasts; lousy lousy firmware.
<Date>Fri May 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This might be a decent product for listening to a few songs, but it's very difficult to listen to podcasts on this device. The hardware is fine, but the software is just terrible and includes a buggy USB implementation that isn't fully compatible with Macs.  Starting with the last point, the player does mount as a normal USB mass storage device and you can easily copy files (and whole directory hierarchies) to it. When you try to unmount the drive, however, it disappears for a moment and then immediately re-mounts. Under MacOS X there's doesn't seem to be any way (other then clever timing) to remove the drive without getting a warning from the operating system.  Add to this the fact that the only firmware updater available from Sansa is an .exe file that only runs on Windows machines, and it becomes clear that this player is only intended for Windows users. Mac and Linux types should look elsewhere.  The first annoyance in actual usage is that this player only allows you to navigate using its own internal database (which it appears to re-build from ID3 tags every time the player is turned on). You can browse by artist and album and song name, which might be all right for music (assuming all your songs are tagged correctly), but fails miserably on most of the podcasts which use these fields in idiosyncratic ways. Organizing your files into directories (grouped by podcast subscription, for example) doesn't work, because the software doesn't let you navigate the file hierarchy on the drive: it's their database or nothing.  Further, even if your files are tagged in the way the player expects (such that one podcast subscription corresponds with a single artist or album) the order that files are played appears to be arbitrary. Having files named such that episode file names sort in chronological order doesn't help at all: again; the player insists on playing files its own way. If you have five days of news updates, there's no way to listen to them in order.  The player also fails to save any state at all when it is turned off; if you're twenty minutes into a sixty minute podcast you'll lose your place. (In fact, you'll probably entirely forget which file you were listening to.) Even if you remember exactly what file you were listening to, are able to find it in the player's crazy database, and also remember exactly how far into it you were, you'll have a hard time getting to that spot. The player's fast-forward feature operates at barely five or ten times real speed. To get twenty minues into a podcast you'll be left holding the fast-forward button down (while hearing absolutely nothing) for at least two minutes. The player is hopeless for listening to long podcasts in small chunks.  Of course, all the intelligent design that has made products like the iPod so popular are missing. There's a power button, a stop button, and a pause button. How do you know which one to choose? I have no idea. There's a button which a picture of a few lines on it, there's a central "action" button, and there's a "menu" button. Which one do you use to browse the player to look for the next thing to listen to without stopping the current track playing? It's not at all intuitive. Not that I found any feature for "queueing" tracks to play in the current playlist, anyway.  For me at least, this player was a complete waste of money.  Sandisk---please just open-source your firmware and let us fix your lousy product for you.

<Title>Won't power on anymore!
<Date>Fri May 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned this player for about 2-3 weeks and have been generally very happy with it...  Until today that is...  Like some other have reported my player will no longer power on.  In my case it is not due to overcharging, I was using the player and it was almost fully charged.  Just in case I just tried to charge it, but it won't even begin to charge.  The problem happened when I chose a song to play, instead of the song starting to play normally it suddenly started playing the music funny (like super fast-forward) then it powered off and won't turn back on.    I didn't buy a protection plan so I guess I am going to have to contact Sandisk for support.  I didn't see anything on their website about this issue.  Before this problem I would have rated this player with 4 stars

When it comes to MP3 software, I have little faith, the iRiver H10 that I own occassionally freezes while the computer interface is problematic. This Sandisk product bypasses a computer interface, which is good, but the thing died with no response. The computer detects it via the UBS, but the thing itself can't be turn on.  The only consolation is that tech support is friendly and helpful, and provided some instructions to bring it back online, now I'll try to resuscitated the little gadget.

<Title>My Favorite Portable Player
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I own 3 iPods but the Sansa express remains my favorite portable player !  I use the iPods for separate uses (the iPod Touch as a portable video player, the 3rd Gen Nano for transporting iTunes video to my HD TV, and a 5th Gen iPod for my car's mp3 player)  But for just walking about, or at the office, I just use the Sansa Express. It really is a simple and effective ultraportable MP3, FM radio and recorder. The fact that you can record FM radio, AND voice recording just seals the deal!  I have had the Sansa Express for about 8 months, and while I have had the database scramble on me a few times (easily remedied) and once had the entire thing just go lifeless (a hard reset brought it back to life with nothing lost), the Sansa has been a carefree purchase. It really is just amazing how well, and how versatile this little jewel is! And for such a small price.  I have since bought a Sansa for my brother, and he really enjoys it too.  A no-brainer purchase. No Regrets.

<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>ive bought alot of mp3 players in my day. most ive had for years and buy new ones just because they look nicer. this is by far the worst one ever. it lasted about 3 months with very little use (less than once a week). I put songs on it when i first got it and it worked ok. it doesnt save changes (shuffle, equilizer etc) so you have to adjust the settings every time you turn it on. The shuffle is a horrible feature anyway. unless you change your songs every time you listen to it youll hear the same list in the same order repeating alot of songs. sometimes twice in a row! so 3 months of that aggrivation and i updated my song list just to have it freeze up and i havent gotten it to turn on since. If you need a jump drive style mp3 player i reccomend coby. they have some pretty sturdy players. i have one that melted in my car and still works fine

<Title>Absolutely sick at this price!
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know if some people are reviewing the same device that I've been using and loving for a few days now... but I have to say that this thing is awesome for the price you pay. Add in a microSD ($10 - $30) and make it a 2gb/3gb player easily.  I don't have problems with it dying, as when I got it, I updated the firmware immediately (I suggest everyone to do so), and am running Windows Vista HP 32bit (It even shows battery charge in Windows!). So if your player is dying, it may be an earlier firmware fault that has been fixed, or maybe not, but at this point, its been great.  The sound quality is excellent, this is coming from an owner of multipe Etymotics (ER-4P) and SHures (E3s), as well as Headbanger Earsubs, cheaper Sennheiser earbuds, some Creative ones that came free, big labtecs etc.. Well you get the picture. The equalizer function works well, and non equalized sounds best with the good headphones.   The main pros this player has:  -USB plug & play mass storage!! No extra wires, no mess. It transfers and charges all in one. I can't understand people who are saying your computer "has" to be on to charge it... (Um, hello all Ipod owners).  -Small but has a OLED display. Clear enough to find your songs and choose playlists, that's enough for me.  - Slick looking, great controls, very intuitive. If you don't think these controls are intuitive, um... well you can't teach intuition at school perhaps... The power button returns you to the main menu, as well as powering on/off. There are dedicated volume controls, and a HOLD switch. The center button does the work, while the selecting, while the left/right seeks, and the bottom button goes to your playlist/settings. Can it possibly be any more self explanatory?  - 15 hour battery life. This is overexaggerated but possible if you leave it playing and don't touch it.  Some CONS:  -The microSD card sticks out a tiny bit! Upon immediate inspection it seems prone to getting pushed and ejected. I haven't had it happen yet but I really am not surprised if it will eventually, especially if you put your player in your pocket and not wear it w/ lanyard.  -The lanyard connector is on the cap itself. Now it does snap in QUITE tightly and won't come off without a LOT of excessive force. Granted, it is a tradeoff, between easily losing the cap if it was on the player itself or having it on the cap w/ lanyard but run the risk of pulling it out. The ideal solution that failed to be implemented would have been a built in cap, or retractable USB plug.  -Screen/display will fingerprint like crazy. Just a part of the material I guess.

<Title>just right...mostly
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>when i saw the first annoucement for the sansa express, i thought someone read my mind for all the features i wanted. after i got it, i was very happy with it. i had the same problem some other users had with it suddenly powering off and i wasn't able to power it back on. i even called tech support and eventually tried to get a replacement for it. then, i had a hunch and decided to check the manual again...that's where i discovered the "hard reset" function (hold down the volume up and select buttons). true to form, it was reset and powered on...now i'm going to have to send back the replacement, haha. the sound quality is pretty good (the ear buds it comes with suck, but that was expected). also creating playlists is a bit difficult, but the interface is pretty intuitive so not much getting used to required. oh and the little monster graphic is kinda cute:-P.

<Title>Great for the Money!
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Love it a lot.  Only things that could have made it better for me: 1. lanyard connection on main body instead of cap. 2. play music while plugged into USB port 3. pehaps bigger buttons, but ok. 4. On/Off button should be seperate from menu button (dual use currently) 5. would like a clip instead of lanyard if possible. 6. Need to be able to delete songs from device instead of just PC only.  Example.  You might record a file from FM or mic. but you have to delete them from a PC only (atleast I have not seen it yet in the menus).  All in all, I am very pleased with the sound quality and happy with my purchase.  FM reception can sometimes get staticy, but for the most part, it is probably in line with all other portable FM devices I have used.  I really love the ability to add micro SD cards to expand storage room.  I tried it in windows media 11 and could add songs to either the device or the expanded memory and it worked perfectly.  Copies songs very quickly using USB 2.0.  No lockups or hangs (I love the auto firmware updater whenver I plug it into my PC, it looks for latest firmware).  I'm hoping for song delete ability in the future from the device menu.  Volume buttons are great and work very good (plenty of range).  Equalizer for Pop setting is good for me.  This is a great deal for the price point.  It even handles audio books.  Highly recommended as I have bought two of them.

<Title>Buyer beware
<Date>Sun Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just plugged in my new Sansa Express, and immediately my hard drive crashed and now appears to be damaged beyond repair.  (I am running PC Doctor now.)  The computer in question is a ThinkPad X60s which has run flawlessly now for 4 months.  It seems unlikely that the Sansa is the culprit, but as I say the crash came within seconds after I plugged it in.  Thought you should know.

<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As others have indicated, this seemed like a great little MP3 player until it wouldn't turn on a week after I got it. Other annoyances include the inability to delete tracks or recordings without being hooked up to a computer, and one music-listening session where all the music would be garbled until you hit the back button to start the songs over. Not sure if new firmware would have fixed the latter problems, but I don't want to spend my time hunting down updated firmware for a $60 device.

<Content>I really liked this little DAP, especially the OLED display and microSD slot. It did tend to lock up sometimes. Plugging it into a USB port on my computer always brought it back to life. The other day it suddenly stopped playing music and powered off by itself. I turned it back on and it got halfway through "refreshing database" and turned off. I tried the USB trick and hard resetting but alas, she was gone for good. Since it was on the last day of the 30 day BB return policy I brought it back for a refund.

<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the sansa less than a month ago and was really happy with the value. For its price, it really is a great player. But it only lasted a month. Then it just stopped turning on/charging. I should be able to exchange it, but still, this was very disappointing. When it did work, it worked relatively well, but there were some noticeable software errors, such as songs repeating despite being on shuffle and some songs simply not playing or showing up in the library.

<Content>My Sansa Express lost its power within a few days of taking it out of the box, even though I charged it as instructed.  The techie at Sandisk said it was defective and so I could exchange it.   With my new player, I cannot get the firmware loaded or get the player to show as an E: drive.  After reading the recent comments above, I've decided to return it to the store before my 30 days expire.  What a shame!  I REALLY  wanted to like this product and avoid the iPod craze.

<Title>Good Product
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good product. That's a fact. As of right now though mine isn't working but I think the problem is being caused by Windows Vista's MTP driver. The Express works on all other computer systems. So, if you own Windows Vista you should think twice before purchasing this.   As an mp3 player I think it does well. It's inexpensive, looks reasonably attractive, and is pretty easy to use. The buttons are a little too small, battery life is good but not exactly as good as advertised and the firmware isn't that great. I would suggest this player over any other low capacity mp3 player though. Just not with Windows Vista.

<Title>Easy to use media audio player
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is one of the easiest to use audio media player.  All you do is simply plug this into one of your USB ports and you use it as any other USB flash drives, click and drag your songs into the file folders and that's all there is to it!  My only gripe (which I deducted a star) is the control navigation which could have been implemented a lot better, but other than that the price is great and it is the same size as a USB flash drive making it compact to fit any pocket (just remember to not lose it or misplace it as if it were a flash drive).  Note: You can also use this as a USB flash drive but remember the limit is only around 1 GB

<Title>Buy the Sansa Clip instead
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned both, but I had the Sansa Express for about two months before I lost it, along with a pair of good earbuds, when the player disconnected from the cap and lanyard. I had been careful to put the player in a safe place when I left the art studio or was on the move, but this one time I was distracted, and that was all it took.  The Clip, on the other hand, has no parts to lose.   For those of us who tend to be a little bit absent-minded, a lanyard is a necessity, and we might as well throw our money down the toilet as buy the Sansa Express.

<Title>Stands out above the rest
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 1GB Sansa Express for my wife for Christmas. My wife wanted an mp3 player for the gym. The requirements were these:  - had to be small and light with the ability to fit in a pocket - had to have an FM tuner for the video screens at the gym - had to be able to play a variety of audio formats without additional software  I can say that the Sansa Express is just the ticket. You don't need any additional software other than what is already on Windows XP and Vista. The device is about as long as a USB jump drive, but a bit thicker. It plugs into any USB port, even the slower 1.0 USB ports (if you happen to have an older computer). When you plug it in, Windows recognizes the player without fuss. Now here is where most people get themselves into trouble. They just start dragging and dropping, not really understanding how the Sansa Express works. That's a sure way to lock the thing up and create frustrations.  The first thing I did was let the device charge for 2 hours. At that point the battery meter indicated a full charge status. I then used the Sansa screen menu to "format" the device. Finally, I went to the Sansa website and got the latest firmware for the device. Firmware updates are incredibly easy, and the Sansa website has a forum with many beginner and advanced participants. A short read of the forums, and you'll learn some great tricks. In fact, I would say that reading the forums on the Sansa website will give you a much better understanding than the included manual, which is not that great.  The sound quality on this device is astounding. Playback of a recording on the Sansa Express is audibly superior to that same recording on an iPod Nano 1st generation. You can also choose from some equalizer presets and even create your own custom equalizer setting. I showed my wife how to use Windows Media Player (already installed with Windows products) to one-click sync music to her new Sansa. Windows Media Player lets you create playlists and shuffle as you sync, and that's quite handy. FM reception is excellent and sound quality in that mode is also nice.  All in all, the Sansa Express is a great media player. It supports many more formats than the iPod, manages power effectively, sounds great, and offers probably the best pricing of any media player on the market. If you need to add capacity later, you can always insert a micro SD card for even more capacity. Nice!

<Title>Mixed thoughts
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Cons: I bought this for my 8 year old and it is too complicated for her.  Sometimes for me, too! Audio books downloaded from the public library get inconveniently filed with songs (whereas books downloaded from paid sources get conveniently filed in audiobooks), the display goes off (to save battery power) way too quickly, the volume is not as high as I'd like it and rewinding can be onerous.  You really need to sit down and dig into the instructions before using it, a minus for impulsive,"open-the-box-and-use-it" types like me. Pros: It is small, cheap and it does the job.

<Title>Only Ipod Lovers think Its Bad
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Let me start off by saying that I do own a full sized Ipod and an a new late 2007 Ipod Nano and 2nd edition Ipod Nano. Let me tell you why you should choose this unit instead.       This is a great MP3 Player. It has an easy to use menu system. You don't need ITunes or special software or firmware. I plug it into my Laptop Computer and click and drag the files onto the player. The laptop recognizes it as a portable HardDrive. The plug and play feature and size alone blows away any Ipod.       It has great sound quality. Don't let people say it does not. The sound quality is all in the speaker system you have hooked into it. I am running Skullcandy Ear Buds with 24k Gold Connector. They provide deep bass and sound is crystal clear.       The FM Tuner works great. Maybe not for you if you live out in the country, but for anyone near a decently sized city with radio stations, you will get them all just fine. I have used mine to pick up a radio station for a good 30 Mile Radius Outside of the city with NO drop off at all.       It takes additional memory cards just fine. I really don't see any of the complaints I have read on these reviews with my unit. I wonder if these people are reviewing the correct item.       You don't get any better build quality than this unit as well. I have dropped it countless times without leaving a scratch. I ran it through the clothes washer 2 weeks ago. By that night after letting it dry out, it was good as new and smelled nice as well!      Don't listen to the negative reviews. The ipod shuffle is useless because it has no screen. If you buy an Ipod, You are just paying to be "part of the crowd" Do yourself a favor and save a lot of money by buying this item.

<Title>Great little player to compliment my Zen W.
<Date>Mon Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was kind of upset that Creative was removing all of their FM recording capabilities off their players.  I don't record FM music stations (Duh it's an MP3 player) I DO however use this feature to record lectures that are broadcast over an FM frequency.  The quality is really good in comparison to my Zen Micro 8GB (sold now).  I would say my only drawback is that it saves the recordings as WAV. files.  A 45 min lecture is the equivelent to 336MB.  So on the 1GB player you don't get much room.  I did buy a 2GB Micro SD card for around $23.  This should resolve this issue.  I do really enjoy the built in microphone.  I use this to record my own lectures in my home to improve my own speaking quality.  I just thought this review might be helpful to anyone with the same buying prospectives as myself.  Finding players that record FM are pretty hard to find.(That record well and have decent quality anyhow) Great little flash player loaded up with features....Good buy for the money!

<Title>Functional and Inexpensive, but still good quality 
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player was exactly what I was looking for. A small mp3 player which doubled as a thumb drive (without AAA batteries). This player is very small, but works well for all that i needed. With the built in FM tuner as well as the equalizer this little device doesn't lack much. I could have gotten the Sansa e250 (nano-like player with a color screen) but I preferred the usb connection to a little "coolness". Plus this guy was cheaper than the other players. Battery life has also been very good. The earbuds that it comes with aren't cheap, but one would do well to purchase a set of silicone covered ones from walmart for $5-$15. Don't forget it's got expandable memory too so you can pop the card in your cell phone and  transfer pics or ringtones as well. I would say that the finger controls are a big tiny if you were to have fat hands, but other than that I don't see any drawbacks. The display is actually pretty sleek. It's got a smooth blue glow. It's not hard to see in the daytime either... just shield the screen with your hand and the sun won't make it too difficult to read the display. Some might think 1 gb isn't enough memory, but I didn't find it  restrictive.. but even so... expanable memory is so cheap now, there is no need to get a player with more internal memory. You can get a 1gb microSD card on here for less than $10. I only gave it 4 stars because I am a cheapskate and was hoping to get it for under $40 (It was $50 when i purchased it with free shipping)

<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned the Sansa Expresss for over a month and am quite happy with it. I bought it mainly to use with Audible Book downloads and it works seamlessly with Audible software. But I also have used it for music and just to store a file like a memory stick/flash drive. Sound quality is largely a function of the ear buds or headphones that are used with it. The ones that come with it are junk but better quality ones make the experience just fine. The screen is difficult to read in bright light and twice when I start it it was stuck on the opening screen.  I don't use a lanyard but attaching it to the USB cap end seems like a dumb design, even though the cap fits nice and snug, I'd be afraid it would fall off.But for the money? You can't beat it.

<Content>The unit is sleek, attractive, has a great sound. Easy to use - that is, if you can get it to work. The first unit I bought quit working after about 24 hours. Fully charged and loaded with music (that took me hours). So, I took it back to the store and got a replacement. Brought it home, charged it up for three or four hours. Spent another hour or so loading music into for my daughter. She loved it -- until it quit working about two days later. Same problem.  I can't find anything on the Sansa website that suggests how to fix the problem. It won't take a charge. It won't reset. It's just dead.  We'll start looking for another brand.

<Title>Shuffle problems? Read this review
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK, I'm copping out on a full review. My main purpose here is to tell you how to fix the Shuffle problem that I and many others have been experiencing. You won't find this in any Sansa docs, so here goes...  First you pick your music category (usally All, but you may pick a particular playlist or Album as well). Then you turn on the Repeat All feature. Then you turn on the Shuffle feature. You *must* do it in this order or it won't work.  After that you should get random shuffling without any repeats or "favorite" songs coming up over and over again. This trick worked for me and I hope it works for you as well. I returned an Express then spent a lot of frustrating time figuring this out when the second one had the same behavior. Sansa deserves a real bashing for this oversight in documentation but otherwise their player is top-notch.

<Title>iPod shuffle killer
<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What do you get when you take an iPod shuffle, a FM radio, a digital voice recorder and add in a small screen AND reduce the price?  You get the Sansa Express.  This flash-based MP3 player is by far the best bang for your buck.  The screen is small, but gives you all the detail you don't get with an iPod shuffle.  It comes with 1gb of flash memory, but is expandable with a microSD slot which supports the new SDHC standard- allowing you to expand its memory by another 4gb currently.  It is possible to buy several and be able to swap them around and end up with more storage than a full-size iPod, for a lower price.  If there are downsides- they would be that it is not independently rechargeable.  You have to plug it in to your computer's USB port to recharge.  But it's battery does last for 14 hours (not a great number, but long enough for most people).  Another downside is that included ear buds.  They're crappy.  But, what else do you expect?  Drop a few bucks on a real nice pair and you won't regret it.

<Title>Disappointed and frustrated
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Sansa Express to replace a Creative MuVo that had a worn-out play button after one year of heavy use (and flawless performance).  The features I liked (and still like) about the Sansa Express were its 1) small size, 2) micro SD expandability to 3 GB, 3) FM recorder, and 4) ability to plug, sync and charge directly in a USB port.  I didn't care about seeing pictures, album art, etc. on a tiny screen.  Soon after I started using the device, however, performance problems became more than a nuisance.  The biggest problem is that the device frequently freezes for no apparent reason when the controls are used.  The only way to restore it to responsiveness is to perform a cold re-set of the device.  This loses your playing "place" and also zaps all your FM pre-sets.  Also, the re-set procedure will only work if you first eject the micro SD card, and then it must be re-inserted afterwards (at which point the contents of the card are re-indexed which in itself takes an inconvenient amount of time).  I downloaded the most recent firmware for the device on 7/4/2007, and it failed to correct this problem.  I have since learned that the surprise freeze feature is not uncommon with this device.  Other problems seem to be present by design.  For example, the fully-seated micro SD card protrudes about 1mm beyond the body of the device.  The SD card will occasionally eject accidentally when another object taps it and triggers the ejection spring.  So far I have not lost a card, but it is only a matter of time.  The pause feature is annoying, in that the paused device completely shuts down after about 15 seconds, losing its place in the file you were listening to and returning to the beginning.  This is not a problem when you are in the middle of a 3-minute song, but it is a big problem when you are 45 minutes into a 1-hour podcast.  I was forewarned about the display's visibility problems when one is outdoors, so I can't complain too harshly about that, except to say that it was even worse than I expected.  The display is completely invisible in all but the most shaded outdoor areas.  All in all, the device has been a disappointment.  Even with the design flaws, I would have recommended it were it not for the surprise freeze feature.  Because of that feature, however, I must recommend that the buyer look elsewhere for a flash .mp3 player with similar features.

<Title>An enjoyable MP3 player
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I decided to buy an MP3 player, I did a lot of research on the Internet.  I had no previous experience with a player, but knew I wanted quality without paying an arm and a leg.  The reviews of the Sansa Express convinced me to purchase it, and I have not been disappointed.  Being elderly and nontechnical minded, (I grew up in the radio age.), I had my son download a number of my CD's on to the player, using XP Home.  He was able to do this without difficulty and quickly.  I am now thoroughly enjoying the player, even with the earbuds.  It's compact size and light weight are perfect for when I am using the treadmill.  I like my player so much, that I recently ordered another one as a birthday gift for my son.

<Title>Mostly Excellent
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using my Sansa 1GB for a couple of months now with no problems.  I wanted something reliable and inexpensive with reasonable space, good battery life, light weight, and a working radio.  I got precisely what I wanted.  If that list is close to what you want, I think you'll be happy, too.  PROS:  This product is very economical without any substantial sacrifice in value.    It charges quickly and stays charged.    It is very small and easy to handle.    The use of windows explorer to manage its music is, I think, superior to the general irritation of using Itunes.  If you need one, a good CD ripping program to use is CDex which you can find for free on download.com.  It records voice, and it records radio broadcasts.  The sound is great.  I purchased a $30 pair of Creative earbuds along with it, and I have no complaints.  The display is pretty and blue.  The brightness can be increased at need.  CONS: The selector isn't perfect.  It's said that the buttons are small and occasionally hard to use - this is true, but it only amounts to a minor irritation.  Even then, only an occasional one.  The menus aren't perfect.  The Ipod has a slightly more intuivitve layout.  I don't think I had to spend any time learning how to use my Ipod when I bought it, but this required more effort.  Which is to say, some effort as opposed to none.  The functionality is sometimes weird.  For instance, if you select Play All, it will play all the songs in alphabetical order, beginning with numbers and special characters first.  If you want to play all on a shuffle, you have to first turn shuffle on.  To me, the functions of shuffle and play all are tied together.  One doesn't ever need to happen without the other.  What's more, if you try to listen to an album without turning shuffle feature off, it will shuffle that album's songs.  This would be less of an irritation if the selector were as easy to use as, say, the Ipod wheel, but clicking through numerous options can sometimes be tedious on the Sansa.  There isn't a good armband for use with the Sansa, but it's so tiny, why do you need one?  I just put it in my pocket at the gym and that works fine.  The radio, though it does work reasonably well, will fuzz out in many buildings.  If you need 100% coverage or close, look elsewhere.  It works for my trips to and from work though, and that's all I need.  Finally, the display: I said it was good and it is, EXCEPT in direct bright sunlight.  Then it can be nearly invisible.

<Title>Excellent!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this mp3 player very much.  I love the total plug & play (no drivers at all) and drag and drop operation.  Battery life is very good, I have done 13 hours nonstop no problem.  No cord to lose or carry.  Sound quality is pretty good too.  I picked up an extra 2gb micro sd card here on Amazon for $15 (get Sandisk, 3rd party cards won't work).  The included headphones are actually better than the Sony earbuds I was using!  The only things I don't like are pretty nit-picky... the usb cap looks like it could get lost easily.  The FM tuner is pretty strong at home, but next to useless at work indoors... I expected as much.  FM tuner operation can be a little slow until you have your presets set.  But I love the option of the FM tuner for football, etc.  Something oddball worth mentioning... I had to plug this player into my laptop to charge it up a little before my desktop computer would recognize it.  Strange, but since then it's never been an issue.  For the price this is an awesome product for those looking for a no-nonsense (non ipod) player.

<Title>Firmware Update Needed in order to See Menu
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After charging it, I was only getting the voice recording menu and no other options.  It turned out that I had to load the firmware onto the device.  This link, http://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.aspx?CatID=1376  allows you to download updater software for the express.  Once this software is installed on your pc, and you plug in your sandisk express, then it will go out and find the correct firmware, and load it onto the player.  After that the menu finally showed up.  This firmware wasn't on the CD that came with the device.

<Title>Great mp3 Player, and customer service
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD40N8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1744394-5435258">Sandisk Sansa Express 1 GB MP3 Player</a> Ok, I bought this mp3 player back in April of this year (2007) and it worked great until the begining of September when all of the sudden it would not start up, I contacted SanDisk tech support and they were very helpful, they asked that I send it to them (postage paid by them) and they sent me a brand new one. So far it has been working great.   PROS: 1: it is easy to access the song you want 2: it lookes great and has a great lcd screen. 3: it's got a slot for a microsd card so that you can upgrade the memory up to 3 gb. 4: it it easy to recharge as long as you can access a computer 5: the sound quality is wonderful. 6: You can plug it in directly to your computer via USB, no extra cord needed  CONS: not that many!.1: The top surface scratches easily and is VERY fingerprint prone. I recommend that you get a cover/skin to go with it. 2: I don't think the firmware that comes with it is that good so you should go to the website and download the firmware updater to get the latest version of firmware.  If you are looking for a high quality, small, sleek, low cost mp3 player with great customer service and do not need to play video or look at photos this is the one for you.

<Title>Excellent for Audible stories
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this product to listen to Audible books in the car. It charges quickly with the USB connection, and is easy to use  - it remembers the position in the book from one session to the next. The only annoying thing about it is that the fast forward and rewind seems to be very erratic - sometimes jumping several minutes with a small press of the rewind key. Other than that - perfect for the job.

<Title>Works on Mac OSX 10.4.X
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Amazon Sandisk Sansa Express  I am a Mac user and I wanted a small 1-2gb MP3 player and obviously the shuffle was my first choice. I have had iPods before but I was looking for a cheaper alternative. I came across the Sansa Express and it was cheaper and had FM radio capabilities. And after reading good reviews I got one. I am pleasantly happy with my choice. I use OSX 10.4 and this has worked fine for what it is.  It is small, about the size of a pack of gum. The front is a smooth black finish and looks nice. There is a cap on the USB connection and the cap snaps tight. I wish it was a sliding USB so I don't lose the cap, but am not afraid of it falling off. Headphones and a laynard are provided too, both feel cheap though especially the laynard.  The Sansa Express itself is nice looking but the controls are awkwardly placed on the unit. Especially the Menu button which is the default "back" button.  The FM tuner, which I use more than I thought I would sounds good, there are 10 presets you can program. And remember this is FM with no AM available. The sound is decent, and it seems to be loud, I never have to turn it higher than a "40%" on volume at work. You won't be hearing deep thick bass but it's decent.  On a Mac you just load it into your USB port to charge and also to drag and drop folders of music onto its folder structure. It shows up as an "untitled" hard drive on your desktop and you drop your music into the "music" folder and that's it.  One little annoying thing is the shuffle always starts on track 1 of XXX and seems to be less random than other shuffle settings.  But the Sansa is cool because, of FM, charges via USB port, sounds good and  is a very affordable MP3 player. I am happy with my purchase. Cheers.

<Title>Next time I'll get a $19 disposable mp3 player
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>*** Update *** To use your device as a good old USB Mass Storage, go to Control Panel>System>Device Manager. Update the driver of the Sansa Express, and instead of MTP choose Mass Storage. Enjoy USB 2.0 transfer speeds and full control of any files you put in the device. *** End ***  All I want is drag and drop my mp3s without having to use a bloated 'Media Manager', like WMP11 and the like. I want to create my own playlists and no DRM. I want a letter drive. Well, not with this thing.  The device in itself is a wonder. You have 1Gb of storage, great sound quality (the headphones suck, though), FM receiver, voice recording, equalizer. To make a long story short, it beats the Shuffle flat out. Hence, the one-star rating.  Now for the software part: be afraid, VERY afraid! The USB interface is slow as hell, you CANNOT edit the ID Tags of your songs from within the internal memory and there is no way you can create your own .m3u playlists (or any other types by the way). The device connects as some bullcrap MTP mode, which means that it was designed specifically for Windows Media Player. Great!  Here it is people: choose from iTunes/iPod or Sandisk/Win. Now that's like choosing between pain and bigger pain.  So next time, I'm getting myself a $19 Taiwanese, free of everything, m3u-compatible player. And I'll switch to Linux.

<Title>Great Little Player
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player to record FM radio because I am going to a convention where they are broadcasting the program. I also bought a 2 GB microSD card. It works perfect, but with a few notes (in random order):  * The headset works as an antenna. If you are recording FM you need to make sure the headset is plugged in;  * You can only record on the internal (1 GB) memory, it does not make sense to expand the memory with microSD cards to record FM radio. Unfortunately I had to return the item for this reason and switched to the Sansa e260 4 GB. One minute of recording FM radio takes 7.5 MB of space (WAV only, no MP3 or WMA recording), so you can record about 2 hours;  * The headset is fine, but if you want to have serious bass you need to switch to an in-ear headset like the Sony Fontopia. They go in the ear canal, not just in your ear like ear buds. It is more comfortable too. But that is just a general tip, not just for this Sansa Express;  * For twice the cost of a Sansa Express you get a Sansa e260 4 GB, which has 4 times more memory, has a larger full-color display, also plays pictures and videos, 5 hours more battery power.

<Title>Could have been an iPod Shuffle killer, but poor firmware killed it.
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these last month and had a great time creating music directories on it (Best of the 80s), (Favorite Tunes) etc... I dragged and dropped my mp3s over with ease. No reason to launch an ISansa program or any other waste of space and time.   The OLED display was very bright and colorful.  A nice thing to see after using the iPod Shuffle with it's no frills while plastic shell for the last year.  Other improvements this had over the iPod is FM radio (and recording), voice recorder, OLED OSD as I mentioned, upgradeable by way of sdmicro cardslot, and best of all (I believe) Drag and drop ability!  Now the bad part.... The playback software (firmware) is awful. When I went to playback the songs I had dragged over I couldn't find a way to browse by folder! WHY NOT?! It only has the options to browse by artists, albums, genres, songs  It wouldn't have taken that much work to add "folder" to the list. This is probably the biggest flaw. Unless you have an immaculately tagged collection of MP3s your songs will show up as UNKNOWN.MP3... try sorting through 2GB worth of that. It's a pain!  I personally don't like to sort by albums, artist when I only have 1 or 2 songs within that area. It's a waste of time to play music this way. I prefer to sort my music in directories. They give you the freedom to drag them over like this, but not play them. It doesn't make sense.   The other big problem is that they don't have any support for .M3U files so you might as well throw your playlists out as well.    Another bug I noticed is that if you have the Sansa Express plugged into your USB and are running WinAmp it will give you a memory read error and shut WinAmp down.  I think at least some of this is fixable through firmware, but I doubt it will ever happen unless they make their firmware open sourced. If they ever left it up to the users to fix it could truly be an iPod killer.  -Matt

<Content>i thought this would be a refreshing product to purchase after hearing about how ipods tend to die alot..and for the price and cute color- mine is pink- it seemed like a great buy.  With the usb stick ending i didnt even have to deal with cables.  But the problem was that it is supposed to hold 500 songs wma format- and for some reason it would not take more than 110. I continually have emailed the sandisk customer service- the past 5 days and they keep telling me to download things- which haven't helped.  It's junk and i would not recommend purchasing inferior products like this one.  Total dissapointment.

<Content>So far the express has been working great.  I did have a few problems out of the box with it showing newly added songs, but that was only on the first day.  The interface is good, but took me a little while to learn.  Now I take it everywhere, listen in the car, at work, at home.  The radio reception is also fairly good, considering how small the device is.  In the end, having a 1g thumb drive that I can also listen to music on is very convenient.  It's a good product.

<Content>The Sandisk Sansa Express 1GB player has a great feature set for the price and is easy to use. BUT it is very poorly made. The first one I received from Amazon had the FM radio die within a week. I requested a replacement. The second unit lasted 4 weeks before dying completely right after it indicated that it was fully charged. Time for a refund.  I had seen complaints about defects in some reviews, but thought that I would not get a bad unit.  A key question to ask before you buy a Sansa Express is: Are you feeling lucky?

<Title>I love this item, but there are a few things to work on...
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sound quality is great, light weight, easy to use, but a few things to work on:  1) Drop the lanyard and instead include a case that has a belt clip on it.  2) This information applies to accessing the device from the PC-  If you want to have your files organized in folders, be sure to do it before you put the files on the device.  You can create a folder after the fact but then you can't drag and drop files into the folder you created (perhaps this is because my device is full, it thinks I am copy/pasting rather than cut/pasting, even though I choose cut/paste).  There have also been times when I try to remove a folder with music in it and I can delete the files in the folder but not the folder itself.  Once the folder is empty it can be deleted. 3)  The shuffle function doesn't work very well.  The device gets a "memory" for shuffled songs and when I turn the device off and then resume listening later on, it inevitably gets back on to same shuffle pattern If you turn shuffle off, go back to music, and then turn shuffle back on it clears it up, at least until you turn the device off and then back on again.  Thats a bit of a pain.  When I think of shuffle I think that it should be completely 100% at random at all times.

<Title>Tragically flawed
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product has two major flaws.  Flaw #1: Flimsy design.  Flaw #2: Poor customer support.  I bought the player about two months ago, and was fairly happy with it.  The fact that it can only be charged via USB was a bit irritating, and the interface was somewhat confusing at first, but it seemed like a good value for the money.  Compact, decent features, good capacity (MicroSD compatibility is handy) etc.    But it only lasted about two weeks of normal use (I didn't even drop it, or get it wet) before the menu button broke.  The menu button is the single most-used button, and it is made of thin, lightweight plastic supported by. . . well, clearly not supported by much at all.  Without it, the device is essentially worthless.  So, I thought I would email customer support, get a replacement through my 1-year included warranty, and see if I could get that one to last a little longer.  But Sandisk has a customer service system involving a complicated website "mailbox" system.  I wound up getting referred into their system, which is way more complicated and confusing than helpful, and they eventually "closed" my inquiry for no apparent reason.  When I sent another email asking that they reopen it, since I was still dissatisfied with my broken mp3 player.  No response.  The bottom line: This is a nice player, but the company cut a few too many corners on things like button durability and customer service.    Maybe you'll have a better time of it than I did, but I don't think the low price in any way counterbalances the hassle and disappointment this player has caused me.

<Title>Traded my shuffle for this great MP3 player.

<Content>And I like it sooo much better. Love the ability to record FM radio since I am a Tivo addict and was frustrated when I couldn't go back and listen to talk radio shows. Got my Mom and Dad (in their eighties) each one and they like it, too. I bought a USB plug-in charger for it on Ebay for $10 and never charge it on my computer anymore. I can also charge it when I travel which is often. The SD card expandability is terrific. I buy those on Ebay too with the Adapter so the micro SD card can become a full sized SD card. This way I can use it as an extra card for my camera as well. This product does it all.  Regarding the button issue: For $7 we bought the extended warranty at Best Buy. We had to return my Mom's for this issue but they simply handed her a new one. My Dad and I have had no problems with ours and I use mine daily.

<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the price, you really can't beat this MP3 player.  Cheaper than an iPod shuffle and with potential for 3 times the storage, PLUS an actual display and an FM tuner.  Great value.  I have no real complaints about this player after about 6 months of use.  Great battery life, easy to use, good sound.  The included earbuds look cheap and aren't all that comfortable, but they sound good.  I'm using this player with my Sennheiser CX300 earbuds and the result is awesome.  The FM tuner works fine, too.  My only beef with the player is that it only organizes music according to artist and album.  I have yet to figure out how to get it to play a compilation folder that I put together with different artists (i.e. a collection of driving songs or workout songs...).  As far as I can tell it doesn't support playlists.  Or maybe it does and I just haven't figured it out yet.  Overall - great sound, lots of storage space, FM tuner, tiny package.  Awesome.

<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player to hang around my neck while riding my bicycle. I liked the design, price, size, capacity, but it just kept shutting off. I thought maybe I was hitting a button inadvertantly, but even with the Hold switch on, it would randomly shut off. Turning it back on, everything would run fine again for a while.   After returning the first one from Amazon, I bought another one locally and it had the same problem.   I'm not one to bother taking the time to figure something like this out. Why should I when there are far more reliable options on the market. I'm using a Samsung T9 now and love it. It's a little larger, but great UI and included software. Much better. And it stays on.

<Title>Express Downloads
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everybody today has to be the first one to own a new MP3 player. Nevertheless, while it is convient, many owners may be a little misled into owning what would be the best in quality. While so many owners head toward the Ipod from Apple, it doesn't actually carry the best within price. Sandisk knows that feeling. They've made undoubtingly some of the highest-quality MP3 players out there that really thrive. They have done that well with the M230 series which has sold thousands of units. But now, all MP3 players are becoming more mandatory with those Lithium-Ion batteries that are rechargeable, and Sansa needing a new path.  The Sandisk Sansa Express is a very sleek and convient MP3 player that works like a charm. This 1 GB MP3 player can hold up to 500 songs in a heartbeat. This works very well with Windows Media in storing all your favorite songs that you can download from music services like Napster, Rhapsody which includes Best Buy's Real Music, and services that work through Microsoft's Play for sure services. There is one problem though, the battery life drains really fast through the rechargeable battery, unlike the earlier M230 series models that relied on a simple AAA battery. Also, you can't be able to play music you've downloaded through Apple Itunes here.    Still, despite a couple of flaws, Sandisk has made some really good MP3 players, and this is no acception. I absolutely recommend the Sansa Express because this MP3 player is one the most durable that you can get for your money, at an affordable price. There is no doubt about the quirks on this, Sandisk mades them well.  Price: B  Convience: B-  Setup: B  Overall: B 1/2-

<Title>Nice little thing
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first experience with an mp3 type of product. I find I'm not adept with handheld devices and multiple-function menus. Probably due to my general lack of tolerance for the process of getting there. That makes this little thing OK. I wanted small and inexpensive...I got both. It's small, so not real friendly to use with motorcycle gloves on. That's why I bought it, to use while riding. The small size is convenient, sound volume is good. It's a set-and-forget thing when riding. The FM tuner works too. And the necklace is convenient. The earplugs are bulky, sit on rather than in the ear. If I buy another MP3 type of thing, I'll probably get one a bit larger in physical size. The storage is fine, plenty of space for the type of music I listen to when riding: no vocals, active instrumentals. The price was good too. And the thing has a slot for an expansion disk. I'm pleased, but again, I'm not a gadget oriented person, want something simple/easy to use, and make no effort to keep up with my kids or their uber techo literate spouses or the grandkids.

<Title>Works just fine
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Update: I returned the first unit to Amazon when it wouldn't retain a charge after recharging (great replacement policy, Amazon!). The replacement worked for a few weeks before it exhibited the same problem, and now Amazon will no longer replace malfunctioning units:   "As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."  The reviewer who lamented the lack of a replaceable battery was right on the mark.  Original Review: Works as advertised. Good FM reception, good sound (with your choice of equalizers), syncs easily with Windows Media Player, compact. No complaints. Good value.

<Title>Very good little player
<Date>Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player for a few reasons.  I'll describe my feelings for each below:  USB connector This is a great idea that I wish more products used.  Just plug the critter into your computer and transfer your files.  The only problem I have with this (which I didn't know at the time I bought it) is that transferring files over requires the use of Windows Media Player.  While this isn't inherently a bad thing, I don't like being railed into doing things a certain way...especially when I don't do it that way already.  You CAN drag and drop files onto the unit via Windows Explorer, BUT they only go to the expansion memory, not the internal.  Not a huge problem, but annoying nonetheless.  Expandability It's fantastic to have a 1Gb player of this size that you can expand.  I fully plan to get a 2Gb mini-SD card soon and will continue upgrading to bigger sticks as they're available.  This feature alone is worth the price of admission.  FM Radio Living in Atlanta, it's required that we listen or watch the Braves' games during the summer.  Having an MP3 player that also has a radio was mandatory to me.  Now I can hang this little guy from a lanyard and listen to the Bravos while I cut the grass or walk around the house.  The player weighs basically nothing, so it's extremely nice to have around.  Voice recording I never thought this would be useful, yet I find myself leaving little reminders to myself all the time.  Grocery lists, reminders at work, honey-do lists, you name it.  Unfortunately, now I don't have any excuses for why I don't do things.  :)  The interface is a little clunky, but given the size of the unit and the screen, I think they did the best they could with what they had.  It's perfectly usable, but not the most efficient interface.  All in all, this is a great little unit.  I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone else.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the WMP requirement and the interface.  Otherwise, it's a stellar product!

<Title>The Best Mp3 to Go!!
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's been a month now since I received this thru mail so far no problem.  It's a good player and a must have while listening music at work or sing-a-long inside the restroom. Just plug this to the USB port to charge or transfer music using Microsoft Media Player. Sound quality is good I'm using WMA file format.  My only complaint was the price at Amazon they keep on changing. The day I've ordered this it was $47.99 after a week they lowered this to $38.97 I should have ordered a week later and as of today their price is $46.99 I was planning to return this but they will charge me shipping & Handling. I have no choice but to keep this and enjoy music!!

<Title>Handy little device not without its hiccups
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been looking for an MP3 player that fit these criteria: -USB 'thumb-drive-like' direct connection -Plays FM Radio -Reliable quality and support -No touch screen or touch controls -Has standard headphone jack -Has a screen to see what track is playing -Had a clip to hold onto clothing  Well I hit five out of seven on this one.  I am on my second one now.  The first one DIED mid-use.  Screen went black, and it would not respond to button presses or USB connection.  Had to exchange it for a new one.  It loses a star for being unreliable.  It could really use a clip like the iPod Shuffle or the Coby Clip mp3 player.  It's the size of a usb thumb drive and is very light; it loses a star for missing this easy piece of attachment.  Other than that, the audio quality is great for such a small device.  I love the little screen on it, and the buttons are all well placed.  The design of the whole thing is pretty nice, but the underside is not completely flat which bothers the designer in me.  Navigating the menus with the limited buttons is a bit tricky at first but once you get used to it, it's pretty easy.  It's all worked around getting the music to your ears as quickly as possible which is nice.  So, bottom line is, for $46 it's a decent deal for me.  I got it for working out with and it does that job nicely.  I only wish they made it with a clip or at least an armband accessory.

<Title>Easy to Train
<Date>Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Being of middle age, I'm at the point where I hate new gadgets because it means learning how yet another thing works!  So of course, the first thing I did was accidentally set the Sansa to have menus in Italian (or some such).  Fortunately this is a very easy gadget to train and I quickly figured out how to set it back to English, download music and, the reason I bought it, download Audible books.  I really like the locking device, you set the volume and the settings where you want them, set the lock, tuck it under your shirt or into your pocket and you have hands free entertainment while doing other things.  The screen is easy to read and the buttons are not too small for hands that aren't as agile as they once were.  If this is your first venture into "IPOD-Land", as it was for me, I highly recommend the Sansa.

<Title>Deal killer - Proprietary built-in non-replaceable battery
<Date>Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was keenly interested in this player because of the microSD expansion capabilities, nevertheless that feature is outweighed by the proprietary built-in non-replaceable battery. A AAA battery would be far better since spares can be carried and the unit's life isn't tied to the rechargeable battery system, the achilles heel of so much equipment. I made the mistake of buying a different mp3 player with a built-in rechargable...has the battery life of...well a dead battery. How much equipment do you own from tools to toothbrushes that has been been rendered useless by the death of a built in rechargable battery system? If the same equipment used standard AA or AAA rechargables, all you have to do is get new batteries and you could buy replacment batteries cheaply anywhere.

<Title>Nice MP3 player/FM tuner/flash drive
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a tiny MP3 Player with a good FM tuner because my smartphone will only play internet radio using bandwidth, and its MP3 player keeps skipping. The Sansa Express has a great FM tuner. The MP3 player is easy to use, works well, and the interface is intuitive. It has a nice graphic equalizer. I love that I can plug it into my computer's USB port to download MP3 files, and can use it as a flash drive too. With a 2GB microSD card, I have more than enough room for my music and files. And it's so small that it easily fits inside the case that came with my favorite earbuds. (I haven't used the included earbuds.) Other reviewers point out that its shiny face can be used as a mirror in a pinch. I've had it only two weeks and have had no glitches yet. Battery life seems to be acceptable. My only disappointment is that it does not come with a wall charger and can only be charged via USB.  I had to buy a wall charger for those times when I travel without my computer.

The little cover piece with string is annoying. The controls are flimsy and outdated.

<Title>Not bad, if you're a windows user... okay otherwise
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you use WMP and use it to sync with the Sansa Express, this is a nice device.  You can create playlists and organize files nicely.  But... If you're using the SE as a USB drive under any other OS, or just don't want to use WMP, it's a pain in the neck --- the Express ignores any directory structure you place the files in, and you cannot create playlists (like m3u's) by hand.  That said, I like the rechargeable battery feature and the fact that I don't need a cable to connect it to my PC --- makes it perfect for use while riding my bike to/from work.  So, it'll do for what I am using it for, but as a general purpose MP3 player for someone NOT using WMP, I think it needs a few firmware changes.

<Title>Almost Great
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall, I believe this is a pretty good MP3 player.  My only reservation is the rechargeable battery.  For me, it would be more convenient to have a replaceable battery (AA or AAA).  Sometimes it is just not convenient to have to fire up the computer to recharge the player; it would be simpler to just replace a battery.  It is great to have the USB connection built in, so that you do not have to carry around a cable.  I would buy this product again; the pluses outweigh the minuses by a considerable amount.

<Content>I purchased this for my wife because she wanted one to use while exercising. She rarely uses it. I had to set it up and I really cannot stand using the windows media player to manage music.

<Title>A Decent Budget mp3 Player
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>** Updated  I have charged this player at work twice via the USB port and noticed that on this system, also running Windows XP Pro, I was unable to load the files off the drive like a flash device. If you Google the terms: msc mode sansa express, you will find an anythingbutipod forum post titled "How To Use Sansa Express in MTP and UMS(MSC) Modes without Uninstalling Drivers" by a user winwithben. This method worked for myself and several others without removing any registry items.  Now the Sansa Express works just like it does at home (a flash drive) and I can easily play mp3s without Windows copying each file to the harddrive to temporary space. If you are using newer versions of Windows Media Player the Sansa has its standard MTP mode installed first and you aren't given a choice normally. I can still use WMP fine as well (as a player but not a syncing agent), so I have my cake and can eat it too.  I'd say this was the best $50 I've ever spent on an mp3 player. It has caused me the least headaches, as I simply had to do a bit of Googling. If only more devices were this painless AND cheap. Thank you SanDisk!  ***  I purchased the pink variety of this 1 GB media player June 1st at a local Best Buy, along with a protective sleeve. The next week I bought a 2 GB SanDisk MicroSD card at Radio Shack on sale. I waited three months to review the item as I wanted to know how it has treated me. I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience of owning this little monster, previously only owning a small 512 MB non-Sansa and a CD-based mp3 player.  As soon as I got home from Best Buy I had begun to sort songs in a folder that felt right for the initial space. I tried to choose a range of file sizes, qualities, and genres. The PCs at home run WinXP Pro and WinXp Home and installed the device without even a hiccup. I have yet to upgrade the firmware either, as it has given me very little trouble. The ability of this player to show up as a flash drive and allow basic copy/paste functions without requiring a heavier syncing agent is one of the best points besides the price. The syncing would likely save me a LOT of time adding music to the player naturally, so perhaps one day I will get around to using it.  The only problem I noticed whatsoever is that the player occasionally locks up when I start it, normally when it gets lower on battery. I only noticed it after I bought the MicroSD card, but the card seems fine. Hard reset with the key combo select (middle silver button) and vol + allows a quick remedy. Firmware likely fixes the problem but I have yet to worry about it since it occurs so infrequently. I have had FAR more trouble with both of my prior mp3 players than this one has given. I never have play issues such as skipping or locking the player up from a bad file.  The battery life is better than advertised in my experiences. The volume it can put out is far louder than any other audio player (including portable CD players) I have ever owned. The included earbuds are much better quality than others I have paid for, though I will eventually get better ones I imagine. The sound quality may not be audiophile-tastic but you really are able to tell the difference between the various sound recording qualities. 128 kbit/s and below really sticks out, especially when you have this hooked up to a home stereo line in, or into your car stereo via tape player adapter. I don't have space to record audio using the built-in mic, but imagine I would be recording more skits like I did with my micro-cassette and Palm Pilot for a while.  I managed to fit 538 songs (most 192kbit/s or above) onto the 3 GB total, spread between internal and external memory space. Some of my favorite songs are longer (and in much higher quality) so I could easily fit more music with a bit of effort. I take this player wherever I go, just slipping it into a pocket or bag. Its radio reception is better than I can get at work with a normal radio, so I opt for it over a streaming feed to catch Ace & TJ in the morning.  I highly recommend this for people who don't want to spend a lot, but want a lot of music accessible on the go. You will likely want the 2 GB MicroSD card, protective carry sleeve, a more comfortable set of headphones, and a y splitter to share your music with a friend. I have yet to be disappointed by a SanDisk product purchased, and this is no exception.

<Content>So I own a Creative Zen Vision M. I had been staying at my girlfriend's house all week without the stupid dongle for my Zen which means it's died. I  really can't go to the gym without tunes so I went to the big box stores out here looking for a charger for my zen. It's rough being a Zen owner, besides online, it's tought ot find any accessories.  I start looking at cheap mp3 players that I can hook up to my laptop which is in the car just to get me through this workout.  After some searching, i find the Sansa Express. I buy it. I love it!  Pros: - I have a sony headunit in my car with a usb input. Now I can charge my sansa and jam out to the tunes that are on it in my car. This basially means I'll never be stuck without an mp3 player again!  - Screen is very nice looking and bright. Can see it day or night!  - Navigating the menus is easy.  - I can use it with my Napster "On the go" service. A HUGE plus!  - Recognized by windows as a mass storage device. AwesomeQ  - Sound is great. I use the "Normal" EQ setting which is plenty loud enough. I am listening with my JVC Marshmallow heaphones which freaking rock!  Cons:  - What cons?  5 stars!

<Date>Fri Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After my first generation shuffle finally died I needed to start looking at mp3 players again.  To my surprise the prices have come way down and competition way up.  I bought this for $39.99 and can't believe how great it is for the money.  I primarily use this when riding my bike or working out at the gym but could see myself leaving my 20GB player at home and taking this on airplanes.  I read all of the reviews (good and bad) before purchasing and would like to relate my experience.  So far battery life has not been an issue whatsoever.  The unit does not come with a charger but I have been able to plug it into my LCD TV, laptop or best yet an aftermarket USB charger that I purchased via the web for $5.  The Sansa headphones suck.  I'm using my old shuffle earbuds and the sound is great.  The screen is hard to read in direct sunlight...I agree with the other reviews.  The shuffle function plays the same songs too frequently so I would recommend not using that feature or creating a playlist.  I didn't install any the cd that came with the unit.  Instead I plugged the unit into my laptop and used Windows Media Player to transfer files with no problems whatsoever.  I really like this player and the price.  I also like the USB Stick design and using a landyard instead of a clip.

<Content>I picked this up because I wanted a handy mp3 player that could record voice - I thought this might be a way to facilitate podcasting - and I was right.  It's meant I can record anywhere!    I've used a number of mp3 players - nomad MuVo (got it with my Audible subscription) iPod Shuffle (original) and iPod Nano.  They each have a feature or two the others lack.   The SE is very handy and small - and like the MuVo and the Shuffle, it just plugs into a computer - no cables required!  Nice when you have more than one computer you want to connect to.  It works well with Winamp for managing the contents and setting up playlists  - though on one of three computers I connect to, it crashes Winamp - I'm hoping this is a bug that will eventually be fixed.  A big plus is the FM radio - it is great to be able to tune into the news without grabbing a radio, or connecting to the internet.\  I was happy that this could play DRM'd Windows media (not that I like DRM!) - but found it isn't very good for the Netlib audio books, since it lacks decent bookmarking (only in the Audible content does that work; I wish I could make big mp3 files into AA content).  I've found that, apart from Audible content, this works best for audio books you've ripped from CD - then you can retain the tracks and navigate the book, picking up where you left off.  The nano remains my main audio book listener - but this is a great addition to my set of mp3 players.  I'm glad I got it - it's a good starter for someone wanting to try out a player.

<Title>Good, but a little tempermental.
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this unit because it was reviewed so well and the price was right.  I like it, but I've only had it for a month or so and already had a couple problems that required support from Sansa.  Fortunately, their online help was perfect and both problems were resolved within one day.  I'm a little worried about how long the buttons will last, they have a feel that makes me worry.  I also have an Ipod shuffle, and comparatively the Ipod is a better built machine, but with fewer options, and downloading music to the Sansa is more straightforward than using Itunes.

<Title>The perfect mp3 player?
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just bought this player and can't say enough good things about it.  Expandable memory and integrated USB connector is what attractred me, and rechargable USB powered battery.  I had a Samsung YP-U2 series that has a similiar design but it lasted 3 weeks and wouldn't power up, it also had many problems with Windows Media Player 11.    This SanDisk is perfect, I've only had it a couple of days (Best Buy had it in stock first) but I expect it will last longer since all other SanDisk products I have bought last a long time.  Some site list mini SD as the expandable memory, but it's micro SD (this site has it right).  For $60 you can't beat it, it does everything right.  iPod who?

<Title>Outstanding Value Proposition - I'm Wired for Sound
<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked one of these up for work yesterday at a major retailer/e-tailer that seemed to have it "first", because I was really feeling the necessity of a device like this and the feature-set sounded promising. I frequently have to crawl around in ceilings for insane numbers of hours doing networking and cabling jobs. I needed something to fill the dead-space in my brain.  Light-weight, feature rich. Very attractive (and user-intuitive) design.  The surface is black mirrored finish.  Very shiny, but prone to fingerprints.  The "finger print problem" isn't a big deal for me. Everything gets grimy and icky up there anyway.  The battery life is insanely good. I don't run the volume way up, so I'm not over-driving the amplifier - probably one reason. Anyway - I worked for 16.5 straight hours, and never stopped it. It was on shuffle/repeat all. It was still showing 1/4 on the charge indicator when I went to bed. I plugged it in before I fell asleep, and it's fully charged now.  The included earbuds sound pretty darned good, but they aren't terribly comfortable, and they don't stay in my ears with any kind of activity. I'll be immediately replacing them.  I also couldn't believe the thing is so feature-rich but doesn't include a clock! A few bits of scratchpad nv and a few bytes of code. This surely has to be on the to-do-list for Sansa...   Capable of playing both MP3 and WMA (Windows Media Audio) at a much improved size-for-quality (to simplify: WMA is effectively MP3 at 50-60% of the size), this is far superior to my view than Apple's "Shuffle" being primarily limited to iTunes/AAC.  The FM receiver had moderate sensitivity.  Not much of a groundplane for that antenna, so I guess it's to be expected.  It works fine for strong stations.  I wasn't really buying it for the FM tuner anyway.  That said, many gyms have an FM broadcast of the TVs over the equipment.  That's probably what this is designed for primarily - and it'd be perfect for that.  The display is awesome. VERY readable and it's downright gorgeous in a totally darkened space, as are the blue backlit buttons.  I transcoded 293 songs out of my MP3 collection to 64kbit/sec WMA. It required just under half the device's storage. So at that bitrate, 600 songs may be a fairly accurate accounting with the types of music I listen to at work. I'm sure the sound may lack a bit, but when you're just using it as background filler - who cares? It's about the amount of music stored at that point...  Just for kicks, I encoded a 384kbit MP3 track from an SACD (Charlotte Church. Very demanding.) utilizing a commercial well-reviewed MP3 CODEC implementation, and plugged the Express into my More Headroom headphone amp, and that into my HD580 Sennheiser headphones.  There was some identifiable amplifier noise on the Sansa. It didn't punch the lows or lift the highs. Probably 75% of SNR that I get on the Creative Zen NX. A friend's Shuffle shows similar characteristics to the Sansa Express (by seat-of-pants method). The Shuffle seems to carry the bass a bit better, the Sansa a bit cleaner on the highs. But that's just my "golden-ear" opinion.  I don't think I'd want it as my only MP3 option for more audiophile-type listening.  But again:  It's a "micro-device".  The one niggling "gotcha" that is common out there:  Why put the lanyard attachment point on the cheap and disposable cap section rather than the actual "business end"?  Hmm.  Maybe I answered my own question. ;)  I like the idea of the lanyard, but wouldn't use it given the probability of losing the device and keeping the cap.   With all that said, I am *super* happy with this device; for its purpose and value proposition. In fact, I'm ecstatic. I would give it a 9.25/10 rating. Earbuds are a very personal thing. I'm only docking them 0.25 for the earbuds. I have no problem replacing them. I'd like to hit them another 0.25 for not adding a clock - but heck, the Shuffle doesn't even have a display. I'm going to hit them another 0.25 for apparent SNR/THD/Amplifier quality, but I'll apologize for it since other similar micro-players have similar apparent performance.  Honestly, a "fairer" rating is probably 9.90/10 when all factors (cost, size, battery life, display quality, quantity of music stored, overall feature-set, etc.) are taken into account.  This is truly a ShuffleKiller. I just hope SanDisk can push the marketing and advertising hard enough to upset the Apple cart [sic].  Yeah, scratch that... I'd give it a "10" on the emotional scale for a day and a half of use.   ;)  With apologies to Cliff Richard:  "Walkin' about with a head full of music, MP3 in my pocket and I'm gonna use it-stereo, out on the street ya know whoa whoa whoa, [...] I feel so ecstatic, it's music I've found, and I'm wired for sound"   --- Jodie

<Title>Very Pleased So Far
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Sansa Express as a replacement for my Creative Zen V and have so far been very pleased with it. I love the size and simple controls and menus, and that there is no need for the dozen extra cables that come with all the other devices on the market. The earbuds that were included weren't exactly quality but I was intending to purchase something seperate that was more to my liking anyway (I hate earbuds!). My only concerns were the lack of listed compatible music store on the company's site (which could change- the product is fairly new, after all), and where they included the anchor for the lanyard- on the cap end instead of the actual usable part. The other ("safer") end is where you can insert the optional memory card (not included) but I think they could have designed that better and included the card slot and the lanyard anchor both on the body.

<Title>Nearly perfect shuffle killer
<Date>Thu Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my express for a few days now, and the experience has been absolutely excellent. First, the things I find to be of most value: Pros:  + Small, sturdy construction (Sexy too) + Expandable Memory (MicroSD) + Powerful radio receiver + Excellent recording functionality (recording off the radio was never easier) + USB Plug built in + Beautiful OLED Screen (top area is yellow, main section is blue) Cons: - A bit bulkier than the 1st Gen Shuffle - Play/Pause/FFWD/REW buttons are not active unless you are at the "what's playing" screen (use the power button to get back to that screen quickly)  Neutral/Don't really matter:  +- The recordings are uncompressed .wav files, so they are much larger than mp3, wma, aac, etc.  Comment: the controls took a bit of getting used to because they are more complex due to the increased functionality

<Title>A very nice entry level MP3 player
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Sansa Express a bit more than a week ago and I have made use of it just about every day since.  Overall I am quite pleased with it.  Its positive attributes include:  Appearance -- To rip off J.K. Rowling there is only one word for the physical appearance of this MP3 player:  Cool.  It has a silver colored body and a black mirror face.  The controls are back-lit in a cool blue and the display is primarily blue-green.  The brightness of the display is adjustable which is very important if you take it out for a walk on a sunny day.  It is the size of a pack of gum and weighs about the same.  File Formats -- Supports MP3, WMA, Protected WMA, WAV, and Audible files.  Caveat:  I could not find any information in the Sansa Express documentation or on line about what bit rates are supported.  According to a telephone technical support person it supports 128KBS MP3 which is OK for "Jump'n Jack Flash" or the like but not so good for more complex art/alternative rock, jazz or classical.  However, I have downloaded 128, 192, and 320KBS MP3 files to the Sansa Express without a hitch and they seem to work fine, so I am inclined to believe that the unit supports all standard bit rates.  File Formats Update 4-22-07 -- I have been in contact with Sandisk technical support via email and they gave me the following information on Sansa Express supported bit rates: WMA - 64 to 128 kbps. MP3 - 96 to 320 kbps and VBR. (VBR = variable bit rate, a CD ripping option in some media player encoders that varies the bit rate based on the dynamics of the music, increasing the efficiency of the compression process [if its properly done]) Sandisk technical support responded with an answer to my question in less than 24 hours.  Sound -- The MP3 sound is good enough that I have not felt the need go back to my portable CD player although I have been using 192 and 320KBS music files rather than 128KBS files which reduces the amount of music that can be stored on the device.  This, I should say, is a matter of personal choice; alot of Napster-To-Go rock and roll sounded fine at 128KBS.  Radio -- The radio is a nice feature and I would rank its quality as roughly comparable to a pocket radio I have used for quite some time, but you should not expect it to pull in weaker stations or work in places with a lot of radio frequency interference.  Controls -- I found the controls to be easy-to-use.  If you do get lost or take a wrong turn you can always press the power/menu button again and quickly get to where you wish to go.  I will mention one thing to guard against: the radio has a feature that will automatically scan the FM band and set presets to the strongest stations -- a nice feature but if you activate it by accident say goodbuy to all your own presets; and also it skips stations that you may want preset that can be received just fine (the radio search function has the same problem.)  Compatibility with Windows Media Player 11 -- I have had no problems at all using Windows Media Player 11 with the Sansa Express.  Compatibility with Subscription Services -- I have used the device with Napster-To-Go with no problems at all (exploiting a free-trial offer by Napster).  After importing my ripped CD's to the Napster library I could download any music regardless of its source (ripped CD or downloaded Napster-To-Go) to the Sansa Express by simply dragging the desired track(s), album(s), artists(s), or playlist(s) to the MP3 device window.  You can select multiple items to be dragged using standard MS Windows techniques (for example mouse click, followed by as many cntrl-clicks as you need).  Its a piece of cake.  Mini USB cable -- I plug my Sansa Express directly into one of the front-mounted USB ports in my desk-top computer where there is plenty of space, but if the only USB port you have available is located in the tightly crowded space in the back of your machine Sandisk includes a mini USB cable with the Express that allows you to use a USB port where physical space limitations prevents a direct connection.   Not so positive attributes:  Ear Buds -- the ear buds that come with the Sansa Express are OK as far as sound goes but they do not cover the ear canal so they do not block out local ambient noise at all.  Also they are not particularly comfortable.  However, the earphones I was using with my portable CD player work fine with the Sansa Express and they do not seem to adversely effect battery life.  To sum up:  Overall I am very pleased with the Sansa Express.  I am particularly pleased with its size and looks, that it includes an FM radio, support for subscription music services, expandable memory, and costs just 59 bucks.

<Title>Best I've owned so far ...
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned several MP3 players, including the Rio Karma, Creative Zen Micro, and a number of smaller capacity players.  This is hands-down the best player I have come across.  Excellent sound, sturdy and compact, color OLED display, plenty of battery life, compatibility with online music services, FM radio, recording, driverless functionality with Windows ... all of the features you would expect.  The Micro-SD expansion slot, along with my past experiences with SanDisk products in general are what sold me.  The most important feature to me is that the player has the functionality I want, at a price where I can afford to lose it ... so I have it with me whenever I need it.  This is by far the most bang for the buck with regards to MP3 players, "entry-level" or otherwise.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  Don't forget some extra storage space!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLP5UK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1744394-5435258">Sandisk Micro SD 2 GB</a> works like a champ in my player.

<Title>Good, but the shuffle functionality is sub-par
<Date>Sun Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product for my wife and she liked it well enough for 2 weeks after which time she told me the songs needed to be refreshed.  She had 10 hours of music loaded and about 20 hours of listening time with the Shuffle function turned on the entire time.  I would expect that she would have heard nearly every song once and many twice.  Turns out that more than 1/2 of the songs had never been played, and many other songs had played 5 or 6 times.  This is far from what I would expect out of a randomizer.

<Title>Great player but it's broken after 3 days of use
<Date>Fri May 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was really excited about this little player (my first, after doing lots of research) and when I got it, it was working great and all my expectations were met. Really love it, great sound, nice and small and portable, convenient USB hookup, basically all the good things everyone else liked about it.   Then on about about day 3 of owning it (and having never used it for more than an hour at a time) mine unexpectedly refused to turn on after charging all night. Apparently I had "overcharged it" which is strange because a lot of other reviews I had read said this was impossible, which is one of the reasons why I bought it (pop it into a USB and leave it all night, ready for next day's use. Seems nice and convenient!) Luckily I am in touch with customer support (their number is on the website for all to see, not hidden or needing a lot of digging around to get ahold of them) and they are helping me trouble shoot the little bugger.   The only problem is I suspect their tech support is outsourced, so there has been a bit of a language barrier when they are trying to explain how to take it apart and whatnot, but at least they are trying to help me solve the problem. Also, they have said if we can't get it fixed that they will send me a new one, which I guess is okay, but I think if I had known that it can overcharge itself like this, I might have looked elsewhere.  Moral of the story: Always register your product immediately! (And when it comes to electronics like these, I will probably only be purchasing directly from the company or their authorized resellers, in case I get another lemon.)

<Title>A capable unit, but with a few annoyances
<Date>Wed May 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I won't repeat what others have reviewed well here, but I will emphasize a few points I've found that are a nuisance.  Display unreadable in bright light. Here's the problem: To make the Sandisk look slick, they coated the front with a mirrored surface, a one way mirror like the kind you  see in police shows when they're interrogating someone. The display is behind this surface, so when it's bright out, all you can see is your face. You are literally flying blind outside.  Another nuisance, less important (so far). The device has a built in USB port on one end, which is covered by a cap. The cap is where the lanyard hooks in that lets you hang the device around your neck. So if the cap comes off, you're left with the cap hanging around your neck, not the unit.  Otherwise a fine MP3 unit, full featured.
