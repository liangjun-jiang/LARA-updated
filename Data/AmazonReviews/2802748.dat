<Title>Large size good price
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Outstanding hard drive space for the price, the ear buds that are included are of excellent quality, and I'm completely addicted to it.  The best feature is putting my entire music library on shuffle and listening to things I've ignored for years.  I'm still not always crazy about iTunes but I'm getting used to it.  It's completely changed the way I listen to music.

<Title>beyond expectations
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was virulantly anti ipod. They were for noobs, kids, non tech savvy. I had an iRiver H320, which could be hacked, rockboxed (alt operating system), had line in recording and FM, and a big geek factor.  It played videos before ipods (albeit choppy quality and totally a gimmick). It is drag and drop from windows explorer, no itunes interface needed - well that is a superior feature ipod just doesn't have. I loved that thing. I still have it, but it is only 20 gigs. iRiver doesn't make them any more or support them. it is heavier and fatter than an ipod.  Enter my 80gb ipod video. Form factor - A+. slim, light, portable. Usage factor A. simple, slick interface. click wheel a bit too sensitive, but you get used to it. Video - A++ - biggest surprise for me. Thought it was a gimmick, but video quality is amazing and you can easily output to a TV. Even on 50" HDTV screen, videos are great - VHS quality. With some qeek abilities, you can find excellent free software online (DVDshrink, Videora) to enable you to rip any DVD (or captured youtube video with Videodownloader) to mp4 and have it on your ipod. 6 hours video is plenty.   accessories - A+++. Sets these apart from other brands. Bought a Belkin Tune Talk Stereo, and it is now a digital recorder, capable of 3 hrs of recording live music or ripping old lp's or cassettes to digital. speakers, chargers, cases: huge assortment online for any taste, budget or functional requirement.  80 gigs - what can I say? HUGE storage ability. nothing else comes close.   itunes software took me a while to get into, but it is easy and just fine. I still prefer "UMS" ability to just drag and drop from windows explorer onto player as though it were a hard drive, without any extra step in between. But itunes has some advantages for music management.  all in all, totally satisfied. (But I still use my iRiver now, almost exclusively as a digital recorder) Rockbox is coming for the 80gb ipod, however....!

<Title>Excellent for school
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm at college frequently and sometimes I have several hours between classes. This is perfect for those times when nobody is around to talk to and you need some long term, or short term entertainment. The screen is a little small, but its not painful to watch. With an 80gb capacity, I managed to cram 600 hours of video onto this little guy, which will give you about 300 movies, or 800+ tv show episodes. You can cram probably double the amount of music on here if you don't care about top audio quality (as if you can get it through the regular ear buds anyways). The games are excellent, especially tetris, which has kept me addicted for many hours. You can listen to and skip through music while you play your games as well. It is the absolute best investment if you frequently travel or have a lot of downtime on the go, especially if you don't have the space for larger electronics like a laptop. I do not recommend using the itunes store for anything but games, however, as all of their products come with DRM that will only allow you to play it on the ipod and your PC,  which means when you want to buy a new player, you are out of luck.

<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say, I promised that I would never buy an iPod, but after the addition of an 80GB model (and the capability to play Pac-Man!), I was finally wooed. The effortless podcasting integration is also a winner. I had a Creative Zen Vision M, but this model is over twice the size and is thinner. I wish it had more filetype compatibility, but it is so easy to use. This is a winner.

<Content>Having this expensive toy is certainly something of a "what one wants, not needs" thing, but what I personally appreciate about it is the portability of it, combined with its ease of use. I can stash my recorded TV shows, all music, pictures, and every single piece of music owned in one spot, and view these here if needed. Play it thru my car's plug in or on speakers, or even jst headphones. It's pretty easy to use once you get the hang of the wheel dial and how to use it. One big plus is how it updates so easily when I plug it into my laptop - and charges too!

<Title>Excellant Apple product
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had a different mp3 player but sold it to go with a video iPod. I don't regret making the switch. I've loaded it with books on tape, tv shows, and music and it works well.  I'm not fond of the click wheel but I'm getting used to it. By biggest quibble is iTunes. Since it's a free program I try to cut it some slack but I dislike it's organization scheme - much prefer Music Match. And while this review is supposed to focus on the product how can one ignore the program that makes it work?

<Content>The product is excellent, as expected.  Apple always does an excellent job with their products and the IPOD is no exception.  I still haven't figured out how to download videos to it but that is not that important to me anyway.  IT is probably simplier to download videos with a Mac computer but I'm a PC person.  the service from Amazon was also great.

<Title>Ipod 80GB great .... when it works.

<Content>80 GB Ipod arrived in non working condition. Seller would not replace,reffered me to Apple support. Item was repaired and returned in 3 days but continues to have problems. I had to buy extended warranty from apple ($60) because I know this unit is a dud. On it's 3rd trip back to Apple repair for same problem (Static/distortion through headphone jack & Docking interface). Item arrived quickly and what appeared to be good condition from seller but with all the problems I've had I wish I would have bought locally so Item could be returned/replaced instead of repaired. Was not worth the $50 I saved by buying online. Seller has little to no control over this, unfortunate experience with my first Apple product for me.

<Content>I received this iPod as a Christmas gift - I would never have gotten it for myself.  I mean, who needs 80 GB of MP3 storage and the ability to play TV shows and movies in a miniature screen?  Aparently, I do.  I love this thing.  I have loaded tons of music on my iPod, a season of SouthPark, some old Star Trek episodes, and I have 60 GB space remaining.  Plus, the screen quality is remarkable!  This is a very cool device - and I am not an Apple fan.  One thing - I am told they scratch easily, so I was quick to get a case for it.  I suggest the iSee case by Contour Designs.

<Title>Ipod...not bad, not bad at all
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, let me start off by saying that I too was once one of the many people who were determined to be completely anti-ipod. When I bought my first mp3 player (a 40 gb creative zen) I strayed as far from the ipod as possible, not wanting to conform and be like everyone else who had them. I had my zen for a little over a year and it really was a terrific player; easy hardware and software, no silly click wheel, organized my music perfectly. I guess I should mention that I'm also one of those people who has yet to increase my music collection digitally. I'm still old-fashioned in the sense that I prefer to buy CDs instead of downloading music from the Internet or from a music service. Anyway, like I said, the zen was great but it didn't hold pictures, store videos, or even have a color screen. Not to mention, it was quite large and bulky. That's when I decided it was time to seek a new mp3 player. The zen was so easy to use and I didn't want to part with it, but it was definitely time for an upgrade. When looking for a new mp3 player (what would be my second) I did my research, trust me. I knew that I didn't want to lose any space so I narrowed my search to players that stored 40 gb or more. That's why I ruled out the Zune, which, though attractive in many respects, only had a 30 gb version available. After hours(seriously, I probably spent a full 24 hours overall) of intense research, I narrowed my options down to the 60 gb Toshiba Gigabeat and the 60 gb iAudio. Still not wanting to submit to the conformity of the ipod, at first I was leaning toward the Toshiba Gigabeat. It looked like it was very user friendly and had all the same features as the ipod and more. But then when reading the customer reviews I saw that users suffered from frequent crashes of the mp3 player and lost entire music libraries. Plus tech support was not very supportive. The iAudio was also very enticing, especially because it included an FM radio component. But then I noticed that it had a maximum file limit of 10,000 files. Even though it advertised 60 gb, the iAudio really only offered 40 gb because of this limit. That brought me to the dreaded ipod. The size and popularity of the thing finally won me over and I purchased one. Although I'm losing credibility in the non-conformist department, I'm really glad I made the purchase.  Pros: great battery life bright screen, crisp, clean picture tiny! easy software with itunes (and for me who still uses the cd method, all i have to do is pop a cd into my drive and itunes automatically asks me if i want to add the tracks to my itunes library, it's really simple) the click wheel really isn't that bad, just a little getting used to holds a crazy amount of media, music, photos, videos, 80 gb is all i'll ever need  cons: you can't actually do anything on the ipod itself, like organize music, delete songs...everything has to be done on the computer doesn't come with a charger, you must charge through your computer and often times the warning "do not disconnect" comes up on the screen until it is completely charged  In the end, I really like the ipod. It's worth the money. I'd recommend buying a case before you take it out the box though, because it is unbearably prone to scratches (not pretty). Also, make sure that you don't charge it when the battery is only half or a third of the way empty. Wait until the battery is completely empty before recharging and this will preserve the life of your battery. The ipod really is a great buy. If you're like me; a music addict, then you won't be disappointed. Hey, sometimes being a sheep isn't so bad.

<Content>No problems.  If you don't know what it is by now, your in trouble!!  One of the best features I love about the Ipod (and I'm not sure which models have this features), is that I can do a photo slide show, by syncing a folder of pictures and a song playlist.  I went out to "Five Below" and they had a $5 A/V cable that connects from your speaker jack of the Ipod into your TV.  For the holidays, I put family slide shows together and it was a big hit!!

<Title>Go with 80 Gig if you have movies in mind
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, you will find the anti-Ipod group will find something wrong with all apple Ipods. I've been using Ipods for around four years and my first Ipod still works fine. In fact the oldeset Ipod I have is permanantely placed in my car. Now the new 80 Gig, buy it if you plan on downloading movies and TV shows. Some of the shows I watch happened to be broadcasting at late hours. For example I love Jay Leno, so I purchased 20 episodes of his show for $10.00 from itunes ( I think that's the cost). I travel quite a bit and killing time is priceless. I use to carry a laptop plus all the movies I wanted to watch in a case and sometimes even a portable DVD player. The convenience factor is amazing if you are willing to pay the premium price. Although I wish they have more movies in the Itunes store along with a cheaper price tag (that's not going to happen anytime soon).

<Title>One star docked for the freezing issue
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This new Ipod is a great improvement in general over the 4th generation.  I'll agree that there is a minor problem with freezing up, but it's likely a very well known problem to Apple and it will get fixed in a firmware update sometime relatively soon (they're probably focused on getting Itunes working correctly right now - now THAT is something that is in desperately need of updates to work correctly.)  In the meantime, I think I've discovered a very simple, temporary, albeit unwieldy fix: don't use the Hold button.  I have found that nearly every time I've pause my 80gb Ipod and then used the Hold button, I've unpaused and unlocked only to find my Ipod frozen.  Since I stopped using the Hold button, no freezing.  Inconvenient?  Definitely.  You'll have to weigh which is more annoying - having your Ipod play randomly in your pocket if it gets bumped or whether you have to center-button/menu reset it all the the time and lose your place in your songs.

<Content>This is a great product.  It does what it says on the can, however you do need to make sure that you arrange your music well on the PC prior to importing it as the IPOD wants to be the king and control what you do.  Its a little bit "big brother" in the way it prevents you doing things like burning your own CDs etc, but I manage that via WMP and then import it to itunes.  Seems to work quite well.  Great product, not sure how to get movies onto it yet but time will help.  Highly recommended.
