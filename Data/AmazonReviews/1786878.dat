<Title>Tired of iPod or iTunes, try Sony NWZS616FRED 4GB Walkman Video
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>YES HELEN, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO!!! This little unit is slick and neat and is the size of a pack of Trident Chewing Gum, only partially thicker. RUNNERS, it fits nicely into that little pocket they put on your shorts and is it slick and beautiful.. So-o much for the esthetics's, it is easy to learn to use, and boy does it have the features you want in an mp3 player. The sound is spectacular as you can adjust the EQ to any desired sound you might like and Its easy to make play lists for your music and play only the play list or all music..Great for making a workout music play list.  DO NOT use the headphones that it comes with but get yourself a  good pair of headphones (I know, another investment). You can view pics and videos and easily turn the screen horizontal and play music while showing Aunt Helen or grandma those pics you took on vacation.. THE RADIO, with ease it scans and finds all the stations in your local area and you can delete the ones you don't care for and has wonderful reception and sound. All of the buttons are easy to use and logically placed. Software, you may not want to use Windows Media 11, but that's up to you. I use WinAmp and found it easier to find and adjust my directory targets..Oh, and the battery life is spectacular, my iPod went dead in a few hours BUT this one is like that ever ready battery guy, going and going and going. NOW for the downside.. Few to no accessories, I'm still waiting on a belt clip for $19.95, so don't expect any extras.. Must be connected to delete music.. So now you know why it gets so many 5 stars out there. Do your homework.

<Title>a great little Mp3 and video player
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought a Red one for myself, liked it so much I bought my wife a Pink one as a gift. Very easy to use just drag and drop music, picture or video files. The FM receiver is very good also, better at tuning in frequencies than the boom box I have at work, a good add-in feature. I also like that you can play sound tracks from a variety of ways, play list, folders, albums, or artist. The equillizer is another useful feature. The buttons compared to other Mp3 players I've used, have a very positive feel to them, unlike the Creative players I also own which tend to jump all over trying to select a item on the menu.  I found some great and free video converter software (Twin Video to iPod-Zune-PSP-3GP) from Cnet downloads that allow me to easily convert video files from my Sony camera to the format that this little cute uses.  If I have one complaint, its that this item is so new that accessories are very few or non-existent in number, things like AC DC chargers, cases etc, even from eBay. But I expect that they will become available in due time. I wish the Red came in a 8gb model I would buy that too.

<Title>Loving it!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I researched high and low before settling on this model.  I wanted an FM radio option, so iPod was out.  The Sony MP3 models had the lowest number of negative user reviews, and even these tended to be minor.  Also they featured consistently positive reviews across the board from all major online sites, including Amazon.  I just received it today, and it worked flawlessly.  No installation (I already had Windows Media 11), and the menu was easy to follow.  Very happy with my choice.

<Title>Excellent value, solid player.
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is an all around solid MP3 player.   Initially I had some difficulty using Windows Media Player to transfer my files, but I downloaded the MediaManager from Sony.com and that worked very well it getting my iTunes music onto this unit (I have a 3rd gen iPod classic, and an iPhone (which I love).  Converting my iTunes purchased music is time consuming (the DRM tracks that is), but still workable and I'm sure with continued searching I'll find a tool that works easily (as opposed to buring a CD then importing into iTunes using MP3 encoder).  I was also concerned before I bought it about the controls.  I've become accustomed to the iPod click wheel and the touch screen on my iPhone, but once I got the unit it was really a non-issue.  The interface is clean and easy and the front controls work well.  Battery life is awesome.   Sound quality is excellent (not sure it's better than iPod as many reviewers have commented, but it is certainly as good, and likely better to most given the audio enhancement options available).  The display is crisp and video works surprisingly well.  I can't imagine watching much on it, but the occasional video podcast might be nice.  The display is much better than the Creative Zen V Plus I bought for the wife a year ago or so.  I would definitely recommend this unit for anyone looking for a inexpensive MP3 player with FM radio.

<Title>Nice player, great features
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sony NWZ-S616 has a lot of good going for it, and I'd recommend just a few improvements.  Good: Excellent battery life, beautiful screen, navigation and buttons very intuitive (dedicated volume button a HUGE plus), and really top-notch sound quality - I'd rank it right up there with iAudio/Cowon mp3 players easily. The ability to support playlists, and its wide array of music play options is a plus (play by genre, year, artist, album, etc). Big plus is drag-and-drop capability (on a PC). No proprietary software needed. Nice form factor, too - not as thin as an iPod nano (3 gen) but, not as wide either.  Lacking: Needs a firmware update so you can delete files from the player! Really, there ought to be a way to delete accidentally uploaded music that you just don't care to listen to without having to hook the player up to your PC. Not good. Another firmware update suggestion would be to make possible a way to preview the next song (correct me if I'm wrong, but I couldn't find a way to do this).   Also, it would be nice to have the option to buy some accessories for the player, but noooo...Sony's dragging its feet on getting these available to the public, and at this time, no third-party accessories to be found.   Overall, a great player with a lot of upside if you're looking for great sound quality and flexible play options.

<Title>SPECTACULAR SOUND
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this about 2 months ago. Now i still cannot stop smiling when i listen to my music. Especially when i see people listening to their ipods. As far as sound is concerned, there is nothing better out there. I cannot imagine myself listening to my ipod after i listen to this. My biggest mistake was spending a lot more money for my ipod, especially after i upgraded my cell phone. I got the sony ericcson walkman phone and found out that it sounds better than my ipod, much more better :-)...If you are looking for the best mp3 player that your money can buy...THIS IS IT!!(you will have to buy a better set of earphones though)

<Title>AWESOME!
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this device about a month ago whilst looking for a nice l'il mp3 that would hold every song Jamiroquai's ever made and a lot more. My previous device was just a l'il iRiver mp3 that only held about 80 songs... Yeah, sad. Anywho, I am compelled to publicly declare my Love for the Sony NWZ-S616FRED. It holds about 2,450 songs so I have ALLLLLLL of my JMQ on it...including remixes! I have approximately 562 songs on it so there's still more than enough room for whatever else I want to add. I've already downloaded I-dunnno-how-many pictures onto it. I haven't put any videos on it yet, but I'd like too SOON! Very recently, my mother gave me an iPod Nano. Cute, but it has no radio and I can only download from iTunes! (Boooooo!) I have accounts with as well as many, many tunes on Napster and the now defunct Dell MusicMatch. Returned the iPod to mother as I can't get my MusicMatch and Napster collections onto iTunes and for that matter, onto the iPod whereas I have no problem gettin' 'em on my Sony. Also as previously mentioned, the iPod has noooo radio! My Sony does (smile!), with 30 station presets! Plus it's smaller than that wide, graham cracker of an mp3 otherwise knows as the iPod Nano. If this thing had a voice recorder and/or the option to record from the radio, I think I'd request to be buried with it. The only thing I prefer about the Nano is that scroll thingie. That feature is wicked! Other than that, compared to the Sony NWZ-S616, the iPod is inferior. The sound quality is great and well satisfies a bass lover like myself. My only gripe about the headphones that come with this device is that they're the ones where one side is longer than the other (not sure what that's called, but...); the longer side goes behind the neck... I prefer the regular ones where the cords are the same length. I highly recommend this product! Please consider and compare before purchasing an iPod. :)

<Title>INCREDIBLE SOUND
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player, and I read hundreds of reviews for different brands before I found this Sony Walkman.  I purchased it based on the positive reviews and the brand name because I own a Sony Walkman cassette player that has served me well for quite a few years.  I think that this MP3 player sounds as good as or better than the Bose sound system in my car.  I was afraid that it was going to be too complicated, but once I figured out how to rip my CDs with Windows Media Player, it was easy to sync the songs I wanted, and it is just as easy to delete songs to make room for new ones.  I am really glad I bought this Sony instead of some other brand.  It looks great, sounds great, and is easy to use.  The only thing I don't like is the ear buds, so I am using the Sony headphones from my cassette player.  I only wish I had bought the 8GB player because I couldn't get everything on this one.

<Title>Great value for money
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my husband, (a die-hard i Pod nano fan) for Christmas, based on online reviews on this and other sites!  He loves it!  Great sound, tons of features in a neat little unit at a better price than the 4G Nano.  Husband is now a Sony convert!  I'd seen several complaints about the headphones, and very nearly bought a replacement set but my husband seems quite satisfied with the sound!  He says they are certainly no worse than the i-Pod headphones.   One big drawback - accessories (cases, belt clips) for the Sony Walkman Video MP3 player are not accessible as I-Pod accessories!

<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this device for my boyfriend, my mother, and one for myself. I love it and so do they. They are always listening to it and when they aren't... they're uploading music onto it. The sound quality is amazing, so much that when you have in your headphones, you feel like you're there in the studio with the artist. I'm very glad I bought this product.  Only bad part is not being able to delete songs from the device... how bothersome but otherwise not that serious. Don't like the headphones it came with but hey!, who ever does? That's why you gotta buy a new set of headphones, though the ones it comes with are sufficient. The color on the screen is awesome! very clear and very easy to use. Drag and drop is amazingly easy. It takes little to no time to learn how to take your downloaded songs and upload them to your device.  I recommend the product. you'll also be awed.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This MP3 sounds great and looks great.  For the price, you can't beat it. The best part is that it is so easy to copy files into the MP3.  I didn't bother loading the software that was included and copying music couldn't be simpler.  It's only a matter of selecting the music, clicking 'copy', and in less than a minute or two, the entire selection is in the device and it even sorts it into categories, too!  I'm very happy with my new toy.  (=
