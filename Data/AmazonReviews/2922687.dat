<Title>Excellent Little MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, keep in mind that this review is coming off of a person who previous owned a Sansa M240 (a piece of junk!!!) but ...  This little item is excellent.  I stores a lot of songs and from the first view one can see that it is much better built.  It's got a FM radio built into it, which is nice, and can handle a variety of music formats.  The unit is better designed so that buttons don't physically need to be pressed - all you do it swipe your hand over the button to activate it.  The is nice because with a small unit like this I'm thinking the physical energy to push the button is stress the unit to eventually break. And it is incredibly light - about the size of a small pack of Wrigley's gum.  The only drawbacks that I see to it are:  1)  It recharges through the USB port, so you'll need to have a computer nearby to recharge it.  As someone mentioned in another review, that might be a pain for using on a vacation unless you own a laptop.  However, to counter this, the unit does have a 15 hour charge, so you'll have to be listening to music a fair amount of time until it loses charge.  2)  It would have been nice if it came with a lanyard.    However, both of the concerns I noted are miniscule, and I would still recommend this MP3 player.  I got the black version of this unit, but the blue unit doesn't look that bad as well.

<Title>BEWARE: This is not a usb memory device!
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this thinking that I could treat it like a jump drive.  Bzzzz.  You MUST HAVE WINDOWS AND at least SP 3 installed on a pc.  Then you have to have their software installed on the machine you are using to transfer files onto the player (so I can't use my work machine to transfer files).  I currently have no machine that handles these restrictions, so I either have to return it or have to invest $700 or more for another machine so I can use my $70 player.  Maybe I'd like it if I could get music installed on it, but for now it's just a piece of expensive slag.

<Title>Not so good as the previous models
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 3rd. Yepp and have to say that the previous models where quite better. This one doesn't have buttons for volume, forward, etc... instead of it is sensible to touch, but EXTREMELY SENSIBLE, which is very inconvenient.  When you store the music through the USB port in your computer, you can't create files (as playlists) the device separate them in Artists, Songs, Albums, etc, but never in the files you previously programed. Besides this, after 1 week of having it, is giving me problems since it turns off saying there was a system problem.

<Title>It will NOT work as a USB Drive.
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Note: This YP - U3 will NOT work as a USB Drive. it used to work, then Samsung & Microsoft Teamed up to update the firmwire in this device, it can NOT be used as a usb drive now. and it ONLY work on windows XP (not even 2000), no linux, no mac.   And you will need Admin privilege to install the driver. (so if you want to transfer file between computer, this thing won't work).   I am IT engineer so I did a lot research on this and managed to update the firm ware. But it is such a hassle. I won't buy this thing if I know in advance it won't work as a usb drive.   I repeat, It will NOT work as a usual usb drive. you will have to install drivers on the computer. The description in Amazon in not accurate.   if you have a firm ware early than 1.07, it might work. most of them are 1.11 now.   Hope this will save you some money and time.

<Title>The iPod Shuffle, but thinner.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Loved it's design and color.  There have been some problems putting it in the USB and trying to get it recognized.  Just try it 2x or so to get it going.  Great storage amount; Sounds great.  You also have a 1-year Warranty offer on it if anything goes bad. If it breaks, just send it back in for free (Pay for shipping)  and there you go.
