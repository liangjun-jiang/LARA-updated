<Title>It looks nice...at first.

<Content>This MP3 player is quite neat and useful...but that only lasted for a month or 2 because it scratches way too easy.  The interface is great and the sound is awesome.  It does get slugish if too many songs are in its memory.  All in all, mine worked for about 9 months before it decided to stop working.  I sent it in to RCA 2 months ago and still am waiting for some type of response from them.  So if you are looking for an MP3 player that will stay looking nice and have a long lifespan....then this one is not it (especially at over $100).  
<Overall>3
