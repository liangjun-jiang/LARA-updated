<Title>Great gadget, though DRM leaves a lot to be desired...
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I've been wanting to purchase a portable MP3 player for quite some time now, and I finally bit the bullet and got the Sony NW-MS9.  I think it's a really great little player, though I have some issues with the &quot;digital rights management&quot; (DRM) implementation.  I'll separate this review into two portions - the player and the software...<p>The player (plusses)<br>* Sound quality is great!  Though I have no other players to compare it to.<br>* Comes with a trendy keychain attachment, not a carry strap.<br>* Small, compact, fits in that pocket-within-a-pocket in your jeans!<br>* Feels sturdy (not like a toy) for it's size and weight (1.5&quot; x 3.25&quot; x 0.75&quot;, 2.5oz without keychain)<br>* It has a blue backlit (can be turned off) LCD screen with different display modes. (the equalizer is tres-cool!)<br>* It does have a two level bass booster (which is more than sufficient).<br>* It can be used as a portable yet small hard drive.<p>The player (neutrals)<br>* It uses Sony's ATRAC3 compression - which is similar to that of an MD recorded in LP2.  In my opinion, it's almost indistinguishable from CD, especially under the conditions I use it in. (bike rides)<br>* It can only utilize OMG (ATRAC3) files recorded at 66, 105 and 132kbps.  So the software provided (OpenMG) converts audio files into a format that can be used by the player.  Note that the bitrates give you ~131min, ~82 and ~65 minutes respectively on the provided 64MB card.<br>* Would be nice if it came with some kind of leather/vinyl carrying sleeve.<p>The player (minuses)<br>* The &quot;gum stick&quot; battery needs to be charged externally, though if you have an MD player that uses the same battery, it's not an issue.  However, when connected to a PC via USB, the player can be accessed, and files can be read/written to it (including playing music from it through the PC)<br>* It only works with MagicGate memory cards, which are white, cost more (+~$10 over normal) and hard to find.  It would've been nice if it came with the 128MB card to start with.<p>The software (plusses)<br>* Good music recorder (ATRAC3 files, supports high speed ripping)<br>* Very simple to use interface. <br>* Imports MP3 songs by adding it to it's internal database; does not convert them on the spot, only when needed.<p>The software (neutral)<br>* Songs can be checked out to up to three different devices (though they can be checked back in at any time).<br>* MP3 files need to be &quot;optimized&quot; into ATRAC3 - which adds to the conversion and download time (normal download times are ~4-5sec on my PC), unless you've done that before (cached)<br>* No special &quot;visualizations&quot; like WIMP/WINAMP/etc.  Just a simple interface with a simple spectrum analyzer/wave displayer.<br>* To backup your music, you need an internet connection.  I haven't tested this function yet (the internet backup isn't available on OpenMG v2.0)<p>The software (minuses)<br>* ATRAC3 (.OMG) files cannot be transferred from one PC to the other due to the DRM requirements.  In fact, I tried moving a file, and I couldn't use it anymore.<br>* I think I know what the implications of this are when your PC gets nuked by say a virus, though I won't post speculation until I try the music backup function.<br>* Doesn't link to the media hotkeys (next/prev/stop) like WIMP.<br>* The software has a horrid screen refresh rate, even on a P3-850.<br>* The software doesn't support &quot;NSSM&quot; (Non stop mega mix, like some of the new trance/ayumix CDs I have) playback style (there's a noticable pause between files being loaded) on music files, though it does support it on CD Audio (unlike WIMP).  I haven't tried this on the player though.<p>So there you have it, the biggest minus was because of the Digital Rights Management thingie, which is why it gets a 4, but it's a great little portable music player.  I'll just have to keep my entire collection in MP3 format, not their proprietary OMG format =)

<Title>Expensive but Extraordinary
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Sure, the Sony NW-MS9 is far more expensive than your average portable MP3 player but then again this is not your average MP3 player.  Super small and compact, this Digital Music Player can go anywhere and in any pocket.  You'll barely know it is on your person as you run down the street.  It seems well suited for an extensive workout and comes with a clip that enables the whole player to fit on your keyring!  Steller looks as well.  The device is surrounded in all silver casing and has efficeint controls. This Sony will be the talk of all your friends.  Downsides?  Unfortunately yes.  The unit uses the Sony Memory Stick System which is not a cheap way to store files by any means.  64MB Memory Sticks costing....  However if you need a super small unit and are not intimidated by its high price this unit will suit your needs perfectly.

<Title>An EXCELLENT MP3 player!!!
<Date>Thu Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I have to say, when I first opened the package, I was a little skeptical about the whole thing, but when I plugged it into my PC via USB port, I was blown away. This little device (which is conveniently the size of a cigarette lighter) has a spectacular sound for a small MP3 player. This system is very flexible due to the fact that it plays back in ATRAC3 and supports MP3, WMA, WAV, and liquid audio. It comes with music management software, a keyring-style carry strap, a rechargable battery, a battery charger, ear buds, a USB cable, and a removable 64MB MagicGate Memory Stick Media card (which lets you record up to 120 minutes of music.) The LCD display is blue backlit and you can have it in three modes, all of which are helpful. One thing about this system, which I like, is that it fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and weighs only 67 grams with battery and MagicGate card already inside it! Also, since there are no moving parts, it cannot and will not skip which is perfect for when you are doing your daily jog. It also has the &quot;see saw&quot; switch operation which lets you move quickly through tracks and such simply by pressing up or down.  Also, the software is relatively easy, especially if you are familiar with the whole digital music thing.  I must admit however that the MagicGate Memory Stick Media cards are a bit on the expensive side. But hey, that's one small price to pay for a great unit!  Overall, I found the Sony NW-MS9 Network Walkman to be a SPECTACULAR piece of equipment and I recommend it highly.  Hope this review was of help to you!

<Title>Great Hardware, Poor Software
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Once again, Sony delivers marvelous hardware with marginal software (see also their line of digital cameras that lacks Windows 2000 support). This player, the physical unit itself, is excellent: conveniently small, well-styled and lightweight, with a nice display for a small device. The sound quality is excellent (good bass!). For the price, a 128meg memory stick would have been nice. I haven't personally purchased a second memory stick yet, but potential buyers should be aware that they can be a bit expensive and hard to find (see the other reviews). Overall, however, I like the hardware and have no serious complaints.<br><br> The software is another matter entirely. I expected that it would be fairly straightforward to add and remove songs with this device: I assumed that when the player was attached with a USB cable, Windows would simply recognize it as an extra drive, with normal copy/delete functionality. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The only way Sony allows the user to interact with the player is through a software package called OpenMG Jukebox. This Jukebox not only plays songs and maintains playlists, but it also &quot;optimizes&quot; songs in different music formats for use on the player. &quot;Optimize&quot; is a misnomer here, as it implies that the operation is an optional way to improve performance (maximize storage, increase sound quality, etc), whereas in reality ONLY music &quot;optimized&quot; to Sony's proprietary format works on the player.<br><br> Since the vast majority of users maintain their digital music collections in mp3 format, this creates quite a dilemma. Either the user 1) stays with mp3 and converts songs &quot;on the fly&quot; to omg, Sony's format, as he puts them on the player (this greatly increases the time needed to copy songs to the player) or the user 2) maintains two copies of all his songs, one in mp3 and one in omg (this obviously consumes drive space rather quickly) or the user 3) converts all his music to omg, and is forced to use OpenMG (rather than the mp3 player of his choice) to listen to it. None of these options is particularly appealing.<br><br> I am torn on the &quot;final verdict&quot; for this product. The hardware easily deserves five stars. As for the software, I sympathize with Sony's desire to fight music piracy (though I think their motives are probably more financial than moral). However, I believe that the protections put in place through the use of their proprietary format do far more to mar an otherwise excellent piece of hardware than they do to prevent piracy. Anyone determined to pirate music can still do so, at the cost of a little extra disk space or a few more minutes, and those users who, for instance, only have mp3's ripped from their own cd's (which does not constitute piracy) are still forced to accept the inefficiencies inherent in any proprietary format. In the end, Sony's software only succeeds in causing music pirates a minor inconvenience, at the cost of giving all their users headaches. So sadly, I must give this well-designed product a rating far lower than it deserves.

<Title>Vague Advertising
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this unit mainly because of it's size. When I got it home I found that I have to use Sony's software to use the portable unit, which converts it to ther format (not mp3 like the box states) but it would not &quot;optimize&quot; my mp3's therefore I couldn't use it as I wished. Oh I could play my mp3s on their jukebox, but that's not the reason I bought it, I bought it so I could take my mp3s with me. I went to their website to get help on importing and the instructions I read talked about functions that my software didn't even have. Upon calling them on the phone (which was surprisingly quick and efficient) I found that I could basically only use mp3s I downloaded from EMD (Electronic Music Distribution) which I have a good idea is affiliated with Sony. I really don't care for super-corporations telling me which music I can and can't listen to especially when I give them 300 of my dollars. Now I have to go back and battle with the store to get my money back. They should clearly state on the box &quot;Will only play MP3s that we say you can play&quot;

<Title>&quot;Open&quot; equals &quot;closed&quot;
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>All you need to know about this device is that its manufacturer, Sony, is a music publisher.<p>So they created this device to protect themselves and lock us out of having unfettered access to OUR music that we purchased in CD form.<p>Their software and memory stick technology use the term &quot;open&quot; to describe the accessibility of your music, but it's really closed, or at least limited.<p>It works like this: you copy your CDs onto your harddrive.  Then, you &quot;check out&quot; songs from the harddrive to your memory stick, much like you check a book out of a library.  At that point you can only listen to the song from the stick, or your CD.  It will be unavailable on your harddrive until you check it back in -- just like at the library.  There are also limits to the number of times/or amount of time you can &quot;check out&quot; music (I can't remember which -- that's when I gave up and returned the thing.)

<Title>Light, But Powerful
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I am thrilled with the Sony Network Walkman NW-MS9 I received for Christmas.  It is very compact and lite, easily fitting into any pocket as I take long walks or work.  The music sound is wonderful - Bose-like quality in my ears.  I like the 64 MB memory card.  It provides ample capacity for up to 2 hours worth of music or audio books. Extra cards are available. The display is informative and easy to read for such a tiny device, offering an array of options to improve my delight in this product.  Finally, the software for my PC is easy-to-use quickly enabling me to record favorite tunes from C-D's or the internet.  This is my first MP3 player. It is amazing the impact on your spirit when you have your favorite music close by, like a companion, regardless of your activities or destination.

<Title>The best music gadget
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I am always looking for gadgets which work, this one is  worth the money. I fly a couple of times a month and enjoy my music, however with the tight rules about CD players and other eletronics during flights the NW-MS9 is a godsend. Sound quality and volume level is exelent and the unit itself is so compact it fits in your top pocket. I found the music stick a great idea too, easy to use.

<Title>Great but has drawbacks
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I love it, it small, lightweight and just plain good looking. Sound quality is also really good. However the major drawback is sony's method of copy right. You will find out when you buy it if you use your own cd's a lot. If you like just plain old mp3 it is great but if you want to use your own mp3 dont buy it.

<Content>I got this as a present and didn't initially have problems with the walkman.  Then one day at the gym it just stopped working.  I called Sony Repair and got someone immediatly.  They couldn't fix it over the phone so they asked me to send it to the repair center.  Lots of calls and three months later I got the walkman back, but no battery or memory card.  Lots more calls and 1.5 months later I got a new memory card and battery back.  According to the service center water got into the case and caused the problem.  Now I still use it at the gym, but I have a casing over the walkman to ensure no more water gets in.  The walkman is high maintenance, I wanted an MP3 player that acted like a walkman.  Now I have an MP3 player that must be handled with care.

<Title>Great Size, Terrible Software
<Date>Sun Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I reject Sony's policy of trying to make everyone use their proprietary format. Yes, you can use MP3 and WMA, but it converts it to Sony's encrypted format. As if they are the MP3 police, you can only download and upload the music several times before it cuts you off. I own this music! I can do as i want with it.

<Title>Run, do not walk, away from this device.
<Date>Tue Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Sony, the greedy bastards that brought you Betamax, are back at it again with this digital music player.  IT IS NOT AN MP3 PLAYER.  It converts all mp3 files into a proprietary code that makes using the files for anything other than this player impossible.  Unless you want to have two versions of every song on your hard drive, one for Sony and one for everything else, do yourself a favor and buy a real mp3 device.

<Title>Expensive for the market, not very durable
<Date>Sun Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you are scrolling through all these reviews trying to find a pattern you might be hard pressed. I think people went a little overboard with '5 stars' well I guess just in my opinion. This player took a bit to figure out on the software side, and all the stories on the format issues are true.<p>Sony's customer support for this devices driver updates, software, and repair is very poor. It is very difficult to find an email address, phone #, or contact. I have seen other MP3 portable type devices that have a much more friendly support model. I think I'm pretty patient too, but considering what I paid for this I think it shouldn't be that hard.<p>Also mind the battery door it breaks after normal use in my case (about 2 months after warranty). What is the kicker is the battery door holds the battery powering the device and you have to fix it somehow if you want to use the device. Mind you the repair Sony wants to charge is like $59.95 (w/o parts) so at that rate you may be able to buy a cheaper player!<p>My end advice is if you find yourself reading all these review pay attention to the battery, software points. You are paying a lot of money for this, don't risk it on this one.

<Content>Don't buy ANYTHING that uses Sony's crappy greedy proprietary ATRAC system! YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!  I had a Sony MD that made you convert mp3's to ATRACS and I couldn't download mp3's off the net and listen to them no matter what I did! I download sermons from my church web site but thanks to Sony's greed they won't let me listen to them!  This is going WAY too far!  Just because Sony has such a large industry share of the music available, and they want to protect it, they will make buyers of their players jump through hoop after hoop to listen. I hope their greed comes back and bites them on the butt!!
