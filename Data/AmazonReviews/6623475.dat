<Title>Would not buy again.
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item in pink back in April, by May the hard drive crashed... I sent it back to the company for repair and I have been waiting a month for it to be returned. I love the unit itself but the customer service is the most horrible that I have ever received.  I will not purchase another product from this company.

<Title>Have had for about a year
<Date>Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this little guy at Fry's for $100. I don't use it heavily, but it has been just fine for me for a year, and I wonder why it hasn't gotten any better press. I've had no interaction with the company or tech support, but they just released a new firmware for it, so it has been on their minds. The number one reason I got this is that it is ONLY one I could find which supports bookmarks. I listen to a lot of talk radio and audio books, and I want to be able to move from one recording to another and not lose my place when I go back to one I started earlier and this guy does it, via its bookmarks. I also don't have to use any Itunes-type proprietary software. I just hook it up to my laptop and it appears just as any other hard drive. I create a folder, click/drag my audio, and I'm done. Even the on-device user interface is Explorer-like, and intuitive. Don't tell him, but I just bought another one for my brother's birthday....  :O)  Dave

<Title>I wasn't going to pay for a IPOD!
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My friend got this after her mom got one.  So I jumped on the bandwagon 3rd and haven't regretted it.  It can store for me up to 1500 songs, but that could be because many of my songs are over the 3 minute range (such and Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, Dave Matthews).  I haven't had any problems.  Definately worth the price.

<Title>Gmini XS100
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Gmini XS100 has the capability to play eaudio books and that was my primary reason for purchasing this player.  I'm very pleased with this product, the compact size, ease of download, storage capacity.

<Title>Worked great for two months
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved this little guy when I got it, does everything.  Then it started loading everything REALLY slow, and then eventually it just stopped all together, it says hard drive not found.  Still awaiting to see if I can get the warranty honored, only 2 months old.

<Title>Good product-poor unit
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Based on trial use of the product a unit was ordered through Amazon.com. The unit was delivered in non-working condition. Exterior of package did not warrant refusal but interior packing material was skimpy. The hard drive of the unit was apparently not functional. On July 24,'07 unit was returned (at my cost) for repair under the manufacturer's guarantee. It has not yet been returned

<Title>Small and slim but has great sound and quality
<Date>Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great little unit for listening to audio books or music. Pros: For audiobooks the Archos has the capablility of bookmarking, pausing, rewinding, and forwarding. The sync with Windows Media 10 took some time to figure out but after that it is simple to do. Cons: The Archos has a rechargable battery but doesn't come with an AC adaptor.  In order to charge the unit, you have to plug it into your computer USB port making sure your computer is on. Also, the directions say that the manual is on the unit but actually you have to go to their website and download it to your computer.  But this also saves you space on your Archos.
