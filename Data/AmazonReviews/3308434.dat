<Title>Simply Horrible
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased 1 for my wife for x-mas, and it kept crashing every time you'd try to scroll through your music files. To make matters worse, the user's manual was so poorly written in "English" that it was incomprehensible. At first, I thought I had a bad unit, so I took it back (to CopmUSA) and got a replacement. The second unit was performing exactly like the first one. I returned that, and with the same money (actually $4 less) I bought a SanDisk mp3 player that works much better. This Centon product is just plain lousy. Avoid it like the plague.

<Title>Not really "USB 2.0" - fair otherwise
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I expected the "Hi-Speed" version of USB 2.0 when I saw the "plug and play USB 2.0 direct connection built in" thing in this item's information - but I was dead wrong.  They are using a technicality in the USB 2 spec that allows them to refer to USB 1.1 speeds as "USB 2.0 Full Speed" - it's a USB 1.1 device in everything but name , and thus 40x slower than a real USB 2.0 "Hi-Speed" device.    That said, the MP3 player is at least functional, and it has more bells and whistles than the equivalent player from Apple (backlit display, FM tuner and voice recording).  Haven't had any crashes so far - if I did I might try a firmware update when Centon offers it.  If you can handle the USB 1.1 speeds, and especially if you have gift certificates or a discount, this would be a fair - not great - choice.

<Title>I Really Don't recommend it!
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased it on COMPUSA, and I wasn't sure to buy it, but it was the only one with an included USB connector. When I first opened it, I noticed how weak the battery cover and USB plug were, because they can be opened with almost no effort, making it easy to accidentaly drop and lose. Despite it's features, the battery will last for about 3 hours or less playing music, and it happened that sometimes the screen will go black and I have to remove the battery, wait some seconds, and reinstall it to make it work again! I also purchased a Sandisk SANSA m200 for a friend of mine, and definitely, it has a more robust design and more easy-to-use interface, and battery will last for more hours! Sure it is cheaper than others brands, but the quality on the product is definitely inferior. Please don't waste your money!

<Title>Simple and cheap

<Content>Let just be honest and say the product is worth its value. If you want something with video, thousands of songs, and stores pictures maybe you should get an IPOD. If you want something to just put some music on and work out or if your on the Go then its good. People rating this product are all expecting qualities of an IPOD. If you want that quality then spend $300. If you want to get something worth the value of 20$-30$ then this is a good product
