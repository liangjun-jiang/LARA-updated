<Title>Awesome!

<Content>I bought the Sony NWZA816PNK (Pink 4GB Walkman Video MP3 Player) as a replacement for my wife's 4GB Creative Labs player after she ran that one over with the car (she says it was an accident).  The Creative was good, but until they just came out with a firmware upgrade, had some nagging problems.  But this Sony unit is absolutely fantastic. The ear bud headset is high quality and there's plenty of volume in this little player for anyone's deaf ears.  My Wife absolutely LOVES this thing. We bought a belt clip for it and she uses that on an armband.  The only thing I'd like to see is a silicone protective case for it with a clip on the back, but there's little else that I could suggest for improvements for this little powerhouse.  If you're looking for MP3 and Video playback in the 4GB range, get this baby! But unless you're a girl or it's for a girl, stay with the more masculine colors.

<Content>This is the best Christmas gift that my husband has ever given me. Terrific sound quality with a choice of three different ear bud sizes for comfort. Easy controls to use and lots of options.Amazingly clear and large screen.  I've spent the last year borrowing my teenage son's 4gb Ipod Nano and I like this Sony much better and because it's not Apple, I'm not limited to only downloading music from Itunes. I have the belt clip and the arm band and have been to the gym and done chores around the house with it easily. I highly recommend this over an Ipod!!

<Content>Not being able to delete files on the mp3 player combined with the fact that the thumbnails are not displayed in Windows Explorer makes deleting music and pictures a bit cumbersome. I had to write the file names down and keep unplugging and replugging in the Walkman. Learning the sync function in Windows Media Player took some trial and error since I didn't want to put all the pictures on my hard-drive into my mp3 player!  However, I love the thumbnails that are automatically downloaded and displayed for your albums! The interface is easy to use. The earphone are fabulous and the sound is awesome! I got the pink one and saved some money, plus it's VERY pretty. It looks purple in the picture but it's actually a nice shade of glittery pink.

<Title>Pretty in Pink!

<Content>I recently purchased this mp3 (my first one!) in pink because my husband has one (in black,not pink) and he loves it.  After watching him play with his awhile I decided I had to have one.  He researches everything he buys and felt this one would be the best bang for the buck and he was right.  I had never used an mp3 player before but the first time I put my earbuds on I was hooked!  The sound is incredible!  I prefer to listen to music with my player over any music on the radio now.  Also, this is so easy to use, we signed up for Rhapsody and for electronic dummies like me, it was a cinch.  My hubby talked me into buying the pink (against my better judgement- pink?  yeah right!)  But it is the prettiest pink I have ever seen on an electronic gadget.  I am proud to sport my pink mp3 player.  I recommend getting the clip though because I don't have a place to put it except in my bra- yuck.  I also ordered the hard case for it because I don't want a scratch on my pretty pink- not one!  Oh, and if you're going to buy one, check the prices at Best Buy first- I got mine there for 119.00, it's currently 133.00 on Amazon- don't know why, they're usually cheaper than Best Buy any day.

<Content>Perfect for someone who loves music! I have 300 pictures and 200 songs on it, and still have 2.2 GB of space left over! Highly recommend.
