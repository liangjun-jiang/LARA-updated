<Title>Weeeeeeeeee!
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's a good item. I haven't tried any other mp3 players so I have no basis to compair.   It caught my eye with the color screen, which is really nice to have some graphics on your hip. The user interface is real easy to use. I have yet to read the manual and I have no reason to. The audio quality is nice. The little bud earphones give sufficiant sound quality. I like the image viewer. It could use a couple more cool features to utilize the color screen. More graphics or such. It has a screen saver function and it'd be nice to use a custom image. Audio options are excellent. You can adjust just about anything.   It's small, light weight, very versitle and easy to use. It comes with a good ammount of accessories.  I have nothing really negative to say about this product. It's real good and I'm happy with it except i'd go for the 1 gig @ 200 instead of 512 @ 150.   Cheers! ;D

<Date>Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The YP-T7X is a solid mp3 player.  The FM radio works well.  It is a good device to use while running.  I also have a Creative Zen and the two devices are complimentary (one for storing all of my music and one for use while running).

<Title>Samsung hit the nail right on the head
<Date>Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is perfect for my everyday transit to school of about 1 hour everyday. The bass response and high frequencies are noted very well on the included ear buds. The lanyard and hip clip are well constructed too.  My brother has dealt with his apple, and I do feel sorry for him. He had a 512MB iPod shuffle. It worked fine for a long while until he tried to remove one song and iTunes ended up removing all of the songs. The software is much simpler on the Samsung, because if you are running Windows XP no additional software is needed. All you do is drag from anywhere in your computer and drop into your removable drive folder where the Samsung USB is attatched.  I have dropped it onto cement on several occasions and have found no damage to the case or the storage capabilities. I have also placed text and images and they are easily viewed on the high resolution screen.   And at a price of only $150 its a mini-mini-iPod with built in practicality, or you can think of it as a mass storage USB device with a headphone jack, either way you still get a great working device.

<Title>Beware!  Early release batch defective!
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this unit in late February and within a week it malfunctioned.  The unit turned on with the "locked" displayed eventhough the "Hold" switch was in the OFF position.  I couldn't do anything with it other than turning the unit ON and OFF.  When I called Samsung tech support, it took them less than thirty seconds to diagnose the problem; they already knew about the defect.  My conversation with them gave me the impression there were many returns from the early releases of this unit.  The unit I purchased was manufactured in January 2005.  (For those considering purchasing this unit, note that there's no way to find out the manufacturing date until after you open the package.  The date stamp is on the back of the unit.)  I sent my defective player in for repair and received a refurbished one back.  I was dissappointed at paying so much for a new unit only to end up with a refurbished one.  The other reviewers were lucky to get a working player; I was not so lucky.

<Title>excellent sound and only a few quirks
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is the first MP3 player that I actually like.  It has a customizable equalizer to get the sound to sound just the way you want it.  Very very few MP3 players let you do that and it is something I believe should be in all MP3 players. The player is small but has a bright color display.  The player doesn't require any additonal software in Windows XP.  You simply drag files between your computer and the player in "My Computer": it is that easy.  There are a few quirks.  The little stick that you use to move around the interface is a little too loose.  You can move it up and the player will think you mived it left or right.  Similarly, manuvering around the interface with the little stick takes a few tries before you figure out how to find the options you want.  But these are minor complaints for such a feature-rich and small mp3 player.  Battery life is OK at max 10 hours.

<Title>I loved it for the 3 hours it worked
<Date>Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A disclaimer:  The sheer gloriousness of this little player earned it the two stars, which is remarkable considering it broke.  I can't imagine how popular this is gonna be if they ever get it right.  This is a gorgeous little player, easy interface, great color screen, rich beautiful sound and works with Windows media player.  HOWEVER, I got the first one this past Saturday, used it for 2 hours....Saturday night it just wouldn't work at all, no matter what I did it wouldn't turn on, I did everything the troubleshooting guide told me to.  So I returned it Sunday morning for a new one.  It worked beautifully Sunday evening...played it for about an hour.  Monday evening, I left the house, got in the car, tried to turn it on..same problem, just refused to turn on no matter what I did.  It's really a shame too, because I just adored it, it was so cute and sounded excellent, and I got photos on it and everything, and it was the size of a zippo lighter.  For 3 hours, I was the envy of my friends.  I returned it Monday for the clunkier but seemingly more solid Zen Micro, and so far so good, but after reading some reviews I'm not too hopeful about that one either.  If this one messes up, I just may scrap the whole idea of ultra-portable music and stick to cd's.  I would suggest you wait two years to buy an mp3 player...wait till they've figured out how to make ones that work right.

<Title>Coolest MP3 player around!
<Date>Sun Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player ROCKS! And here's why: 1. It sounds great 2. It's the size of a book of matches and weighs like one ounce 3. It has a color screen 4. Has rechargeable battery 5. Is simple to use and navigate once you are familiar with it 6. No moving parts, it's a flash drive 7. No extra software required, just drag & drop in Windows, or Media Player. 8. It has a FM radio built in. The only downside to this player is the crappy headphones included. I bought some better headphones, and with the included belt clip, I'm all set for the gym. Ipod Shuffle eat your heart out.

<Title>A decent portable music player
<Date>Wed Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Positives: 1.The sound is great. 2.It's really small. 3.It is easy to transfer music to and from the device. 4.Color screen is amusing.  Negatives: 1.Unit controls are lacking.  Navigation through the unit's features and songs is tedious. 2.Short battery life. 3.Screen is too small. 4.Bundled software is not very useful.  Additional notes: The samsung yp-t7x is easily the best portable music player I've ever owned.  However, the only other portable music players I've used were CD players, cassette walkmans, and a minidisc player. I don't know how it stacks up against other MP3 players.

<Title>Great interface & features - ipod is jealous
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I highly recommend this player. I did alot of research on the web and this had everything I wanted. A radio, recording, color screen and easy drag and drop song loading. It works seamlessly with windows media player at home and at work I trasfer files onto it from a mac with no problems. I have not a single regret purchasing this product. It holds enough songs, the interface is so simple that I can switch songs and turn up the volume without pulling it out, and so far it is quite durable. I think if I bought an ipod I would have deeply regreted it. Everyone I know that has had an ipod has sent it in for expensive servicing several times and the price for an ipod is too much for no radio, no line in and being locked into using itunes suxxx. Get this player, you won't regret it!

<Title>Great subscription player
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I tried the iRiver equivalent, but the interface was terrible and I had problems after I flashed the firmware (look at the discussion forums).  I then bought the Samsung, and it has been a dream - great price, size, sound and interface.  No support for playlists (hence, a 4), but I haven't needed them with the built in ability to select by author.  I am using it with Yahoo Music.  The Samsung and Yahoo are a perfect match.  Note - if you use podcasts go with the 1Gb model, 512Mb is not large enough.

<Title>Excellent MP3 plus for a newbie
<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had experience with MP3s with my pocket computer but I decided to get an MP3 player stand alone. For the convience mostly since its size is a fraction of my pocket computer and for sound quality.  I did some research and I decided against IPODs. They are NOT good value for the money plus I did not want to be tied to Itunes. Also I personally enjoy the radio. I wanted an MP3 player with a radio. I went with this one after checking the Web for reviews.  I have had my player a few days now. Overall I am very pleased. The FM tuner is superb. The sound is very good. Especially with the WOW or SRS functions selected. The MP3 player is great. Unlike IPOD this player has the nifty ability of direct in-line recording. What that means is you hook up an included cable to the line-out of your music system and the line-in end on the Samsung and you get conversion to MP3 at the bit rate you desire up to 192.  So if you have books on CD or tape you could record them on a low bit-rate.  I also like the ease of uploading files. It uses a windows folder system. The device turns up as a removable drive and no driver is needed for systems over Windows 98. You then just drag files over. You can create new folders to hold the files.  This I think will help a lot when I start adding hundreds of songs. Yes 512MB is not that big, but you can simply cut and then copy back over entire folders without much problem.   A couple more things to say about this. One, 512MB still holds a lot of music. Actually it is 486MB after the system software takes some space. But really unless you were hiking in Peru for a month it is not that hard to swap folders out. For any given day or weekend the storage is more than enough unless you listen to MP3s from getting up to going to sleep.  Why 4 stars? The picture function simply is a gimick. I downloaded pictures at the suggested pixel size and they look pretty bad.  Bottomline is the goods outway the bad. Especially as you can use this as a normal removable drive to transfer files and also to display text files. Very, very pleased and the radio and direct in-line recording make it a lot more nifty and usable than the increasingly narrow and featureless seeming IPODs.

<Content>I did a lot of research to buy the best mp3 player for the best price.  I purchased the yp-t7x 512mb from Samsung. I love it. Crisp sound, cool features, i almost boughtthe ipod but wasnt sure i wanted to invest so much money up front. Glad I didn't, the t7's great. I'd recommend it but do your own search.  4 stars because the accessories have been hard to find.  I did upgrade to sony earphones for 15.00 dollars at Target.  Worth the price, the earphones that came with the t7 were not comfortable.  Overall, excellent purchase, love it even at 120 some songs,

<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After reading the many reviews posted on this website, I decided to go ahead and purchase the Samsung YP-T7X. This is my first MP3 player and I did not want to spend a lot of money on my first one. I also wanted a player with radio. So far I really enjoy it. The sound is good,you will need to purchase new headphones to really enjoy your music. Small and compact. I would like to buy a case for it but so far no luck.If anyone knows where I can buy a case please advise. I wish the playlist was set up different. Good Choice for the Gadget person. Not a lot of money and a good bang for your hard earned dollars.

<Title>Good; until you get going.
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I chose this player after reading countless reviews and comparison to many other players. I decided to disreguard the warnings that it just stops working one day. Then one fatefull bus ride on the way to school, my YP-T7X stopped working. I spent hours trying to revive my $100 investment. But it was no use; with my warrenty out, I had a useless pile of plastic and metal in my hands.  On a lighter note it worked extremely well while it worked. Music was crystal clear, far better than any CD player I have listened to. The FM radio had poor reception, but considering I live in the middle of nowhere it was to be expected. The voice recording was great, gave me a chance to sleep during class, just record my teacher's voice and take notes later. I never used the photo viewer. All in all, its a good little; I mean little, player if you willing to take the gamble. I would advise finding another player, that is more reliable.

<Content>A bought this mp3 player because it had a color screen, but a week later it craked and all i could see was this swirly blue and pink thing(like your calculator looks when you break it). And Samsung of course would never cover the waranty. I accepted that i couldnt get the screen fixed, but i figured as long as it still played music, it was good enough...two months later, it stoped working all together. It can't even turn on. I'm so disapointed with the quality of this, that i dont intend on buying another Samsung product anytime soon

<Content>Oh how I wanted this little baby to work for me! Well, it didn't and it died in February of '06 after I bought it in December of '05. I went a couple of rounds with the business that is contracted out to service Samsung's products (because they don't do it in house). The service center was nice and accomodating but still couldn't get it to work. And it had all the options I was looking for (le sigh). I should have paid heed to the poor reviews and bought something else. Now, unfortunately, I'm thinking of getting an Ipod because of the great reviews on Cnet. I'm out $114.00, which I could have spent on a player that worked. Not happy at all.

<Content>I've had NO trouble with this device whatsoever and found the entire manual online with no trouble either--however I didn't need the manual to use it. This is my first MP-3 player and I found it absolutely amazing! I'm thinking of getting a second one for my son for his birthday in March. I highly recommend it, especially for the first time owner of an MP-3. I immediately subscribed to a music service and got it up and going, as well as loading up the cds in my collection from computer to this device. I use the timed shut off fuction at night before bed regularly, as husband watches tv that drives me nuts and I would rather hear tunes to relax. Can't say enough good about this one. Since it was a refurbished item, I went the extra mile for the 2 year warranty and strongly suggest you do so too.

<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased a refurbished Samsung YP-T7X 512 MB Digital Audio Player for my son for Christmas.  He had originally asked for an iPod Nano, but for a 10 year old I felt the need for a $150 mp3 player was a bit unnecessary.  After reading many reviews on this player as well as MANY others, I opted for this one and must say I am extremely pleased.  It's very easy for him to operate and add files to and he loves it!  So far he has used it everday and matter of fact is one of his "top 2 best presents ever" [ This along with the scooter I got him :) ]  Definitely recommended!
