<Title>Terrific item!
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a terrific piece of technology. It improves on its MuVo precedessor (I bought a 128 MB player 16 months ago) with a longer battery life, larger memory, and LCD window, while retaining the immense advantage of a digital music player *without* moving parts.  To my mind the iPod is overrated -- too expensive and too fragile. Plus the MuVo plugs directly into your USB port.

<Title>Great Device, Bad Ear Buds
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  I researched this model, and found that others thought it was good.  I agree.  The sound quality is excellent for such a small device -- better than CD and tape players I've had in the past.   The software makes it very easy to download songs to the device, as well as rip from CDs I own.  Takes some getting used to in regards to playing different folders (have separate soft and workout music folders), but quick to navigate once you get the hang of it.    Would definately recommend it for someone who doesn't need all of his music stored on one device and who wants to play for 1-4 hrs at a time (anything more than this, would recommend a hard drive device.)

<Title>great
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this player about a week ago. My computer at home is only operating on Windows 98 but it still works. I wasn't able to use the software that was included but instead used windows media player to change my cds into .wma files. To organize the music I just created folders by double clicking on the removable drive (mp3 player). The music sounds wonderful and holds tons more than if I had converted into .mp3 files. I had to check out a lot of players due to my older computer set up. This was the only one that I saw that could work on my system. If you're a little slow in the updating department I would highly recommend this player.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently puchased the 512MB Muvo TX FM so I could listen to music while running. This model comes with an armband (some don't) and is great for the job. It took about 2 seconds to figure out. I simply plugged it into a USB port, copied some MP3s onto it and I was off.  Like anothe rreviewer mentioned, the earbuds aren't great, just OK.

<Title>More than the iPod Shuffle (but not so Mac-friendly)
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You can read about this great little device's many features in other reviews, so I'll mostly direct this to Mac users.    Apple claims that iTunes supports this mp3 player, but it really doesn't.  You can load mp3's onto it using iTunes on a Mac if you download MuVo Helper, a little freeware application you can find online (search on "muvo helper").  Even with MuVo Helper, however, iTunes can't transfer its playlists to the MuVo; nor can it transfer Audible spoken word files.  Of course, the MuVo won't play Apple iTunes AAC files either--just mp3's.  With a Windows computer (98SE and above), you can upload mp3's and wma's (drag and drop using Windows Explorer, and create playlists by grouping files into folders) and also Audible files (with Audible's Manager program and Creative's new MuVo firmware, which you'll need to download from creativelabs.com).  You might also check out Red Chair Software's Notmad application (redchairsoftware.com), which helps you order songs into playlists.  Otherwise the MuVo can play songs in a few different ways: the order in which you uploaded them, or alphabetical order, or shuffle play.  So... if you have a Mac and no access to a Windows machine, you won't be able to take full advantage of this device.  However, it still makes a worthy alternative to the iPod Shuffle if you don't buy from iTunes: similar price, similar size, removable battery, a pretty good radio with autoscan and presets, and pretty good radio/voice recording as well.  If Creative were to offer a real iTunes plug-in, this would be a little treasure.

<Content>This is a great product in terms of price and ease, and better than the IPOD Shuffle, I might add. The price is very affordable. It is very easy to use, just plug and play, the person doES not even need a software.... it acts as an external drive.  Moreover, it tops the IPOD shuffle because it has an FM, fm recorder and voice recorder. I read somewhere that this product does not have a shuffle feature. Well, I beg to differ, just go to the play mode and select shuffle once, then it would shuffle all the music folders saved.  With all the assertions above, it is viable to say that this is a great product.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>I love this thing....
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my MuVo TX FM in the mail this afternoon, and it is a delight to use. I was copying MP3's onto the device, and playing them, within 5 minutes of unpacking. I'll also point out that I only have USB 1.0 ports on the system I am using right now, and the transfer speed was still very managable. (About 8 minutes to copy the entire 512 megs, around 1 minute for a single album). As several people say, the earbuds are so so. The belt clip is really nice, and the armband is cool. (Although, as a bigger guy, it might be a little snug if you wanted to wear it on the upper arm.) The display is great with a nice blue backlight, and the interface is very intuitive. The FM reception is great. (It's much easier to let it autoscan and assign all the stations to presets. If you try scanning around on your own without doing this...good luck) The voice recorder works fine, and I have already tried running the output to my car stereo. All you need is a little two ended cable if you have a line-in on your car CD player, and it sounds great. I'm no audiophile, but at least at a casual listen, the sound quality was the same to me as a CD in the player.   The software is OK. You can import an external playlist, and it will transfer a playlist to the player, which is cool. It does seem to take a while to import tracks, and it would be nice if the autoplaylist had a little more control.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the device. I have a couple friends who already owned them, and they are also very happy. Bottom line, why pay the same money for an IPOD shuffle with no display!?!?

<Title>Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I considered many different mp3 players before purchasing this one.  Several things made the Myvo tx fm 512 standout from other similar products.  First was the durability, I am not the most careful person, I have accidently dropped it on a few occasions, including once from the car onto blacktop, but if you look at it you cannot tell that it has ever been dropped.  Next was the storage capacity.  512MB is plenty of storage space.  I have yet to run out of space, I am now up to 38 different bands with about 3 songs apiece.  The price was very good.  Even though the iPod shuffle may be a few dollars left it is a little less reliable and lacks a screen to tell you what song you are on.  Another good feature is the navigation, using windows I made a folder for every band,  it is very easy to move from folder to folder using the small joystick.  I had two slight complaints with this little gizmo.  The first is that the included headphones are very small and uncomfortable.  I replaced the included ones with a pair of my own and and now happy.  The other complaint I have is the included software.  It probably works fine, but I don't have much patience and after a few minutes when I couldn't figure it out I decided to drag and drop and it worked perfectly.

<Title>Great product, poor build quality.
<Date>Tue May 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Must have bad luck with this player.  The first one I received had a problem with the earphone jack, in that if the supplied earphones were inserted in all the way I would only get sound faintly from one ear.  If I held the jack in 1/2 way is sounded great, but definitely wasn't of practical use in this condition.  So I returned it and got a second one which had a different problem.  This player made a loud hiss/screech sound in the earphone whenever the backlight was on.  Very annoying whenever adjusting volume or changing tracks.  This one was usable, but shouldn't have to make sacrifices on a new player.  Overall it has great functionality and sounds good and is the pefect player for my needs (jogging), will try one more player to see if the plant that was manufacturing these players was just having a bad week.  If you get one that's well made, I'm sure you will be happy with your purchase.

<Title>fantastic buy
<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i bought this item shortly after christmas and it is a brilliant buy and reasonable value for money. i listen to 'audio books' as opposed to music, so i cant comment too much on the sound quality, but the mechanics of it are great. it is very easy to use as it only has a few buttons and the dispay is easy to understand. regardless of how many tracks you have, the player recalls where you left each one so you can easily skip through them all (unless you let battery run out while youre listening to it, then it will out you back to the last time you turned the player off.). the earphones could be better as they dont stay in my ears very well, but from reading other reviews that seems to be the case with most mp3 players. the battery lasts for a long time but rechargable batteries are definately recommended to keep your cost down in the long run (and save the environment). the player is compatible with mp3 and wma and takes many hours worth of tracks in wma format- i have around 25 hours worth on mine at the moment and still have loads of room left! (this does depend on the 'quality' level of the tracks you download though, so again, it may be different if you want to listen to quality music.) basically, depending on the format and quality you want, you may need a player with less memory space than you realise- ill never fill mine! i thought id use the radio and voice recorder but havent really utalised either much. its a bit of a gimick and i could have got another 'creative player' cheaper if id chosen one without these features. the radio signal isnt great either and the auto scan only manages to pick up a few channels in most areas. overall i would recommend 'creative' as a make. when my first player arrived faulty i returned it directly to them instead of through 'amazon'- they swapped it quickly and without a fuss. i did have to foot the initial cost of the return postage, but other than that it was very good prompt service.

<Title>Easy to use
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been very happy with the TX FM 512.  I thought about buying the creative muvo micro because it was supposed to be small, but I think that TX FM is about the exact same size.  The thing that I really like about he TX FM is that it is very easy to plug-in to the computer and transfer music files.  This is nice because there is no need for extra cables to keep track of.  The other thing that I really like is that the MP3 functions are very easy to use.  I'm not much for boring instructions, so I went ahead and checked out the MP3 player without them.  I think that I knew everything that there is to know about it in about ten minutes.    There are a couple of things that could be improved about the TX FM.  The first thing is that the earbuds are big enough to fit in an elephants ear.  There is no comfortable way to use these earbuds.  Also, I really don't like hanging the player from the neck band.  If using it for running or working out, I would reccomend using an arm band.  As for any other issues that other people have mentioned, I believe that the firmware download fixed all of them.

<Title>Dead after 6 months..
<Date>Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have the Creative MuVo TX FM 512 MB MP3 Player. After 6 months of no problems my player just shut off on me yesterday. It would turn on, then after 20 seconds, it would shut off. I swapped out the battery, still nogo. I formatted the drive and tried listening to just the radio, nogo. I loaded the new firmware from Creative's site, nogo. So now I'm stuck w/ a broke MP3 player. Creative wants $50 to fix it. BEWARE: Their warranty is good for 90 days (not 12 months). I went to Creative's forum and it seems that ALOT of people have this same problem but yet Creative does nothing about it.  I wish I had bought an Ipod. Creative sucks. Their products work for a few months then crap out on you!!

<Title>Tx fm vs N200
<Date>Mon Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was deciding between the MuVo tx fm and the MuVo N200.  The basic difference between them is the N200 is smaller, lighter, lower cost, and has an input jack to record from an external source.  The Tx fm is slightly larger and heavier(but still very small and light in my opinion), and does not need a separate connector to hook up to the computer to download.  So for me it boiled down to an external input or convience to download.  Eventually over time I tend to misplace the external connectors so I chose the MuVo Tx FM.  So far I am very happy with it.  I just plug it in to download new music (I don't have to search for the extra cable).    It is kind of a pain as someone else mentioned to switch between FM and MP3, but I don't change over that often so it's not really a problem.  Amazon might filter this section out so I separated it.  It has to do with price and convience.  In the end I did not buy it from Amazon due to the price difference.  I had sent in several "found a cheaper price elsewhere" but the price was never adjusted.  I was also worried about service if it came D.O.A.  Amazon actually had the advantage there since they ship this product out of Office Depot, but the price difference almost paid for the extended service contract.

<Date>Thu Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>El reproductor de mp3 muvo 512MB es un excelente producto, las canciones se escuchan bastante bien. El mendel reproductor es muy intuitivo y tiene varias funciones adem�s de reproducir FM, entre ellas, ecualizador (incluso lo puedes personalizar), cambiar el idioma, bloquear los botones, entre otras.   Lo que me agrada es el software organizador que trae consigo, ya que compila bien las canciones incluso a 128Kbps, dej�ndolas con un buen volumen. Sin embargo siento que no es buen reproductor ya que no he podido conseguir el ecualizador.  Lo que no me agrada son los aud�fonos, pensque iban a ser m�s ergon�micos. Otra cosa que no me agrada es que por lo menos el que comprtienes que subirlo por lo menos 2/3 partes del volumen para escuchar algo, es decir que m�s de la mitad del volumen es in�til, sin embargo la �ltima tercera parte tiene lo suficiente como para poder escuchar tu m�sica favorita bien alto.

<Title>Great mp3 player for ppl who are active and want the basics
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are a lot of mp3 players out there nowadays, and I think it's just a matter of finding the one with the features that you want/need for the best price...  What I like most about this mp3 player is the fact that it does not need xtra cables to transfer data files.  I also like the way it navigates, like how it uses the scroll wheel for skipping tracks, as well as a separate volume button (though some ppl might prefer the joystick-type controller that other players, e.g. iriver has).  It is very light, and since there are no internal moving parts, like all other flash players, it is highly appropriate for active tasks, such as working out.  The player is also great in that it has an FM tuner that works well.  One bad thing about the player: the backlight causes high-frequency background noise while a song might be playing... in other words, if you are playing a song, and decide to change the volume or change a setting, or switch to the next song, the backlight will turn on and you will hear a tiny noise in the background.  Of course, I don't really need the backlight on anyway, so I turned it off completely (this also conserves battery life ;) )  Overall, I've only had the player for a couple of days, but I am highly satisfied.  It is light, it is thin, it does not need cables, and it takes in standard AAA batteries that can be found anywhere.

<Title>Excellent sound and features for the size and price
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own two Creative Muvo TX FMs and I am very pleased by the performance and features.   Pros: - Excellent sound - Equalizer with custom setting and presets - Ability to delete files while playing them - Comes with software but you can use it with other programs like Musicmatch, or simply use Windows Explorer to drag-and-drop files and folders onto the Muvo like any other drive  - It keeps the folder structure you create - Fairly fast USB 2 file transfers - Uses standard AAA battery so no waiting for it to recharge - Several playback modes; shuffle, repeat, play one folder, play all folders, others - Amazing number of settings and ease of use for such a small player having only 4 buttons - Easy to skip songs or adjust volume without looking at it; good for jogging or for driving while playing it through your car stereo - Good FM radio  Cons: - Tiny display - The maximum sound output is fairly low. Okay for the furnished ear buds or the lightweight headphones I use but a bit weak for driving an FM transmitter or the powered speakers I use with it. - It can't compete with hard drive players that store thousands of songs; but then it's 1/5 the price and not intended to hold a big music library.  I first bought a 256 MB version, then a 512 when the price came down. I don't need a 1 GB version, though the price of them has come way down, since it is so quick and easy to change files. 512 GB lasts long enough for most trips.

<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own 4 different generations of the Muvo devices.  I started with the Muvo FM 256 for use[...]  Loved it in everyway.  So much that I bought a Muvo 128 on sale somewhere for my son to use.  Then, I bought the Muvo FM 1 Gb to get more room and then bought the 512 when I saw it on sale as a backup.  Only 1 drawback I can see, the sound isn't as loud as I would wish it to be, but hey!  It's only got 1 itty bitty AAA battery... whadda ya' expect?  15 hrs of playing time is worth the tradeoff and the thing hardly weighs more than a pack of gum. PS  The included earbugs stink.  Most of them do.  Get a pair of Sony's fontopia (sp?) and you really 'see' the sound the Muvo's can put out.

<Content>Any kid could figure out how to use this, which dosen't say much for us adults. I did manage after some playing around to see how easy it really is. It will do folders so you can drop whole albums straight from your PC or single songs if you like. It will show up as an external drive even without the software which I have not even loaded. While the WMA files I am using save space even at the highest quality they still sound slightly compressed, this tells me the unit will give you all the detail in the music you need. It seems durable as I have droped it and it still works fine. The battery life is slightly less if you play it at high volume, If you run it into a sound board you will need the extra drive, also if your headphones are less efficent. Overall the best feature is it plugs straight into your USB with no cables. This is a good unit I fit seven complete albums on the 512 I think I need a 1g now. Have fun! Ray

<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Google the MUVO for memory problems, and you'll find several bulletin boards complaining about dead MUVO players with no acknowledgment of a systemic problem from Creative. I also had an external USB sound card up and die one day from Creative. They are not yet good at making external audio devices.  Don't buy unless you want a cheap MP3 player and you don't care if it dies. Otherwise you will spend half its cost ($25) on a replacement after 3 months, even if it is still under the hardware "warranty".
