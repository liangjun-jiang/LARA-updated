<Title>Sound it good, but that media explore has problem
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound of this zen 8gb microphoto is good, the photo is also good. but I found the software which transfer cd to MP3 called "media explore" is bad. When I installed it, true it works, but this software will cause you windows explore "not responsable" when you install it(even not run) regularly. So you can't use windows explore without unstall "media explore".   Creative's software design must be worse. That's the reason I give it 3 stars!

<Title>Love my Creative Zen MicroPhoto 
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Being an ex-iPod owner, this item definitely is better than the hype of Apple products makes iPod's out to be. I am very pleased with my Creative. I'm amazed with how much more the user can do on the player itself, unlike the iPod where functions and settings were barely customizable from the player. Love the radio and microphone features which iPod also lacks. I use these features quite a bit! I've convinced several friends to buy this product because I've been so pleased. And besides all these features, 8 gb is the perfect amount of space for most "normal" people... and can be purchased for the same price as an apple nano 4 gb, which I must say is too small anyway. This player fits right into my hand. The volume is also great in the headphones. If a friend is listening with me, I no longer (like w/my iPod) have to turn the volume all the way up and ruin my headphones to have lound enough music. Works great in the car with my iRiver FM Transmitter. Couldn't be happier with this item! Thank you Creative Labs. Way to go with this product.

<Title>Best miniature hard-drive player!
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Best little hard drive based player I've found.  I base this off the comparisons with ipods, Dell DJ's, larger Creative players, iRivers and other players that lack that "Je ne sais quoi" that I was looking for.  I have an older 5 gigabyte Zen Micro that I really like (so does my wife), so I purchased the 8GB microphoto for her.  It is everything the Micro is and just a little better in all ways.  Naturally the color display is the highlight here as well the increase in storage capacity.  I might note that the Microphoto is slightly thinner (about a millimetre) than the 5 GB Micro, yet it still has a choice of many different face colors.  It has lost none of its nice feel in the hand that was there before, in fact it was so well liked by my Nephew and two Nieces that they asked for them for Christmas.  I take that as major praise for the design since teenagers have quite the opportunity to see different players, especially the ipod!  Also important to me is software and where I can purchase from online sources.  This is important if you want to buy from Napster and others.  Ipod=itunes store for online music purchase, in fact you should check the online source to see if your player is compatible.  I have both Windows and Macintosh computers and I still choose a Windows device (maybe Microsoft is on to something!!).  Also the rechargeable battery is replaceable, I have replaced two ipod batteries for a friend on an older second generation ipod (not something I'm fond of) and when another friend's newer fourth generation ipod's battery began losing capacity I couldn't find  instructions on how to dis-assemble it, he brought it back for service for $85.00 and a day's wait, not for me!  The Creative software works well and is a good tool for organizing your Zen Microphoto's music and files.  I could not use my old Zen Micro Explorer with the Zen Microphoto, no problem though, both versions of software run fine together!  The software is a piece of cake to use and the 8GB Microphoto transfers files about 3 times faster than my old Zen Micro, I assume a faster hard disk is in the new machine.  The sound is breathtaking and you may use one of eight pre-set equalizer settings, your own custom setting or you may disable the EQ function if you wish.  Currently there are five Zen Micros in our family, four 5GB Micros and one 8GB Microphoto, they all work perfectly and I am very pleased with them!  I have read in some reviews regarding complaints with the headphone jacks, the newer ones do seem to have a different connector on the end of the headphone; however, we haven't had  trouble with any of them!

<Title>the little player that couldn't
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to admit, 8Gb for the same price as the 4gb ipod nano, what a deal!  I had this thing for a day and I tried to download the firmware like Napster says you should but my computer wouldn't recognize it-I ended up erasing the firmware on the player and the new version wouldn't download, leaving it on the recovery screen with no remedy.  I heard something about a different cable was needed to do that so make sure you don't erase the firmware without the correct equipment to replace it.  Anyway, I waited 3 weeks to get a replacement and I am only following the directions to make sure nothing like that happens again.  If Napster works with the player, don't try to fix it if it's not broken-I learned the hard way.  My new player is working fine, I did a lot of research and this one was the best-and the color screen is so vivid, it's unbelieveable that something so small could be so great!  I have a hard time blaming my 3 week wait on Creative, it just means that this little thing is the best because they were always sold out.  The 4 stars are because it is quite fragile-you need to be careful when you're outside in the New England winter weather and you can't jog with it either.  But don't let my bad experience taint your thinking--this player really is the best buy!

<Title>So Much Better than an I Pod
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The best thing about the Zen Micro Photo is the ease of use.  For many people who are not experienced with computers, this product makes it easy.  You install the software and your done.  You rip a Cd or add tracks already on your computer and then quickly put them on the micro photo.  I had the thing going 15 miniutes after I had it out of the box!  The Micro Photo is easy to use, has a removable battery so you can just buy a new one, without having to send the entire product back to the manafactuer " COUGH COUGH APPLE"  Plus has and * Gigabyte hard drive so there is plenty of space. Not to mention it's loaded with features, such as a FM Tuner, Microphone, and the ability to show photos. Creative makes a superior product and I recommend this to any one who wants more bang for their buck!

<Title>It's a hard drive player, not a flash like the Nano, so they are not comprable!
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is OK. I also looked at this before buying an Ipod. I found the touchpad annoying to say the least, although I did like the size. The controls were not nearly as responsive as the Ipod, and after using Itunes, I guarantee there is no way the software is easier to use. There is a reason why everyone buys Ipods, they are just better.  By the way-the reason the Nano is more expensive is because it is a FLASH DRIVE, which means you can bang the heck out of it and it won't skip or break, just like a USB. This player is a HARD DRIVE player, which means it has lots of tiny moving parts that can be fragile, so you cannot run with this player like the nano, and you have to be more careful with it. If you want to compare the Nano to another player compare it to another player that has 4GB of FLASH space--Oh, wait, THERE ISN'T ANOTHER ONE. I'm just saying, compare apples to apples, people.

<Title>Own it, had the competition, glad I switched
<Date>Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must say, after owning an iPod mini which I loved despite it's quirks (ie. clickwheel simply didn't respond in some areas due to being packed in a pocket with all my other junk for some time) then buying the Nano because everyone else seemed to love them. Promptly I broke the screen (ok, I'm hard on stuff), sending it back, getting it back(two weeks later), then after two more weeks the battery wouldn't hold a charge (hmm, overcharging over USB?, well maybe) then doing the return/recieve thing again, then putting it in a "protective case" only to find when I pulled it out the whole thing was covered in scratches, FROM THE CASE!! (screen really was fixed though, no more cracks, just scratches).   At that point I figured, oh well, I've spent more on less before and started to shop around. I found the microphoto fell in love with it (I actually prefer the fact that it is larger, way easier to hold). Me, being the compulsive consumer I am forked out the cash right there and then. Brought it home and wow, it can tune into FM stations, that was an annoying little bauble I had to plug in to my docking port before, thus making the nano bigger and adding leverage to a wee little connector. Then boom, you mean I can record those lectures that I usually tune out of because the girl that sits next to me is hot!?!   Then BOOM, when I plug it into my PC, Windows recognizes it as a removable harddrive right from the start, my backup program asks me if I'd like to create a new profile for it and Outlook says "would you like to sync your calendar to portable device?". Now I'm thinking, why did I ever like apple products?  Then it hits me, I can't use iTunes, my trusty friend. It was so easy to sync my music and I worry, will this be a problem? Then I open Windows Media Player (which, if you have a sound system like mine, you will know actually produces better output than iTunes, thus making it my default music player even during my iPod days, plus it plays DVDs) Low and behold, there is my zen again, just waiting for some audio goodness to be transferred (unbelivably fast I must say, less than one second per song).  Then comes the moment of truth, what does it sound like with my 500 watt THX certified logitech sound system plugged into the headphone jack. It sounds good, way better than the Nano or the Mini (which both sounded identical I might add, same audio processor in both, anyone who says different is a victim of their own mind) The navigation is different, going up and down rather than round-and-round, but not all that bad, especially when you find that little touchpad sensitivity setting. After precisely one month of use I am now a Creative touchpad pro, nothing can stop me!  Not only does the battery keep it's charge, (by the way, new firmware seems to fix the short battery life thing, had the same issue and now she gives'r for a good 12hrs) but hey, I can buy a new one for 20 bucks and replace it myself! I never bought any music on iTunes, but I can't imagine it being any easier than MSN music, seems to work good, and I can play my girlfriend's songs from Rhapsody, not limited to Apple (or Microsoft for that matter) music files.  Ya, It isn't as "chic" as the nano, or as popular as the mini was, but it is a heck of a lot better. I loved my iPods, but I see now my eyes were closed to the truth, there is life beyond a clickwheel, and it is much better.I get a whole boat of features you have to pay extra for in an iPod, which consequently makes the devices rather irritating to operate. (and why oh why did Apple put that little headphone jack on the bottom of the player? everything else seemed to fit just fine)  Best of all, when I whip out my Zen, people at my University actually look and say "whoa, that looks cool" rather than "dude, you got one too, sweet". And though I will never ever use 8gb of music, I do have some rather sensitive databases backed up on the player as a tertiary backup (three harddrives, two mirrored, one important files only, one removable disc and now the zen) that works with existing backup utilities, on any computer (windows based i would assume).  Now, you make YOU'RE decision.

<Title>Absolutely Delighted with the Zen Micro Photo
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am absolutley delighted with this player. The color screen makes the player FUN... otherwise no advantage over monochrome. Love the fact that you can create multiple playlists on the player itself and name them for future recall. Just love the way the menu structure works... takes a little figuring out at first, but not difficult and gives you so much more control over the player. FM radio is a nice plus when you just want something different. Battery life is more than acceptable and the battery is replaceable, so you can always carry a spare when you take that 17 hour flight to Sidney!! Very nice construction and I very much like the size... rests very comfortably in your hand... The nano is TOO small for me. The full size iPOD is TOO big for my use. Don't hesitate... you will end up loving this player. Hey, the 8GB is sooo.. nice. Oh, and one more thing... you can just drag and drop your mp3 files via Windows Explorer to the player... my favorite method... so easy... Also, when you touch a control the player lights up in a very pleasant blue color... again FUN... just like your music!

<Title>Incompatible with most operating systems.
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is compatible ONLY with Microsoft Windows XP.  Creative has really fallen short on what could have been a nice product by choosing to offer drivers for only one operating system.  If you have Windows 2000/ME/98, don't waste your time with this product.  There is absolutely no way to transfer files to it.  I had one, tried it, and sent it back for a refund.

<Title>Keeps on Surprising!
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Where to start? I've bought a lot of different Mp3 players. In fact, you might say I'm obsessed with them. I also have friends who have Ipods. (bah!) The only good thing about Ipods is the wide variety of accessories you can get for them. This little Zen beats them all, hands down! I'll start with the list of cons since there are so few.  CONS:  Touchy buttons. (even with senitivity turned on low, but easy to get used to, and there is a hold button) Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time. (?) Has ability to record, but has no line in.  PROS: (and this will be quite a list!)  Plays WAVE,Mp3,and WMA as well. (I have everything in WMA) Bass booster option. Smart volume option. Sound quality is great. I've read complaints about the bass boost being distorted. Turn on the smart volume and the disortion goes away. Crisp clean treble as well. Smart volume also adjust for different record levels. (quite nice) 5 band graphic eq, as well as plenty of presets. 8 gigs holds tons of music and photos. Very small. (fits in pocket comfortably) Works as an external hard dirve, and lets you decide how much space to use for this. (128mb upto 4gigs) Uses a standard 2.0 USB cord. (big advantage) Charge battery while you put music or photos on it. Not only is the battery rechargeable, but also replaceable. (you can buy extras for long trips) Screen looks bright and clear from any angle. Main menu is very customizable. (options, wallpaper,and colors) Easy to navigate. Almost no gap between songs. (good for Pink Floyd albums) Built in microphone. Seems to record pretty well. Has a calender where you can store reminders and events. Not so important, but it really looks COOL! Not a bad price for all it does.  LAST WORDS: At first I didn't like the fact that you have to use software to transfer files, but now I see why. I have other Mp3 players that are plug and play. It takes them a minute or so to boot up. Not this baby. Turn it on and it's ready to go in less than 3 seconds. The software updates the player when you close the program so that it doesn't have to boot up.  I'm not the kind of person who likes to read manuals, and with this player, I didn't have to. It's almost too easy to use, and yet full of features. I've also read complaints about the software. If you know how to navigate windows, then software will be easy to use, and it works well. I've only had it for 3 days, so I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting or haven't found yet. But it just keeps getting better. Has more features than I dreamed it could.  BOTTOM LINE: Buy what you want, but the Zen Micro is BETTER!

<Content>I never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. Wow I have owned this wonderful toy for a year Never had a problem with. I have dropped it! It rebooted and rebuilt the library. It does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (Think Felix Hernandez) Keeps data and photos (no Video) Create play lists whatever suits your mood. It's like walking around with your own theme music. An equalizer, choose your list random or planned. Play all or play some. Adjust the volume. Oh and another thing get your own headphones. Creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. But if your thinking of buying this at 8GB think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EA8U12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-1437992-4183657">Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB Multimedia Player (Aluminum/White)</a> Same price but get more, more more!

<Title>Don't last
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was really happy with my Zen Microphoto until it stopped working after less than two years. Creative offered me a new one for $150 (which is half what I paid for it), but I'll probably try to find one without built-in obsolescence. I think that a $300 device should last longer than that, and I wasn't impressed with Creative's after market support. My other big problem was I could never get it to work with Windows XP, although Vista seemed to support it OK.

<Title>Awesome Mp3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this Mp3 player over an ipod nano over a year ago and still use and like it. It doesn't compare with the new nano's but is better than the previous generation of nano's. It's well built but still should have a protective case for the obvious reasons. The touchpad was a bit tricky at first, but I figured it out in a few days just like everyone else.   The things that keep me from giving it a 5 star rating are the following; it takes awhile to charge and the wall chargers are hard to find, plus they're over $25 without shipping, if you find it. But maybe this is just me since this is my first Mp3 player of this sort. Maybe the ipods take hours to fully charge as well. The other thing is that I have an apple macbook, and so their is only one freeware program that lets me use this on a mac, but it commonly requires that I replug it several times to have it detected.     Bottom line is that the thing works very good.

<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player back in 2006 and it worked faithfully for me for two years.  The Good -the software is easy to use -the interface is not bad -the construction felt very sturdy -the music/picture quality was excellent  The Bad -the touch pad was not as easy to use as the ipod wheel -the cases that could be bought for it blocked the pleasing lighting around the unit  So I had a silicon case for my unit because I am a clumsy person. I have dropped it many times over the two years and finally, last week, I dropped it one too many and it would no longer start up. I have since purchased a "Zen" and am very satisfied with it so far.

<Title>Little Zen Microphoto mine
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first MP3 player and I choose a Zen after much careful comparison. The main purpose was for audio books, so I required a set bookmark function as well as compatibility with common e-audio book formats. Zen came through! I encountered some issues with initial set up using the ultra-sensitive touchpad, but these are now resolved with patience. I am thoroughly enjoying my little Zen. It works well, is easy to use and at 8GB, holds quite a lot, even some lovely New Age & Celtic music! I did purchase ear buds that noise-cancel to replace what is supplied. You should also purchase a rapid wall or auto charger as the battery only lasts 12-15 hours. The PC interface is easy to use and rips audio from CD with ease! Get a Zen Microphoto and ENJOY!

<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>DO NOT BUY THIS!!! This player has gone bad twice for me and I have had it less than a year. Creative customer service is awful. You have to pay them 12 dollars just to talk to them on the phone, and although email support is available it is not at all helpful. In addition to this,  if the product is still under  the one year warranty a 25 dollar "diagnostic fee" is charged each time the player is sent in for repair. Unless you want your mp3 player to be complete garbage in less than a year, purchase something else. I am giving up on this one and purchasing a different brand.

Menu a bit clunky I've had it for three weeks and am still not used to the touch pad.  I always end up selecting things I don't mean to. Who needs photos on an MP3 player?  I think they just add that to raise the price. I wish there was an 8GB without photo capability that was less expensive.  Overall To me the most important thing in an mp3 player is sound quality. That combined with the amount of space and the easy transfer of playlists makes this a good deal. I would buy it again if I had to do it over.

<Title>Not bad, but a couple of minor quirks
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a decent little player, with good sound, bookmarking support, excellent FM reception, etc, but it does a couple of things that annoy me. I bought it to listen to lengthy podcasts and audiobooks while moving around, but I'm not sure I'm all that much better off than I was with my old 512MB RCA Emusic1.  The Micro Photo is very ID3 centric, using the MP3 file's abritrarily defined tags to sort the files inside of the hierarchies by artist, album, and genre. I haven't found a way to also sort by directory structure, meaning that I have to explicitly create playlists containing everything but my podcasts when I want to listen to just music in shuffle mode. Not a huge problem, but it wouldn't be a problem at all if this were a simpler device.  More importantly, it lacks any sort of grip for a pendant, band, etc, meaning that the only way to carry this thing short of, well, carrying it or dropping it into your pocket is to buy a clunky silicon wrap to put around the entire device. That's not a huge problem for me, as I'm a guy who always buys big pocketed-pants, but it'd be a big problem for my wife  and anyone that wants to use this device while wearing gym clothes.  Both of the above problems are also present in the iPod, but are absent in most bottom-rung flash devices that sort files by filename. If you're deciding between going low or going with a device like this, ask yourself: Would you rather have to put up with this device trying to organize your files into a tiny little 8GB library based on their metadata, or would you rather put up with a bottom-end device that doesn't have support for bookmarking/file resumption?

<Title>why you need this one instead of an iPod
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this thing and I use it all the time.  I never leave home without my cell phone or my Zen.  It beats any iPod in my book.  You really cannot beat this workhorse of a MP3 player.  I've dropped it more then a couple of times and it still performs well (I use to own an iPod nano and 1st time drop killed it).  I have two problems with it: (1) really POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, they could not care less and thankfully I've only needed them one time (it's tough to destroy and the reset function  solved my frozen screen problem); and (2) crappy shuffle function.  I also have an older Nomad (which I love) and it has the same problems, you'd think they'd address at least one of the issues over the past 3 years.  You do need to be somewhat digital literate or know someone who is to enjoy all of the great features, as the Creative Labs line is not the iPod so easy a monkey can do it.  Not to say it's difficult to use, just not as easy as iPod and mine did not come with detailed instructions (although simple enough to figure out).  Now for all the pluses: (1)the photo feature is great (brillant colors); (2) as is the radio, recording and MP3 functions; (3) I love the universal cable portability; (4) the two-way music transfer is the best feature as far as I'm concerned, especially since you can transfer to any computer (like your personal laptop and home computer, etc.) not just the one registered like iPod; (5) enormous file storage capacity, we're talking a LOT of songs, etc. here....;(6) the sound quality of the songs is much higher then iPod since songs for iPod are recorded on their own proprietary file format (MP4s, I believe) which does not stand up well to other file formats for real audiophiles; and (7) the exchangeability of all types of songs, this Zen allows me to purchase foreign cds on my travels and save them without a problem - try that with any other MP3 player, I dare you.  However, I did replace the included earphones with better ones by Sony but that's a personal preference so I didn't deduct any points.  I also didn't deduct points for the quick trigger finger controls since you get use to them and eventually value them when you come close to filling the tremendous file storage capacity.  If you want a brillant MP3 player with outstanding functions then choose the Creative Labs line instead of making a trend statement with the latest and greatest iPod.  I highly recommend this player.

<Title>Good Player, but be aware...
<Date>Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've found this to be a good player, but please be warned that the directional buttons on it are so sensitive, even in the least sensitivity setting, that it is almost impossible to scroll down one menu item at a time.  The slightest tap at all on the button makes it scroll way down the list, making menu navigation nearly impossible.  If it wasn't for this extremely frustrating issue, I would give it 5 stars.

<Content>What a nightmare.  I have had mine for about one year.  It did well with the original battery, but when that failed, I have had no end of problems.  I put in a new battery and the thing locks up about every third time I dock it to my computer.  I have tried reloading the firmware, cleaning, and finally formatting and reloading everything.  It is still giving me fits.  I am now an enemy of anything with lithium based batteries (lithium ion, lithium poly, etc.).  I found out the batteries (looked it up in wikipedia) have to be carefully guarded during charging to keep from over charging lest they catch fire or explode. Then I found out the batteries lose about 20% of their capacity per year from date of manufacture (your mileage may vary depending on usage and conditions of use).  I am switching to a MP3 player (SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player) that uses standard OTC batteries and getting a good set of NiMH batts (with their own set of pros and cons) and a smart charger.  The unit has less memory and is less durable but is sounder, electronically.

<Title>Zen MicroPhoto 8GB  Rules!
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love it! I especially love the fact you can replace the battery. I'm extremely pleased that my public library, Walmart and numerous suppliers of music and audiobooks provide a wide selection of materials that work on it. It's a sturdy piece of equipment and it's known to take a few bumps (or drops with a rubber case). It is easy to navigate through the screens, and I love that you can preset a maximum volume. No damaged ear drums with this baby! I have long fingers and I'm pleased that the Zen MicroPhoto fits in my hand comfortably. I don't like extremely thin devices. I highly recommend it.

<Title>3 Strikes Creative is out!
<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my first Creative MP3 a few years ago, it's big and bulky, but I liked the set-up and had read warnings galore about the I-Pod. It worked well for several months, then stopped allowing me to dock and download anything. I bought my LAST Creative Microphoto last November. It freezes, it rebuilds, it freezes, it rebuilds. If you take the battery out for more than an hour, it might restart. All those hours collecting music... Wasted! I'm done with Creative.

<Title>Unecessarily Complex
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device has the potential for 5 stars, but there are a few things that keep it at just 3 stars.  I've only had it for two days, so I can only comment on usability -- not durability.  Here's my list:  PROS: - Nicely sized (3.75" x 2" x 0.75") - Solid feel - Excellent sound quality (as with other Creative MuVo) - USB chargeable (car chargers and travel chargers are available, but not included) - Decent play time per charge (I got about 10 hours today and still had a little charge left) - 8 GB of storage - Accepts assorted media file types (MP3, WMA, etc.)  CONS: - Over-sensitive touch pad (I suppose I'll get used to it) - Can view music list by Artist, Album, etc., but CANNOT queue it to play sorted by Artist, Album, etc.! - Overly complex menus that all look the same (you have to review the menu choices to even know where you are) - Very quick timeout on menus (you can't think about what you're going to do, otherwise it will just go back to the song list) - Not enough choices on the menu button (sometimes it only has Volume) - Does not show up as a removable drive on a PC (requires software) - No skip to next album/artist/etc. -- just to next song  My biggest gripe is that when you queue all tracks to play, it will play them alphabetically, by track name -- not by Artist, then Track.  There's no way to change this STUPID behavior.  It's VERY annoying to listen to a classical piece followed by Rap or Alternative just because that track name happened to be next, alphabetically.  When you browse by Artist, Album, Genre, etc. you CANNOT queue all to play (i.e. pressing play while highlighting one of these lists simply plays whatever you already had queued before).  So, you can't say play sorted by any of these, unless you manually create playlists.  It doesn't accept playlists from other systems (e.g. M3U files).  It has its own proprietary playlist files that can't be edited outside of its lousy and slow software.  Managing 4,000 songs is a nightmare with this thing!  I suppose I was spoiled by the magnificent Creative MuVo 1GB -- just plug it into any USB drive, drag files and folders onto it (showed up as a flash drive), and it had skip folder features.  If they only made one with 8 GB of memory...  The only reason I may keep this Creative Zen MicroPhoto is because I got a great deal for just $[...] after rebate.

<Title>Attractive, expensive, paperweight.
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had this player for about a year and it has never worked properly.  More often than not the software used for loading and organizing files does not see the Zen when it is connected.  This despite the fact that windows does see it.  On the rare occasion that it does successfully connect the Zen and the computer software freeze up before I can load more than a couple of dozen songs.  I have gone through all the steps Creative recommends in order to correct this all the way down to editing registry files.  I would give this zero stars if I could.

<Title>IT WORKED FOR ABOUT A YEAR....
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I BOUGHT A CREATIVE ZEN 8GB MP3 PLAYER LAST SUMMER. IT WORKED WELL FOR ABOUT 1 YEAR, AFTER WHICH TIME I COULD ONLY TURN IT ON BUT NOT PLAY ANY MUSIC. WHEN WE CALLED THE MANUFACTURER, THEY ASKED IF IT WAS BOUGHT OVER 3 MOS AGO. THEN THEY ASKED IF WE HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY; WHICH WE DID NOT. THEY SAID "THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT." THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WAS THAT IT WAS ACCIDENTLY DROPPED A COUPLE OF TIMES. BUT THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE DESTROYED IT. ANYWAY; I BOUGHT AN APPLE IPOD TO REPLACE THIS UNIT. THE OTHER THING THAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS UNIT WAS THE CONTROLS ON THE FRONT OF THE UNIT.

<Title>Compact and efficient, sensitive buttons, but poor reliability
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own three of these, and they are quirky beasts, sometimes failing to boot unless your remove the battery for a minute and replace.  But for the price, $130+ each, they should last a while.  The oldest, just 9 months old, has died.  The two younger ones live on.  But that's a poor record for the money, I think.  For the two that still work, the buttons are a bit sensitive and the menus a bit too complex.  But once you get it playing, it works well with decent acoustic quality.  I discovered that WinAmp recognizes it (an alternative to Windows Media Player) and I am able to transcode on the fly from a lossless format on my PC (FLAC) to something compressed.  Also, playlists were very easy to generate and download.  I discovered that some of the random playlist features of the Zen Micro photo are dubious, as occasionally the same song would play twice in succession.  Also, sometimes an album would be listed with each song twice even though in looking at the files in Windows Media Player, only one would be there.  Deleting and reloading did not solve the problem, but deleting the duplicates in on the player itself seemed to.  Occasionally the player would announce that it was rebuilding the media library, which I think means that it's own buggy software corrupted its own database.  However, after a few minutes, everything was OK.  However... I really can't recommend anything that costs this much which has a high likelihood of failure.

<Title>Wayyyyyyyy Better than an Ipod!!!!!
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had one of these for about 9 months now, and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! It fits in you hand perfectly the mini Color screen is flawless, the clarity of the music is great,and the fact that its not a Ipod makes it even better. The Little Blue Surrounding light around it is real cool to, but after about a few months you wish It wasnt there cause it Kills the battery. It holds a real good amount of songs, Records Voice, and FM radio. You can also sync your Microsoft Outlook with the Player its way better than my previous mp3 player, which was an Iriver. But I think that if you are looking for an Mp3 player you should consider this one.   P.S- Dont use the Magnet Tri-Folding Case!!!

<Title>get the original Zen Micro
<Date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Zen Microphoto when my original (black and white screen) zen micro was dropped several times, and then i broke it. to be honest the zen microphoto isnt any better thatn the original zen micro besides the fact that it can contain photos and the viewing screen is in color.  the fact that the screen is in color and it takes alot of energy to light up the entire screen, it seems that the functioning process to actually use the product takes a really long time-much longer than the original zen micro. the zen micro was easier to turn on and off and shift from menu to menu, whereas the zen mircophoto goes through some glitches here adn there and the screen freezes whereas the zen mirco doesnt. basically, go buy the zen micro its better than the microphoto and kind of looks better too ( i think th sparkly metallic thing going on with the microphoto is crazy)

<Title>Bad Choice!
<Date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it.  It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months.  The firmware decided to stop recognizing songs, albums titles, and eventually that there was even any music to listen to.  Now I have a 200$ dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PC.  Customer service? Don't count on it.  So if your into extensively troubleshooting, highly frustrating, pieces of junk, this is a great product.

<Title>Decent player, buy another battery
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this player for about a year now and except for the occasional song getting mysteriously deleted and the extremely inconvenient software to use on your computer, this was a good purchase for the amount I paid.  Be prepared to purchase another battery, though, since the factory one gives you about 6 hours of listening at best.  Also, if you are purchasing this over an iPod because of the radio function, forget it.  The radio works terribly and you can only get the most powerful stations.

<Title>What a let down . . . 
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase.  Boy was I wrong.  Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware, software, or other products like this one.  Now having problems with the product is one thing, but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats [...].  Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month.  My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months, I did get it to work again.  Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems.  OK, so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem, no go.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone.    Save yourself some frustration and get something better.  iriver maybe?  Just stay away from Creative Lab products.

<Title>Likes/Dislikes: A List
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are some things I like about this, others I don't. Some people have written similar reviews, but I want to add my 2 cents. Hope this helps potential buyers.  Likes: 1. Small, easy to use 2. Good sound quality 3. Good storage capacity for those of us who don't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers. 4. Some people have complained that the Creative Media software is hard to understand. I disagree, I found it straightforward. You can even change the titles, artists, and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player. Yes, I realize this can also be done in WMP, but sometimes you want to edit later, or you missed something earlier. 5. Replaceable battery. If it dies, you can get another one, you don't have to send it in to the company.  Dislikes: 1. The shuffle mode is annoying. It doesn't go through the entire playlist on shuffle. Once a song is over, it goes right back onto the potential playlist, and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played, to the exclusion of the other items on the list. I want to hear all my songs at least once before I hear repeats. 2. The Creative Media Center software doesn't install on Windows Vista. 3. This is a hard drive player, so no running with it. That's okay though for people like me: I don't run. It also makes it cheaper than the IPod Nano, which is a flash player. 4. The cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer. I don't like this because I'm not always around my computer, I don't lug it with me everywhere I go. However, there are ports you can buy (here on Amazon, even) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports, so that's handy. 5. Not as many accessories as the IPod, but not that important. 6. You can't view your photos while you are listening to music. Sometimes this sucks, but if you have a camera phone, or are in an actual conversation with someone, you probably won't be listening to your music anyway.

<Title>The True iPod Killer
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For anyone that has at least half a brain and realizes that, not only are they not all called iPods, there are other brands out there that produce incredible portable mp3 players, this unit is for you.  First, what most people disregard as minor, this is one of the only mp3 players that charges with the same cord it uses to transfer files. To top that off, it's a standard USB cord! That means Universal Serial Bus, silly... it's the cord that comes with every computer, digital camera, blackberry, etc. That means you probably already have several of them! So what, you ask? Now you can charge your player and transfer files from any computer! This is no minor feature!!!!  Besides this feature that I love (that is so hard to find in other players), the Creative Zen Micro Photo also features a replaceable battery. To all of you iPod owners that have to charge your iPod every 4 hours I don't need to emphasize this. Top it off with great battery life!  What else? The quality of the picture on the screen is tops; the sound quality is great (the earphones are good too); the size is perfect; and the backlight is too cool. It looks great and is the best mp3 player on the market, bar none.

<Title>Excellent!  Don't buy an IPod until you read this...
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I chose the Creative Zen Micro Photo over the IPod Nano for several reasons:  1. Storage space - Micro Photo has 8 GB, Nano has 4 (and costs more) 2. Rechargeable AND Replaceable battery - Unit charges through the USB cord whenever connected to your computer (this is a PLUS, because you spend a lot of time connected to your computer managing your music library).  Micro Photo holds the charge for at least 12 hours, maybe more.  And unlike the Nano, the battery is replaceable, so you can purchase extra batteries if this one dies, or swap batteries to keep music playing on long trips. 3. Compatibility with online music stores - This feature was #1 for me.  I'm a big fan of Comcast Rhapsody, and this player (NOT any IPod) is compatible with their Rhapsody to Go service, which lets you have UNLIMITED downloads from their catalog of over 1 million songs for $14.99/month (as long as you have the subscription, your songs will play in your MicroPhoto).  ITunes can't beat that.  I no longer buy CDs.  The day they come out, they are on my MicroPhoto.  4. Price - do your research, for an 8 GB compact-size mp3 player with a color display, this price is a steal.  I haven't even used the Photo features, but I'll love having an album of pictures on my mp3 player to show my friends and family at anytime.    The unit is very small; about the size of my flip-style cell phone.  That's bigger than a Nano, but very lightweight and a comfortable fit in the palm of my hand.  I didn't necessarily need a credit-card size player.  I wanted the storage space and the Rhapsody-to-go compatibility.  Negatives (and there are only two minor ones): 1. The world is made for IPods, so there are not as many accesories available for Creative players as there are for IPods.  However,[...] has a nice selection. 2. The touch controls are very sensitive and take some getting used to (I figured it out within 2 days).  My husband has an old Creative Zen Nomad (30 GB and the size of a small brick) and although it's no longer "in style" it works well.  I know my Micro Photo will hold up well over time.  Friends, family, and coworkers were critical of my decision to purchase a Micro Photo instead of an IPod.  Now, many of them want to trade their IPods for one.  Do your research - the Rhapsody-to-Go compatibility and 8 GB hard drive were enough to sell me on the Micro Photo.

I like the color screen, but it makes my pictures look blueish and i dont ever use the FM Radio Feature. I enjoy my ipod more, mainly because it doesnt skip, IS actually quite sturdy (it's made out of metal, not wood like a pencil, so think before ytou say it will snap in half; I've sat on mine a lot), and i also love the fact that it uses iTunes, which is an AMAZING program.  Don't get me wrong though, if you are looking for an mp3 player with a larger capacity than an iPod Nano, this is deffinitly the way to go

<Title>Beat Expectations
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I commute to work on the train and like to listen to music, audio books and NPR (news).  I replaced a 20gig Ipod with this unit and I couldn't be happier.  I was nervous about the user interface, but it has completely impressed me.  Simply put, it just works the way you think it should.  I design software for a living, so I know great usability when I see it.  The FM tuner is awesome (I used to swap between the Ipod and a Sony walkman).  The bookmark feature is great for audio books.  Overall, this thing is a nice piece of gear.    My complaints - can't view photos while listening to music.  Not sure how they missed this feature, it can't be all that difficult.  Hoping for a fix in firmware for this.  Also, the software used on the PC to get songs onto the unit isn't the best..but it works.  Overall, it was a good trade.  Until apple gets off their high horse and adds some additional feature/function to its units (other than watching a video...who's going to use that), I'll stick with creative.

<Title>Nice looking but hard to use
<Date>Sat Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I like what people say in their reviews. I agree and add that the controls are not easy to use. Even at the lowest setting, the touch controls are jumpy. If you are a push button type this is not for you.  The On/off/hold button is small, hard to reach and hard to shut off. It takes 5 seconds before you know it is shutting off.  The photo area is just ok. It was hard for me having 50 folders to navagate and to load up on the screen. It also takes time before it goes to the next picture. I could be wrong here.  THe light that comes off this thing can light a house. I was using it the bedroom (it was the first night, and my wife was not pleased as it lit up the room like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. I wis I could control the brightness.   The color option for the device was not great in that it all uses the same backkground, this dumb tech looking feel. I dont like it, and want to change it, but can't.  So why will I keep it. It works, and it is not IPOD. Basically I do not want to go I-Tunes, I am PC based. And that is that.

<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player puts all others to shame...especially Apple's line of iPod products. Why bow down to a company that gives their hapless customers zero flexibility when you can buy a wonderfully crafted, superior (in every way) product such as this? Just do the research. This little baby gets you everything you want for less money and more value.  The earphones are very nice. Don't use this machine's bass boost with them, though. They're fine without it, and suffer with it turned on.  Don't bother using the pouch that comes with it. The MicroPhoto will simply slide out of it; the pouch's strings to not stay tightened with travel.  The controls are a little difficult to manage at first, but within ten minutes of playing with it, I was able to use it like a pro. Between my husband's large hands and my own small hands, neither of us have any problems with our two MicroPhotos.  The display and the interface itself are both absolutely amazing. My one qualm with this little gadget is that its battery indicator will lead you to believe that one third of the juice has been sucked out of it within an hour or so of use. Apparently the indicator only goes by thirds, so even if you have 95% of the bugger still ready to go, it looks as if you should already begin to worry over the battery being drained. Hopefully this nuisance will be solved...other than that, I'm one satisfied customer!  Creative's products have always been dependable, of course.

<Title>iPods are #1 for a reason
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Whoa, what a disappointment!  Sound is way below the quality of my iPod 6 GB mini.  My iPod is charging constantly while I play it in my car with my Monster cable, and it is also charging while I work with my music files.    Maybe the new, yet-to-be released Zens are better.  One can always hope.  I don't have anything Apple, except my trusty iPod, and I will gladly replace my Mini with the 30 GB iPod when I run out of space.  You can't beat the clickwheel navigation of iPod either...awesome for those of use who work out while using our players, awesome for using while driving.  Once again, Apple rules the world of MP3 players.

<Title>Go against the flow, skip the iPod & get a Zen!
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>LOVE this little guy!  Added bonus of being able to set a fave photo as the screen backdrop makes it personalized.  The variety of colors that the player comes in is cool but around the holidays the only color available was the standard silver... was hoping for purple. :)  The earbuds that come with are top-notch, if a little big for my ears. 8 gb might not sound like a lot of storage but I loaded almost my entire cd collection plus half my hubby's with room to spare.  Love being able to use Windows Media Player 10 to load with ease... just wish WMP10 would let me organize the tunes once loaded.  You have to use the software that comes with the player for that which is slightly annoying.  It comes with two programs, neither of which does absolutely everything you need it to but they're both pretty easy to figure out.  Touch pad seems sensitive at first but there's a setting for it (low, med & hi) so you can adjust it to your fingers.  Also dig the organizer that syncs with Outlook (no need for a pocket calendar anymore!)  Thank you Creative Labs for an awesome little piece of equipment!

<Title>If you use iTunes, get an iPod
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall, the Zen is okay.  I could not transfer my songs from iTunes directly onto it.  I didn't like the headphones.  When the screen is illuminated, a screeching noise is sent through the headphones.  I also hate the software.  It has virtually no good options.  It's a sturdy mp3 player, but has its flaws.  I don't really have anything else to compare it to.

<Title>Meh
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got the 4GB in July, and took it on holiday, only to find that the battery life lasted half the advertised length, and that it didn't have a charger, and it was a pain to charge without the specified charger, which, by the way, costs an extra 0 (over in England). Took it back, and got the 8GB. It has a brilliant interface, is colourful, not overly stylish, but produces a great sound and picture, but it also freezes, skips tracks, and is a rather slow, outdated money making machine.

<Title>Quite good MP3 player, but charging is not easy
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Quite a good product, easy to use, the touchpad is a bit too sensitive for us older users, but my daughter, for whom I purchased it, loves it.   The unpleasant thing is the charging, you cannot charge it on a computer on which the software is not installed and the standard USB chargers do not work. Worse, the charging icon appears on the screen but it doesn't charge !   This wouldn't be so terrible (althought it's not very consumer friendly) if it was written somewhere (I DID read the manual) but it took me some time and seaching on obscure forums to find out.  Definitely something to improve

<Title>good sound and navigation, some technical difficulties
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Positives: - Good sound - Easy navigation. For those accustomed to iPods, the way that the MP3 player sorts your folders is by album, not by artist, when you look at the folder root using the provided program. However, when you're using the player itself you can search by artist, album, or track name. Especially helpful because you can search by first letter, which is a lot faster than scrolling through everything - Radio reception and recording quality very clear  Negatives: - Short battery life. At first the battery seemed to drain a lot faster than advertised. It is only if I keep volume at medium and keep the MP3 player on lock mode that the battery seems to last longer - PC program and MP3 player itself freeze. The PC program takes a while to load the longer I use it (perhaps due to more files?). The MP3 player freezes often, and I've come to realize that it often happens when it undergoes a static shock - not uncommon in the winter here. Waiting for it to rebuild the library takes a while and often freezes again - to fix it I have to take out the battery and then put it back in, and then keep it still waiting for it to restart. - Music does not play when you want to look at photos. Albeit I personally did not buy this MP3 player for its ability to store photos, it would be nice to able to hear music while looking at them.  However, for the price, you're still getting a really good MP3 player with a lot more features than an iPod.

<Title>Perfect!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to admit, when I was first shopping around I was tempted to just settle for an ipod. Boy am I glad I didn't!!! I have had this player for about a year now and it has worked perfectly since day one! You wont find a player anywhere with this many features for this price(it's cheaper now!) I had wanted to get one in a cool color but most stores only have it in black or gray, once you see the gray in person it's nice though. I have noticed a few issues in the other reviews that might help.  *The battery works just as advertised, the screen is so bright and gorgeous that it drains, the book says to lower the contrast to the lowest you can stand, that works great but i dont like that too much, if you dont keep turning the screen on you'll get the right battery life. *Its great that the charge cable also transfers files but something I didnt see anyone mention is that ANY DEVICE WITH A USB CONNECTION will charge this!!! I purchased the regular wall adapter and I dont use it. My stereo has usb and it will charge the Zen, mostly I just plug it into my Xbox 360 and viola! It's charged while I play music in my games. It cant get any better!!  *I noticed some people complain about freezing, maybe they are using usb 1.1 I use 2.0 and it transfers like a rocket.  *The only complaint is the you cant look at pictures while listening to music but if you plug it into a xbox 360 (which its completely compatible with) you can listen and look at photos on you HDTV they look unbelievable! you can even access your datebook and calendar on the Xbox, GENIOUS!! Pretty much just buy this player you wont be sorry, I wasn't and I'm sorry after everything I buy :)

<Title>I will be returning it
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, let me say that I am anti Ipod, for 3 main reasons-- (1)I don't like Itunes; (2) I find it beyond annoying that they have 95% market share and everyone has one, plus they make all of the accessories (have you seen the sharper image catalogue?!); (3) no FM radio and I like to listen to NPR on my way to work in the morning. So I was looking for a non-ipod mp3 player and decided on the creative after reading the reviews. My thoughts: PROS (1) look cool, nice compact size, I like the blue light that surrounds the player, feels very solid (2) sounds good (3) easy to use with windows media player  CONS (1) biggest con and the reason I am returning it--this thing is darned near impossible to use! The touch screen is unbeleivably annooying. It is so sensitive that you cannot ever select what you want on the first try. It takes about 4-5 attempts if you want to scroll up 1 or 2 items. Anytime I get what I want on the first attempt it is pure luck. I mean how hard is it to design something that does something as basic as being able to select the song you want?? Along those same lines, you cannot listen to a song and put it in your pocket without "locking" the device---if you even breathe on the thing it will do something unexpected and unwanted. (2) Cannot see the screen in daylight. Kind of important, no? (3) Can't listen to radio and search for music at same time. If I kept it longer there would probably be more to add.  Anyway, I have given up fighting with my mp3 player. There must be one that actually works as you'd expect. I will keep looking. I hope I am not forced to buy an ipod!!

<Title>Good Player-Not so good pictures
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and as a starter player, it's fine. However, the screen started giving me trouble right away. I lost a whole line of pixels near the bottom of the screen. The company actually states that they prefer that you return faulty merchandise to the store. Unfortunately, anyone who buys from amazon knows what a pain in the rear returning things can be and I am a busy person so I decided to live with it. The playback is good, although the headphones that came with it are pretty mediocre. Also its software isn't very good either. However, it's a good price for eight megabytes of music to take with you wherever and when it breaks, I think I'll be ready to invest in a nicer Ipod.

<Title>Worst purchase ever...
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I was really pleased with my Zen, it was great.  It had enough storage space for everything I needed.  Navigation was simple, though it took some getting used to.  The one problem I ever had was it's final problem.  I was listening to music and all of a sudden it froze.  So I figure it's not a big deal and I restart it and it rebuilds its library.  And it froze again within 3 minutes, so I restarted it and it starts in "Recovery Mode".  I had used it several times before just formatting it and starting over.  So I tried that.  However it refused to connect to the computer at all.  I tried any number of things to connect it.  The creative website offers no support for issues that aren't simple.  So now I can't use it.  And quite frankly I wouldn't use it again, too many problems.  So I went and bought a Zune.  I couldn't be happier, so thanks for sucking Zen!

<Content>My children like their Creative Zen MicroPhoto 8 GB MP3 Players, however we've had both players "freeze" within weeks of purchase--they just stop working (without being "abused").  Creative has replaced both players, but recently one of the replacements "froze" (two months after we received it).  We are waiting to hear about its replacement.  Bottom-line, we wont be buying this product again and wouldn't recommend it.  Too fragile.

<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Creative Zen MicroPhoto for several months now, and I really enjoy it.  The color screen is great, and I like the options to put your own photos on it.  It's really easy to use, and I like it a lot more than any iPod.  The touch pad may be kinda tricky to get the hang of at first, but I found it best to just lower the scroll speed settings.  My only real complaint is that the software sometimes crashes on my computer.  I don't know if this is my computer's fault, but it still works about 85% of the time.

<Content>This mp3 player is great, I love how easy it is to download photos and songs, the playback sounds great, lightweight easy to carry and so much better than the I POD.  The only drawbacks are the usb cord is too short and the headphones ear pieces are too big.  Other than that I would have given it 5 stars.  For the price you can not go wrong with the Zen for 8 gbs you have more storage plus photos that the I POD does not.  The case does not scratch like the Ipod.  Plus it is really nice looking ( I have the red).

<Title>The MP3 Player That Couldn't
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My "battery replacement program" Ipod failed and I was tired of Apple and Itunes in general so I searched on the Internet for a new player. The Micro Photo seemed wonderful for the price and storage was comparable to my trashed 10 gig Ipod.   I received the Zen and at first was impressed, particularly with the sound--I was using Shure e-5s at the time. However, after a very short period of time the headphone jack began to cut in and out and I knew from much previous experience that this was a very bad sign. Despite due dilligence in my original searching I discovered after looking deeper into it that the headphone jack problem was a common ailment.  By now, I had also fully experienced the navigation and download aspects of the Zen software which I would rate at about a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10--in other words--really bad and not intuitive at all in my opinion.  I decided to return the unit and did not want a replacement. The good news is that I ended up with an Iriver Clix, which although only weighing in with 2 gigs of storage, is so easy to use and intuitive that it doesn't seem like I gave up anything moving down to 2 gigs from the 10 gig Ipod. The Iriver Clix is really amazing and utilizes almost its entire surface area for viewing track info, album art, etc. You can also download video and pictures but I only use the player for listening to music, which by the way sounds better on this device than on any other MP3 player I have ever used. If you couple this player with high end phones like Shure e500s (yes I traded up from e5s to e500s and the difference is worth every penny) you won't believe your ears!  Bottom line is that if the Zen hadn't been defective I would never have purchased the Iriver--now that's a Zen thing!

<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was in love with it when I first got it. I wanted to get the IPod nano, but at the time it wasnt in pink. So, I found the zen microphoto and saw the colors it had to offer. So I bought it and it was what I expected it to be and even better. I listened to it a lot. I put it aside for a while. When I finally got the chance to listen to it again, I realized that it skips songs. I really dont know why it began to do this. I was disappointed. But its only select songs that it does it to, im not sure why. Also, it has a very low battery life. I listen for not even 1 hour and the battery life becomes low. Overall, I think its a good product.

<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We are anti-IPOD. We own a 6gb Zen, 4gb Zen photo & 1 MUV. So, I purchased this 8gb Zen back in Nov06 as a christmas gift for my teenage daughter. It did work for couple of weeks (from chirstmas till mid Janurary). Then it was the problem, when she was listening to music and all of a sudden it froze. So I figure it's not a big deal and I restart it and it rebuilds its library. And it froze again and again. I went to the Creative discussion Forum website and I found that everone has the problem. Creative should have a recall on this unit (this is not a cheap unit) So now I can't use it. And I'll send it to Creative for repair or replacement.

<Title>Better than my old ipod mini in many, but not all, ways
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player to replace my busted 4 gig ipod mini. This player has twice the capacity and feels sturdy in the palm of your hand or pocket. I don't like the Creative sync software that came with the player, but then again I didn't like iTunes either. I currently use Windows Media Player 11 to sync songs to the zen micro.  The sound quality is excellent, I bought a slightly better pair of over the ear headphones which helps a lot (Koss Portapros). I don't really use the photo capability of the player, after all I bought this to play music not look at photos on a tiny screen. It is nice to be able to set a photo as a wallpaper on the player, although it can make the text tough to read. I prefer this player over my old Apple in most ways (sound quality, build quality, sexiness (the blue light is sweet), option to change the battery, and storage space.   The one thing the iPod has over this player is the ability to rate songs from the unit itself. The option may be buried in there somewhere, but I can't find it. I used to use a smart playlist with iTunes which would add/delete songs from the player based on the star rating I assigned. I can still do this in WMP11 but I cant change a rating from the player. This means I can only update whats on the player from the computer side (ie, if I am listening to a song from the zen I cant lower the rating so the song will be deleted the next time I sync). This is not a huge deal, I just need to figure out another system for choosing what stays and goes from the player. This may not be an issue but my music collection is larger than the 8 gigs of storage this player offers.  Overall I am very satisfied with this player. The battery life seems great, although I have not actually fully discharged it and timed how long it lasts. Another bonus is that the charger transfer cable is a common mini USB plug so if you lose it you do not have to worry about purchasing a proprietary Apple plug. If you are on the fence about this player, wait for it to go on sale and get it.

<Title>Hardware=Good. Buuut....
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software is terrible. I've been a happy Creative Zen customer for around 2 years. I've had 2 Creative Zen Micros before I got the Microphoto. Admittedly, both of those died within 8 months of hardware problems, but we had some good times before that. The software that comes with is surprisingly good. The menu works well, and includes some interesting features that the iPod does not, including an option to view song details, and an easier way of making On-the-Go Playlists.   All in all, I've been quite pleased. Then I upgraded to the Microphoto. Not much has changed with the player. The color screen is nice, and the extra space is much appreciated. I wish you could view photos while you listen to music, but, as the philosopher Jagger once said: "You can't always get what you want". Unfortunately, something has changed: The way the player interfaces with the computer is terrible. Before, the interface was something similar to iTunes, where you could organize and view files in the hierarchical organization of Genre>Artist>Album. Now, the player behaves like Windows Explorer. The files are viewed by their file paths on the hard drive, which is usually 200 characters long. Basically, if you load on 1000 songs, and then want to remove an album and add a new version of the same album, you have two options. One: you can spend an hour wading through files waiting trying to find the ones you want or Two: You can remove all 1000 files and put them back on, which takes hours.  I used to be able to live with this, angry as it made me, but after spending some time with Apple's iPod, and seeing how flawlessly easy iTunes makes the whole process, I can't bear it anymore. Seriously, it doesn't have to be hard. Theres a reason Apple corners the market with these things. They're just easier and better.

<Title>It's okay....but Ipod is the way to go
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this device just because I was sort of tired of all the iPod stuff and figured that there would be other cool things out there.  overall, it works..  PROS-  REMOVABLE BATTERY! iPods do not have this and if/when you battery starts to lose its lasting time, replacements for the iPod are very very pricy and difficult.  WIth the Zen microphoto, you can pop out the battery whenever, and buy a new one if needed.  VOICE RECORDER.  This is just plain handy.  Furthermore, it records up to 10 hours.   CONS-  The biggest problem, for me, is the SCREEN.  It is impossible to read whenever I am outside!   Also, this is probably just a problem with my own, but the FM RADIO does not work! Whenever I turn it on it is always slow and hard to figure out how to scan for stations.  And by the time I want to quit, the whole device freezes!   TOUCH PAD.  The vertical scroll is sort of unusual, and sometimes if held to long, it will turn up the volume very fast.    Overall, great for the price, but I would just as soon get the iPod...

<Content>This Mp3 player stores so many songs and the music comes out crystal clear!   I decided to get a creative mp3 player over an ipod for two reasons:   1) I want to be able to replace the battery myself. The ipods are pretty much a one shot deal - the battery is internal so you can't replace them yourself (you're better off buying a new one than replacing the battery b/c it costs so much);   2) the cost of the creative mp3 player is a lot less.  I've had this mp3 player for 5 months now and have no problems with it at all. It's wonderful!!!

<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is the 2nd Creative mp3 player I purchased and when it's time to buy a new one it'll be another Creative product.  In my experience Creative's mp3 players are just as good if not better then the ipod.  And as an added bonus I don't have the same mp3 player as everyone else (and they're uncle's dog!)  Some people will tell you that the Apple interface is so much better then anybody else's, but in reality Apple had to pay Creative several million in a lawsuit because Apple stole Creative's file system! The interface is smooth and easy to understand and navigate.  SQ is great as well.  I encode all my mp3s with EAC and LAME at 320kb/s.  I also use a headphone amp, but anyone who hears my setup claims that it is among the best they've heard.   One of the great features about the Zen Micro and Zen Micro Photo is the size.  They are perfectly suited to be encased in a mint tin (think Altoids or Penguin Mints)  All you need to do is cut out one end for the headphone jack and on/off switch and line the inside with a soft material like felt.  You've got a case for cheap that looks cool and will protect your mp3 player better then anything on the market.

<Content>This unit is a good deal.  The OLED screen is sharp, the sound is good and the capacity alone is worth the price.  You can put your entire collection of train wreck sound effects and Glen Miller on here and still have room to fit 400 versions of Eleanor Rigby on it.  Even better is the user replaceable battery.  This means that you can hook this puppy up to a potato or apple and get CLEAN, RENEWABLE and TASTY electricity anytime you want to!  Sure, it'll void the warranty and fry the player, but isn't it better to take that chance for the sake of the Earth?   You know it is.  Buy this thing and a sack of apples, too.

<Content>I purchased this MP3 player after carefully comparing to othe MP3 players by other manufacturers.  The Zen Microphoto 8 GB player is not the best on the market nor does it have all the bells and whistles of some of the other players which cost quite a bit more but dollar for dollar it is a good buy. The user menu is intuitive and easy to learn. The unit seems fairly rugged. Mine has been dropped a couple of times but continues to work flawlessly. The Zen MicroPhoto gets one demerit in my book, however, because the touch pad is overly sensitive making operation a bit frustrating. Even setting the touch pad sensitivity to the lowest level does not resolve this problem. If you're looking for a good value in an MP3 player and don't need scores of gigabytes of storage, consider the Zen MicroPhoto 8 GB MP3 player.

<Content>I got this to replace my broken ipod mini. I couldn't be happier, the software is better than itunes, and its much easier to move music files to AND from the zen. I am definately beyond happy to have chosen this over another ipod.

<Title>Zen Microphoto Good Buy
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is definately worth the money, i didn't realize how small it would actually be. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend since i have a zen touch 20gb nd she didnt need something quite as big. Works great, the only thing i don't like about it that i prefer on my zen touchis that on the microphoto, the scrolling bar for music and volume are the same, so sometimes you'll adjust the volume when you're searching for a song or vise versa. Also to charge the player it has to be connected through the usb cable and won't charge unless your computer is on or you have a laptop and the laptop is being charged. But besides that, if you can get one for $150 like i did, its def a good player for someone that doesn't need to have a ton of songs.

<Content>Most of the time I'm pretty happy with this player, but it freezes pretty frequently, requiring me to remove and replace the battery -- a major annoyance. I bought it to listen to in my car, and the controls are not the easiest to use while driving. While I'm not completely dissatisfied, I wouldn't purchase it again.

<Content>Love the Creative Zen!  For the money, you cannot beat the value.  Excellent battery life, and easy to get to the battery if you had to.  No need to send back to the company like an iPod, which my daughter has.

<Title>opinions of a 66 year old on my zen

<Content>Quality sound. Rather sensitive touch control that takes a bit of getting used to. Ear phones are single size and drop out easily - hence only  a 4*. Nicely compact & solid - you know its in your pocket and it does not feel fragile. For a novice-computer person the software is not too difficult to instal. Overal - a good buy.
