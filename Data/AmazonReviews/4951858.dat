<Title>Not much of a good product..

<Content>After two weeks of the delivery of the product, one of the buttons don't wanna work anymore. I called the customer service but I haven't got a chance to ship it in yet for a replacemnt.  The unit itself does have some good features such as FM with recording along with voice recording. And plays folders as well but not as easy as you can select it. And also comes with several black lit colors as wel.  If your on an SD card, you have to start all over on the play list when you turn the unit back on. The unit itself is very fragile and the plastics can be easly scratched. One of the holders for the back battery cover broke off.
