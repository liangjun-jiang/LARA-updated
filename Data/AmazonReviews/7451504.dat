<Content>This unit is quite small and very neat. Firstly, it's quite affordable and is easily expandable to 2 GB, via it's SD card slot. The screen is beautiful, very nice quality for the small price. Movies can be converted to fit the player. For instance, I halved the size of a 260 mb file, but then, that was on the lowest quality setting (which was still impressive.) Sure, you may buy cheaper products than this, but this is a name brand, maybe not in the US, but I'm told it is in Asia.   Video files are converted to an .asf file, which is viewable via GOM player (free download which I recommend), just in case Windows Media Player doesn't recognize the file type (which seems common).   I bought this to keep me entertained, and was quite pleased by it's performance. But, at the end of the day, I decided I had no need for such an item, but a young adult might.

<Content>As long as this is just needed for viewing video it is a great deal.  Pros:  1.	The other functions are limited but the video quality is very good.  The LCD is just large enough to be useable for watching a movie.  The video is smooth and not jerky at all.  2.	Uses MMC or SD cards for up to 2gb (3.5 hours) of storage.  3.	Comes with good trans-coding software and all needed cables.  4.	Uses a cell phone battery so it can be replaced.  Cons:    1.	It will not save your place when watching a movie.  If you turn the unit off, you have to start from the beginning of your video.  You can turn the LCD off which can extend the battery life while it is paused.  2.	The documentation is horrible.  Like something from a 1980s PC clone with English so bad it is barely comprehensible.  3.	The unit cannot be recharged without risking damage to the electronics unless it is turned off (according to the directions).  4.	The 128mb included is not enough.  Plan on buying a larger SD card.   5.	The games and mp3 functions are so limited that I won't be using them, but it is fine for movies.
