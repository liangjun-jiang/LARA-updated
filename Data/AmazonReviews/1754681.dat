<Title>A Small Piece of Garbage for a Big Price
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product was an insurance replacement for my previous Flashtrax.  I very much regret this purchase.  My photography store only carried these at the time, so I really had no choice since the Insurance Company put them in charge of replacing my goods.  Here are some of my reasons:  1) 8bit file system. Not only do I use this product for my photography, but I use it as an MP3 player and to transport files.  Unless you plan on time warping your computer back about 10 years, to an archaic 8bit file system, the truncation if files is an extreme annoyance. ie: "myfilename001.jpg" becomes "myfile~1.jpg" and Elvis Presley-Rubberneckin.mp3 becomes "elvi~1.mp3"  Finding the MP3 you want; forget about it.  2) File Sorting Lord have mercy on your soul if you listen to Audio Books.  I do.  Let's assume that I have time to rename 150 mp3 chapters of my audio book if 8 letters or less filenames.  Then I HOPE that each file was created/modified in order - You see, the P-2000 sorts files and folders according to DATE and TIME.  It's incapable of sorting files by filename!! You can't create any play lists OR listen to mp3s in order alphabetically or numerically!  3) Slow Copying files from my Sandisk Extreme III 82x 1gig CF card is slow and painful.  Hope you have a back up battery.  4) Highly Proprietary OS. Ok, so using the P-2000 for MP3's is useless, but at least I still have my photography, yeah?  So I've copied a fresh batch of Canon files to the P-2000 and wish to put them in a folder for viewing (they call them albums).  What the?!  Why are all of my files being copied, then renamed to some Epson proprietary naming system!?  My immaculate Canon file naming system is apparently not good enough this lil baby.  Instead of simply renaming the, the unit COPIES the files into the new files with new names taking up a lot of time, and wear and tear on the hard drive.  Also, can you say "bye bye battery?"  In general, using the file system with Windows file explorer is difficult.  Folders (or albums) that you see while using the unit are not the same that you see in Windows explorer  Example, Lets say you want to create a new folder to throw other photos in from you HDD.  Sorry, no.  You have to use Epson's proprietary "album creating" steps to do this.  Apparently Epson is still learning how to use a standard file system.  So now you're created a folder called "Photos from September 04th 2005; logically, you should be able to plug in your USB in and just copy your files over, yeah?  Sorry, no.  Now you have to find the CODE name Epson gave this album in you folder list.  Just finding the folder with the name you gave it would be too easy.  Epson called mine "ALBM0254." This meant that I had to search about 250 folders to find the one I just created.  I hoped "ALBM0254"  was the right one to copy my files into.  The best way to know for sure, is to put one file into the folder, unplug the device from the UBS, turn it on, browse to folder 254, see if the file is in there, if it is then plug it back in and copy the rest of the files over.  If not, well, try again.  5) Bad Battery?  Too bad. According to Epsons documentation, , using the P-2000 without a battery (AC Only) will damage the unit.  So, if my battery fails me at some point, and I have the day's worth of pictures on this unit, I am unable to recover them until I call Epson and order another proprietary battery. $80.  Until then my clients will just have to wait till a new battery shipped out to me.   6) Media Support Not all it's hyped up to be.  I haven't yet found a proper AVI/Mpeg that it can play.  It claims to be able to play QuickTime .MOV files, but the only one that I've gotten to play (aside from the sample it came with) was some weird and obscure music video I found on the net.  As the only playable MOV file that I've found, I keep it on my P-2000, so I can watch it every now and then feel like I haven't been raped by Epson.  If Cavemen had Portable Photo-Storage units, they'd have P-2000s;  Old technology based software and OS  7) Extra Stuff: I was spoiled by the accessories that came with my Flashtrax.  I got a remote control (which I honestly did use) and external Video / Audio cables to connect to my TV/Stereo.  The Epson does not come with those.  8) Technical Support. I have tried to contact Epson (Canada) in regards to the file sorting issues (twice) over the last week, however I have not heard back from them yet.    To be fair, this unit is much sturdier than my previous Flashtrax (after all, cavemen use it), and the battery life is excellent.  The screen and picture are excellent.

<Title>Great Screen, Primitive Software
<Date>Sat Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The screen on this baby is gorgeous, but the people who wrote the software need to go play with a few MP3 players and similar devices to get a clue on usability.  The user's guide tells you that you may only copy files to a particular folder on the device; then you have to unplug it from the PC, power it up, and move the files to an Album by punching buttons.  It's been noted that all photos copied to it get rewritten with cryptic Epson file names to cryptically name Epson folders, which makes it next to impossible to totally manage the device from your PC.  The alternative is wearing your thumb out punching buttons to do it on the P2000 itself.  Sorting is done only by date/time, so if you retouch just a few of your vacation pictures on your PC, and then copy all your photos over to show the relatives, you are hosed unless you modify date/time on all photos.  Zoom in is a great feature, my only complaint is there is no single button push to back out to normal size.  Would I buy this one again?  I'd have to look really hard at alternative products.  Am I sorry I own the P2000?  No - I've learned to deal with it.

<Title>Great way to save your photos on the road
<Date>Tue Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this unit to save photos while I'm traveling and I can't bring my laptop. I shoot many many pictures when I travel and then when I get home I go through them keeping only the few best ones. Since I shoot large files, 12 megs, I fill up my memory cards very quickly. With this unit I can quickly download my cards and get back to shooting. The display is fantastic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that even though they have made it very easy to download memory cards into the unit, if you want to transfer files from your computer to the viewer it is a bit more complicated. But, if you read the manual closely it does work. There are cheaper ways to save your files on the road, but none that has a display as large, crisp and clear as this one. I highly recommend the Epson P-2000.

<Title>Photographers this is the one!
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just wrote a review of the Creative Zen Vision which I ordered and returned last week because of the incredibly bad screen viewing angle.  No such problem with the Epson!  The Epson arrived a few days ago. The screen is wonderful. Everything the Vision should have been. Clear, sharp and easily viewed from a much wider angle. No shimmering at all. Same size, same dimensions (640x480) but has a zoom feature that works very well.  The Epson doesn't have the same tight build as the Vision and the device is a considerably bigger in size, with a slightly cheaper, plastic body. Slightly bigger hard drive. Also has an SD/MMC card slot in addition to the CF slot. Essentially the same functions as the Vision but no FM radio. I didn't buy the Vision nor the Epson for the radio.  That said I'm really happy with the way pictures appear on the Epson and will certainly keep it but still miss the build quality of the Vision.  Video playback is very clean with no stutters. Sharp image. Haven't tested the music playback much but seems fine. The external speaker is fair for such a device but certainly no substitute for even the most basic of computer speakers.  The device boots fairly quickly (5 seconds or so, much faster than the Vision). Navigation is simple. File transfer is very simple to manage.  The battery drains fairly rapidly (about an hour of playback of photo's) but it does pop up a screen recommending you recharge (nice).  It doesn't come with a mini to RCA cable (the Vision does) for playback from the device to a TV. They recommend you buy one in the manual (gee thanks).  Any photographer should be happy with this device. Not as portable or elegant as the Vision but the screen wins hands down, I kid you not.

<Title>Found a way to view Avis!
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One of my disappointments with the P2000, which I really like, was the inability to view the avis I get from my Canon camera.  I tried converting to mpeg4, but the simpler mpeg4 conversions are visually poor.  Someone recommended the program Video Vault PVP to me and it is easy to use.  All I have to do is tell it I want to convert the file for use on the P2000 (or I imagine the P4000).  The conversion process is very fast, the video excellent, and the compression makes for a much smaller file.  (...)I wish the transfer of a one gig card full of images went a bit faster and there was an external charger available for the unit. Isabel

<Title>Not reliable enough for photo backups on the go 
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nice portable viewer but do not buy it to use to copy photos from your memory cards in the field, it is not reliable enough for that.  I stored over 13 gigs of photos on it during a recent trip and two folders of over 300 photos "disappeared".  I could not view or download the photos.  I thought they were lost or corrupted, but I was able to recover them using the $200 OnTrack Easy Recovery Program. Although it was the only way I would have recovered my photos, Epson later told me not to use it.  I also had problems with the battery not charging within the first week and even problems running the unit on AC power.  All this happened in the first month I had the unit, but Epson would not refund or replace the unit.  I sent it to them for warranty service and it came back quickly with no explanation of what they did.  I have no confidence I can save photos to this unit as backup, which is the reason I bought it. If you are willing to spend this much on a portable viewer, it is excellent, but if you want a reliable tool to backup photos on the go, DON'T BUY THE EPSON P-2000 or P-4000, stick with a laptop.

<Title>Great News! It's easy to download movies!
<Date>Wed Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just bought my P-2000 Yes, I'll be using it to transfer cards while on the road. I shoot 2000 frames a week doing destination weddings.   I also wanted to use it to watch movies; I fly alot. Anyway... I read MANY reviews saying it was very difficult to create a file it would accept. THIS WAS TRUE UNTIL NOW. If you own this unit and want to watch your favorite film simply get VIDEO VAULT PVP EDITION. Google "Video Vault" and you'll find it.  Working with the program is super easy, video quality is fantastic. I now travel with no fewer than a dozen movies. Too cool.

<Title>Needs some improvement, but what an awesome device!
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been a professional photographer for about 20 years, but I did have a hiatus in that span in which photography fell by the wayside. I've gotten back into the craft and for the most part, I have kissed film goodbye - and I would have bet my left arm that would never happen. I just bought a new digital outfit to begin my new venture into the photo biz and asked an acquaintance who is a freelance photographer and who is sent on assignment by such publications as Time & Life. He recommended the P-2000 when I asked his opinion on the best device out there to use in the field to clear out CF cards and after getting to handle one in person, I agreed with him and bought mine 2 weeks ago.  The image quality is STUNNING. There is no other way to put it. Colors are crisp & sharp on the moderate-sized display and the controls are iPod-ishly intuitive and easy to operate.  There are some things I believe should be done to make the next incarnation a 5-star achiever:  1.) This puppy really needs to have a firewire port. Say what you will about USB 2.0 - on a Mac, Firewire is simply faster. I have a USB 2.0 port on my iMac, but this thinig is too freakin' slow in importing images via USB to the computer. This is a device for professionals - I'd say can the SD slot in favor of a firewire port!  2.) The charging port is on the opposite side of where the lanyard attaches. ... so, if you want this to charge while in its protective case, you have to turn the lanyard  in the case and have it charging in an awkward position.  3.) They seriously need to come out w/ an external battery charger. I do not see the point of buying a separate battery if there is no charger other than the unit itself.  4.) The delay between clicking on a thumbnail and/or zoominig in is WAY TOO LONG. Sometimes, it's zooms in fast, and other times it feels like an ice age is going to pass you by while you wait.  5.) It is way too picky on video formats. The example/demo video that came w/ the unit is a .mov Quicktime file - but I have quicktime files that play fine on my Mac that won't play on this thing. Granted, I will primarily be using this as a professional companion in photoshoots, not as a video player - but you get the idea.  6.)  Where you put in the CF card, it needs to be labled more clearly on the orientation so you don't jam it in backwards.  7.) When the disk is full and you want to import the photos into iPhoto - it takes FOREVER. I have imported photos from external hard drives, CDs and DVDs before, but this is the slowest EVER. I shot a wedding rehearsal and the wedding itself - well over 2000 photos in about 14 hours of activities over 2 days. I got home and hooked this puppy up at 4pm and started importing photos. I went about my day, took a nap and about a few minutes to midnight, went to look at the photos and they were STILL importing! Only about 75% had been imported. I don't know if this is a 2000 rpm drive or if it's a USB 1.0 or what its shortcomings are in the speed dept., but yikes, it takes way too stinking long!  Despite its shortcomings, it is a fast downloader from CF to the drive while in the field. Not as fast as I'd like, but decent. I used this device yesterday during a photoshoot in which I took bridal portraits for about 3 hours. I imported over 700 photos and the bride viewed many of them, zooming in on several - and half the battery life remains. This device pays for itself in just saving the cost of larger capacity CF cards over time. Thus far, I am very pleased with this purchase.

<Title>Epson P-2000 Multi-Media Viewer
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this item in the mail about 3 weeks ago and i have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I picked this up so that on my 2 week trip out of the country, i would not have to lug around a lot of heavy electronic equipment (i.e. laptop, chargers, etc...) in addition to my camera, lenses and flash cards.  As travelling by air has gotten a lot more challenging.  this little item will afford me nearly 40 gigs of storage for my RAW images and JPEGS.  I can shoot whatever i want and not have to worry about running out of room on my flash cards.  A note though.  Most reviews state that it takes about 1-3min to download a CF card full of pictures.  i have found that if you have a lot of RAW images, then, it takes quite a bit longer.  it took nearly 20-24 min to download my 4 gig card.  So, i still have to bring my charger and Voltage converter for Europe.  I also noted a lot of praise for the Video Vault program.  I tried it and i found that often on my movies  the sound was off of the video about 3-4 seconds later.  so, i downloaded a free trial of dvdclone mobile (i set it for itunes video and viola'!  No more worries.)  AAAAAAAAAAnd, it was a bit cheaper.    The Epson P has a standard sd card and a CF card slot.  so, it is child's play to pop it outta the camera and plug it in.  the product manual shows you how.  it downloads quickly and reminds you to plug it in if you are going to be downloading off your cards for too long.    the picture viewer is awesome and allows you to zoom in on your pictures so you can spot fuzziness and poor quality quickly!  (instead of looking at a tiny 2 or 2 1/2inch lcd screen.)   Highly recommended!!!.  for the reviewer that lost 2 or 3 files inexplicably and that does not trust this device.  One word of advice, download the card while the charger is connected--you copy the card,then, you page through the images to insure everything is there you want---then, you format your card after you are sure it's there. it says in the manual that if you download stuff on battery and you run outta juice--it might not copy correctly or at all.  i haven't had any problems while utilizing this device to it's fullest capacity.  I now travel with 12 or 15 movies on the hard drive.  When it's time for work, i delete a movie and free up a gig and a half.  or, i delete everything and have nearly 36 gigs of photo fun!!  (i haven't used that much space yet, but, we'll see--italy is right around the corner).  5 stars!  way to go Epson!! (for all those missed connections)

Worth owning.

<Content>Does an excelent job and has a lot of versitility, but is heavy and slow to load the pictures each time you try to initially view them. (This pertains to the pictures that are already in a folder on the p-2000. I would have expected these to be faster to view then pictures being downloaded.) Once you've been through the "slide show" once, the images load quicker the second time. Had no proplems uploading and downloading from my computer. No problems downloading directly from my camera's card. Overall I am quite happy with my purchase. Screen gives a very good image. Very clear and crisp. Worked great while we were traveling. I used it to unload my camera card so I didn't have to bring extra cards.

<Title>Epson P-2000 Is A Good Product
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am basically happy with my Epson P-2000 except for one issue. If you want photos entered into an album on the Epson P-2000 in a certain order for presentation, you can't do it.  Photos are shown in the order and date they were taken on your digital camera.  After spendidng hours creating a 700 picture file on my computer and transfering it to the Viewer in the order I wanted them presented, I learned from Epson Tech Support this feature is not currently availble on the P-2000.  I explained my reasoning for wanting them viewed in a certain order, and tech support said this may be available in a future update. Other than this, I am enjoying the P-2000 to store and view my photos.

<Title>P-2000 is unreliable
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a professional photographer and have relied on the P-2000 and a redundant Dell notebook for photo storage in the field.  The P-2000 corrupted about 10% of files downloaded from several CF cards (Lexar Professional 133x media).  The corruption is transparent until the files are unloaded to a desktop.  The original files on the CF card remained intact and error free.  On a recent wildlife shoot in East Africa I returned to discover that more than 300 of 3000 plus frames were not retrievable.  What makes matters worse for the P-2000 is that it cannot be repaired in the field.  One cannot restore its operating software from an external source and the cost of doing so is prohibitively more than the instrument is worth.  I will not invest in another one, personally.

<Title>Too Many Gotchas
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The P-2000, at first, seems wonderful.  But over time the warts begin to appear.  This device can be attached to you PC as a hard drive.  However, it cannot be USED as a hard drive.  Deleting files, changing folders, defragmenting, or formatting the P-2000 can render it inoperable.  Because of the above, deleting image files is a laborious process.  It took me 1/2 hour to delete, one by one, the many folders I created during a one-month vacation.  Why doesn't Epson provide a DELETE ALL?  There is a known incompatibility with newer Lexar CF cards, and Epson has no plans to correct this problem.  (The Lexar cards work fine in the camera and on the PC).    I recommend against purchasing this, or any other, Epson multimedia storage drive.  Since Epson is not committed to keeping their products compatible with the latest memory cards, the useful life of their products will be very short.

<Title>Support and repair are sub par
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Epson P2000 and family are not properly supported by epson. You cannot send the device to Epson for repair, even under warranty. You have to use an "authorized Service Center." In the Boston area I was given 4 service centers to choose from. 3 had no idea what a p2000 was and would not repair or support it. The 4th was a horror story in itself. Months of effort to get the repair and return. They could not repair it so had to send it to a repair facility (Epson). But had no idea of how to do so. Calling Epson was little help because the help desk cannot talk to the internal repair facility or check on the repair status. Only the Authorised service center can. Months of trying finally had the device returned to me and the screen failed within a short time just after the warranty ran out. I was given the option of taking it back to the "authorised repair facility" which I have sworn will never get my business again. So... I have pulled the drive out of it, pulled my files off of it. and it sits in a drawer as an expensive reminder of what not to trust.

<Title>Epson's P-2000 is AWESOME!
<Date>Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Last summer I bought a Canon Digital Rebel and broke it in on vacation in Florida.  Foolishly, I thought a single 512 CF card would suffice.  I wound up conserving my shots and deleting more than a few in order to make room for more.  Granted, the larger 6.3 megapixel camera created larger files, but I still was woefully prepared.  I spent too much vacation time fretting over how many pictures were left and weighing that against the number of days left in my vacation.  Not anymore!    This summer, when I travel, I'll be toting the Epson P-2000 to go along with the upgraged Canon 20D.  Even with the boost in megapixels, I'll not worry about a single shot.  I can fill the 512 CF card and then download all the images (including the raw format for the 20D) onto the Epson P-2000, erase the images from the card, reload and then keep shooting.       I have a 60GB Ipod, but I bought that for the music.  I was originally considering storing unprocessed pictures on the Ipod this summer in order to free up space on my CF card.  However, the more I read reviews on the two Belkin products that can accomplish this task, the more I realized that this was going to be a frustrating, time consuming, and battery-draining endeavor.  The main reason I began to search for a media storage device was the numerous consumer reviews I'd read about the Belkin product that complained about the excessive time spent downloading onto the Ipod.  Not only would it take over twenty minutes, but it would seriously drain the battery. I considered this transition from CF card to Ipod needing to be accomplished in the Magic Kingdom and realized that this was the stuff nightmares were made of!  Not only that, but then I would be needing a charge for the Ipod!  Not good!  The purpose of this was to make cleaning off a card convenient!     After searching through several products, I came upon several reviews of the Epson P-2000.  It has several glowing reviews and, now that I have one, I understand why. Albiet a bit pricey, this is a solid unit that really delivers!     The 40GB is more than ample to handle pictures taken with my 20D using either RAW format or the Large/Fine files.  The download from a regular 512 Sandisk (not WA or 80x) is very fast!  Really!      The machine is quite intuitive to use.  The controls are straightforward.  The screen produces some outstanding images with superb color, clarity, and detail.  The zoom feature on the Epson is also stunning.  You really won't believe your eyes until you load some images onto the unit and view them for yourself.       This product allows you to clear you CF cards AND see the images you took.  I like that advantage over the idea of carrying the data on an Ipod without the ability to see the pictures.         I didn't buy this product expecting it to be a great MP3 player.  From what I understand, it performs well as an MP3 player, but I doubt it will touch the quality of sound from the Ipod.  The unit does come with some sample pictures and a sample video.  As of yet, I haven't transfered any video to the P-2000, but the sample video was incredible!  The screen is large enough and the speakers produce ample volume that I would consider copying a DVD into AVI format and load it onto the machine.          If your primary consideration for a media storage device is for pictures, this is your unit.  Although it does a lot more than just handle pictures, there are other units that are probably better suited for other purposes.  For instance, the 100GB Archos would be my choice for a device to store DVDs on.  The Ipod is the one to beat for quality music.  Similarly, the Epson P-2000 is the king of the hill when it comes to allowing you to view pictures in brilliant, amazing color on the ample 3.8" LCD screen.  The 40GB is also quite sufficient for storing a huge number of high-quality pictures from your CF card.

<Title>Great but not without flaws
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No doubt, the screen is great. But there are a few details that are frustrating. For some reason, when moving from photo to photo, the system will not pre-cache the subsequent photo so that every time an hourglass is displayed for half a second or so until the picture is displayed. This is totally unnecessary and could have been avoided by smarter software. Video will frequently freeze for a moment when played back. Moreover, the system is extremely picky regarding the video formats it accepts. It will accept the AVI files of my Canon SD 400, but will reject the AVI format generated by Windows Movie Maker. It does not play Windows' WMV files which is frustrating.  I still don't regret I got the unit, but more compatibility and smarter software would have been nice.

<Title>Love the P-2000 ...Much better than the Flashtrax
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Advantages to P-2000 - Menus & Buttons are visual, intuitive and easy to use.  Browsing thumbnails display quickly. - The display is large, sharp, bright and perfect for viewing photos - Quick downloads - Memory cards slot design makes it easy to load & remove cards with press of button.  Accepts both SD & Compact Flash cards without an adapter. - Comes with protective case, hand strap & display stand - Battery is well protected - stored inside device with a door covering it - Easy handling, no clumsy screen to unfold  Disadvantages to P-2000 - Can't Zoom or do slide shows with raw files  If you shoot .nef +jpg, you can still zoom, create slide shows and it will auto rotate the jpg for you.  Although you can't rotate raw files I didn't find it an issue since it's easy to turn the device sideways and that way it uses the whole large screen for a larger display anyway. - No Histogram display on raw files (again if you shoot with a raw+jpg you can view the histogram on the jpg)  - Hard to find one in stock to buy!  Advantages to Flashtrax - One button download don't need to open cover to start download process - Better raw file support, can rotate & zoom raw files & view histogram - Offers a 80GB option  Disadvantages of Flashtrax - Doesn't come with protective case - Hinged screen seems vulnerable to breakage if you bend it back too far - Menus & filelists are hard to navigate - buttons awkward - Need to move rubber piece to insert memory card each time - Compared to p-2000 the screen display is poor and protective plastic is flimsy - Battery snaps on end near hinge and can pop out if you press buttons on side accidentally.  - slow download speeds - Awkward to hold & balance because you have to unfold the screen.  Folding screen also makes hard to adjust screens angle of view if there is a glare.  Prior to buying the P-2000 I owned a Flashtrax & an eFilm PicturePad which I use to download raw digital photos.  One day the eFilm stopped reading memory cards, but the other functions worked.  Although it was under warranty the eFilm stopped making them and couldn't fix it so bought a Flashtrax to replace it.    I liked the Flashtrax a lot better than the picturePad since it's display, battery life and menus were much better than the efilm.  When my husband dropped the FlashTrax on a grassy area, the screen cracked even though it was folded at the time. It still worked fine, the display was just cracked.  So don't assume that the folding screen will protect the screen from breaking.    SmartDisk replaced the screen but a few weeks ago my photo equipment was stolen so I was back on the market for a portable storage device.  After reading a review of the p-2000 I decided to give it a try.  (On the p-2000 the glass/plastic on the p-2000 screen & body seems much more solid than the FlashTrax so I think it would withstand rough play a little better even though it doesn't fold.)  Now that I've worked with the P-2000, I wouldn't buy another Flashtrax.  The P-2000 downloads from memory cards much faster, and the screen display is bright, sharp and large enough (3.8") to get a detailed view of photos.   The menu's are more intuitive due to the more visual nature of the menus and the buttons easier to use.  The slide show feature also automatically will create transitions to make the show look polished without any effort.  There's no folding and unfolding screens to view making it's easier to hold  and adjust the screen to get a direct view without glare.  Bottom Line: If you are a professional or enthusiast who shoots raw, you'll probably agree that Epson could to improve the raw file support.  They need to add the capability to view histograms and zoom on raw files which I'm hoping Epson will do in a future software update that I'll be able to download easily.  Shooting a small jpg does work around this but wastes memory space.   Most the time I only check my histograpms while I'm shooting to see if I need to adjust settings so this isn't a deal breaker for me.  You'll still love the P-2000 for it's great display and ease of use.  It's much cheaper than buying 40GB of compact flash cards and smaller and easier/faster to use in the field than a laptop.  If you are an amateur you'll love the p-2000 since its a slick device to store/view thousands of photos, listen to jpegs and watch quicktime movies on.  Definately worth the wait if you can't find one right away to buy.    Epson if you are listening... you have a good product can't you increase production, improve raw file support and come out with a 80GB option?

<Title>Very nearly perfect
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I can't imagine going on a shoot or traveling without one of these! It works just like you'd expect it to, very easily, you drop in your CF or SD (it supports both) and you can download and create an album in a matter of seconds/minutes depending on card and file sizes.    The only thing that really irks me is the time it takes to cache the images, you have to cycle through the entire album once for it to do so, and that can take forever if we're talking about a 1GB card.  It takes about a second to cycle through each image (jpeg format from my 8mp digital slr)  If it were a touch faster, it would be rockin'.    I also dislike how finiky the unit is regarding movie files.  It claims to be able to play AVIs, but it wont play the avis' that run on my computer, but it will take the ones from my compact camera.  Okay...!  Not a big deal for me since I'm using this for purely on the go storage in lui of lugging a laptop around, but still, they could've made this easier.    The case that comes with the P2000 is okay... Lookswise, it's kinda silly looking.  It has a pull tab on it.  As for protecting the case, I mean, it's slightly padded, but I would've liked to see a case included that you could store the P2000 in while using it.  The one that is included is soft foamy material.  The sell cases on ebay specifically made for the P-2000 that are made of leather, and they store memory cards, all while holding the unit.  I'd reccomend picking one of those up instead of the included case.   The design is REALLY sleek and nice.  Images look simply beautiful on the big screen.  It really looks similar to a Sony PSP, people get mixed up and ask me all the time what game I'm playing.  The battery life is GREAT, I've only recharged the battery once, and I read in Popular Photography that you can transfer up to 13 cards before having to make a new charge.  The few annoyances I mentioned above are not even worth mentioning once you have the unit in your hands, it is worth the cost and the time it takes to cache the images!

<Title>Photo Fine, that's for sure
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A beautiful, crisp display is what catches anyone's eyes who spots this item. I looked for a decent storage device for a long time before finding the p-2000. Battery charge is 3 hrs. It takes about 7 minutes to copy a full 1 gig CF card (Sandisk Extreme, not the II or III version). I shoot RAW mostly so card space is always a concern. Not so bad for events if you have a few cards (I own 4 cards, 5 gigs total). But for travel a storage device is neccesary (that's what I told the wife;). 40 gigs of space is plenty. I like the ability to copy files from my pc to it too, very handy when giving portfolio type presentation on the spot. Price is high, and it's a bit heavy for the pocket. Though solidly built, it's still a hard drive. You don't want to be banging it around. I'm happy with the purchase.

<Title>Beautiful display, narrowly specialized, sparse feature set
<Date>Sun Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For digital photographers the Epson P-2000 is wonderful. It accepts SD and CF cards and downloads JPG, some RAW and other file formats to its 40 GB (36.5 usable) hard drive.   The screen is gorgeous. JPG images can be rotated and zoomed. You can organize your photos into albums and slide shows.   Overall, the Epson P-2000 is a terrific way to store and view your photos while in the field. Lightweight (about a pound), it fits into a copious pocket or your camera bag. The battery supposedly will support downloading of 13 1 GB cards before it poops out. Recharging takes only a few hours.   The question I would ask is do you need it? Having wanted one for months, I finally yielded to temptation. But having used it now, I really wonder if it's worth it for someone with my usage. With 2 GB Compact Flash cards selling for $80 (after rebates) and those cards holding approximately 350 NEF format files, wouldn't more cards do just as well? Granted, the P-2000 offers a far better means of viewing in the field then any camera display. But  if I am that interested in assessing shots in the field, why not just carry the compact notebook I already have?   I haven't answered these questions to my satisfaction yet. But for people who do shoot a lot, don't want to carry a lot of storage media, the P-2000 is terrific. The display is well worth the price and the 40 GB hard drive is practically frosting on the cake.   As a multimedia player for videos and music, the P-2000 is shockingly lacking. The device is very, very particular about video format and you are practically guaranteed that you will have to convert your video to one of the few formats the P-2000 will accept. Epson's documentation is very poor in this regard. Video playback is excellent however with only a moderate amount of skipping.  For music, forget it. No playlists. No equalizer, though the audio quality is good.  Finally, Epson provides no way for the user to reinitialize the hard drive. This is ridiculous. If, for example, you want to sell the unit, you are left in the position of leaving all your photo on the hard drive where a sophisticated user will be able to retrieve. Perhaps you might not want this. No, don't think "dirty pictures" --- think a pro photographer who copyrights their material and wants to protect those copyrights by not distributing what are effectively originals. This attitude on Epson's part is disturbing and I hope they will change their position soon.   Overall, the P-2000 display is worth the entire price. The SD and CF handling capability and the variety of formats makes it perfect for the digital photographer. I do think Epson overstates the case when the claim the P-2000 as an audio/video player. The device can do it, but its feature set in this regard is primitive.  Jerry  NOTE: I have since had occasion to use the P-2000 in the field while on vacation. It is absolutely terrific as a means of reviewing your work in the field. The screen is dazzling beyond belief. I would still hold to the 4 star rating because of the weaknesses noted above, but as a photo viewer for field use, the P-2000 is superb.

<Title>Wonderful but pricey
<Date>Fri Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Epson P-2000 is wonderful tool and an expensive toy. The LCD is top notch and the size is just right. Smaller, and the pictures would lack punch, larger, and it would be too cumbersome to carry around with you. Speed is acceptable.   With a high price, currently $499.00, you must ask yourself why should I buy this instead of a slightly more expensive laptop. With memory cards coming down every month in price, who needs this pricey gadget? In my opinion, there are two good reasons to invest in one of these babies. First, if you are traveling light, or for long overnight trips and you only own a desktop, not a laptop, this it is useful to download your shots. At 40gigs, that should be worth a good week or more of shooting. The second reason to get one is that you can take your portfolio with you anywhere. The size is perfect. A pro can show his/her portfolio, or an enthusiast can now easily show any or all of his/her work. Plus, you can also hook it up to a television and run a slide show. All your shots, organized in files, and small enough to show high quality images anytime and anywhere.   I am giving it four stars instead of five, simply because of the price/value at the moment. Other than that, Epson P-2000 is simply the best at what it does, and it does it well, period.

<Title>does what it advertises, but......
<Date>Tue Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like what others have said about the screen; It's just fantastic but with some drawbacks. Looking at the image full screen, powerlines or any type of horizontal fine lines look jagged. You will have to zoom in (crop) for the lines to smooth out.   Also like others have stated that the unit can be slow accessing images unless you have scrolled through them first.  Battery life is fantastic. Playback onto a larger screen is really good. Trouble getting mpg4 playback or anything as fine quality as the sample proves to be very difficult or almost impossibe. Menus are very intuitive. I have a canon 20d and shoot raw, no problems whatsoever but only no thumbnails of the raw. It is a must have if you are not traveling with a laptop at all. If you tend to travel with a laptop,this unit really poses no additional advantages. additional support, or help is very hard to comeby since the unit is designed for a niche clientele. People who shoot raw files in the field.

<Content>Nice screen nice design built well BUT slow on viewing pictures and generally an unnecessary tool...just nothing great about it...i went out and spent more money and got a sweet 12in iBook which does EVERYTHING...yes it was about $600 more money but worth every penny...as soon as i played around with the epson i had buyer's remorse and regretted the purchase...impulse buy i guess and looked better on paper than in person

<Content>The finest device of its kind.  The 640x480 high-res screen is reason enough to buy this device, add a 40GB hard drive, two inboard card slots for the most commonly used memory (CF and SD) and wrap it up in a well designed exterior with user friendly software and you've got the platinum standard for design excellence and performance that the other would-be competitors cannot touch.  Save your time and aggrevation; this is the one.  The others, at best, vie for second place.
