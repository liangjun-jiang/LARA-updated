<Title>Three hard disk failures-definitely buy the extended warranty
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the Ipod when it works, but I have had three die on me out of the blue.  I have taken care of all of them.  They have not been dropped or exposed to high or low temperatures.  It's easy to get them replaced if you pay extra for Applecare.  That's definitely worth it.  If you have not already invested in getting your music onto Itunes, look closedly at other MP3 players before getting locked into Ipod.  At this point, I have 6000 songs rated on Itunes.  It would take too much time to switch.

<Title>Next Generation Brag Book & More
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Was I ever surprised when my husband purchased this nifty photo iPod for me as a birthday present when they first came out on the market.  Being the techno wizard that he is, he thought it would be fun for me to have not only almost all of my music collection at my fingertips, but to also be able to enjoy many of our family photographs as well.    I'm sorry to say that I don't have any tips for loading all your pictures on because I let my husband play with that part since he's so good at it. But I doubt that I would have had a problem with it either.    As with all iPod products, a case is a necessity to keep it from getting scratched.   I initially had a skin for mine, but wasn't completely happy with that set up.  My bonus daughter gave me a wonderful turquoise leather flip case that allows easy access to the wheel and an unobstructed view of the screen.   With all the other in depth reviews here, I won't go into a lot of the specifics of the technology, except to say that it seems there would be a better way to navigate through to find particular songs or artists or albums.  But whoever thought 10 years ago, we would be able to have this cool device in the first place?  So I'm grateful for what it does do - gives me hours of pleasure listening to all my favorite music and browsing through my photograph collection up close and personal with the easy click and twirl of my fingers or thumb.  I now call my fun new toy "Mimi's Next Generation Brag Book" because while other mothers and grandmothers whip out their photo albums from their handbags to brag on their Johnny and Susie, I whip out my cool new iPod Photo and twirl my thumb around and find extensive files of family photos from weddings and vacations to pictures of our new grandchildren.    Unfortunately, not long ago, I was carrying my iPod in my bag when I threw in a bottle of water without the cap being screwed on properly.  When I discovered the mess in my bag later that day, my iPod was wet, and somehow the inside of the screen was showing moisture.  We dried it out completely -- in a low temp oven -- yes, we did.  The files were intact and the music still played beautifully, but the pictures couldn't be seen clearly because there was no backlight now.  After sending it off to the factory, we received a message that the backlight was damaged.  Replacing that part would have just about paid for a new one, so we opted not to get it repaired.    I still love listening to this iPod and haven't experienced any other problems.  The music comes through beautifully and transports me to another realm when I'm plugged in.    - Victoria Austin ("MiMi" to Sam & Laryn)

<Title>It's about the iPod, stupid...
<Date>Sat Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just ignore the simpleton from June 12, 2005 who talked about the iPod charger being incompatible with overseas 220v.  Like your laptop, all you need is a cheap adaptor to plug it into the wall socket.  There's absolutely no risk of damaging a US spec iPod if you travel outside the country - I`ve done it plenty of times.  On the other hand, taking your iPod on vacation without your charger is a tad foolish - hardly Apple's fault!  I'm often discouraged to see people who post reviews on Amazon that are more to do with their own shortcomings rather than the product itself.  The 60GB Photo is my 2nd iPod.  Yes it's a little expensive, but I use it daily and find it to be a first rate MP3 player.

<Title>The BEST way to travel with pics and sounds!!
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased my iPod Photo for the express reason of taking it to Europe along with my digital camera, my girlfriend has dig cam also. This was our first trip abroad and 14 days in Italy we knew that we would be taking tons of pics and I didn't want to lug around my laptop, so I looked around and decided to get the 60 gig version. Before we left I added over 30 hrs of music, not much for some but more than enough for me. We ended up taking more than 2700 pics over that week and half and the iPod took them all in with no problems. I purchased Apples camera connector, $29? and the world travel adapter kit from Apple also, the travel adaptors allow you to simply change the style of plug that is on the power adaptor that comes with your iPod or your laptop for that matter, the cool thing is you don't need a power converter for your Apple products, just pop off the plug replace it with the one for the part of the world you are going to and you're set. With no problems I was able to plug it in and charge it all over Italy, and download all our pics from both cameras. So instead of having to keep an eye on a big bag with a laptop and worry about it being stolen I was able to keep my camera and my iPod in a fanny pack and I never had a worry. For those of you out there with high end digital cameras and you don't want to pack a laptop this is the way to go, Plenty of space for even large files. As for those folks that find the controls difficult all I can think is that they don't understand simple file formating and higherarchy.  One last thing, you can also use your iPod as an external hard drive to copy and transfer any files you want from one computer to another, and it's drive is big enough for anyone. I couldn't be happier, and like the engraving on the back of my iPod states "Travel is the Best Revenge"

<Content>I've used the iPod 60GB as a travel hard drive that I use to store digital images.  I found it to be very fast with the optional fire wire connection cable and very stable--it always works and had no difficulty taking 30 Gigs of images.  It's noiseless, had excellent design features, and is powered through the comptuer--another words 'invisible' when it should be.  I have no hesitation in recommending this product.

<Title>Finally a MP3 Player to Hold my Entire Collection!
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod series has gained an incredibly loyal following over the years. With the release of the iPod Photo 60 gig, Apple has created a machine that can hold entire music collections - and more.  For those of us who remember the days of giant 128mb MP3 players, to have a 60 gig small hand-held is just amazing. It is barely the size of a pack of cigarettes. The case is white plastic on the front and SHINY silver metal on the back, which will scratch in about .2 seconds unless you're careful. Be sure to buy a protector immediately.  Exercise enthusiasts will note that there ARE moving parts inside here - you can feel it buzz slightly when you do some file operations. It is more akin to a CD player than to a radio. If you are riding an exercise bike, this will be no problem. If you're jogging, that's another issue entirely. Active people should stick with flash memory style systems with no moving parts. Of course the funny part of this is that the commercials all show iPod users dancing around like maniacs.  You might wonder just how you could fill up 60 gig of space legally. Being a musician and friends of many musicians, I of course HIGHLY encourage you to pay for all of your music. It's only 99 cents a song - and you are helping to keep musicians fed and promoted. In any case, the iPod makes it easy to store what you've got. I can get about 3,000 songs in 10 gig. For a youngster just getting started in the work world, this might be a high achievement in CD ownership. But for most adults that I know, especially adults in a relationship, it is easy to have 300+ CDs in the house. You collect them over the years, as your musical interests change and new bands come out. This iPod finally lets you put all your music in one place and hit SHUFFLE. It is really cool to play music for days and days and have it all be different.  The photo aspect is really neat, too. The screen is 220 x 176 which gives you a nice resolution for most photos. There are hundreds of applications for this. You can carry photos of family and friends. You can carry photos of birds for birdwatching. You can carry trip photos. You can carry poison ivy identification photos when you camp. True, a very detailed image (say a class photo with 500 people in it) is going to be too tiny to see. But a nice well-done photo (say a Titmouse on a branch) will be perfect for your needs.  The interface is really easy to use and needs no manual. You slide up and down to choose an item, and click to accept it. There's a clock, calendar, contact manager, and fun games. I really like the 'music quiz' where it plays a snippet of one of your songs and makes you guess which one it is. Since you obviously loaded all the songs onto your iPod you would think this would be easy - but if you have a large library, it can be amazingly hard!  Best of all, recent price drops have made this all-around favorite surprisingly affordable. If you've got a decently sized collection of CDs, and some photos you'd love to carry with you, I highly recommend this device. It's well worth the price.

<Title>Ipod - exactly what i was missing!....love it!.
<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got my Ipod Photo 60GB 1 week ago from [...] Have been playing with it since.I love it. Box contains: - Ipod photo 60, AC Adapter and USB cable for charging/connect. Bought:  -Ipod Case - Belkin Sports Skin($12.54) @ walmart store..cheapest at the best price...other cases with same silicone were ridiculously $29.99 and up...! - Apple Audio-video cable from Apple Store...(other cables dont work, tried it. Bestbuy, Target and CircuitCity had not heard of this cable..can u believe it...Bestbuy said 3 yrs. they have not heard it...take our audio cables instead...no video..anyway!). - Apple camera connector @ Amazon - Car Cassette adapter @ Amazon (later found walmart has it cheaper!) - Griffin Ear Jams @ Amazon...(Apple headphones are useless without this!...you need this!) Hope this helps any one trying to decide on an MP3 player. And oh yes...No other MP3 player comes close to the simplicity and ease of use of Ipod....researched a lot of mp3 players....the only close runner-up was Toshiba Gigabeat....but realized later that an Ipod is after all an Ipod... About Podcasting and Ipods - a combination made in heaven. All in all love it!.

<Title>best yet for audible.books
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I was looking for a compatible mp3 player for my audible book downloads, it was months of looking.  I, of course, knew that the ipod could do it, but it was way out of my price range. I bought a rio player, it was not good enuff.  I bought a dell juke box, I LOVED it and still do, but found out that it couldn't do audible books (I have about 300 of them).  Then I got Nomad Zen Xtra. Now that was very nice unit and I liked it,  but I couldn't get very many books stored on it.  After having spent so much money on these devices I thought  "Why not get an ipod?".  So I looked at the selections of ipods and their reviews.  The photo ipod has the least negative reviews and contained lots of storage space. Also on Amazon it was cheaper.  The reviews are correct as to the problems and I have sworn several times at my ipod, but all in all with PATIENCE (sorry lousey in spelling)the ipod works fine. The music sounds good and the books come across great. One of the features I love is that you can speed up the narration without distorting the sound.  I can listen to a 6 hour book in approximately 4 hours for example.  You have to be very gentle with it and be well acquainted with the different menues. It has been a learning experience with me, and continues to be.  Best advice when the device seems dead (blank screen) and nothing revives it hold the "menu" key and center button down for 7 sec or more until apple design shows up. The instructions tell you to do it and you will find it most useful.  To reinterate: 1) best not for young children 2) best not for impatience people 3) excellent for audiophiles 4) design is perfect for holding 5) excellent for walking and running  Blair

<Title>Music Great ... Photos Contacts well sort of
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>True to its promise it is a great music player and the itunes software is intuitive and makes it easy to create playlists.  The enclosed earbuds are so-so - but it does work as promised, and in my case needed a large chunk of the 60GB though in total between photos and music using about 26GB - so unless you own 500+ cd's 60GB may be more than you need.  The photo bit works as promised but while the screen is sharp the pictures seem a tad fuzzy to me, and while the concept of a slideshow is nice not really using it that much.  Also haven't used the TV slideshow feature which would probably make me like the photo bit more.  I think there is a way to store the whole photo file not just a cut down version - so it becomes sort of a backup.  But I have too many photos to do that for.  I also bought it to store my contacts/calendar - and they make it sound easy.  Well perhaps for MAC users - but for a PC user regardless of my trying to use Palm Desktop or Outlook the contact feature doesn't seem to work and the process is horribly explained - just plain awful.  Also one note of caution - if you are going to carry it around in bag or pocket probably worth getting a cover/case.  Almost immediately I noticed a small scratch on the screen - I was obviously not being careful enough.  Unless you treat with kid gloves - get a cover.

<Title>Very happy with iPod Photo
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I selected the 60 GB iPod Photo mainly because I listen to a lot of [...]books. Also, the idea of loading all of my digital photos on a portable device was appealing. The audio books that I had previously downloaded for my Audible Otis player worked fine when loaded onto the iPod using iTunes for Windows. I also love the access to Podcasts from iTunes. Viewing pictures on the iPod screen is not too impressive, but when viewed on my 56" TV they are very bright and sharp. Playing music with the slide show is a nice feature. I found that it is necessary to use Photoshop Album to organize the pictures before downloading on to the iPod. Copying files directly from folders did not work very well since they are all deleted and reloaded any time you make a change. With Album, only the changes are downloaded. The camera adaptor from Apple worked fine with my Panasonic FZ10 camera USB cable. The photos are stored in a file on the iPod disk for copying to your computer. The photos from the camera can be viewed on the iPod screen, but they cannot be displayed on a TV until they are imported from the PC using iTunes. I currently have about 938 songs and 4663 pictures on the iPod using about 8 GB of storage. The only problem I encountered during the initial setup was the requirement to update the system to the Windows format. It was necessary to reboot my computer after this to get iTunes to recognize the iPod. Also, I have noticed that the iPod has reset itself a few times and one time I had to force a reset after it stopped responding. The rewind button does not seem work reliably with the Audible books and it often loses the bookmark when I return to continue listening. Overall, I am very happy with the iPod Photo.
