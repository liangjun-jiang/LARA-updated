<Title>fantastic iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just purchased my new nano from the apple store today and this new model is absolutely amazing! The size is soooooooo small and light, absolutely amazing! The screen is crystal clear with such high resolution.  The only complaint I have is there is just a tiny bit of "lag" as you scroll around and access the menu's and your music. Especially when browsing your music with "cover flow". Its a very minor issue and it's present in all the models I played with at the store.  This is definitely the best nano revision to date!

<Title>First iPod and I'm in love
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm new to the world of Apple and am so happy this is my first experience with the company.  I was amazed at the high quality of video of the new iPod Nano.  It's so clear and sharp.  The only problem I had with it so far was that it froze once in the two days I had it.  I held down the Menu and Center button down together for about 8 seconds or so and the iPod reset itself.  After that, it continued to play well.  Will see how it operates in a few weeks from now.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i just got my new nano a few days ago and i don't have any complaints except for the cover flow. i'm gonna need to spend a bit of time to get that organized so every single song is under an album cover, but it's not that important, it's more for show. also, the back is the polished stainless steel, so i put clear packaging tape on it (as a cheap cover) to prevent scratches since i just throw it in my backpack. i can't find any cases that i like, but it's only been out since September 5 this will have to do until i can get a hold of a clear plastic case. i love the large screen so i won't have to squint at the screen now (unlike what i had to do with the 1st and 2nd gen of nano)  i had a sansa before for a couple of months, but i got sick of that! i guess being stuck with my ipod mini for a couple of years got me so used to it. i gave the sansa to my boyfriend and just bought the new nano! i fell in love with it right when i saw it at the apple store and just bought it right there on the spot! it really is a great upgrade if you haven't gotten the 1st or 2nd generation nano.  if you're looking for an upgrade from previous (small) ipods, then this is  it! or you can save 100 bucks more for the iTouch or 50 bucks for the regular ipod.  wow people! stop complaining about the ipod nano not having a lot of storage space! it's a NANO! not a REGULAR ipod! it's a modified version of the big ipod! get it? and plus you should know the features on the product before you buy it. i don't have a 10,000 song library and movies and videos to store on a device, but if you do then get the regular ipod. so the nano is perfect for someone who just wants some on the run music.  i was a little surprised that they changed some of the colors from the neon colors to the more "calm" colors. but if all else fails, just get the black one. i got the red one to donate 10 bucks to fight aids in africa.

<Title>Awesome Nano with added Video!
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the blue Nano 8 GB 3rd generation Ipod this past Saturday at the Apple Store.  It did freeze up on me once but if you read the owners manual on [...], it tells you how to reset it.  I did as they instructed and it was working normally again.  It kept everything in memory and did not erase anything.  The video function is awesome!  You quickly forget you're watching on a 2 inch screen as the screen is so sharp, bright and clear.  Cover flow is so cool, although a bit slow but nevertheless it is a nice added feature.  Some album covers do not load in Itunes so will not download to your player properly.  This might be a glitch that Apple may address in a future software download patch (I hope).  If you are looking to purchase a Nano, I highly recommend the new third generation over the second, simply because of the added video feature and twice the memory for your money.  It is definitely worth it for the added memory alone.  Overall, more bang for your buck and a nice new cool look and interface, with an all metal construction.

<Title>I did shy away from Apple, now I came back...
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I previously owned a gen 5 iPod with 60 gig...I love it until the headphone jack went out, so I tried to fix it myself since I had it for good two years and didn't want to send it to Apple for half of what I had to pay for in the first place.  So I gave up iPod cold turkey, even when they came out with the 80 gig and 160 gig iPod, I never looked back...I also looked at other music players, they didn't feel the same...until I saw the new iPod Nano...so I ordered one as soon as possible, and yes I do have one already (ordered it straight from Apple).  It's more compact, I love the click wheel, great for people on the move, 8 gig is enough for people like me, new user interface, and the best thing about the new Nano is the video capabilities...for me it's no big deal, it's not my primary source for video playback, but it's just cool to have that feature...

<Title>Nano's keep getting better
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Nano is a nice improvement from the previous generation. The screen is big and bright, the battery life is excellent, and the music sounds good.  The video feature is nice to have, though 8 gigs and the small screen are not conducive to watching feature length movies or even TV shows. I use this feature to keep a few 1-2 minute videos of family and friends to watch now and then on the train to/from work. Plus, the new size makes it fit easily in the credit card slot of my wallet.  Also, this nano syncs nicely with Microsoft Outlook so I can quickly look up a phone number.  I give it four stars instead of five because of what I consider a design flaw--the headphone jack is on the bottom. This means that using the Nano at the gym on any of the aerobic machines requires either placing it on its side or upside down.

<Title>Too Cool Fool
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just picked mine up from CC bought it online and picked it up in the store. They didnt even have these out on the floor yet. This thing is great. Its syncs nicely and the screen is crisp and clear. I have a few tv epiosdes on here and about 300-400 songs and 100 or so pictures and about 7 movie previews from apple which is too cool. I still have 6.8 gigs of free space. The size is incredible its so small. The coverflow thing is cool even though it couldnt find some of the album covers from albums I ripped but thats a small price to pay as far as I am concerned. For the money its great and I dont need 80 gigs so this will work just fine for me.

<Title>3rd Generation Nano Freezes often (similar to the 2nd generation)
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own a video iPod, and have owned previous generation iPods, all of which I have found to be excellent products. I just recently purchased my first Nano (the new 3rd generation) and love the looks, size, functions etc.- a potential excellent product. However, I noticed that my new Nano often completely freezes up; always after syncing; sometimes while charging; and sometimes while just changing songs, going to the menu, etc. The only way I found to unfreeze the player is to do a hard reset. This is quite an inconvenience and totally unacceptable. I thought maybe I had bought a lemon and would simply return the product for a working replacement. However, after some research, I have learned that this was and is a common problem with the 2nd generation Nano. I haven't found much information regarding this issue from others who purchased the 3rd generation - most likely because it was just released a week ago. I plan to return the product and wait until the problem has been corrected. Once this is done, I will only have wonderful things to say about the 3rd generation Nano.

<Content>It is exactly what I wanted. Priced little bit more, but it is worth the money.   I am already feeling that I bought this at the end of 3Gen era, cuz new iPhones and iPod touch has come up now with huge memory.  Getting a feeling that I should have gone for them with little additional money rather than this nano.   Anyhow, I liked nano 3G. It is compact, light weight, clear sound, bright picture and Videos.  And, I can synchronize my Calendar and Contacts from my Outlook too.  I have subscibed to Podcast, and audio books, I liked to listen to it while I am driving.

My JVC car deck controls the i-Pod via a convertor. 12 hours, 160+ songs at CD quality sound and it's flash drive, easily reloaded from i-Tunes. My shuffle does fine MP3 with headphones while hiking- I can't complain. Nicely done on both products.

<Content>This product is good. It acted weird after the first week I had it. The images were all scratchy and then it wouldn't play my music for some reason. Anyway, I turned it back on after a couple of days and it just went back to normal. I don't know what happened, but it hasn't given me problems since then (about 3 weeks later). Then again, I had bought a used one...maybe spending an extra $20 or so to get a new one would be worth it!?

<Content>This was an upgrade for my daughter from her Zen Nano Plus.  The Zen Nano worked very well and has been very durable so I'm not knocking it (actually, I'm inheriting it).  However, this IPOD appears to have many features that allow greater flexibility and control.  It has been much easier to download music to as well.  I hope it will prove to be durable as well.

<Title>A very good product!!
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own black Ipod Nano, my first impressions are very positive.  My biggest concern before buying were colors and sound quality, this is my first ipod. I bought black ipod because I didn't like how silver looked like and wasn't sure about other colors. This black I didn't like at first but I'm getting used to and beginning to like it. Its is not glossy and shiny black like other apple products. Under normal light, it turns to gray black(lighter shade of black).  My advice is go to Best Buy or other stores that carry these nanos and check them out in person before you buy them online, if you're buying online.  Sound quality is good, more towards average. I have owned other and cheaper mp3 players, the sound quality of nano is not any better, about in the middle I would say. Its very good, but in comparison to some other cheaper players, Nano doesn't stand out at all. But this is just my experience.   I have known this before I bought it, so I bought it for couple other reasons. I was already using itunes software, and you can't beat reliability and build quality of these nanos. Just go to store, other SMALL flash players look like bricks compared to nano. And itunes software is pretty good when it comes to syncing your nano, I have used others.  I experienced one issue though, my nano froze. Just like Microsoft Windows would freeze, so did my nano. No problem, just press Menu + Select buttons to restart the nano. So far I only experienced this once, other then that, I'm very pleased with nano's performance. It's a great buy! Some people don't like new shape of this nano, but personally I think its better than older nano's. It fits into my pocket nicely.

<Content>Ok, I'm in my mid 30's and this is my first ipod I have ever bought.  I figured instead of all hundreds of CD's I have I would get an ipod and download them all and get a plug to plug them into my car.  Well, I don't have the plug yet for my car and I just got the ipod in the mail yesterday.  So I download itunes and put in some CD's and even bought a few songs but everytime I wanted to add new songs it seemed like I had to sync them all over again.  Am I going to have to do that whenever I add any new songs??

<Title>My First iPod!
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first iPod ever.  Before this, I owned the Archos Jukebox 2000 which holds 20GB.  This 8gb Nano blows that other heavy hunk of junk away.  The nano is quiet, small, thin, lightweight, plays everything seamlessly, and is a breeze to use.  If you're buying your first MP3 player ever, I definitely recommend the Nano.  It is really worth every bit of the 199 I paid for it.  The screen is beautiful.  It's very bright and crisp.  Cover flow is awesome, although I don't use the cover flow as much as I use the "artist" listings.    Compared to the 2G nano, the new 3G nano has it beaten hands down.  3.5mm thin!  I mean, if you carry it in your pocket, you can hardly tell it's in there.    I really bought the new Nano to occupy me until the Touch comes out and it's doing just that.  I'm plenty occupied and satisfied!  BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A GREAT IPOD WITH GREAT FEATURES FOR THE MONEY!

<Title>Buyer beware: output to TV is now disabled... otherwise great iPod!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned two models of the 5.5G video iPods (the 30 and the 60GB models) and have been very pleased with them. I'm a teacher, and I use them for playing videos in class--so much better than DVDs! I was tickled pink when I heard that the new solid-state flash-based nano would include video; I bought it the first week because the school year was starting.  Well, I bought too soon. It seems that without disclosing the change to customers, Apple has locked the "TV Out" feature, preventing users from outputting iPod content to their TV sets. When you go to the Videos > Settings menu and bring up the "TV Out" option, toggling it on/off is now unresponsive, showing only the word "off." When locked, video content will display on the iPod's screen, but not on your TV or portable display accessory.  According to the guys on the tech support line, the only way to turn this feature on is if you connect your iPod to a device with an "Apple authentication chip" built in, or buy the soon-to-be-available Apple video cables that will work with the new iPods and will sell for a shocking $49, plus shipping and tax.  Quite a blow to this long-time hardcore Apple fan and defender. It strikes me as underhanded. Perhaps if they had made it clear in the pitch that a $50 cable would be required to play to TV, I would have still made the same choice, but as it is, I feel, you know, tricked.  That issue aside, the nano is as cute as a button, and the little screen looks great. I will refresh this review in a few weeks when I have had a chance to put it through the paces.

<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had all 3 nano versions from the 1st to the 3rd (current) generation. This new nano is incredible. I mean 8 gigabytes for only $199 with high resolution video and new user interface. It's very bright, thin and weighs only 1.76 ounces. The screen is 2" which is small for viewing long periods of video but for short stretches like 30 minutes its great. Battery life is awesome too. Only small downside is that it doesn't fit into the small little blue jean pockets any more since its wider but who cares? Definately worth it.

<Content>My 4th generation 20 GB took a dive the day before this was released.  I love the new Nano.  The size is well, very small.   The display is great, photos look good, haven't tried video yet.   Menu is almost exactly like my old ipod they just added video, and photos.   The cover flow feature?  WHO CARES! Its a music player.   I'd say the only downer is if you have an older Mac you'll have to updrade to OS X 10.4.8, I had to buy the newer OS and 10.4.8 is not much diffrent from what I had (10.3.9).  It's wierd there must be some integration of the newer OS into the new version of iTunes.

<Title>Great small Ipod, well worth the video
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Nano came with a cradle adaptor, not so good earbuds that you should immediately upgrade, and the USB iPod cable, all bundled together.  The dimensions of the new video iPod Nano vary that much from the old one. The unit measures 2.8 by 2.1 by 0.3 inches, with rounded edges and a a very nice brushed metallic finish  I think the look is great and like it far more than I expected.   Cover Flow was not great on the nano. Not much CPUs to push the graphics but good enough for the size and gave a very nice color view of all my music.  Amazon would not ship the nano to my APO address in Afghanistan but I sent it to my APOBox.com address and Amazon was able to ship it fine.  I almost went for the Touch, but did not want to wait and its smaller size is better at the gym.

<Title>Still some bugs....
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this a week after it came out, and any smart buyer will tell you not to buy the first wave of new items, especially on electronics. Apple are still the kings of digital music, yet even they couldn't get ALL the bugs out at first. Here's my reviews...  1) The thing I liked about the 2nd gen. was the casing. Full aluminum, so very little chance for scratches. This reverts back to the 1st gen nano style, yet with an aluminum front. why not go all aluminum? 3 stars  2) Video playback is awesome. The larger screen is an improvement, and it is much sharper. 4 stars  3) The backlight can now be adjusted, and can be brighter or duller. 4 stars  4) The cover flow is awesome, yet if you have a lot of music, the album covers take a little time to load. 3 stars  5) The player tends to freeze a little after extensive use. This can be esily rectifeid by resetting it. 3 stars  6) The price is great. I paid 200 for my 4 gig nano, and 200 for an 8 gig nano video. 5 stars  7) Transferring files seems to go faster. 4 stars.  Over all, 4 star review. This is based on personal experience after only a few days, and even with the few gripes, I am still very satisfied.

<Title>An improvement in every way
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Video Nano has improved in every facet over the second generation Nano. As you know, the interface has Cover Flow, the display has increased pixel resolution, and the video is a welcome addition. Lastly, unknown to the public, the audio quality has improved.  The reason I give the Video Nano four stars and not five is because the improvement in audio quality is not significant enough. There is background hiss, and the second generation Nano's audio clarity was poor to begin with.   As you know, the product is excellent. However, it is NOT outstanding. Apple should focus on the basics of what makes an MP3 player outstanding. Its ability to play MUSIC for an audiophile's ears should be present, considering this Nano is the third generation of this line. Sometimes when Apple crams so much functionality into one device, it's possible to forget what is being bought in the first place. One reviewer mentioned that the iCar will be next. How about the iPhone/Fax/Microwave/Coffeebrewer?

I like the design, it's very small and light easy to carry...wonderful product from Apple....just one more thing....they should give more thing inside the product...because it a little expensive that we have to pay extra money to buy armband and something else.

<Content>I guess my review is kind of tainted because our ipod was defective.  It froze up all the time and we had to send it back.  The return process gets 5 stars from me though, as it was very easy and painless.  Disappointing also, was the fact that we lost all of our downloads which was worth $25 or so.

<Title>Incredible piece of technology!
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ordered this iPod for my fiance for Christmas through Amazon, who distributed it from J&R Music World.   First, as usual, Amazon made sure the shipping/billing process was easy and fast. As for the iPod Nano itself...this thing really is a remarkable piece of equipment.  I had held off on buying one of these, because I felt the exclusion of video was a bad move.  After having bought a Sansa MP3 player last year which did have video, I thought it was better than the 2nd generation Nano...which it was...until it crapped out on us. Then, the 3rd generation Nano comes out, with video, and I was sold.  The video quality on this is really quite amazing.  For the small size of the Nano itself, the screen is a very nice size, and it's super clear, bright and produces excellent color.    The audio quality is pretty much what's expected of a portable MP3 player, which is good, but won't blow you away.  The only reason(s) I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the Sansa had FM radio and a record option that would record both radio broadcast, as well as using the built-in microphone to record speech, or other sounds.  Why the 3rd generation Nano doesn't include this can only be for one reason...so we buy the 4th or 5th generation Nano. Pretty lame of Apple to prey on their huge consumer base like this...but other than that, it's a great product, and nobody builds MP3 players with the same quality as Apple. Just pick the thing up in your hands, and you can tell this is not cheaply made...it just feels nice in the hand.  It's also small enough that you can use if for exercise and never even realize you're wearing it.  Bottom line...if you're going to buy an MP3 player, either as a gift or for yourself, don't try to get cute and think other brands are going to offer a better product for less money.  I found out the hard way that Apple really is the definitive product in the MP3 field.

<Title>Another great iPod product
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Apple keeps improving on their incredibly popular iPod line.  The 3rd generation Nano is smaller, has more capacity and now comes in a variety of colors.  Features, mechanics, and sound quality are the same as it's predecessor.  We'll have to see how battery longevity holds up.  This has been an issue for Apple in the past, and was the subject matter of a class action law suit that enriched a bunch of lawyers but didn't do much for the legions of iPod owners out there (including me).  Anyway, make sure you get a case when you purchase your iPod.  Every iPod I've ever had seems to scratch way too easily (like from looking at it the wrong way--LOL).  Software called MediaWidget (for Windows users) will help you do things with your iTunes library you will eventually have to, or want to do, for under $20.  This is all perfectly legal and legitimate stuff that iTunes is designed to preclude for whatever reason.    The 3rd generation Nano is the best product of its type.  The only concern I have is battery longevity, but only time will tell.

<Title>Excellent  iPod...Quality Product
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Purchased this iPod right after Christmas, and have been enjoying it ever since it arrived. As someone who often commutes by subway train often, I normally like to listen to music while I am on the go. This iPod was very easy to set up, and I was able to download all of the music from my iTunes account onto my iPod quickly and easily. What I love about it the storage capacity....I have about 1300 songs on it at the moment, which is only about 4.6 GB of the 8 GB total....So, as you can see, it holds a lot of music... I also like the fact that you can store a lot of different music play lists on it, that way you can leave all of your music stored on the device (unlike my old player). The controls are very easy to use, and you can adjust the equalizer if you like more bass...I tend to be quite fussy when it comes to quality, and am a person that would have no problem giving an item a poor rating if it deserved it. Based on this point, I can say that I am extremely satisfied with this product so far, and would highly recommend this iPod.

<Content>I have about 7 or 8 different mp3 players and a pair of Bose earphones.  So I have knowledge on different features and sound quality. Although I really like the size of the Nano, I'm not impressed with the sound quality.  I've changed the equalizer and sound settings, but it doesn't seem to help much.  My Creative Zen Vision M (although bigger and heavier) blows this Nano away in terms of sound and clarity.

<Content>This is my first iPod.  I recently gave up on Creative MP3 players because I have had bad luck with the ones I tried.  So with my refund money I bought the iPod nano.  I love it!!  It is so easy to use, way easier (and faster) then the Zen.  I really like what they did with the cover flow.  I like to see the covers of all of my CDs I import. The screen is so bright and it is easy to watch a tv show on it.  The biggest change for me is having to use iTunes.  I would rather use Rhapsody, which is what I have been using forever.  But the sound quality, picture, and design of this iPod is amazing.

<Title>Apple improves the Nano and delivers an enjoyable player.
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple's new nano is designed to improve upon the past models and add some functionality.  The improved video, smaller thinner body and updated firmware are enough to make it stand out.  The slighly lower price tag is also sure to help sell more units.    Pros  - Small size - so thin!!!! - Nice design - shorter, fatter form factor for more reliability   - Many color options - Silver, blue, green, black, etc. - Brighter screen with better contrast than previous generation - Great video option is a nice to have for sample TV shows, clips, etc - Very nice size option of 8GB for a video capable media player - Works with most traditional iPod accessories (except old A/V cable) - Slightly lower price tag than 2nd Generation nano - Unlike iPod classic, all flash memory means less failures and breakage - Flash memory also awesome for running / working out - Slightly better sound quality than 2nd generation - Apple reputation is highly deserved  Cons  - New design not ideal for very big hands due to smaller click wheel - Universal dock now required for video out (no more A/V cable) - Slightly shorter battery life than other iPods - No expandability or SD card slot like Sansa View or Creative Zen - iTunes software with limited native formats (MP3, AAC) - Coverflow still buggy / slow - Competing products offer more capacity and features such as FM radio & built-in voice recording - Competing players now available at 16GB flash at similar size  The Looks  First the aesthetics.  Some people will prefer the gen2 nano's longer body with the larger click wheel.  Apple shortened the body in order to limit breaks due to the former generation flexing in people's pockets and bags.  The longer nano was prone to bend (and sometimes break) when people put them in their pocket and sat down or moved around.  Another change motivated by durability is the metal face.  The old clear composite face was a magnet for smudges and scratches.  The new brushed metal face holds up nicer.  Be warned though; it does chip and scratch some more, so get a cover.   Apple does lose some points for the smaller click-wheel being awkward.  It's a trade-off.  The Sound  Sound quality is not significantly improved from previous models.  The slight improvements touted in Apple's marketing are exagerated.  However, let's be fair to Apple here.  They are not alone when it comes to high cost MP3 players with only moderate fidelity sound.  Almost no MP3 players are actually designed for audiophiles / musicians / sound engineers; i.e., the people who could tell the difference between good sound and great sound.    Keep in mind also that MP3 is a compression technology that does experience quality loss.  Particularly, with a lower bitrate your MP3 files will lose more and more of the sound integrity from the original recording.  Combine that with the fact many people rip from CDs that are not digitally mastered, and you would get inferior sound quality with any device.  Features  Other than the changes in the body design, few new features are noteworthy with this device.  There are some changes in the components and software that do make the screen brighter and allow you to do more things, including watch videos and play games.  Some complain there isn't enough memory for video.  But you can still get enough on here for a cross-country flight.  It's a nice extra even if these nanos don't have tremendous memory.  The flash memory in this device could have been a higher speed.  However, the main advantages of the flash player are still here: less risk of hardware failure associated with a hard disk drive player (better for running or working out).  The device does seem to have a slighly shorter battery life than advertised.  Perhaps there is a trade-off with the shorter form factor.  Few users will notice this as they are still likely to get a day's worth of use from a full charge.  Apple's software is still a weakness with very limited direct control over your device library and few file options.  However, most users have limited needs and will not notice.  Apple hits the minimum compatibility needs of most of the market.  And all formats can be converted using iTunes or another software.  Coverflow is little more than a gimmick.  It's still buggy and covers tend to blank out if you scroll quickly.  Cover art has been downloaded with previous software versions and most other video players, so the ability to scroll covers is not really a breakthough.  Keep in mind that the iPod actually still has less features than most competitive devices.  It doesn't have a built-in FM radio tuner, voice recorder, bluetooth, WMA support, and an SD card expansion slot.  Both the Creative Zen<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-5738987-0477421">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a>, which is much thicker, and the Sansa View<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-5738987-0477421">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a>, which is taller, have those components built in.  Additionally, the Sansa View comes in a 16GB size for the same price as the 8GB nano.  Keep in mind that the Creative Zen has been somewhat buggy, and the View doesn't have as long a track record only being released in November 2007.  Still, what the iPod nano does, it does very well.  There's also a 4GB version for $50 less.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-5738987-0477421">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a>  Overall this device is an improvement.  Apple really wins with sleek design and a wealth of accessories.  This unit is no different.  While it is not perfect, none of the competition is good enough to overtake it any time soon.

<Title>Video was a great add!
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new iPod nano I think was one of the best iPods. It's definitely one of the most enjoyable mp3 players around, and they definitely made an improvement on this one. The best add to the nano I think was the feature to be able to play video. It has a nice sized screen, which is larger than the previous one. The 8 gig hard drive is not that bad considering how small it is. I did buy a case and a couple of accessories to go with it since I didn't pay for my iPod nano. And BTW those wondering how I got it just go here: flingk.com/n21v9v1 Saw it on G4TV and it works that's all I have to say. I definately like the new interface they have for the iPod nano, overall this is pretty much the most reliable iPod.

<Title>Ipod Nano Review
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Looking at the reviews for this new Apple product, it seems like there are more good reviews than bad. I think there is a reson for that. Apple's philosophy is that is you are going to make software, you should also make hardware to run it and quite frankly I am amazed at what you get in this product for the rpice you pay.      I was pleasantly surprised to see that not only has the outward appearance of this product changed, which I find to be a very stylish form factor, but the menu system and firmware have had some incredible improvements. I think anyone who buys this product and states that Apple is out to get them or their money is an idiot. They certainly can find out all about this thing well before it comes out if they really wanted to and some people are never happy. In this product you get a beautiful well engineered mp3 player that is well thought out. Beautiful menus and features and a super easy interface. In an MP3 player I want simplicity. I want to not be able to screw with the file system. After I'm buying an MP3 player and not a swiss army knife.       Most of the other brands out there may do more or less than the Nano does or the Ipod in general, but it does not do it as well as the Ipod nor as nicely. Everytime I have ever bought an Ipod, I have always thought I had something of quality in my hand and the sales figures prove that year after year beacuse people keep buying them. So the people who put down this product are idiots because every electronic gadget will have its quirks and limitations at one point or another. Apple products are no different. I think the Ipod and especially this new Nano make listening to music so much fun. Thank you Apple!

<Title>Great devise but has some useless features
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great unit with good sound and easy to use.  But the video function is somewhat useless with the tiny little screen.  You have to spend at least another $49 to get the cable to show it on your TV (I have not bought one to validate that the cable will do the trick).  Memory too small for video anyway.  Also the cover flow comes on automatically and is an annoyance when you are trying to do something else (like set the volume).  But if you thought the old nano was a good deal, this is great.  Smaller screen with no video to make the devise like an 8GB shuffle (with a smaller screen showing the song, etc.) and would really be great.

It has games.  I was going to get the iPod touch, I would of had twice the memory.  With the video problems with the screen.  I decided to give the Nano a look.  I was amazed by the video quality. (I am not real critical on things like that)  People might differ and say that it is not so good but I think it is.  The games are realy fun I really like vortex.  I justed purchased tetris.  It even has a stopwatch. My only complaint is the controls are hard to use for the games. that is why I only gave it four stars.  I am so glad I went with the Nano instead.  I waited for years for Apple to come out with something like this.  the iPod being fat and small does not bother me at all.  The wait is finally over.  If you have not already bought this go out and buy this already.

<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My involvement with Ipods goes back to Generation 2. The Nano it replaced was quite satisfactory...but I need to upgrade my toys. IMHO this one was definately worth it. Thickness compared to it's predecessor is a push. It is far shorter, but wider. Fits perfectly in the hand. The screen is much larger, similiar operator interface, but new software that is an upgrade from the 7.4 used with the previous version. Very bright screen...vidid colors. Also shows an album cover (if applicable). All in all, I deem it quite an improvement. I believe battery life is longer also. Only downside (if you can call it that) was the VERY tight fit of the cable when disconnecting. Some may enjoy the larger screen and download photos. I will not. My use of the Nano is exclusively music. Bottom line - If you have enjoyed previous Ipods, you will love this one.

<Title>The second generation Ipod would have done the job just as well...
<Date>Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It seems like, only a few months ago, Apple had just come out with the brand spanking new second generation of Ipod era. Despite this realization, yet again, Apple whips out its new and improved third generation of MP3 players. Most of us would probably see this as a money making scheme created by Apple in which they give the iPod a new look and few minor adjustments, and expect customers to willingly spend an extra 200 plus dollars for a "sleeker" version of what they already have. I, myself, fell for the iPod uproar and, despite fact that my present iPod nano was barely 5 months old, I purchased the new third generation iPod nano without a second thought. But is it really all that better from the previous one?  If you're looking for better quality as far as engineering, I see no noticeable difference here. Now, if you're all about the kicks that come with appearance and graphic design, you have come to the right place. The new look is no doubt eye catching and a complete contrast to the previous nano, and the addition of cover flow adds for a more colorful music surfing experience. I find the new movie viewing feature on the nanos to be quite unnecessary.  If you want to watch movies on your iPod, then I would suggest the iPod classic which has much more memory. A single movie takes up a good portion of the space on a 8GB iPod and that can subtract a lot from music space. If you're content with whatever iPod you have, don't waste your money. The quality is just the same. You just won't be as hip as everyone else.

It is extremely small, but still holds a lot and displays a very good picture/video.  It is substantially smaller than the 80 GB video IPOD that I have.   That is great for her.  It wouldn't be quite as good for me as it is a bit harder to use for one with very large hands.  In spite of that, this is a great deal.  It is relatively inexpensive, but has a lot of great features.    Highly recommended (except for people with big hands).

<Title>cool little product...4.5
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> After toying around with this little thing for a few days I feel certain I can report that Apple has made another excellent product. When these came out earlier this month, I have to admit that I was thrown back into the MP3 player market, despite already having purchased a black IPod classic 5.5 in May. I almost went with the $249 80 GB model but I opted for the 8 GB Nano instead. This thing is so tiny (it fits in my small jeans pocket) that I don't mine managing which 50 to 100 albums I want to carry with me. And I found that popping this out and flipping threw the cover flow of albums is quite enjoyable.  I also have to admit that I came extremely close to purchasing Creative's new player, which is also impressive. The SD expansion capability nearly had me sold and the Zen UI is nice. Actually the Zen Vision M's UI was better than the IPod's and I may have switched back over had it not been for IPod's new UI, which I think is excellent. The tweaks to the interface is the main reason I bought another IPod in the same year and having it on something that is as portable as the 3g nano is...well it's hard to get my head around.  The floating images that present the media in the selected plane is very nice and album art is slightly improved over the 5.5. Most of the settings are displayed in a similar fashion as previous models with an even more user centric ideal in mind. Photos show up quite nice and are reminiscent to their display in OS X and the new 2in screen and better resolution makes them look better than they did on previous nanos. Video comes off quite nice as well. They play just as seamlessly as they do on IPod classics and the screen display is better than expected for such a small device. The preinstalled games are much better (even though I gripe because I actually paid for Vortex for my other IPod) and forthcoming games for the classics and nanos should be pretty good.  One qualm....the lousy and sucky headphones. I knew they were pretty cheap when I got them back in May but I had no idea how degradable they truly were. I compared the sound quality of the headphones that shipped with my nano to the ones that came with my IPod that is a few months olds and I was shocked. It seems as though those headphones were made to slip in quality over time. Apple needs to do better in that area. Adding a few more accessories with their IPods wouldn't hurt either.  Overall....the 3g Nano is a great product, a near perfect digital player. A 16 GB version may have achieved perfection but then there would be no need for the IPod touch.

<Title>Why are iPods so addictive?
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Being an iPod enthusiast I felt compelled to purchase this new sleeker iPod nano even though I already own the 30GB, the 80GB (5.5 Generation) and the iPod nano (2nd Generation).  Curse you Steve Jobs you got me addicted.  Anyway, what is especially useful about the 3rd generation nano is obviously the video capability.  With only 8 gigs of flash drive space it doesn't exactly have a universe of memory in it but I'd imagine more than a handful of consumers will enjoy this feature.    What is nice about this nano is being able to downgrade my music library to MP4 (video) format and fit twice the amount of songs on it.  Instead of the recommended 2000 songs I can now fit 4000 (sound quality is affected a little but doesn't bother me).  Last year's nano only allowed for MP3 music files because of the lack of video technology so for me this was a very convenient feature.  The rumors regarding the click wheel are true, this sucker has a hair trigger but personally I don't find it as troublesome as other reviewers.  It just takes a little getting used to, before long I had it mastered and didn't have any problems with overshooting the artist I was scrolling for.  The coverflow feature is another big plus.  I enjoy searching threw all my CD covers just like the old school days (which is only about 10 years ago) when all I had was a mountain of CDs and a discman that ate batteries so fast I spent more money on Duracells then on music.  Which brings me to my next point...the battery life on the nano (since it uses a flash drive) is a whopping 24 hours when used soley for music.  Now this figure is a very lenient number (apple uses unrealistic testing conditions) but I have managed to squeeze as much as 15 hours out of a single charge.    Since this is a new product I haven't seen any custom designed cases for it in stores.  So I would recommend getting some of those platic screen protectors because (surprise, surprise) the screen tends to scratch easily.  I've noticed that these Amazon reviews tend to be a little confusing.  Some people have reviewed this product and they don't even own it, others review the seller they bought it from and complain about shipping times.  Another thing that had me laughing was the fact that Amazon allows customers to review the 4 latest nanos separately, based on color.   For example the Blue 8G Nano recieved a 4.5 star review while the Black 8G only got an above average 4 stars.  But wait, the silver 8G nano recieved a perfect 5 star rating.  LOL! What is going on here?

<Title>Apple no longer cares about customer satisfaction
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The thrill of having video capability in a compact form was quickly tempered by my discovery that the TV out option would not toggle from 'off' to 'on' or 'ask.' I tried all the fixes suggested in Apple's support site to no avail. Looking next to the discussion forum, I found another user who had the same problem, but no one had responded to his query. My only other option was to return the Nano to amazon.com for a replacement, hoping the new one would function OK.  I looked back to the discussion forum and now know it is an inherent flaw, not an isolated defect in my first purchase. Whereas my iPod classic can send out the video signal through Apple's A-V cable, connected to the headphone plug, or through the dock plugged into various third-party devices, the new Nano will only send out the video signal to Apple's universal dock, which I do not have and have no intention of buying. In short, my other means of viewing (important with a 2" screen) are not available with this Nano.  There is no reason I can think of that the Nano cannot function just like the classic. I cannot fathom why this change was made or whether it was intentional (due to greed) or inadvertant (due to incompetence). The latter seems unlikely, as the people at Apple are not Bozos. Greed does not make much sense either. The iPod has given rise to an entire industry if iPod accessories made by a host of third parties. Apple cannot hope to corner the market on all of these accessories. They ticked off a lot customers with the iPhone fiasco. Now this. What are they thinking? If I make any more Apple purchases, it will be with a jaundiced eye and very subdued expectations.

<Title>the decline of the iPod?
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Today I had a chance to play with the new Nano, Classic and the iPhone.  Being the techno geek, I have been keeping up to speed on the iPods and after going thru the various functions I have found out the following...  - the iPod classic has a sluggish response UI compared to the previous iPods.  Very disappointing.  It was more difficult to scroll through the albums and songs compared to the previous iPods.  But you have to give Apple credit for the amazing 160GB capacity. - the iPod Nano was as responsive as the previous ones.  Very pleasing to the eye and very well designed. But I read about the video out issue where you need to buy a $50 cable to make use of the video-out feature.  Is Apple trying to milk the customer up as much as possible before something comes up to take over the iPod market share? - As most of us knows, the iPhone will not work at ALL unless you activate it with the AT&T service (unless you hack it...which turned out to be troublesome after today's Apple software update).  The problem with the Touch is that there will be no scheduler feature for the Touch and there are some talks of how the Touch suffers from a "darker" screen compared to the iPhone.  I asked about this and the Apple person told me that they heard about the problem but was not sure whether or not Apple would refund/replace the Touch because this was all very "subjective."     How nice of them to screw us.   The iPod is a very very attractive mp3 player to buy, but it seems like it's starting it's descent into ho-hum land.

<Title>3rd Gen Nano is the best nano yet
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love everything about my new nano--from its tiny size and featherweight to its mint green color. Video quality on the nano's screen is just amazing.   I've had each of the preceding generataions of nanos and each time thought it was not possible to improve on the product. Well, the 3G nano has proven me wrong.  IMHO this is the best nano yet!  If I could have one wish, I'd wish for more memory, since an 8GB iPod gets full pretty fast if you have more than a few full length TV shows or videos on it at any one time. Then again, it has plenty of room for enough video to last through a transcontinental flight or two, so who really NEEDS more?

<Title>Good technology for the casual user 
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I found the audio/video quality and storage capacity of the 3rd generation iPod nano to cover my basic portable entertainment needs. As a frequent air traveller, I find that the nano's video capability in a slim form factor makes a few hours on a plane go by much more quickly without having to lug the extra weight of a laptop or portable dvd player.  Extremely easy to configure, update, and charge.  Downside:  I had the iPod touchpad and screen become completely unresponsive several times in the past few months (it wasn't the battery running out) and had to reset (per instructions from Apple's website) it by holding down the center button and menu function simultaneously until the logo appeared and the screen restarted. This was alarming the first time it happened since I didn't know how to reset the iPod -- but I didn't lose any stored data; so it's a minor concern to me now that I know how to remedy it.

<Title>Almost perfect, just needs a little bit more memory
<Date>Sat Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third iPod, but my first flash-based one. I really like the form factor of the new iPod Nano. While some people have complained about it being fatter than the previous gen Nano, it's still wonderfully small, thin, and light. The new Nano is also shorter, which personally I think makes it a better fit for small places like the coin pocket of your jeans w/o sticking out and jabbing you.  I had previously held out on getting a flash-based iPod because the storage capacity wasn't quite enough to hold my iTunes library (currently ~12GB in size). I was disappointed that the new Nano still has the same 8GB capacity as the 2nd gen Nano, but I just couldn't wait any longer. Too many cool features to resist, I would just have to trim down my playlists a little.  BTW, an "8GB" iPod Nano actually only has 7.41GB of usable storage space. Presumably some of that missing storage is due to formatting, the iPod operating system, and other what not.  The new Nano's fatter body allows for a wider screen suitable for watching videos and some new user interface features, most notably the Cover Flow view. iTunes has had Cover Flow view for a while. Now it's available on the iPod. Albums w/ missing cover artwork are displayed as annoying white music notes on a gray background. (WARNING: Some individuals, like me unfortunately, may be susceptible to getting an uncontrollable urge to want to fill in all the missing cover art. I spent an entire Saturday tracking down missing cover art on the web, and even dug up a couple dozen original CDs to scan in the cover art myself for those last few albums...)  I really like the additional info displayed in the various lists. For example, the album list displays the album name, the artist beneath, and a tiny thumbnail of the album cover; the old interface displayed only the album name. As another example, the song list displays the song name with the artist name underneath; the old interface displayed just the song name, which can be confusing when you have different songs with the same name.  Minor gripes: - The HOLD switch, dock connector, and headphone jack are all now located on the bottom of the Nano. As a result, the dock connector and headphone jack are so close together that it's hard to squeeze the sides of USB connector to disconnect it while the headphones are still plugged in. - If I connect the Nano to the USB port of my monitor, I get a "USB Device Not Recognized" error. Instead, I have to connect the Nano directly to my computer's USB port. Not sure why this is. My 5th gen iPod Video works fine connecting to my monitor's USB port.

I was bummed out when about 1 month after purchasing my ipod nano it stopped playing and the screen went funny, but it was really easy to fix.  All I had to do was to open my ipod on itunes and "restore" it.  It's working fine now and I am confident that if anything like that happened again I would be able to fix it using the apple support website or receiving tech help over the phone.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My first iPod. Seems I waited for the right one. I knew it would be small, but this is tiny. I was using my phone as my MP3 but the earphone connection failed.   The features on this nano blow me away. I put a ton of music and several vids from youtube on it, more than 2.5GBs left still. (2 days of music and 6 hours of video). Hold switch is very nice. Picture quality is great. Reported highest quality iPod video yet. Looks amazing. Even has an alarm, so I just plug it into my stereo to wake up now to my music. Album art is nice, but you end up searching for a lot of it if you dont buy from iTunes. I just grab pictures of the artist for their songs.  Once you get used to iTunes (Must download online) it's easy. Who thought patience improvement was a feature? From my research iTunes has come a long way though. A lot of extra programs I have seen elsewhere are now included.  At first Synchronizing seemed to take forever with all I put on it at first. But once I connected it to a USB 2.0 it went A LOT faster.  I was searching for nicer black earbuds, but see something bad about even the best ones in reviews. So far these white ones work great. I got this for snowboarding and the gym. They stay in perfectly. I noticed the lack in bass right away. But wait, the EQ takes care of that. Now I get to use my old CD-tape adapter for my car and large headphones when not active.  Only downside I see is the games. Apple has been adding more and more for this nano. But reviews show the controls are tough to master. I will likely buy one or tow.  So yes the 8GB is worth the extra money if you want to use any video. But if just music, 4GB may save you some money, but no color choices. Oh and it's not glossy black but a matte finish. Wheel looks BLACK. iPod looks dark charcoal.

<Title>Good But Delicate
<Date>Sun Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased this about 2 weeks ago, I love the color! I got the 8 GB Green version. It holds all of my music, and is small and very portable. The clickwheel is fine, but I do agree with others who say it does feel a little strange in your hands at time (since it is so square). Please do not be like me, and GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR IMMEDIATELY! After only 2 weeks of careful use, I have a nice scratch down half the screen. I now have a screen protector on it, but I didn't believe that it would get scratches so easily! Apple should be able to fix it, this screen is WAY TOO DELICATE. Other than that it does what it says. The screen is nice to watch a music video or two, but I probably will not be watching any movies.

<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I first bought an ipod classic when it came out. But I returned it a week later b/c I didn't use all the space and (mainly) I was concerned with the viability of a hard drive while I go running. So I went back to Best buy and bought an ipod nano. I think I found the perfect ipod. It's small, stylish, has good audio quality, and a decent storage capacity. I haven't invested in a case yet, but I have not suffered any scratches on the front part of the ipod even though it rides freely in my pocket. The aluminum casing seems to be holding up quite well.   If I could change any design element of this ipod it would probably be to add another ~5-10 GB and change the mirror finish on the back.   I know apple will be coming out with a nano in the near future that will have more storage capacity at the same price - but you have to jump in some time - don't you?

<Content>I just received my new 3g Nano. It is a great product, but for a specific purpose. It certainly will not replace the full size Nano or my Archos 604 for regular viewing. The screen is just too small. However, the quality of the image is outstanding. In my opinion, this product will please those wanting a tiny Ipod, very suitable for listening to music and great for watching a short video, say, while waiting for your spouse in the mall. After an hour or so, my eyes began squinting, looking at the tiny image. It may be ideal for a short flight, but certainly not for a cross country flight. Installing the music is the same as any other Ipod, using Itunes. So far, it functions flawlessly. If you plan to use this unit primarily for transporting videos for watching on a TV, this unit will also do the job. Images on a Tv are equal to those from the full size Ipod.

<Content>At first I didn't know if I would like the wider body style, but it turns out it's perfect! It's just as "grippable" as the 2nd gen. I don't know why people say it doesn't fit well in your hand. It fits in mine just fine! The video quality is top notch. There are many new features as well. The playlists show how many songs you have in them. There is a display that tells you how much space you have left. The screen is larger and brighter, so it's easier to read. There are split screens that show album covers, pictures, icons, etc., that show up when you have selected a particular option. The games are also fun and have SOUND! One of them is a cool movie/music trivia game. I love this nano even more than the 2nd gen one I own, which is pink. This one is red. I didn't know how much fun it would be to have video on my ipod until I got this. I downloaded "Finding Nemo" and although it's a small viewing space, the picture is amazingly crisp and clear. The audio quality of both video and music is outstanding in my opinion. The new graphic user interface is the best thing about it. The new nano really stands out as a solid flash-based media player that has surpassed its predecessor in features and ease of use.

<Title>Quality Has Never Been This Cheap
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The reason I bought my iPod nano was because of the amazing drop in price. I  had always despised that Apple priced the 8GB nano and the 30GB video equally because there was such a huge difference in memory yet the nano was just as pricey. When I saw my friend's iPod and found out that it could play video I was extremely shocked that the price had gone down so much compared to the 2G nanos.        The sound quality of the nano is very good. For those ripping CDs at higher bitrates  you will not be disappointed. The slightly tinny sound that used to come from previous nano models is now gone and you can enjoy sound quality closer to that of larger iPods. For those seeking high quality audio in a small flash based player  you will not be disappointed.       The biggest and most obvious change  besides the new shape  is that the interface now includes album covers when scrolling. This is a nice addition but doesn't make a huge difference. Cover Flow is nice too but  if you're like me and your songs don't all have album covers  iTunes tells me I need an account  and I just can't be bothered  then it's not going to be used much.              Video quality is surprisingly good on the smallish screen. Colors are bright and images are sharp. I have only tried watching music videos and short clips on the screen and am not sure how comfortable it is to watch full length movies and TV shows.        The new shape is really an improvement. Not only is the screen wider  but it fits in your hand more snugly than the skinnier nanos. I also prefer the look because it seems more proportional. Of the colors  I chose silver. I don't really like the pastelle-y blue and green but the red and black look quite nice. Color is really up to you though.        Obviously  the memory still isn't that huge but I'm able to put most of my music collection and some short videos on the 8GB it provides. If you know that you need more space  don't waste your money on this. It's a waste of time to buy something and then complain about how it doesn't suit your needs when you knew how much space it had before you bought it.    Some bad things:     The top of my scroll wheel sometimes gets sticky and I have to press the menu button to get it running smoothly again.    My computer often doesn't register the iPod in iTunes but restarting the "iPod Service" fixes this really quickly so it's not a huge issue.    The headphone jack and the dock connector are next to each other so if you want to have an FM Transmitter that connects via the 3.5mm jack and a charger that plugs into the dock connector  space might be an issue.        Having the hold switch on the bottom makes it hard to lock your iPod using only one hand.

<Title>Another success
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple continues to blow away other manufacturers' media players with substantial, steady improvements to what are already great products. If you're an iPod fan already, you can be smug in the knowledge that this one sets the bar just that much higher.  The 2-inch, 320 x 240 screen of the new Nano, when it's sitting on my airline tray table, turns out to be about the same angular size as my TV when I watch it from my sofa at home. Cool! The picture quality is gorgeous, reminiscent of an iPhone.  The new Nano features a 24-hour battery life when used as a music player, and a 5-hour battery life when watching video, so you can watch at least a couple of full-length movies on a full charge. This is slightly shorter than the battery life on my 80GB (5th Gen.) video iPod, but it's a smaller unit, with a smaller battery. Makes sense.  The new split-screen operating system is slick. Now you can view all the details about a track in one glance, instead of waiting for the information to slowly scrawl past you.  As a gadget nut, and a fan of good design wherever I find it, I'm constantly impressed with the attention to detail evident in Apple's multimedia devices. The new Nano lives up to its predecessors nicely.  My older iPods are getting jealous. I think you'll love this thing.

<Title>Amazing, just be careful with Coverflow
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So last night I picked up my first Ipod, got a Black 8 GB Nano. Glad I waited for the new "fat" version. A few months back I bought my sister a Nano as a gift so comparing the "slim" Nano to the "fat" video Nano I like the one better, the extra width helps me hold onto the player better. My one caution is this: with the new coverflow feature you need to be very careful how you organize your music, spent a fair amount of time last night getting that sorted out. If any of the tag information on any song(s) is off from the rest of the album it will create multiple albums in coverflow, also not having any album art for any music becomes annoying in coverflow. So my advice is; make sure you're meticulous on how you organize in iTunes. I did notice a few times that the coverflow artwork did take a second to load the image as I was scrolling, but this seems to go away after a few times. The "split" screen from the menu that randomly shows some of your album art is very cool, since the half screen can't show a whole album cover it pans across the album art randomly, the cover that is show is random as well. Very cool. Last item, some people will rant about how the 8 GB Nano is on $50 bucks less than the 80 GB Classic. Remember its hard drive vs. flash memory, as I tend to be active and move around a lot and plan to use the Nano while at the gym I wanted the stability of flash memory. to me comparing the two is like comparing a dump truck to a sports car, you may want one or the other at a given time so it's really up to decide what is important, capacity or portability?

<Title>Wow, an amazing product
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had all 3 nanos for the 1st to the 3rd (current) generation. This nano is incredible. I mean 8 gigabytes for only $200 with high resolution video and new user interface. It's very bright, thin and weighs only 1.76 ounces. The screen is 2" which is small for viewing long periods of video but for short stretches like 30 minutes its great. Battery life is awesome too. Only small downside is that it doesn't fit into the small little blue jean pockets any more since its wider but who cares? Definately worth it.

<Title>Hangs up - I'm returning my second one already
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I went to the Apple store when they received their shipment yesterday (9/6) and purchased my new Nano.  After connecting it to charge it and put some music on it, I tested it and it froze after about 10 minutes of use.  Couldn't get it to turn off - it wouldn't accept any input.  So I let the battery die down over night and connected it next day.  Still in frozen state.  So I took it back today and exchanged it for another one.  Connected it, put some music on it, and this one froze even before playing a tune.  The software must not have been tested very well.  It's not like I was doing anything unusual.  Back to the Apple store tomorrow to return this, and I think I'll wait awhile to get it.    The product looks great otherwise.  The screen is bright and clear.  Can't wait until they work out the bugs so I can get another one.

<Title>8GB and video????
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What is the point of these Nanos?  I am very dissapointed in the refresh of the Nano, form factor is horrible and who needs video in a 8GB player or less.  The  Video refresh is on target for those that want a bigger device with more storage.  I was hoping for smaller and more storage.  Think of it this way.  The video users wanted more storage so they upgraded those because 30G etc... isnt enough to hold much video, so who need video with 8GB or less.   How much video can you store with 3000 songs as well? I cant even fit a tenth of my cd collection on an 8GB.  I would bet there will more coming with higher storage very soon.  I would not reccomend buying these.   Makes no sense.

<Title>Money Back
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>All the people who complained about getting money back for their iphone are dumb. Apple was generous enough to do this and were not required to. Apple didn't force you to buy it on day one! It was your choice and no one else! I bought the 80GB ipod video aboout 3 months ago. Now they are releasing the 160GB for the same price. Oh well, it was my decision to buy it, Apple doesn't owe me anything! They provided me a great product and I'm enjoying the heck out of it. Stop complaining people. especially the ones that have posted they bought an apple product last week and now want some type of money back. Get over it!!!!

<Title>This isn't the only game in town . . .
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This seems like a good player.  I would take a look at the new Creative Zen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-5738987-0477421">Creative ZEN 16GB Black</a> before making a final decision on this, however.  The 8 GB version is the same price, but it will also be available in 16 GB as well.  It will play a lot more video formats as well, plus non-DRM AAC files from the Apple Music Store.  Of course, those of you with tons of DRM AAC files are probably stuck without much choice, I guess.

<Content>Kind of surprised how little this unit brings to the table when comparing to Zens and Sansas.  If you're looking for more music and video format support, then pass on this.  If you've lined Apple's pockets with a big pile of DRMed iTunes files, well, I guess they have you hook line and sinker.

<Content>You cannot go wrong with a Nano.    I made the mistake priort this in buying a Zune, which is very poorly integrated into the Microsoft product lines.  The Zune software is very poor.  With a little effort  and assitance from Microsfot they could have had a decent product.  I will never buy another Microsoft product again.

<Title>expensive novelty
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 8 GB iPod nano does hold a lot of music, but not as much as it seems that it should for the memory it has.  The iTunes program downloads jumps and skips into your music. You can put a brand new CD to be 'imported', or whatever they call it when you load music into the iPod, and the program will download jumps and skips into the tracks of the music. They did this so that in a couple of years they will be able to sell you something else. It's called 'scheduled obsolescence'. There is very, very little bass in the music. To save battery life, there is next to NO BASS. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Save your money. Buy like eight personal CD players, or maybe two or three MP3 players from anyone but Apple. You will enjoy your music much more that way, and still save money. THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
