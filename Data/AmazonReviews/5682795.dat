<Title>Awesome MP3 Player!
<Date>Sat Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Pros:   -Very small and thin, about the size of a credit card.   -Extremely easy to put songs on and very fast with the USB 2.0. It only takes about 5-8 seconds per song to download to the player depending on the length of it.   -The equalizer is really nice especially since you can customize it.   -The battery was fully charged right out of the box and took about 5 minutes to get everything going including installing the software on my computer.   -The volume goes up nice and loud and doesn't loose clarity or anything.   -The radio has very good reception and never has static.   -The screen is very clear and has a nice sky blue backlight.   -The leather case is also very nice and handy.     Overall I couldn't have picked a better MP3 player with all that the MuVo Slim offers for only $160.     Cons:   The only complaint that I have is the ear buds that come with it. They have really good sound, but they are so big that they don't fit into my ear and just fall out. Also the latch on the battery compartment is a little fragile, but that isn't a big problem.

<Title>This is simply superb

<Content>I think I have taken a good decission in buying this product. After searching over the net for a month, I choose this compact MP3 player as the best one and after using it over a month now, I found it to be the ultimate one when I compare this with other MP3 players those my friends are using. <p>It gives a harmony sound effect, no need to go for another ear piece. The voice recoding is excellent. I recorded so many songs and sent those to my friends and they couldn't believe that the voice is so much clear when I told them it is recorded by a mp3 player. They felt like I am singing infront of them. Lookwise, it is very nice and very handy for travel purpose. I also carry it with me whenever I go for a meeting. The download is very fast, only you need to attach the cable to the USB port.I don't see any disadvantage of this item. Worth buying it if you are a music freakout person. This item is for someone who loves music and listens to the soft voice. Also, it is one of the best gift items you can think of.

<Title>Important Note
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this item after much deliberation.  After much head scratching I found that this mp3 player can only play tracks in the correct alphabetic (numeric) order if there is an alphabetic change withing the FIRST NINE CHARACTERS.  So if you have an album with tracks: Band 01 - song name1.mp3 Band 02 - other song.mp3 1234567 thats fine  if you have the following: Bandrocks1 - song name1.mp3 Bandrocks2 - other song.mp3 123456789X Then it will play the tracks in REVERSE order (???). Maybe a future firmware change will fix this.  BTW: this problem is not specific to Creative products - I have seen similar effects with other products too!  Otherwise: I found that yes; the ear buds are a bit big and uncomfortable but produce clear sound (dont try to take the foam covers off as it is still uncomfortable and no I lost one of them!), the battery latch is fragile but once its on its firm (you should never need to remove it if you charge via usb.  The skipping folder option is really nice!!

<Title>This thing is amazing
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got mine out of the box and fooled around with it for a couple of hours.  I honestly did not know they made stuff this cool.  No it can't hold a week's worth of continous play like an I-pod, but then again it's about three hundred dollars cheaper.  The recording mic. works well and you can record stuff off the radio.  And it's so damn small.  I am completely and utterly satisfied, so satisfied that I decided to sit down and write this review at 1:00 in the morning.  If you've even thought about getting an MP3 player, this one is great.  Second Review:  This review is written about five months after the above review.  I'm responding to some of the negative reviews here listed about the muvo slim.  I'm sorry it didn't work out for you guys,  but as far as I'm concerned, the muvo slim is still the best MP3 device available for under $100.  I am an avid skateboarder.  I've taken about five good slams while using my muvo (one time landing more or less directly on top of it) and it's never had the slightest problem.  I don't think I'd run over it with a car, but it's pretty tough.  Battery life is still very good and it has never malfunctioned at all for me.  I love it.

<Title>I don't know how I ever lived without it!
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A great purchase.  I bought it about a month ago, and it still works great.  The equalizer allowed me to make the crunchy guitars in my music well...crunchier.  The radio was pretty good too.  It doesn't have AM, but who listens to AM anyway?  The voice recorder is EXTREMELY handy,  Especially for people without microphones on their computers, seeing as how this thing comes with one of the fastest ways of file transfering out there.  Simply amazing.  The quality is second only to my 6 speaker car stereo.  If you do choose to buy this, I would recommend that you buy a pair of headsets to go with it.  The included ones are very fragile, and constantly fall out of my ears.

<Title>Perfect!

<Content>I bought this MP3 player after researching many different brands and models, and I'm so glad I chose this one. It's small, charges from USB (so I'm not creating battery waste!) and hold enough music to satisfy my commute. The FM reception is excellent!

<Title>I've rediscovered the joy of music with this fabulous MP3!!

<Content>I LOVE my MUVO SLIM!!!  I'm a 56 year old woman, and when I say this is EASY to use, it really is!! It is SOOOOO user friendly!! I bought it to work out at the gym, but I also listen to it when I'm cooking dinner, scrapbooking, etc. I love the sound, and it's so tiny that I usually just stick it in my bra (in its case) for really easy carrying.  The drop and drag technology is wonderful! Mine holds about 55 songs, which is plenty for me. I love the way you charge the battery by just plugging the player into a computer.  This product is definitely worth the money... and I know I will buy things made by Creative Labs in the future, because they put a lot of effort into making this player absolutely perfect!

<Title>Great Mp3 player...
<Date>Sun Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was my second Mp3 player and I must say that I NEVER knew that it was possible for a player to be so easy to use yet of such high quality. I definitly recommend it to anybody looking for a small/simple/high quality Mp3 player. Another great thing about it is that you can purchase interchangable face plates to make it more colorful!

<Title>Overall I am very pleased with my Muvo Slim
<Date>Sat Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Muvo Slim for about a week now and I've figured out how to use all (or at least most) of it's functions.  I've ripped music from audio CDs and transfered them as MP3 files to my Muvo Slim and everything works great.  I'm no high-tech audio geek but I listen to music often and the sound output on the Muvo Slim is very good.  I'm currenly listening to a Haydn piccolo trumpet concerto and the responce is good in all registers.  I love the fact that the Muvo Slim recharges through the USB port, it eliminates the need for a seperate charging cord so I can recharge it at work.  The leather case is nice and has a magnetic clasp that keeps it from flopping open.  Even with the case it is slim enough to fit in my shirt pocket without looking goofy.  My only complaint about the Muvo Slim is that the FM reception could be better.  It works OK but I have an old Sony personal radio (powered by two AAA bateries) that gets better reception.  I do, however, use my Muvo Slim to listen to NPR while on the bus and the reception is acceptable.  If I used it to listen to music from the radio I don't think that I would be happy with the reception.  The metal construction and sturdy buttons give the impression of quality and longevity.  I hope that this helps!
