<Title>Great when it works
<Date>Thu Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got an ipod as a gift in July 2003, and had some problems with the software, and getting my computer to recognize the device, etc.  I had read a user review on Amazon stating that the software was &quot;flakey&quot;, and I didn't know what that meant until I got my ipod.  When it works, it really is great, I like the design and used it everyday, but it took a fair bit of tinkering around to get it to work.  The directions weren't helpful at all.<p>A previous reviewer wrote that he couldn't run with his ipod because it froze up constantly.  I run with mine everyday and have not had this problem.<p>I had some problems with the Music Match software.  Sometimes it would duplicate songs, and I could only delete one version.  I had to restore my ipod to factory settings a few times to remove duplicate versions of songs.  Apple came out with iTunes for Windows a few months after I got my ipod, and I've found it to be easier to use.<p>My ipod died completely, even though the battery was fully charged, in December 2003.  It didn't work for a few days, then I was able to revive it.  This happened 3 times before I sent it back.  Apple customer service kind of sucks, there is no 800 number to call for support, you have to register on their web site and email your problems in.  Within a few days of emailing Apple, I received a shipping box in the mail to return my ipod.  I sent it back and received a new ipod in less than a week. <p>I'm kind of skeptical that my new ipod will last any longer than the old one, but maybe I had a dud.  With the problems I've had, I can't really recommend the ipod, but it really is great when it works.  Definitely read the other user reviews before purchasing one though.

<Title>Best there is!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Just got the 10-gig iPod last Friday (picked up at a great sale price as Apple is dropping 10-gig in favor of "mini" and "15-gig"). All I can say is awesome. I never had Apple before and was skeptical based on some of the Amazon reviews. But all my fears were erased. I have a 6 month-old Compaq at home and had no problems getting the two to sync up. Literally "plug and play". Bonus is, if your Windows PC has a newer fire-wire port, it will even charge your iPod while downloading music. I have almost 1,000 songs (75+ albums) on it right now, and using just under 4-gig. I read a lot about people having problems sync-ing their window-based PCs to iPod. Based on my experience, I can only guess they are using older PCs and insist on using USB2 or even old USB.  One tip, if you're "ripping" CDs to put on your iPod, be logged into the web. I-tunes will literally fill out all the song/track information for you (a little tid-bit I found by accident).  Also, regarding the reviews where people "e-mail" Apple and have horrible customer service stories....   check out the Apple web-site.  You can't e-mail Apple.  You must call them directly or join one of the discussion chat-groups (which I've used, and are very helpful).

<Title>Proof that there was a crash in Area 51!
<Date>Wed Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>...and they loved music. This product must have been reverse engineered...it's that good.<p>I've been listening to MP3's on portable players since the Diamond 32MB.  I'm an absolute music junkie and use these players to get me to (and keep me in) the gym everyday.  The iPod (of which I've owned 2 previous models) is hands down the best portable on the market.<p>Combine with the Apple owned iTunes site (this sounds like a commercial but...).  They work phenomenal together.<p>I have a PC.  If you do to, make sure you buy the PC version.  Also, it's much easier if your PC has a Firewire port (kind of like a USB port but wider and shorter).  If it doesn't, and you're not computer savvy, you might want to avoid iPod (as painful as that is to say).<p>Daily use is great.  The keys themselves are heat sensitive, which is cool (no pun..), but can be a pain when you get the song you want, go to put in your pants, and accidently touch a key.  Other than that, flawless.  Very intuitive buttons, very intuitive menu, and beautiful looks.<p>If you need more than 10GB of space, you're probably a target for the RIAA and will be sued any day now...  I have 700 hundred songs and use about 25% of the available storage on this unit.<p>I can't say enough good things about this thing!<br>Enjoy...

<Title>Great music, great fun, but not scratch resistant
<Date>Sat Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Received my iPod as a Christmas gift. An amazing product. Pleasantly surprised by how good it sounds. How much music it holds. How easy it is use. How good it feels in your hand or pocket. <p>My only complaint is that it scratches very easily. I strongly recommend that you buy a case for this when you buy the device. My new iPod started showing scratches by Christmas night. I you don't have a case for it, be sure sure you don't put it in a coat pocket with your car keys or a nail clipper.

<Title>Warning to all potential buyers...
<Date>Fri Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a load of crap. I got it as a christmas present.. and now it's february.. so i've only had this thing for 3 months. Well, at first it was all right and all.. but now it's officially DEAD. I have yet to send it in to be repaired and i'm not sure if i want to considering my dad paid so much for this skimpy thing that fails to deliver after only 3 months. I get tired waiting for songs to upload and furthermore, the battery life drains so fast. i started out w/ an ok battery (the battery would go down one bar after about 30 songs) to battery life of an imposter duracell bunny (less than 20 songs and it's down one bar) well great, my ipod died completely when i tried to listen to it a few days ago. it's not responding to snything. i see some ppl think it's great and it has worked out well for them but i really think this is a hit-or-miss product. Either it works for you or it dies within a few months. I have heard other stories of people's ipod dying within a few months and even though there's a one-year warranty, the person still had to pay for some repairs. So buyers beware.. make sure you know what you're getting yourself into!<br>Edit: I got a replacement ipod... had to transfer all the songs over to it... moreover, it just died again. So this stupid thing has died TWICE in less than SIX MONTHS.

<Title>ipod is OK. hoping for advances in future models
<Date>Sun Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my 10GB ipod since Sept. 2003 and I bought it for $300 and had to also buy an FM transmitter, cables for my computer (I have a PC, not Mac), a carrying case (for running, etc.) and a car charger. Thus, the price was somewhere around $375, plus I bought the extended warranty from the store because I knew these were fragile items.<br>The basic FM transmitter isn't as good as the ITRIP, but it was sufficient. The battery life in that thing stinks though.<br>I accidentally knocked my ipod off of the treadmill in its carrying case and it broke. I was pretty mad considering I used to throw my tape player all over the place and nothing ever happened. i miss tapes.<br>anyway, i believe that the ipod should come with a few more features, like a built in FM transmitter and an FM receiver for listening to the radio. i also think its a bit pricy. sometimes it freezes for no reason and sometimes the software for my PC does not synchronize well with the ipod and i have to restart. <br>i find the ipod pretty easy to use, but it is very fragile and could still use some work. i hope the future models will be better. now i cannot buy a 10GB, i have to get a 15GB, but Apple does not seem to be doing anything to their newer models to make them much better. More music is better, but there are no new added features. <br>I might try a new mp3 player in the meantime until apple gets their act together. since all these mp3 players are so new, you can't expect any of them to be perfect. i will take a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude with the ipod. not that i don't recommend it. its the only mp3 player i have ever had, so i have nothing to compare it to.

<Title>Elegant and Simple
<Date>Thu Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Although I'm a PC person, I have to appreciate Apple's commitment to quality. For a piece of equipment this advanced, it is amazingly simple to operate. The face has no moving parts; instead, the heat from your fingers activates the different buttons.<br>  In this updated model there is room for a couple hundred CDs and (supposedly) the issue regarding battery life has been resolved.<br>  Possible issues:  You must own an Apple or PC computer as this is the only way to upload your music onto the iPod.  This model only comes with a Firewire cable; a USB adaptor is extra.  Also, any songs that you keep on your iPod must be stored on your computer.  This last issue is only a problem if you are running a computer with limited harddrive space (e.g. &lt;10gb).<br>  Besides these small problems, my iPod has given me hours of pleasure.  One recommendation is the Griffin iTrip FM transmitter.  This allows you to play music from your iPod over any FM radio.  This item runs about $35 and can be purchased on Amazon.com or on Apple's website.

<Content>The iPod 10 Giga-Bytes. These Guys know how to do the music business! The iPod Has a VERY sleek design for your pockets and case.(I Strongly suggest the case...)With the iPod you can make the huge piles of CD's from the 80's into little AAC Files (Mp4 files). This Helped me and my father. <br>     I got My iPod after my original Mp3 player broke,(it was some wierd hard drive player the size of a brick.) and I have NEVER regreted it. Just using this program may result in: Mac Fever, buying pepsi just for the iTunes lid, thinking or dreaming about a brand new iMac or iPods. <br>     Anywho, You Should buy this! Just keep it away from any electrical devices that include: Van de graff generators, The Ball Things That Have the sparks inside it. it messes with the touch buttons.

<Title>Sweet!
<Date>Tue Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When mp3 players came out I was fairly dissapointed until I discovered the iPods. Apple makes the absolutely top of the line mp3 player on the markey. Yeah, you can go buy a mp3 player for a fraction of the cost, but you'll also get a fraction of the quality.<p>The new iPod minis are great, but I'm still using my good old 10 gig iPod and it hasn't let me down yet. The batteries last practically 4ever, and it's durable and cool looking to.<p>A note to anyone trying to decide on size: don't automatically buy the biggest iPod just because it's the biggest. Chances are you're never going to use all of the space. One of the best ways to utilize the Pod is to put all your favorite music on it and then just set it to randomly shuffle between songs. You can't do this if you have a couple of gigs of the good stuff and 38 gigs of junk...

<Title>This is very expensive  but worth it
<Date>Sat May 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this is so cool. i got one for crhistmas and loved it. i have about 529 songs on mine because i get all of my songs from my schools media room. the teacher is devoted to apple brand software, computers, acsseories, and speakers. this is very cool and the songs are cheap. theres just one problem, when listening to loud songs, you should turn it down because for a small item, this can be hered from a room away when left playing and at max voloume! and it moves alone when its loud! but it is good and it has a cool backlight so when your in the dark, the screen lights up and so do the buttons. it dsiplays the time, date, and it has a photo and video slot and you can keep your scedhual. it also has games like brick and solitare. it also has a special game where it takes all of your songs and makes a music quiz where it gives you 90 seconds of a song and a list of songs for you to pick and get right. this is the only game that you can't listen to a song while playing. the back has it's own licences number and the logo. it has an area for your settings and your ipod's identity(a.k.a your name, tis number, the amount of songs it currently contains,, and the amonut of space you have left and how much is used. pretty cool right! thanks!

<Title>A Perfect Creation for Music Lovers
<Date>Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I first saw I-POD at the MAC display in King of Prussia and I was just bowled over by its sleek design. But it was much more then the Design when I received my i-POD from Amazon. <br>The functionality, the ease to use, the sound quality everything is perfect about this little gadget. Its Got Games, its got address book, you can use it as external hard disk.. and what not. Overall a must buy for anyone who loves all his music to be with him/her.<br>Although there are a few points which you should think about, <br>1. if you are ordering a 10 GB ipod...and for Windows, it doesnt come with USB, so you will have to install a firewire port like I did (if you dont have already). Firewire port externally installed doesnt give the speed claimed.<br>2. Do buy a carrying case, the lil ipod is so sleek that it can slip out of your grip anytime.<p>so Go ahead and beleive me you will love this ...

<Title>iPod rocks on!
<Date>Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was initially skeptical when I was given an iPod as a Christmas gift. I didn't have a vast collection of MP3s, and was not sure that I would use it all that much.<p>Well, now that I have had it for almost six months, I must say, WOW! I take it to work with me everyday (in fact, I am typing this review whilst listening to some classic Beatles on my iPod). It has become an essential part of my life, and I cannot imagine life without it.<p>Combined with iTunes as a way of organising my music, and adding in the power of AAC encoded audio, it kicks butt. Buy one, or better still, buy one of its bigger brethren. The convenience, power and ease of use make it one of the coolest consumer electronic gadgets I have gotten in years.

I was very leery at first because I did not want to waste the money on something that I will not use very much.  I have to say though; this mp3 player has changed my life!  I never go anywhere without it.  It has replaced all of my CDs to the extent that I have sold most of them.  This player out performs any other on the market and always performs flawlessly.  I am also very surprised at how often apple releases new updates on the player.  I am a windows user and I use win 98se with absolutely no problems at all.  Please do not hesitate to buy this because it is worth it.

<Title>Love Music? Can't Do Without iPod.
<Date>Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received the 10gb iPod from my pops for a graduation present and I have to say it's MORE then worth the price. The iPod is simply amazing. Just opening the box to retrieve the 'Pod' is a treat. Apple designed some sort of iPod-origami to create a square-looking box that is truly artistic and practical. Once I got to the machine inside, my life was complete. The iPod is so smooth and the features so extensive, it looked as though it should be in a James Bond film. The backlight illuminates the `Pod' so beautifully, giving the buttons a red glow while turning the viewing-screen a sharp, white color. I never wanted to turn it off. It's as though I should've placed the instrument on a mantel when through listening just to gawk at its beauty.<p>Furthermore, I could actually hear the iPod spin its compact hard drive. Upon taking it out of the box, it turned on to reveille language options and instantly hooked me into configuring the entire thing.<p>Overall the iPod is the most beautiful machine I've ever laid eyes upon. The long battery life is simply icing on the cake and the number of songs it holds is astonishing. If Apple makes computers as well as they constructed this music piece, it's no wonder people obsess over Macs.

I have only had this MP3 player for about 1 month, and I already have over 150 songs stored on it. No problem using music match jukebox... it's very easy once you get the hang of it. <br>The iPod is so sleek and simple. It is so beautiful, and I take it everywhere. <br>I absolutley love the scroll wheel, it makes everything so easy. It's very easy to operate, and It weighs so little. (less than 2 CDs in jewel cases!!)<br>I hope that for the prospective buyer, that you are willing to spend a few extra dollars and get this iPod. I garuntee you will not be dissapointed.

<Title>"to good to be true" I said. MAN WAS I WRONG!
<Date>Sat Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Ok lets start with the teanie,weanie,bad news:<br>1. The first problem is that it was truely made for Macs. All of the included acessories are Mac only compatible unless you have a Fire Wire card already installed on your Comp. <br>2. The second is that you need to buy a USB 2.0 wire for people who have a PC. Unfortunately if your comp is older than 2 years you probabally need to buy a USb 2.0 PCI card. Without it, your sunk. Your comp wont recognize the Ipod because of the older 1.1 USB Driver therefore no music can be transfered. But no worries its about [$$$] for the USB 2.0 Cord and [$$$] for PCI card, but trust me they will garantee a faster and swifter download of music. <br>3. Oh ya it would help to have or burn a copy of Windows Xp because of its great compatibility with installing a recognizing new devices,software,ect..<p>Now for good stuff..<br>WOW!! times 5. This Mp3 is amazing, so much to do with it besides music. You got games, scheduler, clock, alarm, great organization for music playlists and songs. Sound quality is great and dwonloading is swift and easy. Download all your CD's in 2 minutes a CD or faster.( depends on how much songs are on it.)So small and sleek looking its great for traveling and fitting anywhere. If you buy the carrying case for sport activites you can jog, hike,bike, ect.. without it falling out.<br>IF you got the cash$$$ i sugest you buy this one it goes quick so get yours now. Nothing beats it! Best on the market fro your money. So why you still reading? BUY IT!!

<Content>I had never been very big on Mac products, but after deciding it was time to move up from my 32MB MP3 player, I settled on the iPod.  This device is absolutely amazing.  10GB is plenty of room for me.  I had a little trouble settting it up to run on my Windows Me operating system.  MusicMatch always said it was not connected even though Windows said it was there.  Finally after trying it on two different comptuers I took it back and exchanged it for another one only to have the same problem.  I then tried it on one of my friends computers which had WinXP.  After hooking it up there I was able to format the drive.  Brought it back to my house, no luck.  Then I found some software called ephPod 2 on the internet and it works just fine.  All the iPod software still says its not connected to my system but hey, it works.  I deffinately advise anybody thinking of purchasing an iPod to go ahead and do it.  May seem a little expenseive, but it's well worth it.

<Title>Hard to Fault ..Except  Extreme Volume Limits on Euro Model
<Date>Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Ditto what everyone says below --- hard to imagine better bang for the buck than this sensationally slick little wonder of technology. I do however, have one knock against it which I view as quite significant. It simply does not produce enough volume for my liking: and I'm not a headbanger by any means. I would strongly advise anyone considering this to try it out first. I'm referring here to the models with 2.0 software -- for some reason the earlier versions do allow the user to tinker with the upper registers. But not the newer ones, which is big disappointment. Other than that -- great machine.<p>ADDENDUM: The volume problem described above relates to all Gen 3 iPods sold in Europe (where I purchased mine) -- the US models are fine. New French "Big Brother" regulations limit the db levels produced by personal stereos and Apple decided -- for some reason -- to apply these limits to all European models. There is a thunderstorm of indignation about this issue on the iPod related chat boards. Apple has been curiously silent on the issue. So Europeans, beware!

<Title>The player that set the bar.
<Date>Fri Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>over and over again I keep hearing in tech circles when the &quot;ipod killer&quot; will come out, that is, when dell or gateway or rio will come out with a player that can compete with the ipod.  my own ipod is a great player, granted I am using a Mac the Mac OS and the ipod were designed to work with each other.<br>the ipod is small enough to fit in your pocket, carries all your music and organizes it.  people wonder why buy apple since there are other players that have more memory or cost less.  i ask why buy a jaguar or a mercedes when there are other cars that have the same horsepower but cost less?  apple takes ideas like music players and puts top-quality design into them, being able to find 1 of 900 songs in a few seconds is great.  I took it out the box, hooked it up and had my whole collection uploaded in less than three minutes.  it is made of a tough(but hardly scratch resistant) plastic and stainless steel, other players are made out of toy plastic.  other players may have lots of features, like voice recording and FM radio (something that would be nice) but there is no other player that has a cleaner and simpler interface than the ipod and voice recorders and other accesories are easy to buy if you need them.<br> plus apple listens to people, any complaints people have are listened to and their products keep getting better. as for some of the features that other players have, apple lets third parites take care of it.  there are thousands of accesories out there, from microphones to card readers and hundreds of designer cases, how many of those do you get with the Dell jukebox?  I have a freeware program called pod2go that puts news, weather and notes onto my ipod, where is the community of people writing freeware for the Rio nitrus?  <br>Apple encourges ideas in people, you are not just buying a player you are buying a platform that is surprisingly open and constantly being improved.  <br>sure the ipod is not perfect, but it raised the bar for the rest of the industry and challaged everyone to put out better quaity products.

<Title>Can't live without it
<Date>Sat Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my 10 GB I-Pod since Thanksgiving, and definately don't regret buying it. It is amazing how many songs you can fit on something so small; I love having my whole music collection wherever I go. It is pretty easy to use, and the software installed w/o any problems. Since I have a Windows PC, the wire that came w/ it (firewire) did not connect to my computer, although some PC's may have the required connection. I simply had to purchase an extra connection cable for USB from Circuit City (an extra $20). The software for converting CD's to mp3 files works well, and it takes about 5 minutes per CD (on my computer).<br> <br>Overall, I love my I-Pod. The back is a little scratched up from everyday use, but otherwise it has stayed in good shape. I definately recommend the purchase of this product. I have the 10 GB version and still have PLENTY of room after loading on my favorite CD's. A must have for any music lover...

<Content>There are SOOOO many outright lies in the review by the "electronics fan" from Sterling, Virginia, I don't know where to begin. How about from the top.<p>1. He or she (let's call him or her "Sterling", okay?) calls it a "Mac only product". Ugh. Not only has been made for PCs for almost two years, the vast majority of iPods are sold to PC users. That's an indefensible lie on Sterling's part.<p>2. "The buttons on the front are touchy...I keep on turning it on accidently."<p>The touch-sensitive buttons are by definition "touchy". That's why they're called "touch sensitive" -- and also why THERE'S A LOCK SWITCH ON TOP. Sterling's ommission of the elegant lock switch is pretty damning evidence for the hypothesis that Sterling has never even used an iPod, much less owned one.<p>3. "a fully charged battery barely lasts 2 hours of listening time..."<p>Well, I'd think you'd find a good majority of iPod users out there agreeing with the product's specification of 8 hours of listening time, or slightly less if the hard drive is used heavily (by skipping ahead alot, for example). Another deceptive lie. (Hmm, do you work for Microsoft, Sterling?)<p>4. "There is no setting to disable the front panel controls."<p>Um, see #2 above. Lie, lie, lie.<p>5. "ACC format...what's that all about? Nothing on the PC side of the world (hey folks, 98% of the computing public are PC oriented.) uses ACC format (except for some obscure apps like the horrendous Music Match and the equally bad iTunes)."<p>Um, it's called "AAC", not "ACC". I'll tell you what AAC is about. Advanced Audio Coding is part of the international standard known as MPEG-4 and you'll be seeing a lot more about it. Nokia, Europe's largest cell phone maker, uses AAC. The RealPlayer music store uses AAC. And iTunes, the most popular download software on the planet by far (70% market share) uses AAC. A deceptive lie to call it "obscure". Again, more evidence that you're just astroturfing for Microsoft.<p>6. "If iPod users want to make their music that they download from iTunes available to their home stereo using a wireless network connection, what device would they use?"<p>There are all kinds of companies, other than the ones you mentioned, that do this -- Philips, TEN, TiVO -- do a google search on AAC streaming. Of course, iTunes has built in Rendezvous (an open standard) streaming, so expect to see a LOT more on this front soon. Not to mention bluetooth and RF solutions, which are simpler.<p>7. "I have an 85GB MP3 Music library."<p>Great. The iPod support that.<p>8. "custom software assures that I always have fresh music based off of what I already listened to"<p>You don't need "custom software" with iPod -- iTunes "smart playlists" feature accomplishes this for normal people that aren't programmers like you apparently are.<p>9. "These are things you cannot do with Acc format music folks!"<p>Nothing your byzantine setup you describe excludes AAC as far as I can see. Of course, the songs you buy from iTunes are protected somewhat and can't be shared freely with just anyone. But your complex setup can't be accomplished with Microsoft's protected download files from iTunes's competitors, either.<p>10."iTunes for Windows. Man...can any single application suck as bad as this? First, it's nothing more than a thinly veiled medium for pushing Apple's other products (Jobs has even admitted that he is using the iPod the iTunes to "suck" windows users into the Mac world)."<p>You contradict yourself here. You say it sucks, and then you say it's an attempt by Apple to make great software to convince Windows users into buying Apple's products (which it is). Considering how popular it is, and the rave reviews it's gotten from the PC press, forgive us if we don't take just your word for it.<p>11. " The first problem with iTunes is that you don't have consistant menues for your second mouse button and the third mouse button doesn't exist..."<p>Um, last I checked most PCs had two mouse buttons, not three. And I think iTunes interface is incredibly consistent, surely moreso than WinAmp.<p>12.  "Second problem is that this interface is nothing more than a re-badged browser! And it doesn't use any of your existing internet settings like your favorites menu, nor your automatic form fillers, or any of the browser help objects you may have installed (like Google toolbar with an auto fill form app) And let me tell you...you have to fill in a lot of fields to download a song!"<p>This is just flat-out wrong. iTunes is an MP3 player with a built-in store, automatic background downloads, multi-threaded operations. It's ONLY one to use "one-click" technology -- so once you set it up, you NEVER have to fill out ANY fields. You click "buy song" and three seconds later you have the full song on your computer, forever. Instant gratification.<p>It's also ridiculous to falsely label it a browser and then complain it's not a browser (with your "favorites" menu, security icons, or what have you)!<p>12. "And whats with spending a buck for a song?"<p>99 cents too much for a song? The 30 million plus satisfied customers would disagree. Also, if you buy an album, it's only $9.99, no tax or anything, so often it's much, much less than 99 cents per song.<p>If you don't want to pay 99 cents for the instant gratification of getting music you want legally (and supporting the artists -- much more so than through CDs), you can continue to steal MP3s, as you apparently have. The iPod will play stolen music just fine!<p>13. "And a low resolution song at that? Sure, ACC format recorded at 128 is like MP3 at 132 or something like that...sure...but it's still compressed audio. And it's compresed audio at 10 times compression...Folks, look up the term "lossy compression" you will find out that music that is compressed is done by REMOVING sound! Yes, that's right! the sound you want to hear is removed from the music to make the file smaller. The smaller the file, the more sound is taken out of the music! CDs have (get this) CD quality sound...makes sense, right? The music you download from iTunes has one tenth of the music that CDs have."<p>Wow, what a long-winded harangue on compressed music. This from someone with 85 gigabytes of compressed MP3s!!!! Hypocritical.<p>14. "And since you're not getting the liner notes, or the video that is sometimes included on the CD, you should pay less than one tenth of what a CD costs!"<p>No, you're paying almost half. Or, if you buy just the three songs you probably want on the CD, less than $3. But iTunes does include limited liner notes and many high-res QuickTime videos, for free!<p>15. "Plus, when you consider that there is the distribution, bricks and morter (physical stores) and employees that need to be paid, you can see that at the costs that a CD is, (about $17 now) a downloaded MP3 should be less than 17 cents!"<p>I don't know where you learned your math, but Apple's not making any money on your purchase, as you said before... and you're saving considerable amounts.<p>16. "Come on people...it's your money...vote with your wallets!"<p>They are... and you're losing.  :-)<p>17. "In all, I gave this device 2 stars becuase it does look cool...but unfortunatly, it's not the device for windows users!"<p>And which one is, considering your strange criticisms?<p>Yes, it does look cool. NO OTHER DEVICE is as small or as powerful. The cheaper knockoffs are all BIGGER AND HEAVIER.

<Title>A great music streaming device

<Content>The Sterling, VA review below incorrectly says there are no wireless streaming devices for AAC. The Roku SoundBridge with WiFi adapter is one such device, and it looks great: http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/

<Title>iTunes for Windows is unstable
<Date>Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just bought one of these and the iTunes application consistenly crashes my XP system.  Hard to know what to do since Apple doesn't provide phone support.  I'm in reboot hell and seriously considering returning the product.

<Title>Very good MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the first piece of Apple hardware that I've ever owned.  While there were some challenges to overcome in getting it to work with my PC, once I got past them, it's been a great player.  The standard earbuds produce much better sound than I expected (even if they aren't the most comfortable to wear in your ears).  I found the interface very intuitive to use.  Building playlists on the fly, skipping tracks, adjusting volume, etc are all very simple as a result.  The only complaint I have with the hardware is that the battery life isn't quite what I expected.  But it's been good enough to pass the time on many a plane flight.<br>The integration with MusicMatch (still my favorite music collection software on the PC) was pretty good, but iTunes for Windows integrates far better.  It does a great job of replicating the interface of the iPod, and makes great use of the screen real estate.  The smart playlists are its best feature.  The graphic equalizer works very well also.<br>I'm glad I bought it.  If you're in the market for an MP3 player, I highly recommend the iPod.  The 15GB version might be the best deal, since you get the remote and the dock as well.

<Title>iPod is an unreliable piece of junk
<Date>Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a new iPod and only used it for a few months before the hard drive failed. It is now dead.... I've sent it in for repairs, but I'll probably be on the hook for hundreds of dollars to get it fixed. This is not a relaible device. If you are looking for something to use for active sports like skiing, etc. my advice is to look elsewhere. For the time being, I'm back to using my old Creative Labs Nomad 3, which I've had for years and has held up quite well, unlike my iPod which has failed in an embarassingly short amount of time. Shame on you Steve Jobs!

<Title>AWSOME!
<Date>Wed Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This MP3 player ROCKS!  My friend with a Mac got a 20gb model for christmas, and I thought it was really cool, so i disided to get one for christmas.  I picked up a USB 2.0 cable, and it works great with my Windows XP Compaq computer system.  It looks cool, sounds great, and the transfers are really fast.  It has my entire music collection and I have only used a fith of its Hard Drive.  The games are also very fun, and I succed in transfering all of my contacts from Palm Desktop without much trouble.  If you are thinking about buying an MP3 player, iPod is THE BEST!
