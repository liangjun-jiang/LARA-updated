<Title>Awesome MP3 player - Simple yet powerful music

<Content>128mb Muvo by Creative.  My first Mp3 portable.  Does everything I need, works flawlessly with WinXP/2000 and WinMedia 8/9/10.  Plays MP3 and WMA files.  About 30-40 - plays in alphanumeric order.  Also great as a jumpdrive/flashdrive.  I pick my top 25 songs and have space to haul critical documents (word, excel, html etc).  For less than a Andrew Jackson, this is well worth it!  Its simple, elegant and plays music awesome (I use my Sennheiser PXC 250s).  
<Overall>5

<Title>Great, but small capacity

<Content>I love this little player - it weights almost nothing, fits in the tiny coin pocket of a pair of jeans, and is really simple to use.  My only complaint is that it hold very little music (I think about 20 songs), and I can't figure out if you can buy another flash drive without buying the whole player, too...

<Content>I'm a simple gal, and only needed something to play music. For me, 50 songs is plenty, so I got this cheap one. Surprisingly, it's been working perfectly well, allows me to hold important docs with me on the flash drive, and is easy to use.   I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to pay big bucks for an Ipod, shuffle or anything, and just wants to play music from MP3s.
