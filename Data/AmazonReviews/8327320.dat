<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player is a piece of junk. I bought it from amazon last christmas after reading all these good reviews about it. If you plan to transfer files from windows media player or napster to this device DON'T BUY IT. The firmware is sketchy and hard to download. I have had a problem with licensing on it. When i called the customer support for napster, they told me they had no clue what was wrong with it. The support from the iriver company was bad as well. The player is now collecting dust on my desk, and the music is slowly decaying somehow. I suggest you buy an Ipod and put hacked music on it or something, or take a chance and buy the Sandisk Sansa e270. It looks a lot better, but than again, so did the Iriver H10.

<Title>This machine is a workhorse!

<Content>Like everyone else, I did all the research and knew I wanted to use Napster. So, I ended up with this unit and it has been great.   People may complain about the set up or song transfer, but I have had no issues and it works like a charm.  But most impressive is this... I have had this MP3 player for almost one year. I have it running in my car and office for an average of 10-12 hours a day, non-stop. I get to work, plug it in and listen until I go home at the end of the day. Whatever durability testing iRiver did, I have surpassed it. And it is still running perfectly.  It's been dropped, kicked, baked in the car, and even doused with water. It is still going.  After all the issues with durability I have heard about other MP3 players, this one rules. I got my money's worth a long time ago and am now looking for a 20GB.

<Title>For those on a budget, not bad
<Date>Sun Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking to pick up a new mp3 player at Circiut City, and saw this for $100 so I figured I should give it a shot, since everything else near 6gb was $70+ more. Heres a breakdown.  PROS -Removable battery -Built in Radio -Decent earbuds, replace them if you're a complete sound freak though. -Color screen that is very crisp/clear -Good layout -Built like a tank -Relatively cheap  CONS -Touchpad/interface not nearly as easy to use as, say, the ipods -Horrible cables which require you to have the computer in order for the wall charger to work. -"Syncing" your player to your computer is annoying/tedious -Sometimes mine will mess up, such as none of the songs or only certain songs will play until I shut it off, take out the battery, and hope it works the next time.  So all in all its just an OK unit. I would never suggest it over an ipod, but for those on a budget looking for a music player that will do just what it takes, this is a good choice.
