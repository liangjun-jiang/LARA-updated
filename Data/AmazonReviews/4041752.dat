<Title>A rich feature set that falls short....
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After purchasing this product almost three weeks ago I can say I am less than impressed. Build quality is cheap. The on board controls are sub par. The record quality is only servicable on VGA mode or better. Even on the small screen, QVGA is way too jerky. Don't buy this unit for the sole purpose of recording copy protected (MacroVision) material. Get a better product and put a Time Based Corrector (TBC) between source and recorder.  They market this thing as a PVR. It is not. First of all, I don't believe you can set up mulltiple recording sessions (you can set the one recording session to repeat daily or weekly). Second, and this may seem picky, but it really annoys me, is the lack of ability to schedule record time for the AV input. Why would you need this? When when the conversion utilities work slower than real time it is easier to just hook the unit to a dvd player and record the movies you want to take along. Unfortunately, you have to be there to shut the recorder off or you'll wind up recording hours of the DVD menu which you can't edit out on the device.  But to me the most critical shortcomings lie in the unit as an MP3 jukebox. Yes, with a line like: "MPM-201 lets you store and manage a lot of your favorite songs" , it is being marketed as an MP3 jukebox as well. As such, I bought it to have access to my music collection on my boat. Unfortunately, not only is the unit devoid of any playlist or ID3 support, but what others have failed to mention is that the MPM201 cannot even continue playing an MP3 track while browsing the music collection. Cheap CD-R, and flash players are capable of this level of multitasking. Hell, even my last two cell phones would let me browse my music files while they played music. Imagine hosting a party when somone asks you to play a sepcific song. After two minutes of silence browsing throguh 30GB of music, wham! There it is!  It's a great idea, good price point, and a rich feature set. Unfortunately the marketing executives probably listened to what the public wanted, generalized the feature set, then left it to the R&D department to design the unit in a vaccuum. Then perhaps the unit was then rushed to market with glaring faults that should have been noticed by the first group of beta testers (if there were any). These faults IMHO make the device not worth the $400 (unit, tax, and shipping) I paid. I would have sent it back if Target.com didn't charge a 15% restocking fee and shipping charges. Right now I'm dealing with NHJ's less than stellar support in an effor to get these problems addressed or at least find out whether they even have interested in doing so.  My advice: If you still feel you want this player, only buy from a vendor with a liberal return policy. Or at the very least, get your hands on one before you buy. And yes, my unit is for sale.  I will update this post should HNJ release an update before I have to return the item to Target.com.   Should the likely happen an an update is not forthcomming, I will return the item, take the $70 hit and hold to a vow never to buy another prokduct from NHJ or Target.com again.

<Title>Excellent Video and Music player

<Content>I found this product to be an excellent alternative to the other more expensive MPM player recorders on the market. I found the hardware durable and the on board controls easy to understand. The QVGA settings produce a good picture but take up a lot of hard drive space. I prefer to use the DIVIX format and I use the DIVIX software that came with the player to encode all my movies. The key to getting as many movies on this player as possible is to rip the DVD first then encode only the movie VOB files. This way you will avoid the menu items. When I want something from the T.V., I capture it with a capture card and record it as a DVD file set then I handle it the same way as I do the DVD's. As for the mp3 play back feature you cannot play a song and browse the play list. However, anyone using this product for a party source is stretching the usability of the portable device. Remeber, this is a personal player not a home player. For 216 dollars, this player is a steal

<Title>Low Price-Great features
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item a couple of months ago and I am astounded at the feature set. I got it for entertainment and mass storage for digital photos when I travel. The music features aren't important to me as I have a small iPod for that and I was aware upfront that the MPM 201 did not support playlists and is too bulky for that use. However it is really easy to record TV shows and DVDs to take on the road. My only problem has been trying to find spare batteries. The battery only lasts three hours and I can't find a US distributor to buy additional batteries. It is a well-designed piece of equipment at a really good price.
