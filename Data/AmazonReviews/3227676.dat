<Title>FANTASTIC!!!
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I Love my new Samsung MP3 player, I haven't put very many songs on it yet but so far so good. It has vibrant colors and a lot of different features. The navigation is pretty easy to understand and get used to. And its so easy to personalize by putting videos or pictures etc. It's definetly different from an Ipod in a good way. If you don't want to follow the crowd but still want something reliable than this is the perfect product.

<Content>I really like this player.  It is so much better than my last one from Creative.  Easy menu choices once you get the hang of it. Very good sound and lots of good features.  I recommend it highly to anyone wanting a low price but better alternative to the Ipod units.

<Title>this mp3 pales not only to the iPod but to the cheaper Sandisk mp3 players
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had an iPod Mini.  It died with no hard use in 11 months.  I bought this Samsung player at Best Buy for [...].  The player's navigation keys weren't quite as good as the iPod clickwheel.  The memory is tiny for a player that can do so much.  I like the addition of FM radio and games.  Here's the problem.  When only  28 days old, the screen died.  I used it about as much as my iPod Mini, which is not very much.  The earbuds are mediocre, the navigation buttons pale in comparision, and it's reliability is awful.  I was also annoyed because the price on the 1 gig Nano went down $50.  I got a full refund and went to Walmart.  For only $85, I bought a Sandisk Sansa m240 with 1 gig.  That's right, I gave up the color screen and games, but got twice the memory and saved $65.  I have had my Sandisk for over 3 months.  I use it everyday at school in homeroom and run with it on our treadmill for 30 minutes everyday.  This player was used more in a week than the others were ever used in half a month.  I was going to say a month, but the Samsung YP-T8 didn't even last that long.  Don't buy the Samsung YP-T8.  It pales in comparison to the iPod, the iRiver Clix, the Creative Zen V Plus, and even the cheaper Sandisk Sansa m200 series.  Actually, this pales in comparison to just about any mp3 player on the market.

<Title>Feature-Rich MP3 Player Is a Big Hit
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We purchased the Samsung YP-T8X 512 MB MP3 Player for our 10-year-old daughter last Christmas.  It was an excellent choice because it does just about everything you could imagine.  In addition to having a sleek, contemporary design, it has great sound and a brilliant colorful display.  With the software provided, you can convert video to MPEG4 to play on this little dynamo. I was able to store several cartoons including "The Grinch" as well as over 40 songs. You can also view digital pictures, record and play FM radio stations.  The unit has excellent picture quality.  The player also comes with a couple of games you can play.  My daughter loves the player and we have had no problems with it.  We are planning on buying another one for my 9-year-old son this Christmas.

<Content>My daughter wanted this beacause her friend got one and liked it well about a month later she traded it for an ipod. With the player make sure you have the right program for downloading or you will have problems. Research it to. We also couldn't play video so check the direct X version you have and see if it is compatible first. My suggestion just get one of the new ipod nano's. We like the ipod a lot better.

<Title>It's not a keeper
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking to save my 10 year old son some of his birthday money so I shopped around for the best deal I could find. The Samsung YP-T8X 512 MB Music and Movie Player was the best deal I found with all the features he wanted. The Samsung is a nice looking gadget with all the bells and whistles but it's feature are hard to use. The software that operates the music downloads is not user friendly. When the program is opened on your computer, the window opens bigger than my moniter. The buttons you need to click are not visable, therefore you need to drag the window up to access the buttons. As soon as you release the left click on the mouse, the window that moves the page up falls right back down, once again not allowing you access to the buttons you need to download music and videos.  In my opinion, spend a little more money and shop for a quality device with user friendly software.

This one has bookmarks and the ability to skip 10 minutes at a time to find the right spot.  Also has ability to play videos, pictures, read text documents, record and listen to FM radio.  Take a hike ipod... this one rules.  Ebayed for $26!!!!!

<Content>I have been using that mp3 player for 5 months, and I love it so much. It looks neat and the sound quality is very awesome. The only thing that bugs me is that it does not have a search option to search for the songs. You have to go through 100 songs to to find a specific song that you want to listen. Other than that, it is pretty cool.

<Title>Well suited as an audio book player, maybe more
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you would like to listen to electronic audio books in WMA format with DRM (digital rights management), this player might be just the ticket.  I believe that IPOD cannot do this.  There are so many aspects to this player, I cannot give it a general rating that is fair.  But, I have tested it for its utility as an electronic audio book player and found it to be the best among three older Samsung players I tested.  It has a bookmark facility as well as a hyper fast forward/rewind that will allow you to find your place in a 16 hour WMA file (~250 MB) within a minute (tested).  You should not have to though, it auto-resumes just where you left off, and you can place a bookmark just to be sure.  Takes a little learning curve though along with putting up with boot-up time.  Note that it is NOT very well suited to playing back audio books ripped from multiple CD's.  It does not recognize folders as playlist items, a big drawback if it is used as a CD audio book player or a music CD player.  It only understands individual tracks, but it handles very long WMA tracks very well.  I cannot even touch on all the features and shortcomings of this device... but it is well worth owning just to play with it.  A perfect starter because its limited memory capacity has driven the price down.  You will find excellent bang for the buck, as it is a slick and capable device, until you want more memory.  I have done only limited testing using it for photo, video, music, and recording.  Feelings are mixed so far, but would give it a 3/5 at the moment.  As a player for for downloadable eAudioBooks from Net Library, it is at max a 4 given the BEWARE notice below.   P.S.  No longer available new, be sure your used unit has a wall charger and USB cable included.  Software easily downloadable from Samsung but is not needed unless you want to transfer video (why bother?).  Works as a simple flash drive unless WMA DRM is used... It worked with Windows Media Player 9 for downloading WMA DRM.   BEWARE: Battery is built-in and may not be user replacable.  An automatic 1 point off the rating.

<Title>Does a little of everything competently
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player with the ability to do timed digital recording of FM broadcasts.  It's amazing how this feature pretty much clears the table of possibilities - I wouldn't have thought it would be so hard to do:  lots of MP3 players have clocks, and lots of MP3 players have FM tuners, but very few have the ability to set up the player like a radio version of a VCR to record broadcasts.  After a lot of searching, I concluded that there were not a lot of choices, and of those, I liked the YP-8X the best.    My first impression was that the box came with a nice set of accessories: all of the cords, a neoprene cover, a set of ok earbuds, and a lanyard for wearing it around ones neck.  The MP3 player itself looks like a small cell phone that's missing it's keypad.  Powering it on, there's a intro splash screen that takes longer to complete than it should and then you get the MP3 player function playing one of the two songs included by Samsung.    The controls aren't bad, but they aren't great either.  Nothing comes close to an iPod for navigation in my opinion, and Samsung, like the others, has a fair bit of catching up to do.  The menus are a bit confusing at first, the controls not immediately intuitive.  Hold down the menu button for a while to get the main menu, a short while to get to a sub menu.  I often don't hold down long enough and end up in the sub-menu.  I am often hitting the volume adjustment when I mean to be flipping songs.  It's not a bad interface, but it takes getting used to.  The sound is very good.  The maximum volume level can best be described as extremely loud.  The volume goes from 1 to 40, and most of the time I find myself with it set to 12-15 and it being comfortably loud.  I can't imagine what 35 must sound like.  The quality of the sound is good.  It comes with an audio enhancement feature called DNSe and I found this added too much of a reverb effect, while no enhancement at all made it sound a bit washed out.  I played with the equilizer for a while and came up with something that sounds good with my headphones and I'm more than content with the quality of the sound.  I haven't tried the video yet, but the photo quality is good.  It's fun to have pictures in the MP3 player and it's a fairly easy task to take them out of our digital photo album and put them into the player with the included software.  As far as the FM quality and the FM recording capability that I so desperately wanted, it's good.  I'm content.  The FM tuner does a better job than several others that I own (like the one in my cell phone) at pulling in stations while inside of buildings.  It has a tendency to change volume levels randomly a bit, but I'll take volume adjustments over white noise and the tuner does a good job overall.  I recorded a couple of radio shows tonight and the quality from those is excellent.  I can record daily, weekly or on one off occassions.  The games are a bit silly - the motion detector/accelerometer is an interesting gimmmick, but the games are a bit slow paced.  Lastly, 512MB feels small nowadays.  I grabbed a couple of albums, a handful of digital photos and a small video and before I knew it I was cutting back to save room for FM recordings.  I wish they made this in at least 1GB, but preferably 2GB.  Overall it's a bit big for what it is, the navigation takes some getting used to and 512MB seems like not enough, but the actual operaiton of the device works well and it does it's job competently.  I would recommend this to anyone who really wants to be able to record FM, but for anyone who just wants an FM MP3 player, or just a plain MP3 player, there are better ones out there in my opinion.  Comparing this to an iPod Nano - especially in terms of storage, interface and price - it comes out poorly, but if you want FM and can't live without it (like me), then this is a good alternative.

<Title>Excellent little player
<Date>Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Samsung really put together an impressive package here. Plenty of features make this device an extremely attractive alternative to the pricey iPods. There are only three negatives I'll give this little wonder: 1. Confusing navigation. One would think the NAVI button on the front bottom center of the device would control the main menu. Alas, it's the obscure little button on the right side. Until you had the device long enough to memorize which button to press, and when... and for how long, you'll find yourself accidentally navigating out of, rewinding, or advancing past various features. It's also notoriously easy to unwittingly wipe all your radio presets. 2. The FM tuner isn't the greatest. OK, but not great. It does, however, allow you to record and even create scheduled timed FM recordings. 3. This dang device says "DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYER" right across the front of it. Had I not done extensive online shopping before I went to the store to buy this sucker, I'd never have known about its fantastic multimedia capabilities (not even the know-it-all sales clerk at the department store knew it could even play video). That being said, I think this device is fantastic and my post-purchase impression is nothing short of excellent. No buyer's remorse here, folks. Although somewhat time-consuming, ripping one of my DVDs and converting it to the Samsung proprietary format necessary for viewing on the YP-T8X is relatively easy using free tools available on the web (you have to rip the DVD, convert to mpg, then to an svi file). A two-hour plus movie can easily fit in its 512Meg memory. The 4:3 TFT screen provides great viewing resolution, and battery life is way more than sufficient to watch a full-length film - more than a match for poor video iPod. The sound is excellent with a wide variety of preset and customizable equalizer and 3D options. Start with a great mp3 player. Add full-length movie capabilities, an FM tuner, text viewer, voice/radio recorder, motion-sensing games (you tilt the unit and it follows the motion - way cool), and image viewer and you have one heckuva little powerhouse. Only the frustrating navigation system kept me from giving this 5 stars.

<Title>Just buy an Ipod Nano for now.
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This item seems nice, until you read that it has...  512 megs of space.  What movies/books are you going to put on this?  And after you put something like that on it, what space will you have left for music?  I'm not an Ipod junkie, but this is worthless.  For $40 more, you get 1.5 gigs more.  I think that is well worth it.

<Content>I got the 1gb version, and my friend also got one. It's only about $20 more. This mp3 is soooo much better than the Ipod in my opinion. It has games, can be plugged to cameras or thumb drives to transfer files, and mainly it can play movies. If you have hundreds upon hundreds of songs, than yes, you wanna get an ipod. But if you want all of the features I stated above, than go with the YP-T8z. It cheaper than the ipod and has a lot more features.

<Title>I Love My NEW PLAYER!
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Samsung YP-T8X a week ago at Best Buy and it is amazing! I think they should call it something like an Entertainment Player or something instead of Digital Audio Player because it can do so much more than play audio. The videos actually come out really good on the screen. I just added a few music videos and recorded tv shows and they work great. It may seem like 512MB is not enough for videos, but once you convert them to the format required to play, the file size shrinks because the video isn't as big anymore. The photos and music and games are also great. I love how the games use motion instead of just pushing buttons. The battery also lasts a long time, 20 hours. The only time it runs out fast is when you use the USB host feature to connect another device to it, because the player is powering both itself and the device, which the manual clearly explains. Overall, I am very satisfied with my new player!

<Title>Ipod Killer, Spectacular!
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I currently own a 2GB Ipod Nano and just recently purchased the Samsung YP-T8X (to play videos). In my opinion, the Samsung is a superior product. The 1.8" screen is fantastic. The colors are rich and vibrant and the sound quality blows my Nano away. I chose to purchase the 512MB player instead of the 1GB, because I haven't even used half of the Nano's storage space yet.  However, I haven't looked twice at my Nano since purchasing this player. My only regret is not purchasing the 1GB player and that Samsung's 2GB (YP-T8A) version isn't available yet in the US. What a pity!  This player is an excellent choice for those with smaller media collections. If Samsung makes the 2GB version available in the US, I'm ditching the Nano altogether.  To those who ask the question, Is 512MB really enough space for anything?  The answer is yes. I've been able to get music, photos, text and video (converted to smaller format) on the player and still have more than half of the storage left.    However, if you have a huge multimedia library (which you wish to carry around with you all the time) 512MB or 1GB is not going to be suitable for your needs.

<Title>It's Best To Keep and Open Mind
<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Last week I decided to bite the bullet and dive into the Mp3 world.  I'd heard a lot about the iPod and I'd done some research, so I thought I was ready. When I went into the store it was the iPod I wanted and the iPod I was determined to get. Needless to say I was surprised (not to mention confused) when I saw the large variety of Mp3 players available (obviously, I don't read the trade magazines.).  The Samsung YP 512 caught my eye immediately because it was the slickest item in the bunch. I asked the very knowledgeable young salesman questions about the various models and from his response, decided to purchase the Samsung 512. Yesterday, I went back and purchased the 1GB. Why? This is the sharpest, clearest sounding, most feature packed, easy to use gizmo I have ever had the pleasure of holding in my hands!  Oh...what happened to my Samsung 512?  Well, I gave that to my Valentine!
