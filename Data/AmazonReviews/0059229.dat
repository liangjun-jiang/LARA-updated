<Content>HDD Read error when opened the box. I searched the internet and found it hapened to many others (I made a mistake not searching about the prodcut before purchase). No resolution was suggested. I packed it back and shipped it for refund.

<Content>When I first purchased my Coby MP3 player, I was very satisfied.  I would have happily given it a "5".  It worked wonderfully.  I have had it for about 3 or 4 months now and am starting to have many technical and other problems.  First, my battery lasts about 1 hour when the player is fully charged.  Second, I have a lot of trouble getting the screen sensors to register.  In other words I have to push on the screen many times before it registers what I want as far as switching songs or turning down the volume.  It often changes screens without my asking it to.  Right now, I can not get the player off of  the radio and continue to get error messages.  Additionally, I purchased one for my 17-year-old son.  His broke within one week.  He put it in his pocket and the heat caused the screen to go black.  He is not rough on his electronics.
