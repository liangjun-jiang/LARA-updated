<Title>Great deal
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2945594-6670202">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2945594-6670202">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>A Zune is worth a thousand pictures!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great item, bought my wife the ipod she wanted, and I got this same time. Both are great, do not let anybody tell you otherwise<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2945594-6670202">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>. If you can get this for less money, than why get the ipod? (plus the screen is great, a definate plus over the ipod)I had considered the itouch since I was looking for best bang for the buck with the best screen. I am so glad I did not get the itouch! A friend has the itouch, and it is great until you realize that you are constantly looking at it through you finger prints (that sucks).I will update if necessary.

<Content>My son wanted this for Christmas.  I couldn't find it in stores in this color.  I found it here at amazon, and it beat all the prices out there, and it was shipped prompt.  He was so happy with the color and all it's features.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OK0YWK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2945594-6670202">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Red)</a>

<Title>This Zune is Great!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the 30GB Zune for my son for Christmas in Dec 2007. I was torn between the ipod and the Zune, but since my son had thousands of songs from his DVDs and MP3 collection which the ipod would not play, I went with the Zune. I was a little concerned by a number of the negative reviews about the Zune PC software.  But I was amazed.  I installed the software on both my Windows XP and my sons Windows VISTA and it was the easiest and fastest instal I have ever done. It installed flawlessly and it recognized the devise immediately, it recognized that a newer version of the Zune software was available and after checking with me it then unstalled it smothly and quickly with no intervention on my part.  It then asked me if I wanted to load MP3,JPEG, and video files from my compuer and allowed me to override or limit, then it synched up the files flawlessly and was ready to play.  The music was great and the large screen (twice the size of the ipod) looked fantastic.  Manuvering around and using the Zune was easy and fun.  If there were problems in the Zune software earlier, they appear to be fixed because everything was easy, smooth and worked great.  I highly recommend the Zune!  Apple better watch out because the new Zune clobers the ipod hands down.  I highly recommend it and I am going to get another for my other son!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2945594-6670202">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Zune family
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2945594-6670202">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> I bought a 30G Zune a year ago and loved the way I could have my music, pictures and videos with me always. I am a mother of 4 and a grandma of eight so I have LOTS of pics and flicks. I have about 1900 songs,40 videos, and 212 pictures on my Zune right now with 14G to go. Two other family members bought Zunes through the year and it made it so nice to wirelessly share pictures with each other that I bought three more this Christmas as gifts for my husband, son, and sister. We are now a 6 Zune family and growing. We all love them and plan on buying more as the grandkids get older.

<Title>Great deal at $99
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this from Dell for their $99 price which included shipping.  Originally this was for only the brown version, but Dell ran out and substituted a white model which was nice.  I'm running the v2.3 firmware and I have the latest version of the Zune software.  I've had no sync problems.  The software is excellent and it's easy to manage my CD collection.  I have zero complaints about this product, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $200 price people are asking.   Pros: 1. Zune Software is easy to use 2. Zune UI is easy to use 3. Music quality is good 4. Wireless sync now works 5. Seems to be well made Cons: 1. A bit bulky 2. No auto rotate feature on the videos (doesn't auto-sense like an iPod phone). 3. Supplied earbuds are not that great (iPod owners complain of the same issue).  I got this as a Christmas present.  I liked it so much, I got two.  What I like best is that this simply does what it's supposed to do.  It's simple.  It was also a bargain.  I use it with an Altec Lansing docking station and that's also very nice.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQLPZE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2945594-6670202">Altec Lansing M604 Powered Audio System for Zune</a>.
