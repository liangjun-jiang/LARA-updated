<Content>I got one of these a few months ago and this thing is awesome!  This player is tiny and very lightweight!  But it has a lot of features.  The best is the built in speaker, which is surprisingly loud!  Because of its small size, it works great as a flash drive as well.  I use it not only for my music but transportation of files as well.  It also has a voice recorder and FM radio.  There's a text reader as well for quick notes, like driving directions.  And the stainless steel exterior just makes it look cool and keeps it from getting scratched up while its in my pocket.  This player is great, and I recommend it to everybody!  
<Overall>5
