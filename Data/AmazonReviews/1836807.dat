<Content>Though I own a Zen that I use for the majority of my music and some videos, I wanted something more compact that I could easily take with me to school and work, and something that would be less bulky for workouts.  This Sony Flash Player has proven to be a great tool.  It's highly compact, and yet still holds quite a few songs.  It also has pretty good sound quality, though I find the ear buds to be a tad awkward.  The USB plug-in makes it really easy to charge your player and load/unload songs at the same time on your computer.  One minor qualm I have with this product is the software.  It's not very user-friendly.  Furthermore, while I can get the software to work on my HP desktop, I can't get it to work at all on my SONY laptop computer, which I find baffling.    Nonetheless, though I find my Zen to be far superior to this particular player, this one is great for the price, and outstanding if you're looking for something small and relatively easy to use.   
<Overall>4
