<Product Name>Creative Labs Zen Micro Photo 8GB MP3/Photo Viewer
<Title>Piece of Expensive Junk
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I paid over 160.00 dollars for my 4G Creative Microphoto. It has never worked properly. The unit will not hold a charge. I emailed and called the company.Their reply was so sorry for the trouble, send us 25.00 dollars and we may be able to repair it.  I say again the unit cost over 160.00 dollars and I essentially got nothing. If you have money and time to waste on junk then this is just what you are looking.  If not,then I strongly encourage you to shop elsewhere.  Rick Eanes
