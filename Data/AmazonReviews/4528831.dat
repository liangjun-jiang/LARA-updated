<Title>A breeze to get started
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I'm realitively new to MP3 music, but with the software included it was very easy getting started. With in 15 - 30 mins I had music recorded on my player. A great feature of this product is that it will play WMA files also which are half the size of MP3 files which makes this player able to hold 2 hours worth of music. I am very happy with my purchase and the quality of the product.

<Title>Beautiful but Flawed - applies to the psa play 120
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This review applies to the psa play 120 which is the same as this but with twice the memory.  This little player has lovely lines and texture, is very tactile and robust. Unfortunately it is spoilt by some quality and functional issues.  Good points: Looks and feel. Sound quality is good. Has a good quality armband - but it does slip (slowly) down if you exercise wearing it on your upper arm. Has a belt clip - You can use either the clip or the armband but not both at the same time.  Bad points: If you leave the battery in the player it runs down, regardless of whether or not the player is switched on. This is really annoying - but there is a firmware fix available on the web.  The remote is difficult to operate and gets confused. I have not used it since the day of purchase.  The headphones are not suitable for the sporty purposes of the player. They are the most bizarre in the ear design that directs the sound forwards and backwards rather than into the ear- if you run with them you get inerference from wind noise. You need better headphones - Koss (s)portapros are great.  The software is not very flexible. E.g. I have not been able to get it to recognise files that it didn't record itself.  Connecting with the pc is either unreliable or complicated - i.e. when the software fails to communicate with the player, either it is doing something wrong or I am - impossible to know which. I have found a usb port that seems to work consistently now - I suspect it is my mistake rather than the software's.  If you record mixed cds (i.e. DJ mixed) the player puts small gaps between the tracks on playback.  The lock player facility is incorporated into the on off slider switch between on and off. This is crazy - its too easy to switch the player off when you are trying to lock it.   When you pause the player, it suffers from long term memory loss - after a relatively short time it forgets that you paused it and starts at the beginning when you press play.  Despite these flaws I have not tried to get it replaced, because, after all, it is quite a lovely thing.

<Title>Good player for the sports minded and inexpensive
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>The player was great for it's size and and quality I really like teh fact that it uses the samrt media cards which has the smallest size of all the memory card out there.  The software is not very functional I don't evn use it I use the MS Media 7 player which is much betther to use.  but it holds a tone of music( in WMA formatt ) and the cards makes it easy to carry a variety of music with you.

<Title>Not recommended for runners
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I was initially very excited about this product. It is very light weight and ostensibly ideal for runners. It's meant to be used by athletes. However, it has broken 3 times now, all when running. When I run with it, either outside or on the treadmill, it gives of electrical shocks! The first time, the shock was so strong that the whole player shorted out and I had to send it back to be fixed - it wouldn't play anymore! This was just one week after I got it. The second time, just the headphones got damages, but they had to be replaced, because no sound came through them anymore. This last time, the shock was so bad that half of the internal memory was wiped out, and it no longer supports the external memory card. I would not recommend this player to someone who is looking for something durable and reliable.

<Title>Easy To Use
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I found this MP3 Player to be extremely easy to use and configure.  The case is scratch resistant and I liked the fact that you could remove the diplay and plug in directly to the player thus saving battery life.

<Title>Inexpensive, but not Incompetent
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is a very very good mp3 player.  The price is it's best feature.  But I am a student, so money is more important to me than anything else.  I do know enough about mp3 players to tell you that the quality is great, and the hardware is mint!  The LCD is crystal clear, and the head phones rock.  The only thing I found disappointing was the software.  I found it primative(which is good for people not to familiar with computers).  I don't even use the software for anything except downloading the music (there are other features like skins and playing songs [something like a cheap winamp]).  <br>To summarize all this, the system is great, the software is easy to use, and in my opinion, it is a GREAT buy.<p>ps.  You can only upgrade it to 96MB, not 128MB like some websites say!

<Title>memory lapses
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>i got this because i was looking for a decent player to work out with.  because it only has 32 mb built in, i bought a 64 mb mmc.  the player worked great until i put the memory card in.  then when i tried to work it in both my computer and my parents, i was told there was no memory at all...when i brought it back to where i purchased it, they gave me a new one, and i tried a different brand of memory card-maybe that was the problem.  nope, once i formatted it, i was told once again there was no memory.  and when i tried to contact the company, i kept getting forwarded to different people, and just decided to scrap the whole thing, so i returned it all.  it was a lot more hassle than i wanted.

<Title>There is one drawbback
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>The built-in 32mb with the psa(play)60 gets you about 25 minutes worth of music(not the 60 minutes that is advertised) if you have decent quality mp3s.  The sound quality is great and I have yet to hear the device skip. The only drawback is that most people do not realize that you need to download firmware from riohome.com so that you can have the choice of internal and external storage. This piece of information is not on the cd that comes with the device when you load Audio Manager. After visiting a newsgroup, I found out about the firmware and have been able to download to the 32mb MMC card I purchased for the device.  I have no complaints with the sound, just with all the grief that went into getting 45 minutes worth of music.

<Title>Theoretically good - practically bad
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Pros: mp3/wma playback, size<br>Cons: intermittent connectivity to PC, battery drain problem, loose LCD display, flimsy back cover<p>This player's specs looks nice at first: mp3 and WMA playback, 32mb upgradeable to 96mb, small size so you don't look like techno-dork, and I only paid $30 for it on Black Friday. Sound quality is good after ditching the supplied headphones and the LCD is nice.<p>But...<p>Even after the latest firmware upgrade, the battery discharges even when turned off - I'm lucky to get a few days worth out of it [only using it 1 hour/day]. <br>The back case is a bit flimsy and looks like it'll break off any day due to the constant changing of the battery. <br>Default software had problems connecting to Win98, Win2k, and WinXP - had to get the original Rioport with Nike PSA drivers...then use compatibility mode in Win2k and XP to trick it into working.<br>Default software makes it a pain to transfer songs to the unit: only exception is if ALL your MP3s have ID2 info PROPERLY entered.<br>The LCD hangs separately from the unit so it's easy to get it tangled onto anything.<p>Bottom line: not worth even the $30 I paid for it.

<Title>No Support
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I would not buy anything from RIO again. I have owned two of their MP3 players (Rio 600 and psa[play60). Both units broke within a month of purchase. As for the psa[play60 I can not get a customer service person to return my email. I have written 3 times in a two week span with no help. On their website they list the psa[play60 as a &quot;legacy&quot; product. I think they meant &quot;good luck getting these products fixed&quot;. I would recommend not buying any RIO product.
