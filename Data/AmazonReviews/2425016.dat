<Title>Doesn't work
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Someone is going to be very disappointed this Christmas after they open up their present only to discover that this MP3 player does not work.  I bought this unit, uploaded 1000 JPEGs to it, and the unit worked arbitrarily.  I could view some images, but a good percentage of the images would not load.  All the images were JPEGs, no other formats.  There was no obvious logic determining which would load and which would not.  I researched my problem online, and eventually had to call customer service.  They said I had to download and update the firmware, essentially admiting that the unit did not work  out of the box.  However, when I hooked the unit up again via the USB port, the computer would not recognize it. Even after I rebooted the computer would not recognize the unit.  Nor would my other computer recognize this Archos MP3 player.  Neither computer, however, had a problem recognizing a thumbdrive connected to the USB port.  The breakdown was obviously in the Archos 104.  To me, obviously the MP3 is faulty, inconsistant at best.  While I could possibly have bought a bad unit, one would still have to have an internet connection to upgrade the firmware.  This is not stated on the packaging, and one should not have to go to the Internet to upload his songs and pictures. These things should work out of the box. I have lost faith in the company.  If you decide to buy this MP3 player, make sure that you can get a 100% cash refund if you have to take back the player because it is faulty.  I really object to rewarding the company 10% of the price when the flaws were their fault, they dropped the ball.

<Title>Good Nano alternative

<Content>I have owned it for two months and have had no problems noted by the previous reviewer.  I have loaded it up with MP3 and WMA music files and with music from PlaysForSure web sites.  I have not put any photos on it but the display is bright and displays album music covers just fine.  It looks great and works great.

<Title>Better than an iPod
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the Archos 104 for a couple of reasons.  Its affordable and I've heard that it works great.  After getting it, I agree on both counts.  Not only is this an MP3/photo storage unit, it also functions as an external hard drive.  Unlike the iPod, you can storage any file type on this device.  It charges quickly and has great battery life.  And the batteries don't half life down after a month to six months of use.  Its a great buy.
