<Title>Work of Art Ruined By The Worst Software Ever Written 
<Date>Mon Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>From a hardware perspective, it's a work of art. Beautiful, sleek, lightweight, and solid feeling.  I got it in my hands and fell in love.  And then I tried to use it.  Which required installing SonicStage.  I'd read all the bad reviews of SonicStage, and I'd used (what I thought was) equally bad Sony software in the past -- OpenMG for their NetMD player, for example.  So I was prepared for some annoyances, fine tuning, maybe occassional bugs.  I also assumed the people who complained were exaggerating about how bad it was.   LET ME PROMISE YOU -- THEY WERE NOT.   In almost twenty years of using computer software, tinkering with electronics, owning some version of almost every gadget known to man -- I have never seen such a promising piece of hardware CRIPPLED by such a buggy, ill-conceived, underpowered, unintuitive piece of software.  It's WORSE than what people are telling you.   It's so bad that I ended up returning mine and buying an Ipod -- something I swore I'd never do.  The user interface isn't even consistent between the player and the software.  There's no way to shuffle all the songs on the drive.  User support is non-existent.  SonicStage freezes and crashes for no reason, despite being upgraded to latest version and uninstalled/reinstalled.   Certain songs won't transfer, others are marked as having no digital rights (even though they were tracks recorded from the same albums as other songs that transferred fine -- and that NEVER had digital rights assigned to them in the first place.)   A lot of people have complained about Sony forcing you to use their proprietary ATRAC3 format instead of MP3.  Honestly -- that's the LEAST of this unit's problems.  The bigger problem is that the software engineers are too incompetent to program a stable program that will actually CONVERT and MANAGE those ATRAC3's.   Sony's hardware engineers created this beautiful player, and their software engineers will be the cause of its failure.   Words cannot do justice to how badly Sony bungled this mess.  It kills me to say this, but don't waste your time.   **NEW ADDITION:  To the reviewers who make comments to the effect that anyone who has problems with SonicStage software either has a faulty computer or is a complete idiot:  Have you actually tried to USE the software?   Or do you just sort of sit and stare at the pretty pictures on the screen?  (I mean, come on.  Nobody's arguing that the hardware is extremely impressive, but the software is buggy, unintuitive, and inconsistent.  It's been pretty well documented by several thousand people. I can't imagine that anyone outside of the programming group that put that mess together would actually think it's a competent piece of software, and if they do, they must enjoy spending hours in front of their computer and not have much of a social life.)  Second, some reviewers have disputed my claim that the unit cannot shuffle the entire HD.  My claim is true, it has been substantiated by a senior marketing representative from Sony with whom I have exchanged several letters and phone calls.  Yes, you can shuffle within albums (or "groups"), and you can shuffle within artists and playlists.  But you CANNOT shuffle through the entire HD as a whole.  The only way this would be possible would be to designate the entire library as a single playlist, and playlists are currently limited to 1000 tracks.  So if you have 3,000 tracks on the player, there is absolutely, positively no way to shuffle those 3,000 tracks -- only subsets of those tracks (e.g., album, group, etc.)  I suppose you could spend several extra hours of your life creating complicated playlists and shuffle between those playlists.  But on an Ipod (and, incidentally, almost every other MP3 player on the market), you simply hit a menu entry titled "shuffle."

<Title>A better alternative to the ipod (informative,please read)
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a much better product than the ipod, it costs $350(20GB model)and holds 13,000 songs while the $400(40GB)model of the ipod only holds 10,000 songs and is a full $50 more. Also the Ipod(20 and 40GB models) brag about their small size but this is about the same size as the minis, with 16GB more memory(IPOD mini,$250,4GB,1000 songs)This isn't the cheapest per GB but it compacts your music better than any of the ipods so it can hold so much more music. It comes with a cradle, an accessary that costs you $40 to buy for the ipod,a case to protect it which would cost between $20 and $30(basic cases,not the H20case:$150 or GUCCI cases available)It also comes with a AC Power adapter which you have to buy for ipod. It is a beautiful product. Don't waste $ on ipods, but an IMAC G5 isn't a bad PC to consider. You can then put your music CDs onto your computer and stream them to your Sony music player directly from iTunes, which emphasizes using ipods but ends up being just as easy. DON'T FOLLOW THE TREND OF BUYING WORSE PRODUCTS JUST TO FIT IN, BUY A SUPERIOR PRODUCT, the SONY NETWORK WALKMAN

<Title>One Word - DRM, another word - JUNK
<Date>Thu Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This product is cool looking.  This product is well designed.  However, the DRM rules are stupid.  It is my music, I should be able to do with it what I want.  I do not need to be managed.  Their software is HORRID and without it, the device is useless.  I have a mini disc player, another cool looking, well designed product which now sits in a drawer because dealing with it is too much of a pain.  This is the new mini disc player, the new cool-looking, well-designed pain.

<Title>Succeeds at making your music portable
<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am quite a gadget person, and have needed for a long time a good way of making my music portable. It's very hard to find time to sit down in front of my home stereo and listen. I recently bought a Sony DNF400 portable CD/Atrac3 player and was impressed by the ability to cram 20 CD's into one at 68k encoding, with sound quality at about 90% of the original CD's.  And so I have had the NW-HD1 now for over a week and will share my impressions.  1)  Small form factor. Does indeed fit into your shirt pocket. I wouldn't use the NW-HD1 without a neck strap because if the unit falls to the ground, I doubt it'll survive because a hard drive is very sensitive to damage from shock. Or else, use a belt-loop case (not a belt clip, because someone can easily steal it when you're not alert).  2) I listen mostly to classical music, and so I need to listen to one or more CD's consecutively. If you accidently navigate away from the track you're listening, you could forget exactly where you were before. You could bookmark, but when you return to the bookmark, you only get to play what's bookmarked. Not good.  3)   Equalizer is FANTASTIC, as every 'phone has it's own response and you need to check the response curve so it sounds more neutral.  4)   Battery life isn't anywhere near 30 hours on my unit. More like 20, and that's when you use the player in real life (i.e. switching tracks, using the menu, etc.)  5)   No remote. For a top of the line player, it should come with a remote. You can buy a  remote on the internet from various sources. In some countries, I believe the player comes stock with a Sony RM-MC35ELK.  6)   The case is a joke. It's not even a case, just a cover. It doesn't allow you to attach it to anything.  7)   ATRAC3plus at 68k sounds very fine, as good as MP3. You can cram 600 CD's into this player (30 CD]s per gig).  8)   You can switch the headphone jack between the usual variable headphone output and fixed line out for hooking up to stereos.  In summary, for a first effort, this has been a pretty good entry by Sony into the hard drive arena. A few generations from now, all your concerns will likely be addressed, but for now, it's the best of the lot out there.

<Title>Sigh...
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I really hate to say this...but anyone having trouble with the SonicStage software either has a faulty computer or is a complete idiot. I have a Vaio notebook and used the SonicStage software long before I even got this player. I actually decided on buying this player after I ripped most of my CD library into the Atrac3Plus format and learned this was the only hard drive player that plays this format. Fortunate enough this is by the far the best hard drive player on the market. I admit the ipod has a cool scrolling system but the NW-HD1 outperforms the ipod in every other department. The NW-HD1: holds more songs when ripped to the Atrac3Plus format, is smaller, and looks sleeker. Do your research but I'm glad I finally got my hands on one of these.

<Title>A Bit Pricey, But Worth Every Cent!!
<Date>Sun Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I read most of the reviews of the NW-HD1 on this site and on cnet.com before I shopped.  I found the reviews here balanced and found cnet's overwhelming negative (about 70% of folks there disliked the product).  This was my first walkman purchase since the early 90s, and was alarmed by the poor reception of the product on cnet.com. I was doubly concerned since I am not conversant in the technical speak and the reviewers there, I assumed, knew what they were talking about.  So, I gave serious thought to buying the iPod.   I am glad I did not bow to the pressure.  The balanced reviews on this site and my own positive experiences with the Sony brand convinced me to purchase the NW-HD1.  I LOVE it.  Every aspect of this devise oozes ease of use.   I have been copying CDs onto the device for the past 10 hours and I have had no problems.  Admittedly, I have not downloaded songs yet from the Sony site, but based on my experience so far, I would venture to say it will likely be just as easy.  The device is absolutely beautiful, elegant, and classy. And it imparts the feel of luxury and being well made.  This product is what the Mercedes Benzs of old were to the luxury car market: built to last without all the gimmicky gadgets.  My problems with this player are minor: the carrying case that comes standard is impractical, as is the earplugs.   Of course the price is steep, but in this case, it is money well spent.  I have no regrets and would always choose this product over the competitors.  A beautiful and solid product!

<Title>iPod meets its match
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My dad had bought my siblings the 20 gb iPod for Christmas, and my boyfriend bought me this Sony player, so I've had the chance to compare the two first hand.  At first I had some trouble with the software and transferring the songs, but once I had the unit on a more solid surface, the problem was greatly reduced. I still have problems with the software from time to time, but I've learned what to do to overcome them.  I also did not like the default format for the songs that were being transferred, but after increasing the bitrate, I have no more complaints. The songs take up more space and take more time to convert, but it's not a sacrifice I mind making for better audio quality. I still have plenty of room for all of my favorite music, and, being a college student, I have a whole lot of music. I currently have 235 songs and have used only around 2 gigs of space on the player.  It is nice that the iPod accepts mp3 format. I, personally, like the sound quality of the ATRAC3 format that Sony uses just as much.  The two things that I am most impressed with for this unit are the size and the battery life. The unit feels much smaller than the iPod does to me, and the battery life lasts at least twice as long with around the same time of charging. The unit is visually appealing, as well. I also like that it comes with a dock station for charging and connecting to a computer, which the 20 gig iPods do not.  The controls of the unit are not too small to control, as some people think, but I'll admit that I have small fingers. Controlling the unit became like second nature after just a few minutes of playing with it.  Just like that of the iPod, the backlight makes the screen very easy to read. I, personally, do not like either the headphones that come with the iPod or the Walkman. I recommend buying better quality headphones no matter which unit you decide to purchase.  Overall I am very satisfied with the product.

<Content>I just want to say that i have loved this mp3 player from the day i got it and i have had no problems using it.  My friends have ipods so i have had some time to compare the two and i have found that the NW-HD1 is much better.  One of my friends has 1,200 songs on his ipod and it takes up 6GB, i have 2,500 on my NW-HD1 and it takes up 4GB.  My friends get 8 hours playtime with their ipods and i get 25 hours playtime.  This thing is like the size of an ipod mini and the sound quality is good.  I am very happy with my choice to purchase the NW-HD1.

<Title>Pure Magic
<Date>Sat Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had thought about writing out a really long and drawn out review of this product, but so many other reviews (positive ones) have hit the mark on this device whats left to be said. After reading a few (and limited) negative reviews I was a bit nervous but i'm glad to say they were wrong, this product, well, Its pure magic. So I'm only going to touch on my Major Pro/Con  Pros: Don't Blink! Man, talk about loading the music on this device! Yes the conversion from mp3 or even ripping a cd takes a bit longer but when you actually transfer it to the device itself its like pure lightning! WOW!  Con: I don't really have any cons to be honest, the only thing I would ask of sony is that next time the upgrade this model is to add a megga bass function (I like alot of bass in my music).  You can't go wrong with the product, the software is NOT that bad and the new downloadable 2.3 version of this software is quite good.   IPOD is for the kids, the NW-HD1 if for the adult.  IPOD is like driving a Ford Focus, the NW-HD1 is pure Lexus!  Great job Sony.   A final note: I urge anyone struggling between IPOD and this product to buy this product first, try it out for the 14 day return period. You won't be dissapointed and you won't return it!

<Title>Get it now for about $200...
<Date>Thu May 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...or get it later for $400.  The forthcoming model, NW-HD4 is already being declared the iPod killer.  Same features as this except NW-HD4 (and the colorful NW-HD3) can play mp3.  This one can be modified to play mp3 (you'll need to send it to TX to get firmware installed).  But I'm more than happy with SonicStage software.  I've got about 400 CDs on mine and it's half-full.  The sound quality is excellent, long battery life, lightning-fast downloads, sturdy construction and easy to use.  Anyone who thinks it's difficult to operate or use the software probably struggles with any technology.  It's about the size of a deck of cards.  Match it up with JBL On Tour speakers and you've got the ultimate system for the travelling music enthusiast.  It was originally $350.  Get it before it's gone!

<Title>Awesome compact mp3 player
<Date>Tue May 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this mp3 player for about a year. It is very very small, about the size of my palm. The best part is the battery life. It exceeds the 30 hour limit listed in the specs. I did not like it at first when I had to convert my mp3 to ATRAC format. Then I sent it to the Texas service center for a firmware upgrade and now I can upload mp3 directly. They also sent me a new Software which is much better than the one that came with the player. I am really satisfied with the product at this time.

<Title>Good lookin', but fails to shine in more ways that one...
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Upon reading the blurb on the box you think you're getting a really good deal, right? How horribly wrong I was! For starters, the actual quality of the sound that the player gives out is atrocious mainly due to the lack of volume. Full blast volume gives you the same amount of sound coming out of a talking birthday card. This is an incredible let down, especially when you're using speakers with the player.Whilst searching for a this player on E-bay, you're more than likely to come across little scams for about  or  for them to send you instructions on how to open the hidden volume control on your player.     The installation disc supplied contains the actual instruction manual (which I did not discover until a month of installing the player) and a program called Sonic Stage which is the method of transferring files to your player. When you open this program, you think it's all incredibly straight forward: select music to be transferred, press transfer and you're done! This is the case if you're happy listening to the headache fuelling 48kbps which is the default quality for transferring data. You may also think that this can be overcome with the simple click of a mouse by changing the quality to a more regular 130kbps, but it still transfers as 48kbps! I had a headache before even listening to anything!  The actual process you have to partake in to change the sound quality is incredibly long winded and tedious as you have to select individual files, convert them into the sound quality you'd like (roughly 30 seconds per song seems reasonable enough, but then you have to do that for every song you want transferred) and then you're able to transfer them onto your player. Despite the USB cradle developed for high-speed transfers, it doesn't seem any faster. The Sonic Stage program also freezes when you transfer more than 5 albums at a time and crashes your computer on a regular basis. The player is also used as an external storage unit which means you can just copy and paste files into the unit that's shown within 'My Computer' and they can be removed from there.  The players aesthetics may be one of the very few ups of this player. The players petit physique allows you to fit it snugly into your pocket and not notice that it's actually there, although it's surface area is too big to wear around your neck. The design of the players jukebox is very confusing and frustrating too as every song is arranged by 'composer' not by artist. Whilst I'm complaining about the design of this, I found myself stopping to admire the lovely backlight display which is a very minty green colour. The player [as most do] has the hold function, although if you pause the player for 30 seconds, it turns itself off therefore wasting battery life turning it back on again. Now, other than the incredibly unreasonable volume and the hassle to transfer music onto your player.  One of the reasons the world has turned to MP3 players, is for easy sharing or file transferring between work/friends/school, but once again, this player fails to deliver by only allowing the files placed within the external storage folder to be shared and even when you do wish to share them, you have to carry your USB cradle and USB lead (connects the cradle to the computer) which defeats the entire object of easy file sharing and also makes it incredibly obvious that you have a very expensive piece of hardware on you and are begging to be mugged.  When you're paying such an amount for a rather poor piece of equipment, you'd expect Sony to provide you with insurance against theft or external damage and you're just lumbered with the usual Sony warranty which covers a faulty product or damage within the products operating/storage system and leaves you having to pay 0 more to get the player insured against theft through an unreliable company as Sony Centres don't allow you to insure a product unless it was purchased at that particular time within that store.  Overall this product is a poor investment and a complete and utter con! I'm nothing but disappointed with it. Although I may be the coolest cat in town with it, I'll always feel cheated and unhappy with the player.   Ups - The best aesthetics within an MP3 player yet. Downs - Pretty much everything else is a let down.  Want more? www.thetechaven.com

<Title>Do not buy this MP3 player
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I never write reviews, but I felt that it was necessary for a potential consumer considering forking out almost $400 bucks to be aware that this is not the product to do it on.  Here's why:  Terrible software: Read the review prior to mine. When you first get a hefty mp3 player like this you cannot help being a little happy. At first you live with the small problems but eventually they are just too annoying.   Playlists: If you want to make a playlist be prepared to copy the same song twice to the player. Now since you have so much space mB aren't really the problem. The problem is when you go to play an album or songs from a particular artist. Both songs are entries and thus you get duplicate tracks.  Firmware: The standard model shipped cannot play mp3 formats. Eventually you get an e-mail from Sony telling you you can send your mp3 in for a software upgrade allowing it to play this format for only $20 plus postage and handling. WHAT! Are they out of their minds? Why can't I just download it.  SonicStage: Oh this is the second most irritating aspect of the player. Now this might be a particular bug related to the usage of the integrated browser which I am guessing uses the Firefox rendering engine. It results in Sonic Stage not working. Some of the links are disabled and I cannot purchase tracks or redeem my coupon code. You get 30 free songs from Sony with a mail-in coupon... it takes about 6-8 weeks before it arrives. It could have taken about 100 years cause I still can't get my free tracks. I am not computer illiterate either.... running a dual boot system XP/Fedora Core... using XP only for the musts like Photoshop CS and SonicStage.  Display: If you plan on using your player on a sunny day be prepared to spend fifteeen to thirty seconds to find out what the heck is on the screen. If you are like me and carry yours in a plastic zip lock baggy forget about it cause your chances are slim to none and slim just got on the bus.  Worst of all: When I first purchased it in December it crashed about a week later. I took it in and got it exchanged. Four months later it wouldn't charge. I recently brought it in for repairs (I bought mine at Sears and the Sony Service Center works via them). There is a one-year parts warranty but only three months on service. I was all bummed that I had to pay for this but hey what can you do. I told the clerk what had happened and he said you know what I'll just swap it with a new one. He couldn't cause Sears discontinued carrying it... I wonder why.  Well lucky for me he swapped it for a player of the same caliber. It was the iPod+hp... and I am telling you this mp3 player blew the Sony right out of the water. Wow... it had a color display, incredibly easy user interface, real playlists, slideshow, easy hookup to tv and tuner, and more.  I wasn't going to buy the iPod either but it was all they carried in order to satisfy me as a customer. Boy did I let my prejudices push me into making the wrong decision... DO not buy Sony NW-HD1 player cause you'll really end up pulling your hair out.   I guess I am writing this cause I'd imagine there are people out there who like myself who just don't have $400 bucks to throw around for fun. It's hard earned money... and when something doesn't function properly you feel cheated and aren't sure what to do about it cause forking out another $4000 is not really an option you'd want to pursue.  I hope this helps you make find the player that works for you.

<Title>A Decent Hard Drive Music Player from Sony 
<Date>Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a big fan of Sony electtronics so naturally I wanted to purchase a Sony mp3 player. The NW-HD1 is a good music player but its not excellent. I'll just go ahead and list its good and its bad features.  good: -By far the smallest 20 GB digital music player (credit card sized) when it was released. This makes it very convenient as it easily slides into your pocket.  -Typical Sony excellent fit and finish with brushed metal exterior and handsome styling.  - Great sound quality with proper headphones. ie.Not the ones in the package.     -Easy to use controls.  -Good battery life  -You can use Windows to copy any type of file to the player, using it as a mobile storage device (the device won't recognize or trouble the files)      Bad: -NO NATIVE MP3 PLAYBACK CAPABILITY   -No playlist feature, only a 100 track bookmark list. This was really annoying.  -Although I found the Sonic Stage software easy to use (3.1, the included version is 2.0), it was really frustrating converting and copying my entire music library of just under 1,000 tracks to the player (took approximately 4 hours).    -Because the device only supports ATRAC3 playback, you cannot use Windows MP to sync files to it.  -EXPENSIVE when brand new (typical for a Sony)  Bottom Line:  If you don't mind converting your music libary or any of the other downsides, and if you can get it at a cheap price (under $120) buy it. Otherwise get the NW-HD3 or NW-HD5 which both support mp3 files.

<Title>Great-looking player, but with MAJOR flaws
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, this is probably the greatest-looking 20 GB player out there.  However, it is made useless by the garbage software.  I used to have a Dell 15 GB player, but I sold it and got this one because it was so large and bulky.  If I had known what a living hell it would be to put music on this one, I probably would have either kept the Dell or gotten an iPod.  One feature I liked about the Dell (and I'm pretty sure iPods have this too) is that you could add tracks to the "selected music" and have a temporary playlist for however long you want to keep it.  You could add or remove tracks whenever you wanted, even during playback.  This way you wouldn't have to browse for another track to listen to after one ended.  The Sony does not have this feature.  The only way to make a playlist is to make it in the SonicStage software and transfer it to the player.  But, when you do that, any song you add to a playlist will be removed from its album in the libary in SonicStage, and THEN DUPLICATED in the library on the player.  So, if you plan on making custom playlists, you will find both the SonicStage and player libraries will be completely screwed up with missing and duplicated tracks.  But it doesn't end there!  The Connect music downloading service is the only place you can download tracks in their proprietary ATRAC format.  However, EVERY SINGLE TIME I downloaded music from there, the download failed, and then every time I opened SonicStage, it would try to finish downloading, but fail again.  By the time it actually worked, I would have 5 of each track I downloaded, each one either incomplete or full of static.  Speaking of ATRAC, that is the only format this player supports.  So your options are:  A) Completely duplicate your MP3 library to ATRAC on your computer, taking up lots of hard drive space, but making it possible to transfer tracks to the player quickly.  B) Convert MP3 files to ATRAC on the fly when transferring to the player, making a simple transfer take hours.  It is possible to get this player upgraded to support MP3, but you still have to use the SonicStage software, and it doesn't fix the lack of functional playlist support.  I owned this player for almost a year, putting up with horrible software and no playlists, but I have had enough.  I'm selling this thing on eBay and getting an iPod or maybe iPod nano (those things are awesome!).  Sony has the potential to dominate the MP3 player market, but if they don't stop using proprietary formats and software, it's never going to happen.  In the meantime, I'll be happy with my new iPod. :)

<Content>I use these user reviews for so much stuff, that its about time I wrote one as well. The Sony NW-HD1 is just okay. Sonic Stage is just acceptable. It allows me to transfer files, but there is no song number count and make sure you don't try to get fancy with it.  Updating to a recent version required me to initialize the unit which erased everything on the player. Had to re-transfer from SS. My biggest frustration is running with it. It tends to freeze up on me after about 30 minutes. Some days it will last as long as me (2 hrs) but more often it stops playing. I have to reset the battery (switch on bottom) which is a real pain in the middle of a run. I guess a flash player would be better for jogging but this was advertised as "no-skip" technology.  Oh, and the shuffle function is ridiculous. Choosing to shuffle the entire drive (over two thousand songs loaded) is not intuitive and the player will repeat many songs in this mode. Only by resetting and reshuffling can I get it to change. But it will find a new set of songs to continually play during shuffle. Very frustrating. Lately it has tried to play "No Song" This actually shows up on the menu. It does nothing for a while then moves on to a real song. Perhaps there is a bad file loaded. Sound quality is great, battery life is awesome and it recharges very quickly. But the inability to work on the road or trail and the lack of good shuffle playability will probably drive me to another player soon.

<Title>This may be your ideal mp3 player in disguise
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I start, I would like to make a few things clear. I have owned (or at least used) the following players: iPod (4th, 5th gen, mini, nano), nw-hd5, archos gmini xs200, creative muvo n200, the creative zen sleek, and of course, the nw-hd1. My hd1's firmware was upgraded to play mp3s immediately after I purchased the unit, so you must consider this throughout the review.  	Hardware quality: excellent, no complaints. The unit looks and feels durable. The screen's clarity is lacking though, and is quite hard to read unless the backlight is on or if it is sunny outside. The glass on the front is huge too, which obviously makes it more prone to scratches and more noticeable. Something that strikes me as odd as well is the unbalanced distribution of weight. On the top, you can see that the shape curves up, which is what I think makes the right side a tad bit heavier than the left. Not a big deal, really, especially since the unit is held with the right hand. Just something to think about when you go out for lunch today. (90%)  	Size/weight: at 3.88 oz, STILL the lightest 20gb player out there, which is amazing considering the fact it came out like 2 years ago. This is probably this player's most appealing feature. Here are some direct weight comparisons (in ounces): Hd5 - 4.76, iPod video - 4.8, mini - 3.6, nano - 1.5, zen micro - 3.8, xs200 - 4.2 As you can see, the hd1's got everything beat hands down (in the 20 gb category). It's barely heavier than the zen micro, which holds only 6gb! The only 20+ players that can come anywhere close are sony's other players, the iPod video, and the xs200, which are already in the 4 oz range! Size is a different matter though, since the xs200, hd5 and even the video are technically smaller. Their overall volume is smaller, but in my opinion, the iPod video's face is too big, and the xs200 is too fat. To me, in this case, weight is much more important than volume per-se. There is some confusion with sony's other players that needs to be clarified (even I was confused writing my hd5 review). The hd5 is the smallest but heaviest at 4.76 oz, the hd3 is the biggest but is the middle child in weight at 4.59 oz, and the hd1 is the lightest but the middle child in size. I know it's weird, but I don't know what accounts for this odd trend in size/weight inconsistencies. (100%)  	Sound quality: excellent, better (in some cases, much better) than everything else I have heard (except the hd5 of course). I have done sound comparisons side by side with a mini and a gmini xs200, and I must say the hd1 came first, with the xs200 second and the mini, third. For some, this is the sole reason why they chose sony. (95%)  	Navigation: OK, not that great. To choose between browsing from artist/album/genre/group/others, you press the mode button on top. The menu button is used to change settings like shuffle, backlight, etc. As far as scrolling is concerned, navigation is adequate. Pushing buttons isn't as tedious as you might think. Some might even find it to be more efficient than the click wheel. This is how it works; you can tap the up/down button, or you can hold it down. This will make the player start scrolling at a mediocre speed. After holding down up or down for 6 seconds, then it starts scrolling much faster so it won't take too long to get to  "P." The downside is of course, that you have to wait 6 seconds before you start scrolling fast. (80%)  	Software: sonicstage isn't as horrible now as it was back then, but it's still not all that great. Also, if you own a mac (which I do) you're pretty much screwed unless you use VirtualPC, in which case you'd still be screwed since a slow program within a slow emulation software can only mean the epitome of slowness. However, it is usable, and you don't even necessarily have to use it. Mp3 file manager and Vaio music transfer, two drag-and-drop softwares, should both work. Those that have reviewed the software in the past haven't considered the fact that sonicstage has improved, and it's not even necessary to use. (75%)  	Battery life: excellent, another pro that has served as a determining factor for many. 30 hrs? if listening to mp3s, you won't hit that, but you'll definitely get much further than 14 hrs. (yeah, I'm talking about the iPod) The unit also charges incredibly fast considering it's supposed to hit 30 hrs every time. (95%)  	Button placement: The weird thing about the hd1 is that the design is horizontal instead of vertical. It's not really bad (unless you're left-handed), just different. It takes getting used to along with the buttons on the top, which I think are better placed on the front, like on the hd5. It's true that the buttons are a bit small, but it shouldn't be a problem at all unless you're a big or chubby person. The buttons are pleasant to press. (85%)  	Annoying quirks: Whenever a button is pressed, you can hear the disc spinning along with an annoying high-pitched sound. On one hand, it's annoying, but not a big deal. After a while though, it stops. Plus it's not like you can hear it while listening to music. When you put the unit on hold, it flashes "HOLD" on the screen when a button is pressed. It might not sound bad, but the thing is, if you're using the backlight (which you will be most of the time), it will turn on every time you press a button. This obviously wastes battery. Another thing is that (only sometimes) after the end of a song, you hear some silence, and then literally 1 second of some random song, then it moves on to the next. Don't know what's up with that. This one time, right in the middle of a song, the hd1 started playing a completely different song for a while, then went back. These things are probably uncommon and not a huge deal, but they should be considered. Such a high-priced unit should not suffer from such odd imperfections. Although very rare, the unit has frozen on me before. Last but not least, I don't think that the green backlight matches well with the rest of the player. Looks kind of awkward to me. Wish it were black like on the hd5.  	Things that might piss you off: very few cases (have only seen 1 fabric, 1 leather, and NO silicone). I ended up making my own out of a felt piece of fabric. Also, the cradle is necessary. You gotta carry it around everywhere, but it does looks a lot more neat amongst all that clutter on my desk. Those who travel probably wouldn't like it. If this is you, get the little adapter for the hd3 on ebay. Works on the hd1 as well. Lastly, there are absolutely no accessories (except for wired remotes) for this player, which is a major bummer.   	Why you should buy the hd1: Physically beautiful, appealing, durable, outstanding battery life, very small and light, great sound quality, price (see conclusion).  	Why you shouldn't: Sonicstage, a few annoying habits, you have to pay to get the firmware upgrade (although I heard if you buy a new one now, you don't). No accessories, no fancy features.  	Side note: Sony has THE WORST customer support IMAGINABLE!  	CONCLUSION: This is a great piece of hardware, but it may not be for you. In my case, the things I listed above (small/lightweight, sound quality, battery life), they are most important to me. Not to mention, for a used one, I only spent $80! Come on, $80 won't buy you anything nowadays except an iPod shuffle that holds 5 songs. It's nice to know that even if I break this thing, I can always get a new one without spending my life savings. Just because it's old does not mean it's obsolete (yet). However there are plenty of reasons why you should NOT buy this. The video iPod is absolutely beautiful. The screen is gorgeous. iTunes is a great, simple program that's dead simple to use, and quick. There are a million accessories for the iPod. You can install Linux on your iPod. Enough said. The hd5 has a longer battery life that's replaceable, and it doesn't need a cradle. The creative zen vision:m has great video battery life and doesn't have all these stupid legal restrictions. Archos players are probably the easiest to use. In short, you should only buy the hd1 if your preferences look like mine. (or you're broke! Haha) Know what you want, how much you want to spend, and know what to expect. Just to let you know though, for now, I'm satisfied with mine.

<Date>Thu Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a completely Beautiful device, it looks awesome, has long battery life, and since its made by sony... it seems like a no-brainer  If you agree with this, you are mistaken, myself i thought this was a far supirior product to the ipod until i bought one.  the program you haveto live with to get music on this thing is probably the most annoying program i have ever used, always buggy, wont encode half my music collection, and is SLOW the ATRAC 3 format you haveto use cant be opened in anything other then Sonic stage, so if you want to be able to use your computer Other than just litening to music (using a music player that takes up less system memory) you haveto keep both your old mp3s and theese useless atrac 3 files  the device itself is nice... looking, but once you start to use it  it is barely possible to navigate though your music collection if you have anywhere near its 20 gig compacity  Just dont buy it, youll save yourself ALOT of time and money

<Content>Great piece of hardware.  Fatally flawed software, at least for some of us. Before purchasing, try downloading Sony's Sonic Stage from Connect.com.  If you can't get that to work, you'll never get this player off the ground.  If you can, you have a prayer of a chance, but you'd better be patient. Many more headaches than it's worth, given the outstanding competition.

<Title>Like a  Porsche 911  w/  Tires Made of Solid Granite!
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing could be not just a iPod beater, but THE iPod beater.  Instead I'd rather have a $100 flash based player like the Rave-MP258 (actually had one).  Why?  Because the SonicStage softwear is the most crippling act of sabotague I've ever seen a manufacturer ruin their product with.  It's like if Porsche decided to ship the 911 with granite tires.  Hell of a product, but does not work worth a $#!+.  SonicStage has something called openMG.  It checks for some kind of digital copyright but wouldn't even let me transfer ripped wma files on my pc which came from my own cd's?  How goofy is that.  Forget drag and drop...I like the convenience of that, but even though "My Computer" showed transfer of mp3s to the the Sony (drive H on my pc) when I tried to play them they weren't there.  Sony continues to disappoint.  Years ago it was Beta. They did not share the format to others at first and then JVC came along with VHS and licensed it to all who wanted to use it.  Bye, bye Betamax.  SACD will likely fail.  Try to find one in a disc store...You can't.  Plus while others like Marantz build universal DVD-A /SACD players, Sony in it's inane superiority builds only SACD players. No DVD-A support.  If multi-channel audio has a chance the only way is through universal players, but Sony will help send the whole concept to the grave with it's tunnel vision.  Don't buy any Sony digital music player unless you want total frustration like I've got.  I should have purchased an iPod by the new leader in personal audio, Apple...A #@** computer company can build finer audio equipment than the world's largest consumer electronics company...Whad'ya think about that.  Sony, no baloney...but a load of something for sure!

<Title>Do not support Atrac3!
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was so close to being sold on the sleek compact design and great battery life of this hardware (I will give them 2 stars for that) until I read between the lines about the type of software Sony is shoveling.  Do not support Atrac3! Why? It is against your own best interests as a consumer.  Atrac3 (just like Betamax cassettes) is not the norm, MP3 is (like VHS was).  This is just a crappy attempt from Sony to continue to own the music they sell you even if you already own it on another media.  So even if you rip your own CDs, that you paid your hard earned money for, there is a chance that licensing won't permit you to play it on this device. Don't believe me?  Check out this article on the BBC: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4194047.stm Why would you want to waste more time transferring your Mp3 files to Atrac3 (inferior quality to Mp3) on faulty software (read other reviews) just so you could make Sony an extra buck? I am not saying to run out and get an ipod (not perfect either), but do your research before you buy a Mp3 player and make sure that it really is an Mp3 player and not some lame excuse from some billion dollar company to continue to own your music.  Hopefully in a year or two Sony will realize their shameful error and reformat this hardware.

<Product Name>Sony NW-HD1 20 GB Network Walkman Digital Music Player
<Title>Very happy with my purchase
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just picked one up. Upgraded from being a minidisc user so I am already familiar with the quirks of SonicStage. Yes, I know that in two weeks here in the US the NW-HD3 is coming out and will play MP3s natively but frankly I want ATRAC, I have done simple listening tests side by side and agree ATRAC is a richer, warmer sound than MP3.  It depends on what kind of user you are I guess. All my music comes from burnt albmus so converting to ATRAC doesn't bother me. If I were someone who had a hard-drive full of MP3s from Kazaa then admittedly this wouldn't be the best choice for me as far as file-format is concerned.  But all that said, I'm already extremely pleased with my purchase. It's true - until you get one in your hand, or your pocket you don't realise how small and light this thing is. The 30hr playback for me was a big seller as I use the unit all day listening to music at work, and have gotten use to Minidisc batteries lasting these kinds of lengths. Side by side with colleagues' iPods it just feels so much smaller and lighter.  I did a lot of research and wanted to add some information that might help people thinking of taking the plunge, because I feel this is a unit that has a had a lot of unfair bad press - a chance to right some wrongs, and agree with others on some matters:  1. Volume. The unit has been cited as having low volume. It definitely depends on the headphone match-up. With in-ear solutions like the fontopia headphones, you'll never be able to blast past 1/2 - 3/4 of the total volume before your ears explode - believe me it's plenty loud enough, but with my DJ style headphones it is noticeably quieter. This can easily be corrected with a custom EQ of your choice which noticeably increases volume the moment you play with it but some tracks can get drowned out by the NYC subway.  2. Shuffle - some reviews have stated that the unit can't shuffle. Not true. I agree it is not as immediately obvious as an ipod but once you understand how it works you'll see that you can shuffle at multiple points in the folder-tree, such as shuffling the whole HD, or shuffling just an artist, or just a genre, or just an album. Plenty of flexibility here once you understand it  3. Sonicstage - seriously it's not that bad, and growing up through the various versions with my minidisc I can tell you it's a lot better than it was. My only real frustration is that you only see items on the unit displayed in the order you put them on the HD, but you can drag and drop this order to your taste. Hopefully future versions of sonicstage will address this.  4. Gapless playback - yes it's here - and if you call yourself a music fan you should demand it. It allows you to hear albums in the manner in which they were intended without false stop-gaps of silence occuring between tracks that were designed to blend together.  So there you have it - hope you have the information you need to make an informed decsion. I din't want to become another white-earbudded iPod zombie (NYC is crawling with them). I care about build-quality, battery life, and most of all sound-quality. In the display case next to the Sony the creatives, iRivers and Apples really just looked so plasticky.  Hope you enjoy yours.

<Title>Three GREAT tips for you!
<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>1) Because of the introduction of the newer NW-HD3 model, this model (HD1) sells for only $270 in Sony Style stores. (not available online, though). Go to sonystyle.com, at the very bottom click on Store Locator and see if there's a store in your city (New York Boston San Fran etc.).  2) You can upgrade the HD1 so it can play back MP3 without conversion! Unfortunately you have to send it to Sony in Texas for the firmware upgrade. [...]. It costs $20 all-inclusive but comes back with a $25 Sony Connect coupon. (BTW, the dateline on the page is wrong; it should read "Feb. 10, 2005".)  This offer expires in August 2005.  3) Forget about the remote controls that are only available in Japan anyway. Only the three-line remote control (model number with a "40" in it) really supports the HD1 or HD3. (The other "thin" 35-something one does not have menu and mode buttons, a major inconvenience.) They are just too expensive (even on eBay) for their simple functions and they break easily. The buttons on the HD1 (and HD3) are much easier to use. Most people don't need a remote, only want one. Sony should really have included the remote with the new HD3 to make it a better deal.

<Title>I love this device!!!!
<Date>Sun Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this network player around X-mas and have loved it ever since.  I love the fact that it was only $250 and has 20g of space.  What sold me on this product was the look and the battery life (30hrs).  I'm a person that uses this player in the car and while I work so my player is on at least 8hrs a day.  Oh and I forgot to mention that I'm a music junkie and I need as much battery life as possible.  I was a little miserable when I sent my player for the fireware update to Sony but I knew it was for the better because it now plays MP3!!!  As for the SonicStage software there is some room for improvement like the music burning to Audio CD's are a little slow (takes 10 minutes to burn around 18 tracks with 48x burn speed).  They need to improve that for real.  My Musicmatch is much faster burning audio CDs.  People, it's worth it. Two hundred and fifty dollars plus a 20 dollar firware update is still cheaper than a 20g Ipod in the store.

<Title>Superb
<Date>Sun Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this a few months ago, and undoubtedly it is the best (and first) MP3 Player I have ever had. It works great, and is a great choice for taking on the go, or on trips. The recharge of the internal battery isn't too long (full-charge = 1-2 1/2 hours, maybe), and overall there aren't really any problems with it for me.  Pros: *Slick Design - Just by Eyeing it pretty much wanted me to get it *Battery Life - 30 Hours: iPod only has 15! *Compact - So small, yet so powerful *Sound Quality - Choose between 48 kpbs, 64 kpbs, or 256 kpbs. Either way, the quality will sound great coming from this baby  Cons: *Buttons - A little too small for me, I really have to use my nails *Playlist Selecting - Lets you bookmark 100 songs, that is if you're willing to go through all your songs to select them (I have over 3000 songs on my player, so I don't bother) *Price - When I first got it, I got it for $400. That's a lot, considering the memory is half of iPod (though I still choose this)  Overall, this is a great MP3 Player to buy, considering it is relevant for you to buy a player with this much memory (I constantly buy more and more CDs, so I can say it's reasonable for me to get a 20 GB). I find this more doable and overall sufficient compared to the iPod (I read and hear a lot of complaints about the product), and I feel like it is more suitable for me (practically everything electronic I buy is from Sony, which I pretty much worship as a brand), and I just really love it as an MP3 Player. If you have difficulty choosing what you want, check this out. It will most likely not disappoint.  Do not listen to complaints such as not able to transfer MP3's, and the software. Those are minor problems that can be fixed, or really just ignored. This MP3 Player is a knock-out and I find it a truly amazing piece of machinery.  And you know what I hate? People who think there is a difference between iPods and MP3 Players.

<Content>I just bought NW-HD1 for my dad and he is a 67 year old chinese man who loves to hear his chinese music.  Even though he loves the machine for it's size but he can't read what is being played because the stupid machine will not support Chinese characters.  Prior to the purchase of the NW-HD1, I have other mp3 players (IPOD and Rio) that display chinese characters and I never suspected that the NW-HD1 would not have the same function being Sony a big Asian electronic company with long history.  What a dispointment from Sony!!  From now on, I can not assume that anything from Sony is always good, they're no longer what Sony used to be.

<Title>Doesn't actually play MP3
<Date>Fri Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>In case you haven't heard, this unit will not play MP3 files.  Though Sony claims to support MP3, the truth is that you are required to convert all of your MP3 files to Sony's proprietary ATRAC3 format in order to play them.  The unit will not actually play MP3 files -- they must be converted, which will cause significant loss in audio quality.  What's more, the purported 30-hour battery life and 13,000 song storage is dependent on you choosing a low quality setting for the files you listen to.  Higher-quality encoding will lower your storage space and shorten expected battery life.  Buyer beware!

<Title>A True Marvel
<Date>Fri Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Before going into just how wonderful this player is, I wanted to address the two main criticisms from a prior review. First, you need not tell a buyer to beware when analyzing space and battery considerations. Every DAP vendor, including good ol' Apple itself, fudges on these statistics to default to the most ideal circumstances (straight playing with no menu use, no backlight, etc.) So saying that one will store fewer songs with greater encoding rates, or get less battery life under normal use is nothing new.  As for not playing MP3 files, well, that is true, you do have to convert existing files to ATRAC3/Plus. But you can also rip CDs directly to ATRAC3 Plus's 256 Kbps codec, for example, for stellar sound. And while you will lose some quality if you decide to transcode from existing MP3 files, going from one lossy format to another, I can pretty much guarantee you that again, under normal daily use on the go, in traffic, in a bus or train, etc., as long as you trancode using Atrac3 132 Kbps or greater, you will find very little to complain about soundwise. Besides, unlike the iPod, there is a 6 band EQ system which actually works and it works great.  As for the player itself, this smallest 20GB DAP to date (pictures just don't do it justice) is solidly built, remarkably light, with a sharp, though admittedly somewhat small display, and an interface that is a breeze to decipher and navigate with one hand. You won't need more than 10 minutes to use the player like a pro without reading a manual. And the sliding menu paradigm, similar to that on the iPod, is very smooth as is the whisper-quiet hard drive. What's more, you can wrap around a list when navigating from the top and the bottom, something the iPod can't do.  The sonic stage software may take some getting used to and the initial conversion of tracks may slow things down a bit, but once converted, transfer of tracks to the player takes 7 - 10 seconds per album. And unlike the iPod, you can share your music with up to 3 PCs via synchronization as long as you use SonicStage on those PCs (This is not clear from the owner's manual but an addendum is packaged with the player telling you how to authorize 3 PCs for use with the player).  You do need the USB cradle to charge the unit and connect to a PC. But while you need to take it with you if you plan to connect elsewhere, this cradle is small and so ridiculously light in its own right that the inconvenience is minimal at best. And speaking of being on the go, this unit has a 25 minute buffer, nearly that of the iPod, so it can take its fair share of jostling without missing a beat.  Some other negatives that could exist for some is that there is no way to delete files from the player itself and playlist support (bookmark) is rudimentary. You can add bookmarks to tracks while playing them, up to 100 tracks in all, and then, via the the Others Mode, you can play just those bookmarked tracks as a playlist. There is no reordering the list, however, and you need to be playing each track you want to remove from the list to delete its bookmark.  Two features I would also like to mention add to ease of use and stabilty. One involves the ability to jump back to the Mode listing from the Playing screen exactly at the point where you were before you started playing, or simply to the very top of the list, depending on the length of time you hold down the Mode button.  The other feature conserves the overall battery life and thus practical use of the battery. The underside of the player contains a switch to turn off the connection to the Li-Ion battery so that during long periods of disuse, extensive discharging of the battery is avoided and the battery will last longer accordingly (The owner's manual also shows one how to remove the internal battery under the guise of disposing of the unit so battery replacement should be a breeze even if not specifically intended by Sony).  All in all, with some warts easily outweighed by all the advantages, this is one fine player and definitely something you should consider if stability, size, sound, and cutting edge good looks are important to you. Yes it is on the pricey side, but in my experience, Sony quality is worth it.

<Title>An extremely well built MP3 player
<Date>Sun Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I will keep this very simple and list the pro's and the con's of this unit so you can see what I liked about it and what I did not.  For reference, my last MP3 player was a Jukebox Zen 20gig USB 2.0 version but the hard drive died so I purchased this sony.  Let me get the bad out of the way first: -No remote included in the box (for 400, there really should be one) -Converstion of MP3s to Atrac takes a long time if you have more than 1 gig of music...but...(see the good below) -No &#34;on the go&#34; playlists.  That is my biggest gripe with the unit as far as operations and functions go.  There is a bookmark feature that lets you remember up to 100 of your favorite songs so you can make a bogus playlist of sorts, but coming from a Zen, the playlist feature is dearly missed -The case included cannot be hanged anywhere. It simply protects the player from scratches but has no belt clip/string/rope. -Cheapo headphones in the box but that's expected.   Now the good... -Visually, this unit is simply stunning.  Pictures do not do it justice.  It actually looks like a 400 dollar piece of technology. -While Atrac conversion is slow, it could not be more simple.  A transfer wizard asks you to select the songs you want to move to the player, and then converts them ON THE FLY without making a copy of the file in Atrac on your computer.  It's great because if you have a lot of music, you can simply leave the player on overnight and everything will be done when you get up. -The player sounds very good. I can say that I found the quality to be much better than my Zen, and the Zens are known for their awesome sound quality. -64 kbps Atrac compression sounds pretty much as good as a 128 kbps MP3 compression. -Menus are very simple to navigate and there are only 2 buttons on this unit not counting the standard &#62;&#62;, &#60;&#60;,play/stop buttons.  All of them are used to good effect. -The equalizer on this thing is stunning.  On my Zen, I always turned it off because I could not hear a difference.  Here, the unit actually sounds better depending on what settings you like. -Battery life is stellar.  Not exactly 30 but close. -Creating playlists using the Sony software is VERY easy.  Type in a name, drag and drop files either on the player already or in your computer.   I could probably go on like this for a while because this unit has tons of little things that make me just love it.  For all the bad rep NW-HD1 got for the Atrac format, it really delivered in terms of audio quality, ease of use, portability, and visuals.  If you like solid construction units that are reliable (it really looks reliable despite the 90 day labor, 1 year parts warranty) and have 400 dollars to spend.  I would get this over the iPod anyday.  As a sidenote, the unit IS smaller than an iPod.  It is about the size of the iPod mini.

<Date>Mon Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was first sold on Atrac when I was able to put 25 CDs on one CD, and that was in the bad old days of SonicStage 1.0.  Sony says you can put 13,000 songs on the NW-HD1 using Atrac3Plus  48 kpbs.  I've been using 48 for audio CD's and 64 for music and that suits my needs but you can go up to 256 kpbs for the best quality.  I don't like putting these electronic gizmos in any kind of case because that increases the heat and the NW-HD1 has a holder built into the unit so it can be worn with a neck-strap, a must  for me so I can walk around without having to carry it.  The iPod has no such built-in holder.   When I went to an electronics store to get a neck-strap I showed the NW-HD1 to the guy there who was very  knowledgeable about MP3 Players and Sony Network Walkmans.  He said he much preferred Atrac because of the sound quality and said Atrac was accepted as a standard in studios but MP3 wasn't.  I forgot to ask him which studios he was referring to:  music or movie.  While both  units come with 25-minute skip protection, he said the iPod's protection was inferior because  the NW-HD1 had protection built into the hard drive itself.  I only have his word for it and  haven't read about this anywhere so I'd check up on that to make sure.  The ear-buds that come  with the NW-HD1 has a long cord which make it inconvenient when using the neck-strap so I've been using the Sony MDR-G74SL headphones and they're perfect because they come with a short  cord which can be extended with another cord that comes with the unit, something Sony should consider with the NW-HD1 ear-buds.  A colleague of mine at work bought one of the new click-wheel 20 GB iPods at the same time I  bought my NW-HD1 and we compared notes.  The iPod stops when you pull the headphone plug out,  the Sony doesn't.  You can run your finger around the iPod's click-wheel in a circular clockwise/anticlockwise direction to increase/decrease volume or to very quickly move up or  down a list.  You can't do that with the NW-HD1.  However, my colleague and I were astonished  with the size and weight of the NW-HD1 which is about half the size and weight of the 20-GB  iPod.  If you accidentally walked around with your iPod in a neck-strap in an office setting it would be very noticeable, the NW-HD1 is a lot more discreet.  Not that you would ever listen to  music while working.  My colleague's wife, who also has an iPod, wanted to know if a copy of the music was kept on the computer so you could play back the music on a computer hooked up to a sound system.   SonicStage does this, I don't know if the iPod software does.  A woman in her sixties asked me what it was so I guess you could say chicks dig it.

<Title>It really is great
<Date>Mon Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been using a Creative Nomad Jukebox3 for a while now (prio to that the first 6GB Jukebox), it recently lost its Firewire capabilities and somehow, I can't shuffle all my albums anymore...it also 'clicks and whirrrrrs'...and it is H-U-G-E, not to mention Creatives Customer Support policies...anyway it was a toss up, the NW-HD1, Rio Karma or the iPod.    The Karma is very nice, good (if not a bit awkward) form-factor, tons of features (great format support) and good battery life, awesome price.  I was very close to purchasing this, but the build quality was terrible.  It felt super cheap, like one drop and *boom* dead player.  The iPod, yeah, yeah, millions of people can't be wrong right?  Well, millions of people drive Hondas and there are better cars out there.  To ME, the iPod has so-so sound quality, and medicore battery life.  Good Form-Factor, but I don't like the 'look' of all white (for the new 40GB).  Many of my friends have them and again, the sound quality is pretty weak (even compared to Creatives and @128+).  Nice size, looks slick, good interface (I do like the click wheel).  So, the SONY NW-HD1, man this this is SMALL and LIGHT the picture of people holding it their hands doesn't get the size across.  It's very, VERY slick looking, great form-factor design.    There are many people who are concered about it not 'really' playing MP3s (as it converts them to ATRAC), but really, so what?  I would rather have one format that allows me to have the same amount of songs, at a smaller file size and same sound quality on a 20GB player, then a 40GB player with bigger files (for same sound quality) and less battery life (going on 22hrs right now as I left in over night to check it).  Transfer uses 'High Speed' USB, whatever that is (I have USB 2.0), it's seems plenty fast.  Sound Quality is great, better than iPod IMO (same song recorded at same output, same headphones, etc, etc.).  User Interface (UI) is easy to usse, maybe because I am used to Creative's hack of a UI, but I had no problems.  Installation of the Sonic Stage/Connect software was fast, PC found the player (unlike some PCs having issues with iPods), I ripped a song, converted it, transferred it, thumbed through the UI and listened.  As for Customer support and Firmware upgrades/fixes, we'll have to wait and see.  SONY supported the Minidisc for a long time so there is hope =)  It's slick, eye catching, small, light, can fit as many songs at the same sound quality as a 40GB iPod, easy to use and it has great sound quality.   On the surface it might seem like 'lesser' of a player in the shadow of the iPod.  The only 'con' (though I don't think it is) for some people might be having to convert their already existing MP3s to ALTRAC and transfer them over.  It might take longer, but MP3 players are not about transfer rates (IMO).  I want an easy to use UI, great sound quality and good form-factor, the SONY has it in spades.

<Title>Pros: Compact, Durable, Nice Design --- Cons: Software
<Date>Mon Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I don't think I am going to add much to the reviews written previously. However, having owned an iPod and this unit, I lean towars the Sony device. I admit however, that I am a bit biased.  I previously owned a Sony Network Walkman MS-11. This was Sony's older memory stick media player. That unit was extremely small but was limited by the memory stick capacity. Add to the fact that memory sticks are not cheap and the unit was expensive. While I enjoyed my MS-11, the software was atrocious.  Unfortunately, Sony didn't learn.  I am a Sony-phile. I own tons of their stuff and was really excited about this new product. However, I was a bit cautious as they only supported ATRAC. For those of you, including myself, who buy most of their music in CD format and then simply want to transfer your music to a portable device, this unit is fine. It is is similiar to the iPod in that the songs are transferred in a proprietary format. Apple uses AAC and Sony uses ATRAC. The problem arises with those files that are not in ATRAC format. While the iPod will accept MP3, the NW-HD1 will not. It must be converted to ATRAC.  That wouldn't be so much a pain if it wasn't for the pathetic software that comes with the unit. The Sony programmers spend WAY to much time on the visual look of the software and not enough time in getting it to work properly or quickly. As a result, even on one of the highest-end computers available on the market, it is slow and clunky. Transferring files from MP3 via the software to ATRAC on the device takes forever.  If you have a bazillion MP3's on your hard drive, stick with the iPod. If you want to digitally store your music on a portable player (and don't really care about storing them on your hard drive) I would recommend the Sony.  The unit is extremely small. About half the size of the iPod. Battery life is (comparitively) amazing. One of my biggest pet peeves with the iPod was the crappy battery. With about 25 hours of battery time, I don't need to worry with the Sony. The unit looks much better then the iPod. While the latter comes in what I like to call "puke white," the Sony is brush aluminum with a black plastic casing around the green and black screen. The headphones are crappy but that's expected.  All in all, I think the unit can command a $100 premium over the iPod simply for the size factor. If Sony were to come out with a firmware update and a software update that would allow a simple drag and drop transfer of MP3 files, I think they would not only sell alot more, but bring stiff competition to Apple.

<Title>Great unit with horrible software
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The unit is a joy to use. It is very slick, and seems to be be well built. Sound qulaity is better with higher compression rates (these days I don't understand people who use 64 bit compression on anything other than speach)abd it is excellent at 250k. The battery life is much better than the competition.  However, don't expect 30 hours if you are going to play 250 bit files. In my epxperience at this rate it lasts much less - more like 10-12 hours - which is still plenty for me.  Now the bad part: - the sofware which comes with the unit. Sonic Stage has to be nominated for the worst software ever released to a mass consumer. Ever. It is marvelously flawed. It is painfully slow, contr-intuitive, crushes several times within each 30 min of use, etc, etc, etc. I hope Sony will wake up and do something radical - like ditch the entire thing, fire the mediocrities on the development team and re-do the entire thing from scratch.

<Title>Why do they keep making bulky crappy software?
<Date>Thu Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>So i was stoked when i saw it the package. Its tiny compared to my archos jukebox. 20 gigs, 30 hours playback time AND supposedly MP3,WMA, and WAV compatible. I even asked the store guy because i had never seen the proprietary atrac format. He said yeah it'll play all the formats but the atrac would let me compress more if i wanted. I decided to buy it only to find out that you do have to convert to this format and u have to use the f$@$@ing sonicstage software...I'm used to the archos format ctrl A(select all), ctrl C(copy) and ctrl v(paste). DONE.It literally took six minutes to move 900 songs back and forth (very useful if you ever have to format your harddrive) Now i have to import all the music to some crappy my library folder then since every album needs a name you have to name every thing to proceed. For instance i have 4 Tool albums. They have all been meticulously groomed, named and categorized by me before i got the sony.on the archos i click on tool, then i get 4 subfolders of the albums, then all the songs on each album are in they're corresponding folder. Now i start to import to the sonicstage follow along. So since this is the first time ive imported this album to sonic it is catagorized by new and existing. so instead of being able to just click on the undertow album folder i have to actually go inside the folder select all the tracks and then retype in the name undertow for sonicstage. and forget about using the existing option if you have a large music collection because u have to scroll down and find it. Very frustrating and a complete turnoff for what would be the greatest mp3 player yet. Sorry ipod but your mini only has 4 gigs and i would already have it filled.....

<Date>Mon Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been waiting for a long time to get an MP3 player to house my almost 600 cd collection. I was concerned about price and durability, so I decided to finally take the plunge and but the Sony Network Walkman. I now have a little over 6,700 songs on the player.  The process that it took to get to that point wasn't as smooth as I hoped it to be - the software gave me problems and at one point, didn't even work!!! Needless to say I was frustrated, but I did call the Sony customer service and found them to be very helpful in helping deal with the problem. They were able to help me solve it in a timely manner, and for that I am grateful.   The only problems other than the sluggishness of the software is the accessories or lack threof. I know that it is a relatively new product, but I expected more from Sony, a recognized name in the industry,

<Content>I just got this device and I couldn't be happier. Photos don't really convey how small the NW-HD1 is. I urge anyone remotely interested in it to take a look at it 1st hand it truly is a beautiful piece of miniaturization. Using ATRAC3 is not a problem and is blown out of all proportion. Sound quality is good, especially if you encode in the highest bit-rate. Don't take my word for it go and have a look for yourself, you'll probably want one there and then!
