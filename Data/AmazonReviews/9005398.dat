<Title>MTP takes a good device and ruins it
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use Ubuntu Linux, and had I known that Samsung's media player used Microsoft's MTP format, I would never have bought this device. Locked DRM ghettos destroy the value a customer seeks in a product. The proprietary player which ships with the device requires Windows to run, and is vastly inferior to my existing media solution (Amarok).  I can access the device with Ubuntu (the latest version, Gutsy Gibbon), but Samsung worked hard to spoil my experience. They feel they are 'protecting their rights,' but really, they're just shilling for Microsoft and spoiling my experience.

<Title>Wake up Samsung
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1) No UMS (ie. does not appear as drive leter) - a pain as I can't double click a file on the player which I can see in Windows Explorer and hear it - I must copy it to PC 1st. BTW M. Okamoto, it deserves the bad rap it's getting about no UMS - I hope Samsung wake up & fix it in a new firmware release. 2) Only found out about not having to install unwanted Samsung Media Studio from Amazon (which I'm grateful for) after installing it. 3) Won't record from FM radio. 4) Still beeps with Hold on if accidentally push buttons - not logical (no I don't want to turn off Beep completely)  MH

<Title>BEST MP3 PLAYER MONEY CAN BUY
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am shocked to read some of these reviews.  This MP3 player has amazing features!  We researched for a MP3 player with a fm tuner for a christmas gift for my dad and this is by far the best one out there.   We liked it so much that we all bought one as well.    Much better than the iPod.  It comes with it's own easy-to-use software which I am very impressed with as well.

<Title>It will NOT work like a usb drive.
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Note: This YP - U3 will NOT work as a USB Drive. it used to work, then Samsung & Microsoft Teamed up to update the firmwire in this device, it can NOT be used as a usb drive now. and it ONLY work on windows XP (not even 2000), no linux, no mac.   And you will need Admin privilege to install the driver. (so if you want to transfer file between computer, this thing won't work).   I am IT engineer so I did a lot research on this and managed to update the firm ware. But it is such a hassle. I won't buy this thing if I know in advance it won't work as a usb drive.   I repeat, It will NOT work as a usual usb drive. you will have to install drivers on the computer. The description in Amazon in not accurate.   if you have a firm ware early than 1.07, it might work. most of them are 1.11 now.   Hope this will save you some money and time.

<Title>no drive letter, sensitive controls, annoying interface
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Having being a happy owner of two Samsung yp-u2 players (one lost, one smashed) i was confident that the yp-u3 would have the features I, as a podcast listener, needed.  Pause and resume, easy navigation, time remaining, simple loading of files and long battery life.  I was very disappointed.  It does not work as a usb drive, you need media player to transfer files, very very irritating!  I've written my own program to manage and load my podcasts and now it can't work without a usb drive!  The touch controls are maddening!  You must have the thing in front of your face to use it with confidence, but, be careful how you hold it or it will rush off and do things you dont want.  I can't keep it in my pocket and use finger touch to find the buttons.  Only by the constant application of the key lock is the thing reliable.  The new interface is fancy but a downgrade from the yp-u2.  You can't change the time remaining/used display or the search speed.  Also, there is now no way to prevent the sleep feature!  BAD BAD Samsung.  Sound is ok, battery life is good, usb charger is ok but feels flimsy, and the screen is easy and bright to read.  But, another problem, the screen turns off after a few minutes, and then you can't read it at all.  You must carefully stroke it to get the screen to come back on.  OLED is not an advance.  I'm taking it back and will try to find the older and BETTER player.

<Title>minimalist and a good value
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My experience with this has been mostly positive. For everything that really matters to me (i.e. sound quality, navigating) it has surpassed my expectations for a sub-hundred-dollar MP3 player in a streamlined and intuitive package. I also like the "no-cord" approach, so that the USB port doubles to transfer files and charge the battery. The FM radio and voice recorder features are nice.  I was a bit worried about the wiggly USB port that projects out, switchblade style, but I've seen several videos where over 20 pounds were hung from it before it broke. Time will tell but it seems sturdy enough for now. It comes with a cd but I haven't even taken it out of the package -- WMP and even drag-and-drop worked immediately for me (with XP).  However, the "skin-and-bones" approach does seem to leave some gaps: there is a nice FM tuner and a nice voice recorder but no FM recording feature; some of the user settings (like skip interval) do not persist after the device is restarted; it cannot be used as a USB drive. Also, the touch-activated buttons can be difficult to operate since you can't identify them by touch and they are fairly close together (this doesn't bother me much, but I have a feeling my dad's big fingers would find it awkward).  All in all, I am finding it to be a very nice, good value, stripped-down MP3 player. However, I strongly recommend playing with it a bit before you buy it, to see if you like it.
