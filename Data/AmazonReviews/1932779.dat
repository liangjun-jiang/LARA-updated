<Title>Great Introductory MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to get my daughters an MP3 player for christmas but I didn't wanted to spend a lot of money.  The Toshiba Gigabeat U  is great.  It has a 1" color screen w/ date & time display, an FM tuner, line in recording and can hold up to 1000 songs.  It works seemlessly with Windows Media Player to transfer music to the player.  The controls are easy to use and the sound is great.  My daughters are 11 and 10 years old and they love it.  If you want a nice quality MP3 player, but you don't want to drop a lot of cash, The Toshiba Gigabeat U is the way to go.

<Title>Love my Toshiba Gigabeat
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I literally agonized for a year over which type of mp3 player to purchase. I initially looked at getting an IPOD because there so many products that are made for it, but the draw back is that there is no FM turner on an IPOD.  So I started looking into possible alternatives and came upon Toshiba who has gotten very good ratings from electonic websites. I am so glad I got the Gigabeat because I love it.  It's easy to use and I have the best of both worlds, the FM turner and the songs I download.

<Title>MP 3 Player
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Toshiba Gigabeat as a Christmas present for my wife. I bought a lot of my wife's favorite songs to load it with. She loves it. Plays it every day mostly on FM one of the reasons I selected the Gigabeat. My birthday is coming up, perhaps she will get me one. I would love that.

<Title>awesome deal!

<Content>This was my first MP3 player, so far I am very pleased with it.  They said it would be shipped in 5-7 days, and it came in 3.  Its very easy to use and the display is easy to see and read.  The radio feature is really nice and the sound is clear.  If you want to nice MP3 player to just listen to music, without all the gadgets and gizmos, this is an awesome deal.
