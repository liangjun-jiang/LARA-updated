<Title>The best wireless music player available
<Date>Sun Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I think this is the best wireless music player available in the market today.  Pros: Seamless wireless / wired connection/ advanced streaming engine - no skipped beats/ alarm clock feature/ internal hard drive bay/ multiple output connections options/ USB flash drive support and USB external hard drive support/ network attached storage support  Cons: The display is bright but not big enough, does not support WPA network security protocol

<Title>Bad wireless, Bad screen, Bad remote, Bad keys, Bad deal.
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really tried to like this one. On paper it satisfies all of my needs, internal HD that you supply, wireless streaming, USB host and controller interfaces, decent looking tabletop box. Wow, perfect, right?  Wrong.  In reality after two units I have given up. Neither would connect and acquire IP addresses to any of 3 different wireless routers. Wired it works fine, but the whole point was not to run another cat5 through my house to the stereo. What is the deal D-Link? Still using those garbage chipsets in the budget equipment that soiled your reputation over the last 5 years? Get with the program and spring another $5 and give us a real receiver!  Oh, by the way, the buttons are slower than death and the menu system is occasionally unresponsive. This is both old and new firmware revisions. No playlists supported for the internal drive so you are stuck navigating a huge directory structure, and slowly. Oh, and the screen is five lines high so 500 artist directories makes it futile. I could probably write the firmware in VBasic while blind and get it to work better.  All in all a total ripoff considering the failures.

<Title>Major Firmware update bug (Do not buy)
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(See other reviews on the internet for this product also, all complaining of the same problem).  Plug it in, unit will ask if you want to upgrade firmware (default is yes). Press Yes, and the unit will stop working permanently.  DO NOT BUY until manufacturer fixes this Major Bug. I selected this unit over the Roku, because I liked the ability to add a hard disk. The features in this unit are excellent, BUT it will automatically try to upgrade its firmware over the network, and this WILL RENDER THIS UNIT USELESS. You will not be able to reset or do anything with this unit except send it back. I tried 2 units, and had the same issue with both. Spoke with "product specialists" at DLink. They should simply take these units off the market instead of wasting the consumer's time and effort.  Search for 'dsm-120 firmware' on Google for other similar reviews of this unit.

<Title>Absolutely Horrible
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, you'll never get this thing to work wirelessly, reliably.  Even sitting in the same room as your wireless router.  If it manages a connection, it will have more drop-outs than actual music.  If you hook it up with a network cable, it will work better.  But there's still a massive problem.  The navigation system is absolutely, incredibly, unbelieveably horrible.  If you have more than 20 CDs worth of music on your computer, you'll never be able to navigate through it because the system is sooooo sloooooow.  And ignorant.  Let's say you choose to look by artist.  It'll give you four at a time.  You then click the page down button and it'll slowly give you four more.  Let's assume you have 200 artists.  Well, that's a lot of clicking to get to the Rolling Stones or the Who!  And if, just if, you actually get there then you get to the next problem.  You won't be given a list of their albums.  Just a giant list of their songs with no regards to which album they're from.  So, you might think of searching by album, instead of artist.  Okay, let's say you have 500 albums.  Do you really want to slowly click your way down that far, four at a time?  Really, it'll take you fifteen minutes or so to get to the later albums.  Then when you get there, it'll play the songs alphabetically.  No, it won't look at the file name (in case you named with a number up front).  Forget that.  It'll look at the tag to get the song name and play alphabetically.  Stupidly, it won't look at the same tags to get the proper order!  The only way around this is to have playlists.  But if you search by artist or album, you won't get that option.  Playlist searching is totally separate.  If you have 1000 albums of material then you'll have to setup 1000 playlists.  Then you'll have to page through them four at a time.  Nope, you can't pick an artist and then see their playlists.  Avoid this thing.  I don't know if I've ever been so disappointed and disgusted with a product.  There's absolutely no way that they tested it with more than 20 albums.  And I'd be highly surprised if they tested it with more than a couple of wireless routers.
