<Title>Not for meetings etc

<Content>This is a good voice recorder, if you want to record notes to yourself. However, the microphone is not nearly sensitive enough for recording meetings, presentations etc. Standing just six feet away I could hardly hear myself on the recording. Also, the display is very small and the readout is hard to read. I had to refer to the manual which had a blowup of the display to see what it was showing. On the plus side, it has good computer compatibility, no drivers/software needed, and mp3 recording.
