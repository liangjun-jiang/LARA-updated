<Title>This Item is not well constructed
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa e280 is straight up garbage.  I had to take it back on 4 seperate occasions because the the memory froze and could not be reset.  when you load all of your songs and movies, sometimes the songs don't appear on your Mp3 player.  you have to load it 3 or 4 different times to get in on your ipod. the buttons on the sansa are pretty damn small as far as the arrows. the volume button and volume button navigation is well thought out but as far as the unit as a whole, I would give a D-. Very sloppy craftsmanship and I think they need to recall this item and fix the errors or else they probable will soon loose repeat business.

<Title>Prettty good - keep trying
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Happy to see that this player (compared to e140) would resume playback where it left off after turning off.  Resets volume to 50% on power up(?) though!  I had the opposite problem than what this is probably supposed to prevent.  I usually am listening at reduced volume so that I can hear what's going on in the background, only to get blasted after turning the unit back on.  Player needs some way easy to bulld playlists internally.  Sound and battery life are very good.  The more storage capacity a player has, the more the manufacturer really needs to think about the interface and software.  But I'm pretty particuar about the order that I want to play back my tunes.  It's not easy being me :-)  Windows Media player for a front-end?  Don't think so!  I may sell this and look at the Creative one even though it' not as small.  I hate their (Creative) software, but at least it has something.

<Title>This is some headache-causing hardware!
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My beloved Zen Micro Photo's hard drive died, but thankfully, I had Big Box Retailer's extended warranty on it. Unfortunately, they no longer stock that unit, so I had to pick out another one. The Sansa looked like the best out of the bunch: Small, high-quality screen, video playback, high capacity, flash-based, and most importantly, it had a built-in voice recorder.  Almost from the outset, there were problems. I don't use any online music services, so having Rhapsody foisted upon me was an immediate annoyance. The media manager application had a propensity to randomly crash, particularly in the middle of file transfers. Not good. The design felt very badly thought out, with a mechanical scroll wheel that feels rough and gets stuck (I see why Apple dumped them!), and buttons that are tiny, hard to press, and don't feel like they're being pushed when they are.   But the real deal-killer for me was a problem I don't think many others will experience: I have a great deal of music whose filenames and ID3 tags are written in Japanese characters. The Sansa's US firmware does not support Japanese (and other Asian languages as well, I'd assume), and as a result, the player will choke whenever it's asked to play a file with even one Japanese character in it. Since about half my music library fits that description, and it would take forever to go back and manually rename all those files in English, I was extremely annoyed. Perhaps a firmware flash would fix it? I tried to get some firmware of Sandisk's Japanese site, but they don't have any direct downloads. Maybe the newest US firmware has Asian language support, I thought to myself. I found the firmware, unzipped it, and loaded it onto my player.  Dead as a doornail. Tried it again. And again. And again. At that point, I just gave up.  Some people don't seem to have any problems with this. Well, more power to you, I guess, but based on my experience, this is NOT something I would recommend. If you're in the market for an iPod alternative, Creative's units still offer the best combination of features, functionality, and design.   Now I just need to figure out what I'm gonna buy after I return this thing.

<Title>Great Alternative to Apple's Proprietary Garbage
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me start by saying that this thing is really small.  I saw the pictures and even some video reviews on youtube, but I was still pleasantly surprised at how tiny this player actually is.  My Motorola Razor cellphone dwarfs it. It's cheap, so unless you're a dedicated Apple user (i.e. have more money than brains), you're getting a great bargain. I got it mainly because of nice size and compatibility (no need for dealing with iTunes - this baby looks just like another drive to your comptuer, which means drag and drop support for files). I wasn't expecting much from video - but changed my mind, after being able to watch tv series episodes on it during my commute to work, or full movies during recent flights.  The resolution/quality of the LCD is simply amazing. FM tuner gets great reception, even in my basement - not to mention the fact that I can quickly record a new song directly off the radio, so that I can listen to it later. The only downside I can list at the moment is the button interface - the rotating wheel could be a little more depressed, to make pressing buttons around it easier, but you get used to it really fast.   Other than that - this device is definitely the way to go.  I couldn't be more happy with the purchase.

<Title>nice feature set, nice look, easy to use
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll admit that I've never owned any iPod, so I cannot directly compare this unit with a Nano.  Why buy a Nano, though, when the Sansa with equivalent flash memory has additional features and costs much less?  Sure, the Nano's interface (the click wheel) is a little easier to use, but that's not worth a 35% premium while sacrificing features such as video playback and an FM tuner.  My previous player was one of the Sansa e100 series.  This player is a definite upgrade beyond the obvious (color screen, larger capacity, video playback).  It definitely sounds much better than the e100 (and I was basically satisfied with that player's sound once I had tweaked its equilizer to my liking).  The interface is a lot nicer than the e100.  As others have written, the buttons around the scroll wheel are small but this hasn't presented a problem so far.  The menu system is so straight-forward that you don't really need to refer to the manual to use the player, though I would recommend looking at the manual at least once if you plan to put any video content on the player.  Contrary to some other reviewers' opinions, I think this player has a nice, not cheap, look.  I don't know whether it's identical in form to the lower capacity players in the same series; if not it seems much nicer in my hand than those players did when I briefly handled them at a local store.  I'm quite satisfied with this player so far, but I've only had it for about one week.  A word of caution to would-be purchasers:  I had originally ordered this from Amazon and, according to their customer service, they don't know when they will get more units in (despite the website saying "in stock").  I was given a delivery estimate of approximately two months away, so I canceled my order and went elsewhere.

<Title>Great player.  No hassle
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall this a great player with many capabilities.  The FM tuner, voice recorder, pics, and video are specs that everyone knows but it comes together nicely here. Replacable battery is always a plus.  Sound is great. If you don't like what you have you can manually adjust the equalizer settings.  There are many to choose from.  You might want to invest in some higher quality headphones though.  The factory set isn't bad at all, but you could go better.  I've heard a lot of complaining about the scroll wheel and the buttons.  The wheel is easy to use and DOES NOT JAM as some other tend to think.  Yea the Ipod click wheel is nice.. but this isn't an ipod is it..?  When pushing buttons, it seems that your pushes does not register but it does.  No issues there.  Battery Life is great.  Running through the menu, playlists, and all the other functions obvioulsy drains the battery but not significantly.  It'll last for at least 9 hours depending on usage.  Ease of use:  You can't go wrong with this player, and it is incredibly straight forward.  The installation cd gives you a user manual just in case you have any questions but you can figure it out yourself by just running through the menus.  File transfer and media converter is straight forward. To easily create playlists the cd will update your windows media player, so make sure you install it.  Media player tends to be moody at times, but once you start dragging and dropping your files, its easy.    Just something to point out.  An earlier review said that the boot time was around 5 minutes or so.  That's totally exaggerated.  I have a little under 6GB of USED space and it takes about 10 seconds max to boot.  Obviously, you should take care of your player.  Buying a case is a best bet even though it comes with a slim fabric case.  Take care of the player and it'll take care of you

<Title>co-dependent
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i must have got lucky i guess cause mine seems to be functioning properly. but i seriously think it's lame not to be able to create playlists or delete media without syncing up to a comp. i never owned an ipod but hear they are pretty much the same. it doesn't work well with windows media player. and i think it's weak for a company to sell a product without proper software included. they tell me rhapsody works better. i haven't had a chance to try it yet. i decided to make better use of my time and came on here to bash it instead. my creative labs is far better with menu options and music access.  the buttons are a little funky but my wheel works great. it does freeze up for a sec when you try and rate a song. it does take a minute to reload after syncing up. which is another reason they should make it so i can create playlists and delete songs without syncing up.  i do like the video, pics, sounds good, light-weight, nice big screen, it has potential, thier customer support seems good, but then when i asked them why you can't delete songs they said cause people used to complain about deleting songs on accident. so now that's my problem. i really appreciate them striving to suit the needs of the underprivledged. i hope microsoft gets the same idea and makes it so i can't create or save on my xbox without my computer. i'm satisfied with my purchase but taking away two stars for lack of convenience. all i want to do is put stuff on it. delete media i don't want when i hear or see it, so i can load it back up with fresh jams when i have time. it is going to take me forever to get it set up how i want it. not to mention adding new stuff yet to come. blah.

<Title>iPod Nano had better watch it's back! The Sansa competes and EXCEEDS in most if not all categories!
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't fall into the white earbud trance any longer!! Wake from your Apple induced slumber people and open your eyes to the SanDisk Sansa e200 Series!! This review pertains to the Sansa e280 8GB mP3 player and let me tell you that the iPod Nano and Apple for that matter, had better watch it's back! The feature set capabilities and price point of the Sansa e 280 should have no trouble making Nano into apple pie as long as users like me help educate consumers to the realization that yes, indeed, there is a whole market of AWESOME mP3 players that in fact cost LESS, have more features, better reliability, and a company that backs its unit even after it has been sold!   For a long while now, many consumers have a certain "fruit" in mind when it comes to the mP3 player of choice. Well, I have news for you. The Sansa e280 outstrips the Nano in almost every regard. the e280 was the first flash player to come out with an 8GB capacity. The Nano soon followed with it's own 8GB (2000 songs) however, the Sansa has and expandible Trans Flash/Micro SD card slot enabling the user to ADD Storage!! Yes I said ADD IT! Currently SanDisk makes a 2GB micro SD card for about 100$ enabling you to add 2gigs to your player(about 500 more songs). Nano doesn't offer this and yet it is still priced the same or higher in some cases as I found my Sansa for under 200$. with this capability, the life of the player should be extended because of increased volumes for SD cards that come out continuously. Unlike with an apple product where if more storage is needed, you have to buy a new player and spend another 250 bucks! You can plug the storage card into the player and all the music transfered to it automatically integrates into your albumn folders which is a fabulous benefit!  Another Nice feature that the Sansa offers is a larger display screen. At 1.8 inches, the colors are bright and crisp. I would have liked to see a higher color resolution, however, still much bigger than the Nano and quite easy to read and see.  The construction of the Sansa is excellent with a poured metal back casing that is virtually un-scratchable (unless you drop it I would imagine) but you really can't scratch it like an iPod or a Zen. It also doesn't use the same plastic as the iPod or the Creative Zen so the front is SO much more durable!!! You would really have to scrape something pretty sharp against it to show scratches on its face unlike the iPod and Zen player in which you just have to place them in a pocket to receive one.   The e280 has a tactile wheel for navigation which is similar to the iPod platform but I find it to be a bit better. The dial has tiny grooves enabling the user to have more control through the screens. Unlke the iPod, the wheel lights up an electrifying flourescent blue color enabling you to navigate in lower light conditions and it also enhances the sleek look of the player.   The Sansa is compatible with Windows Media Player(free) and Rhapsody which is a paid music subscription site just like iTunes. However because this is not an apple product, you are not confined to the Apple platform.    The Sansa offers an FM tuner which is spot on and crystal clear, a voice recorder (useful if you are the memo on the fly type), video playback and photo viewing capabilities. The Nano has video and photo but does NOT have FM radio or recording capabilities. Easy and user-desirable things to add and yet Apple still hasn't caught on.   The cost of ownership for this is already cheaper right out of the gate with the lower price point but also a GREAT feature that Apple refuses to offer as it would effect their bottom line DRASTICALLY is that the Sansa offers a USER replaceable battery for about 19 bucks. You have to send your iPod out to Apple at the cost of shipping and $50 per battery. Not to mention the battery life for the Nano is 15 hours where the Sansa e280 played for 22.5 hours before dying!  All in all I spent 177.00 and got a FAR SUPERIOR PLAYER!! SanDisk customer service is top notch as well. I owned 2 very expensive $300 a piece 20 Gig ipods. in just over a year each(right after the warranty was up) they had hard drive failure which cost 268.40 to repair. I was told it was cheaper to buy another iPod and was sent rudely on my way by Apple rather than their customer service trying to work with me to keep me as a customer. I have done research on every player out there, Hard Drive and flash. I bought a Sandisk. They are the leaders is flash memory for a reason. Not to mention their customer service was STELLAR!! Top notch and happy to have me convert.   In closing, the Sansa is most definitely worth your time and your investment. Don't spend the 250$ on the Nano for your child's christmas present. They will be receiving a far inferior product, will have to replace it or fix it and the cost is RIDICULOUS! Educate yourself and purchase a Sansa.

<Title>Nice, but No Control
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk's other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn't give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped.   It would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. "It's our way or the highway." Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.  It's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products). Well, you can, but it won't make much difference if the device won't play.

<Title>Just OK
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had this for about a week, then it crapped out and would not hook up with PC after.  Tech-help had no clue, "Just RMA" they said.   When skipping songs, there is a real pause that is aggrevating.  Scroll wheel is cheap as stated before.  Screen is real nice and video option is nice.  All in all, I returned this for an Ipod Nano 8gb.  No comparision.  Outside of video (which I have no use for) and price, (you do get what you pay for) this player can't even stand in the Nano's shadow.    Get the nano, you'll be glad after you did.

<Content>It came boxed very nicely, the MP3 player and its accessories were safe and snug, and the battery came fully charged. I pressed the 'on' button and it turned on and was ready to go. To put music on, I just hook it up to my USB port (with the cable that comes with, obviously) and drag and drop the songs onto the drive. It's as simple as that. To charge it, just keep it hooked up to your computer. I always recommend reading the instructions with more expensive products like this, though. This thing works just as well as any iPod could, and holds plenty of music. Thoroughly satisfied with this.

<Title>Very poor software
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product works only with Microsoft Media Player which is a very poor software, nothing for the real music fan. I have tested the sansa e280 in my office when it came and it worked despite all the problems with windows media player. But then I wanted to connect to my computer at home and it was blocked absolutely. I tried everything (uninstall and install again), but without success. Today I went to a computer expert of our lab, but after some trials he gave up. So the Sansa e280 seems to be rather useless because of its close connections to Microsoft.  The update of the firmware solved this problem, but the software for upload is still very poor: let the Chinese do it !  Used the Media Monkey which is much better than the Microsoft Mediaplayer, but still not logical enough.  The memory size is too small for a music freak, 32 Gb would be more appropriate.

<Title>Impossibly difficult to use
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered this unit with high expectations, lots of memory, expandable, multiple modes, from a well known company and an excellent price; how could I go wrong?.  Easily enough, as it turns out.    I was unable to load it and control the play lists.  Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop.  Dragging a folder to the device was pointless.  Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place.  I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from "My Computer" on the host system.  After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out.   I have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method.   This was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb.  Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!.   Using Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on.    After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.  This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.    Throughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.  As it stands, it's without merit as a player.

<Title>Hope you went to college
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've got an engineering degree in computer science.  I've been supporting multi-million dollar web applications for years.  It took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the Rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for.  There is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight mp3 player.  It's not ipod caliber quality, the only reason you'd get it is for the Rhapsody service.  If you are not highly technical and patient, move on!  Player itself works fine.  ------ Edit - 4 days after getting this thing synced properly, it decided the device was no longer authorized to play the DRM'd music.  Only Rhapsody songs that are added again seem to work.  Filling the 8 gigs over a USB 2.0 connection takes hours.  All this after upgrading to the latest version of Rhapsody, the latest version of Windows Media Player, and the latest firmware for the player.  Further investigation indicates this sort of thing is a common problem with the Plays for Sure protocol used by the Sansa to integrate with the music subscription services, though Rhapsody seems to have the worst reputation.  That could mean it's just the most popular.  Get an ipod.  They're #1 for a reason. A lot of the high reviews and comments on reviews for this product are either people that haven't used it with a music subscription service or viral marketing from Real or Sandisk. -------------- Hopefully the final Edit -   We finally got this thing to work right.  It turns out that if part of the memory gets corrupted, the DRM doesn't work properly, resulting in the problems described above.  Oddly enough, you have to reformat the player using windows, like you would a 3.5" floppy disk.  Since doing this it has worked almost flawlessly.  I'd bump the rating from 2 stars to 4 if Amazon would let me.  Rhapsody technical support was no help, BTW.  We installed Napster as a last ditch effort to get the thing working, and the first thing the application told us to do was fix the corrupted memory by reformating the player.  Too bad for Napster it made Rhapsody work again as well.

<Title>Great player for the money, but room for improvement
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a subscription service (Ruckus) so I didn't want to deal with iPod. I did a lot of research on non-iPod players before buying the sansa. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.   Design is very sleek and the size is just right. The color screen has good resolution and pictures/videos are clear. Controls are very intuitive. The side buttons are a little hard to press, but if you buy a silicone case the buttons become raised making life a lot easier. The scroll button is kind of clunky as well, but I feel the sansa's other features compensate for it. Plus it's pretty neon blue... :)  After reading poor reviews about the FM radio, I have to say it works great for me. I live in a pretty rural area where stations are always a little fuzzy and the sansa comes in just as well as anything else. The antenna wires are in the headphones (standard cheap-ish round earbuds which I find very uncomfortable). I'm planning on getting new headphones, so hopefully the radio still works ok. Otherwise, volume is good, almost too loud.  I wish the package included an AC charger, but now that Sansa has been out for awhile, there are plenty of after-market accessories available. Sansa's website links to licensed products. There is also a memory expansion slot, which is a big plus over competitors. However, the battery life is longer than most players and it charges pretty quickly through USB. The downside here is that you can't use the player whenever it's plugged in. This makes for one of my bigger beefs: file management. It's a bit annoying if you just want to delete a song because it has to be plugged in. If you can't remember if you want to delete a song or not and would like to listen to it to check, heaven help you... You can't play anything (either through the sansa or the synced list on your computer) so this requires unplugging the player, listening, plugging back in, then deleting. I suppose this type of occurrence is rare, so I can deal.     Initial ease of transferring files wasn't great either. After a day though, I'm a pro. Yes, you may have to read the manual, but it'll save a lot of grief down the road. Although it's easier to use off the bat than other players I've tried, it could be improved. The sansa allows you to drag and drop files on MSC mode and sync through Windows Media Player in MTP mode (my preferred method). It took me a few tries to import playlists "as is", but contrary to some reviews here it CAN be done. Make sure you're using the AutoSync feature instead of Manual sync in Windows Media. (easy enough to do once I read the directions!) If you do it right, you'll still have a library full of all songs and playlists that will only play certain songs. The Sansa also has a "GoList" feature, but I've found it to be worthless. In order to add a song, you have to be listening to it. You can't queue up a playlist like in any PC jukebox program. May as well just make playlists in advance then import them.   While some things could be improved, I think the Sansa e280 is a very solid player and I'm glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to the ipod nano, based on both on price and function.

<Title>Sansa E280
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When my Zen Micro blew up on me a few weeks ago, I decided it was time to purchase a new MP3 player. I had long tried to avoid the iPod but after playing with a friend of mines new 8GB iPod Nano I decided I would get one. Fortunetly, I stumbled across the Sansa E280 by chance while looking for a good deal on the Nano. I decided to take a chance on this relatively unknown device and am now thrilled that I did!  While it is basically the same width and height as the Nano, it is slightly thicker which might bother some people but I still don't even know it's there while in my pocket. The Nano has a color screen which can be used to view photos and 8GB. It's actually a nice little player but compared to the Sansa E280 it falls easily to a comendable second place. the E280 has an internal 8GB but there is a slot for a 2GB expandable memory disk! It is very easy to connect to the pc as well. I am by no means a computer expert and I use Windows Media Player to store my music. When I first connected the E280 to the pc, it asked me did I want to sync the two, which I said yes to. Ten minutes later the Sansa was loaded with all my music, no problems what-so-ever.In addition to displaying photos as the Nano does, it also plays videos. When reading reviews I thought this was a clever gimic but nothing worth using on such a small screen (it is only slightly larger than the nano's). I put an episode of South Park onto it when I first got the E280 and was suprised by the quality. I still wouldn't recommend replacing your tv with one of these but it is actually far better than I thought it could be. The packaged video coverter works well. I literally dragged and dropped the episode into it and the it was converted and transferred to the E280 before my eyes. The fm radio is also brilliant. My Zen Micro had an fm radio that never really worked. I didn't expect much better from my new MP3 player but once again I was suprised. No problems picking up the local stations at all.   The player itself fits comfortably in my hand. The only complaint I have about the physical player is the rotating wheel. At first I was disappointed with it as it felt very cheap, particularly when compared with the rest of the player. I got used to this very quickly and don't have a problem with it anymore but I think it is worth noting all the same. The other complaint I would have about the player is that songs cannot be deleted from the player itself, you must hook it up to the computer and manually remove them.   All in all, I would highly recommend the Sansa E280. Of the many MP3 players I tried out, this one really came out of top. It is beaten on size by the iPod, although the difference is near negligible. If your looking for a great little player packed with more features than you'd know what to do with, pick a Sansa E280 up!

<Title>big failure
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned 4 MP3 players including the Sandisk 4gb which I give 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I cannot give the E280 the same rating.  I could not get the e280 to work on my computer. The 4gb is compatible with my Sony, but the 8gb was not recognized.  I tried EVERYTHING.  I downloaded drivers for my PC, I downloaded drivers for the  e280 MP3.  I was on the phone with Sandisk for an hour (and they were OK).  Sandisk told me there was something wrong with my computer (EVEN THOUGH I could run the 4gb beautifully).  They said I didn't have 2.0 usb ports (but I do).  I called Sony just to make sure I did have the 2.0 usb ports.  They walked me through hell and high water.  The only thing left for us to do was to wipe out my computer and reformat it just to see if the MP3 player would be recognized.  I wasn't willing to do all of this because I would have to back up all of my data on my entire computer and then reformat it.  Another few hours of work after I already spent 5 hours speaking with both Sony and Sandisk.  The mp3 player is just not worth it to me.  Good price, but never was recognized by my computer.  It did charge up however, and the menu was working.  But, I never downloaded any music to it because I couldn't get connected.  Now I know why it was such a good price.  I am so sorry it didn't worked because I really love the 4gb one.  I guess I have to go with another player.  boo hoo

<Title>my second one
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is my dream movie/mpeg player, i bought one in october and used it continuously until tonight i accidently put it into an olive jar with no olives but lots of olive brine and left it for several hours, (dont ask) so i am ordering my second one. i watch movies on it in bed and i listen to audiobooks on it.  where ever i find myself in a situation where i have to wait it is a great companion and i can get all my spanish lessons on it as well.  i have also purchased a 2 gig micro sd card bringing my total memory to 10 gig, that much memory does the job. i dont understand people who want to store 80 gig of files on their ipod or archos, it makes no sense and forces you to use hard drive based players which in my opinion are a real problem for an 'active' person.  now for the bad news, it is buggy, and does lock up, Plus you have to unscrew 4 small screws to change the battery to reboot, which can be a problem if you are on a bicycle tour and cant recharge, why not make battery change easier.  it uses the quick time movie format which is limiting, and the software conversion program is written by archsoft and doesnt give you 'any' options, i bought the full version from archsoft. the movies i convert are large 4 to 7 gig and in mpeg2 dvd format, and the software/hardware combination wont handle it and the audio gets out of synch VERY badly, i found a solution, i also have an archos 80 gig hard drive type video player so i convert the file to archos divx format first and then using that file i convert to the quick time format killing 2 birds with one stone but the file actually gets "larger" in quicktime then in divx. another irritation is that the player only handles 10 minute video files so the converter chops them up for you and rotates the frame to fit better, i can live with the 10 minute files, but every 10 minutes you get a 20 second pause as it opens the next 10 minutes, plus the conversion program leaves several rows of pixels unused on the screen, and i'd like the screen to be 1/4th of an inch bigger all the way around but NO bigger, i like it small so i'll always carry it.  i also dont like sansa's firmware updater service since if you have toasted the snasa's operating system the computer wont recognize it and the updater wont update the non-existing operation system, i am still trying to find the firmware on their web-sight.  so with all this pain why buy another, well 'love' is like that.  flash memory is really 'sweet' and the battery lasts and lasts, but for me the main thing is that it is SO small and light weight that i always have it with me, and when you find yourself stuck waiting at the doctors office and you are content watching a movie while those around you are stuck reading dog eared cosmopolitan magazines you'll love it, even those people who have other video players wont have them with them because they are just toooooo big.    hopefully later products will 'iron out' some of these little irritations. and thats why i only rate it 4 stars not 5. hurry up ups i need my sansa.

<Title>Great Unit
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've never written a review on Amazon before, but I like this unit so much that I thought I'd capture a few points that I think make this player a great choice:  1.) Currently an excellent $/GB value. 2.) Build quality is great (solid metal backplane). Screen will scratch, but one of the many available screen protectors will address this problem. 3.) User interface is well-deigned. I'm a fairly big guy (6'1") with large hands, but I have no problems operating the 4 buttons arranged around the scroll wheel. I was apprehensive about the scroll wheel, but it works great for me. The fact that it - unlike the iPod wheel - is raised a bit (i.e., has a positive profile) makes it easy to locate with your thumb when the player is out of view. 4.) Battery life is excellent; I've never run the unit to full discharge, but with heavy use on trans-pacific flights I've never gotten close to battery-empty status, so the stated 20 hrs. seems very realistic.(Remember that turning the brightness down will do wonders for battery life...) 5.) My player is loaded to capacity, and it takes apx. 10-15 sec. for booting, no more. 6.) Sandisk phone customer service has been more than satisfactory on two occasions (wait time was quite long but the actual service was very good).

<Content>I really want to enjoy this player... its a beauty to look at and is the perfect size. But...  Takes about 30 seconds to boot up, takes another 10 seconds to get anything to play, takes about 10 seconds to skip to a new song, takes about 30 seconds to transfer 1 song...  i've never had a player that was anything but instantanious (except for the initial boot).

<Title>Its extra features, may not be what you'd expect
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Sansa e280 (8GB) about a year ago and my wife has the e260 (4GB).  They have been reliable and easy to use.  I selected Sansa over iPod because of its lower price, the ability to listen to and record FM radio and voice, and because of its expandable memory, user replaceable battery, and not needing to use iTunes.  I'm not going to compare similar features of these two products, but rather focus on Sansa's extras.  To me the microphone in the Sansa is surprisingly good and its voice recordings are excellent.  I was surprised to find recordings in WAV format, rather than MP3, and have not seen this mentioned in other reviews, on Sansa's web site, or in the product manual.  Recordings are 16-bit mono, sampled at 16kHz, which is fine for voice.  The level is preset, working well for voice, but set too high for amplified live music.  For FM recording there is another surprise producing a 16-bit stereo WAV still sampled at 16kHz.  The surprise is that the signal is mixed to mono, but recorded in stereo, doubling file size without providing the benefit a stereo image.  The low sampling rate means playback sounds worse than the original, losing frequencies above 8kHz.  A sampling rate of 32kHz would be more appropriate for FM recording, but would double file size too.  I have not needed to replace the battery, but I suspect the cost may not be justified when the time comes.  The microSD slot is not HCSD compatible, so expansion is limited to 2GB.  It's better to buy more memory up front, if you can afford it.  On your computer, a separate drive is installed for the expansion slot, and files must be placed there manually.  Despite its issues, I find the Sansa to be a great value.  Not needing iTunes is priceless.

<Content>I had a Sansa e280 for little over a year. Unfortunately, it broke a couple days ago. I was very satisfied with it, but now i'm thinking about upgrading to a higher memory. The only cons are that it freezes fairly often- many times i had to wait until the battery died to use it. Also, after you put your music on the player, you can't edit the title, artist, album, or anything like that.  I would recomend this item over a nano.

<Content>I bought the Sansa e200. It was on sale for about $84. I also bought a power supply for use while traveling. It was a total waste of money. My e200 has menu screens that are neither English or Spanish. The manual/instructions were supposed to be available on Adobe PDF. I have the latest Adobe (8.0), but I cannot bring up the instructions. All attempts to solve this problem have failed. I would never waste my money on another Sansa product.  Puffmaru

<Title>Meh.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Good: I love the metal backing!!!  It's pretty much the reason I bought the product--I'm a very clumsy person and have managed to drop it several times without it breaking.  Pictures look pretty nice, and although the only video I saw on it is the preloaded one, that was good too.    I like the EQ settings and that you can rate the songs. The voice and FM radio are nice too.  I've never used the micro SD slot, but it's nice to have the option.  The Bad: You can't edit your playlists on the go.  I've previously used Creative players that can so that could just be me.  It's also frustrating that you can't play only one song from an album without adding the entire album to the now playing list.  Basically, unless you have a playlist you have to listen to whole albums at a time.  I also wish you could change the orientation when looking at pictures, but it's not really a big deal. It also takes a ridiculously long time to start up, which makes me sad.  Overall: It works, but I'm not terribly impressed.  It kind of feels like (gasp) a return to the CD era in that unless you have a mix already made you're stuck to just albums.  It's perfect for some people, but I'm looking for a replacement.  Most Creative Labs products would be a nice alternative.

<Title>What more can you possibly want?
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought my e280, not being confused by Apple's marketing "trick" of convincing people that the nano is not just another player. And I don't need the prestige value that Jobs has built into his player. Rather, I get to keep my various music files on separate cards, so I don't have to play with the whole "list" business. My classical music isn't inter-mixed with my pop music, or my 30's collection.  But more importantly, the e280 is feature rich. I use every one of them, especially the recorder which allows me to structure my day and make certain I get all the essentials done. The photos are great, the video quality only suffers because most video producers do such a terrible job wih focus and lighting, and the built in FM receiver has allowed me to use my car stereo with the addition of a simple Giffen car device (at some point I'll spring for the built in system, but not until I get a Click and just leave it in the car). I use Bose earphones at home and the sound is simply first rate. Given the price, the increasing music options (including the ability to turn my records into mp3 files), and the freedom from iTunes makes this a no brainer, unless you have some deep, psychological need to be "in" and have a nano to impress your friends. One suggestion - get the rubber black cover for your e280. I've dropped mine a few times and it just bounces wihout any damage. As for the nano crowd, just wait until you have to replace your battery! In conclusion, I'd rather save $100 and use the money to build my music collection than give it over to Apple. The nano is just more proof that no one has ever gone broke underestimating the foolishness of the American consumer.

<Title>Cannot set MSC connection mode
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Before purchasing this device I downloaded the Sansa E280 user guide from the Sansa website. The user guide has clear instructions on how to set MSC or MTP USB connection mode. Really simple. Just select Settings/USB Mode from the main menu. Piece of cake. A child could do it.  That is, a child could do it IF THE F*****G Settings menu had a USB Mode selection. Which it doesn't.  Sorry - didn't mean to shout.  I sent the device back this morning, along with the nifty base station that I was going to use to hook up the device to my home stereo.  Now, just to be clear: I was able to find out that there is a magic handshake that will allow you to set MSC mode: everytime you connect to your PC, put the device in LOCK, and hold down the left-nav button while you are connecting the device to your PC. So simple even an ambidextrous ape could do it, BUT WHY WOULD HE WANT TO???!!!??? Why the f**k would Sansa ship a device that has to be used in that way?  Oops, shouting again. Sorry.  Anyway, I sent the device back because life is far too short to allow oneself to be aggravated by poorly designed or poorly implemented electronic gadgets.

<Title>Kicks iPod's butt!
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this a year ago and I love it!!  I use it constantly.  Battery goes forever and recharges quickly.  It is very light weight and I don't even notice it when I run.  Far easier to use in my opinion than ipods. I like the actual wheel and buttons instead of the touch pad, which I never could master.  I have had zero problems which is nice since I moved to Africa with the Peace Corps right after getting it and would never be able to get it serviced.  Far less expensive because they don't spend billions on advertisements, but the quality is high.  My only recommendation is that you get any accessories at the same time you order this.  You will save on shipping and it is hard to find accessories that fit it elsewhere.  The world only seems to want to sell ipod stuff.  Buy it!  Love it!

<Title>Looks great and works good --> recommended!
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've got this device two weeks ago and I am very happy with it.   PROS: + solidly build, scratch resistant, looks great (truly "sexy") + great looking interface, easy and quick navigation + tactile navigation wheel for fast navigation (also looks great when shines blue) + good sound, custom EQ, also loud enough + sharp display; even videos are looking good + good tuner reception, sensivity over average, works also in Europe + 20 hours with one battery charge + the battery is replaceable: $19.99 if you need it one day... in contrast to $60+ for an iPod + supports MSC (Mass Storage Compliant) mode: no need for any software to transfer files, can be used for any data as USB stick + supports MTP (Music Transfer Protocol) and MS PlaysForSure (eg. for Napster To Go) + can by extended to 10GB with an microSD card + is not an iPod ;-)  CONTRAS: - supports only an old QuickTime format for videos (big files) - buttons are quite small and may be difficult to push - upper surface is a fingerprint magnet (easy to clean, fortunately..) - no gapless playback (very short - maybe 0.2s - breaks between live tracks) - bad quality FM recording - sometimes crashes during video playback - microSD Card can only be used in MSC mode if I am right.. and can only be used for music, no photos/videos  I don't really need video, so big .MOV files is not an issue to me, and also don't care about audio recording... therefore I can easily give 4.5 stars ... or even 4 3/4. Truly great gadget!

I was looking for megabytes, FM radio, nice design, but I found even more: it was a LOT of megabytes, RECORDABLE radio, BEAUTIFUL design, and also good screen, memory extension and an INCREDIBLE price. I thought that this is something like a joke, but for my happiness it was something real. So I bought it, I wasn't delaying a second. Now I own it for 3 months and I am still the happiest man on earth, because I love music very much, and Sansa helps me everyday too keep it close to me.

I read all of amazon review before buying it, I was a little scared of what I read, I bought it anyway for my wife, I been playing with it for a bit (it is for her Christmas), let me tell you the wheel is a little mecanical compare to a I-pod (who cares), but works great, I was able to dump 3.5 GB of songs ( ran out of MP3) and copied one video over and 15 pictures I have 3.7GB used, the screen quality is really nice, I bought it for $184 + free shipping, I don' t think you can do better then that..... I will recommended it in a heart beat,it is small, cute ,a really nice piece of electronic. I also read that people have problems with the software and complained that you have to use the "media converter" , but I read the manual and that works great too... (I think people do not like to learn new tricks). the only thing is that it would be nice to be able to dump the video on the Sansa, (it shows up in Mycomputer), but I think the software resize the pictures and video to the screen size of the sansa..... so it is worth the effort.... my take on it rely nice, the best buck for the money, the feature I like the most is it as a clock !!!I-pod do not have a clock, the FM radio is also nice, *****GREAT ALL IN-ONE *****

<Title>Fantastic MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for about 2 weeks now, and the longer I have it the more I love it.  It comes pre-loaded with hundreds of songs that are easy to access via convenient categories such as 70's, 80's, Hip Hop, etc.  This is great if you're new to MP3 players and/or don't have a big MP3 collection of your own yet.  The Rhapsody service it comes bundled with is outstanding.  You'll likely find most every song you want, and you'll find it easily, plus you'll quickly discover all sorts of new music you like.  The FM radio works very well too, with splendid reception.  Viewing photos on a screen this size is, naturally, problematic, but the color screen is crystal clear, if small.  You just can't go wrong here.  Trust me, you're going to love this player!

<Title>Great for 2 hours then died after firmware upgrade
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>E280 has great features and capacity for the price.   The player has a quality feel to it except for the thumbwheel which doesn't rotate smoothly.   Pictures, video and music were easy to load.  Video and pictures were very crisp.  FM, MP3 and voice recording audio were all very good.   The player's GUI was intuitive and easy to use.   Now the bad news...   The manual and Sansa web site recommend upgrading to the latest firmware (the player shipped with 01.02.12A).  When I upgraded the firmware to the latest release (01.02.15), the player would not start up again.  The thumbwheel would illuminate but nothing else worked.   I called the Sansa help number (1 866 726-3475) and after only a 2 minute wait, a native English speaker answered the call.  He walked me through some procedures to get the player in fail safe but none of them worked.   The customer service rep said that the 1.02.15 firmware offered very little improvement over 1.02.12A and recommends staying at 1.02.15 (too late to help me!).   The rep offered a RMA number but said it would be much quicker to return directly to Amazon (Sansa would take 4 - 6 weeks minimum).     I decided to return the player to Amazon.  Since I had a few questions I decided to call Amazon, rather than processing the return via the web site.  Finding their 800 number is not easy, and I had to Google "Amazon customer service" in order to get it (800 201-7575).  It took a lot of patience and punching in numbers to get through to a person.    When the rep finally answered, she was very nice and is sending out a replacement unit.  Unfortunately it will not arrive for five days (12/27), so I won't be able to enjoy the player over my Christmas break.  Quality issues can occur with any brand and I'm willing to give the E280 another shot.   Assuming no firmware issues with the replacement player, I believe that I'll be happy with the E280.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have the 80gb IPod, Iriver, and Samsung YP-K5 and this player is better then all of them combined in my opinion. The option of the expandable memory is what hooked me. They are going to come out with bigger and bigger for players and the microsd cards so why spend more on a bigger player when i just make a bigger player with more memory. As Soon as I got it I upgraded the firmware. I have the entire player filled with mp3s and videos and they all work flawlessly even from one song to the next. Even made a little mistake not relizing it. Plugged the player into the front with my external Hdd. External sucks a huge amount of power from the computer system. so it ddnt load the drivers. Called tech support and got a human within seconds and them telling me I made an Id10t error. plugged the player into the back and it started up within seconds.  Reason for the 4 stars is that it is a pain trying to make playlists for the thing.  My advice to anyone getting this player. Get it snag some extra cash get the 2gb microsd / transflash. And an External wall charger first thing. O and a screen protector.

<Title>Doesn't Work with Any Known Music Subscription Service
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned my e280 for about a week now and have come to the realization that the e280 is not compatible with any known music subscription service.  Even though the likes of Napster, Rhapsody and Yahoo Music declare that any of the e200 series players work with their services, it does not.  This defeats the very reason why I picked the e280, to hold a lot of subscription music for my trips to the gym.  The player seems to work okay for your own MP3 music, but don't even consider this lemon for holding anything more than that.

<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>i got a refurb for less than half retail and the only difference is that engraved on the back it says "refurb." the quality, battery life, ease of scanning through the menu, and the drag and drop makes the sansa more appealing than ipods. the video quality is as good as you can expect from a screen that size. light weight, but i'd get one of the clear, adhesive screen covers and silicone cases to protect it

<Title>Sansa Rules
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Sansa e series player is the best value.  It sounds great, and is easy to use.  Best of all you can kiss i-tunes goodbye.  We have a couple of these and love them.  The expandability through the micro SD slot is neat, but slows down boot time.  I have a sweet set of speakers that I also use with this that make it great on the deck and outdoors.  Excellent choice.

<Title>Very pleased so far
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have only recently started using the e280 but so far am really enjoying it.  The disk that came with it was very easy to use as far as installing the software and the manual that came on it is very user friendly and had everything I needed to get started.  The only problems I have run into so far with this player is that every time I connect it to the computer to load music windows media player begins trying to synchronize with it.  The first time I did this I was excited as I watched the percentage of the synchronization process until I later turned on the player and saw what this dirty filthy media player had done.  It mucked the whole thing up due to media player being a bigot of certain files.  The other problem I had was getting the media into the player at first but after taking a second look at the manual, which fully explained my problem and solved it for me I have not had a single problem.  I highly recommend this player.  It has its shortcomings just like other players, inadequate headphones and the like but if you buy a moderately priced accessory package you will be more then happy.  I like it compared to the ipod.  I got mine at a very good price and don't have to worry with itunes or any of the problems some of my fiends face.  Loading music is simply as easy as dragging and dropping files.

<Title>Packaging and durability
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received the item promptly but I do have a huge complaint. I did not received it as I have received other fragile items from Amazon. They usually pack these things in boxes with enough protection so they don't get damaged on the way. Well, I got this one in a padded envelope!!! That is not enough people! I received the Travel Kit for the Sansa better packed THAN the Sansa, with the box and the little inflated plastic bags inside for extra protection. I ordered this MP3 for my brother to replace one I had already bought also from Amazon. I wanted to try the " wear and tear theory" that the SanDisk company told me about the little Sansa. I want to see if this Sansa also cracks and breaks as the previous one. The company told me it was a wear and tear issue and the warranty didn't cover that (this was after only six months of use). So far so good regarding that issue. The little Sansa has no problem in performing its job. My brother just loves it because he says he doesn't have to be fidgeting around with file conversions. He just plugs it in and the Sansa transfer everything he has in his library. One complain, though is that he says that the headphones break easily from the cord. Other than that the Sansa delivers what it claims. We like the product, it is just the problem with the case. People had told us that we dropped it and that's why it broke but I keep telling them, "no, we did not drop it, it just happened." And that's where the mystery remains.  Anyways, I'll see how this one does and I'll let you know, especially after the packaging issue. So, I would say that the Sansa's performance deserve a 5 stars rating, the durability 1 star and the packaging 0, if there was that option.

<Title>Outstanding!
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have never cared for Ipods and their proprietary music software, preferring instead DRM free MP3's.  I have had this unit for around 8 months and have been very pleased with it.  The sound is great, it looks good, and works with DRM music when I need it to.  Now that Amazon offers DRM free mp3 files, I like it even better.  I would highly recommend this, and leave the sheep to worship Apple and the Ipod.  Don't assume because everyone has an Ipod that it must be the best product.

<Title>Better Than My iPod - Waaaaa!
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My husband just received his Sansa e280 about a month ago.  He's in love with it.  I jumped in and had bought an 8GB iPod 3rd Gen Nano instead.  Now I'm left to make mocking faces at him when he tells me how great his new gadget is!  A few things I am quite impressed with would be the expandable memory (you can add a SD card to increase memory for music, videos, photos, etc.), the self-replaceable battery (as easy as a new $20 battery instead of sending it to Apple for replacement at upwards of $60), the nifty accessories that come with it (screen wipe and soft case), the fact that he can also listen to FM radio, and the capability to record verbal notes with the audio recorder.  So, in short, I'm peeved.  I fell into the "fad" instead of getting something far better and now I get to have it rubbed in my face a whole lot.  :)  Save yourself the iPod heartache and pick this one up instead.

<Content>OK, I bought my E280 at the end of 2006 and it's been running daily ever since!  When I got my Sansa E280 I found a program from BakMyTunes called saCaster ($14.95 and worth twice as much!) that manages my music, lets me create and manage all the playlists I want, backs up and restores the media files and allows me to subscribe to and manage Podcasts directly.   I now have a Sansa View and I still keep my E280 synced, charged and stored on my laptop bag for times my I forget my View.  The really nice feathre the E280 has ove the View is it can be put into the MSC mode and it stays there.

<Title>Good product and great price
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had an Ipod nano for about one year before i lost it, and when I was looking around for a replacement, I found the Sansa had so many more features, and for around the same price. I've been pretty satisfied with it, the sound is good and I love the fact that it has a recorder, being a songwriter, that comes in handy when i get ideas and dont have a pad of paper handy. And unlike the Ipod, this actually comes with INSTRUCTIONS!! Overall, I'm satisfied with it, but one thing I would change is the fact that it comes with 20 pre-loaded songs that cannot be deleted-kinda annoying,but i just skip past them. Plus, Amazon has, by-far, the lowest price for the 8G.

<Title>Don't buy
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought two of the Sansa e280 players for Christmas 2007. My player is working fine for now but my son's player has gone into "white screen" mode and I have not been able to find a solution on the SanDisk site or on the Internet. When I contacted Amazon customer service by email they refused to accept the defective unit back because it is beyond "the 30 day" limit. A call to the Amazon service rep was a bit more helpful. The rep was very pleasant and connected me via conference call to a SanDisk technician. The technician could not solve the problem of the "white screen" either. He told me to email my Amazon invoice to SanDisk Support. I am still waiting for a reply. Hopefully, this story will have a happy ending. In the meantime, my recommendation would be to find another player until SanDisk can fix this problem and the problems related by other owners.

<Title>Wouldn't recommend buying the e-series

<Content>I actually have the e260, but I think this has the same issues.  1. Controls are difficult and wheel is breaking down already 2. Has no sleep function like the m-series. 3. Has no bookmarking for audiobooks or video. 4. Difficult to fast forward/reverse through without accidentally going to the very end/start. 5. Difficult to sync properly. 6. Can't remove some old files, no matter what method I've tried.  Sleek body design, thin and small.  Great to be able to expand the memory with the micro-sd. But, the newer series has a new control pad.  You might want to consider that instead.

<Title>Really Nice MP3
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just picked this unit up about 3 weeks ago.  I really like the bright screen, easy to follow menus and great sound. With so many features it is hard to say anything bad about this unit. It fits great in your hand, around your neck with the provided lanyard or in your pocket.  This item has many accesories to choose from and the fact that it is 8GB it has a ton of room for your music library as well as photos and videos.  The FM radio is a nice feature and the fact that you can use it as a voice recorder comes in handy when attending lectures or meetings. The mechanical wheel to navigate around the machine feels reliable and is sensitive enough to move around the menus. All in all I give this unit 5 stars.  Pros: Well built, bright screen, FM radio, voice recorder and photo viewer.  Cons: Price appears to be going up, however if you search around the web you can find this for around $125.00

<Title>Good player but the firmware was buggy
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The player came with old firmware and buggy media converter. It didn't have the option for selecting the USB mode and the media converter couldn't detect the player. So there was no way of copying video to the player.   I had to spend more than 2 hours researching on the internet to find ways to upgrade the firmware (the sansa firmware updater didn't work either). The earphones are pathetic, you are better-of getting a new one.   Other than these issues, its a good player, good value for money. Audio/video quality is very good.

<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this Sansa to replace my truly wretched Philips GoGear MP3 player. My lord that Philips sucked, not that it's germane (or Tito) to this review.  But all that misery is behind me now because this Sansa player is awesome, especially with the Rhapsody music service.  No software glitches, very pretty, sturdy and lots of nice accessories.  The GoGear is dead to me.  Of course battery life is never close to what is advertised for any MP3 player, but this one actually will give you 12 to 15 hours of playtime even if you fiddle with it a lot and have the backlight on bright.  I suppose if you set it to play a 20-hour playlist and never turned on the backlight you might get the the full 20 hours they advertise.  So far, I have had no issues with this player, and I like the size, look, feel and features.

<Content>Santa Claus brought this for Christmas 2008.  I have loaded it from my PC, synced it with Ruckus music service, and jacked it into my car's 'Aux' slot WITHOUT OPENING THE MANUAL.  The little slot on the side is the greatest feature of this MP3 player.  Sandisk is a leading developer of miniaturized flash memory and the inclusion of a 'Micro SD' slot on the side of the E280 makes it INFINITELY EXPANDABLE.  As I write, an 8MB Micro SD module costs $53, and I have little doubt that a 64MB Micro SD module will someday be developed.

<Title>Excellent mp3 player for your money!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>At the end of last year, I was looking into purchasing an MP3 player.  I did a lot of research into them and found that there were not many contenders that shine above all the rest.  The two choices that I was left with ultimately were the Apple iPod and SanDisk Sansa.  I purchased this item about 3 months ago and I must say that I could not be happier.  I use it every day and no other words could help describe it except perfection.  SanDisk truly thought of everything when designing this product.  It has a beautiful sleek exterior that not only is very attractive, but also very durable at the same time.  Many of my friends who have purchased and iPod complain about the touch-sensitive wheel and after a while certain buttons and functions cease to work from continued use.  The construction of SanDisk Sansa far exceeds that of the iPod in that nothing is touch-sensitive and every function has its own button or wheel.  I expect that my Sansa will outlive any iPod on the market!  The storage capabilities of the SanDisk Sansa MP3 players are perfect for those people who do not wish to house their entire music collection.  This item is so easy to move music back and forth onto the computer and my favorite aspect of all is that I do not need to use an additional program such as iTunes to manage my music; this really outshines iPod for this sole reason.  The Sansa works very much like a USB flash drive and moving files is a cinch!  There are so many options the user has in regards to cataloging the saved music and I actually love the way all of it is displayed with beautiful, full-color menus that are far more aesthetically pleasing than the menus of the iPod.  The user has many options to supplement this MP3 player with accessories.  Although the product line is not that of the iPod line, every accessory anyone would want is available.  You will not be able to find the pastel or neon colors that many of the accessories for iPod feature, but rather, all of the accessories complement the sleek, contemporary design of the Sansa; most are either black or silver and some even have blue LEDs to match those found on the wheel of the player itself!  I love the fact that I got a product that far exceeds that of the iPod for a fraction of the price!  I am very happy with my decision to go with the SanDisk Sansa and know that it will be with me for years to come!  If you are looking into purchasing an MP3 player that will give you everything if not more than what an iPod can, I highly recommend this product as your choice!  Its durability and flexibility puts it in a class above all the rest!  You will not be disappointed.

<Content>die hard apple fans won't admit it, but this is a better deal over the nano.  The FM tuner is very clear, I up't it to 9 gigs with a microSD, and the only way I would give an Mp3 player 5 stars would be if they came with decent earbuds (shures,etc.) Some complain about the button placement but if Sandisk would have made it look like exactly like a nano they would have ran into some lawsuits. The scroll wheel is plastic (rubber would've been a little better) but it doesn't snag and works perfect. Highly recommend.

<Title>Good value and a legitimate alternative to iPod Nano
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you are just getting your first MP3 player or if you don't already own a bunch of music from iTunes, you really should give the Sansa e200 series a look.  Besides giving you a lot of storage for the money, its user interface is pretty good and intuitive.  It works with a lot of different music stores.  I like Rhapsody, and I have had no problems so far.  My complaints are small.  I think the thumbwheel feels cheap and loose, although it works without any problems.  The play, menu, prev, and next buttons are small.  The sound quality is good if you substitute the included earbuds with a decent set of headphones.    One extra little feature you get over the market leader is video playback.  I used multiple formats with some fairly lengthy clips and had no problem.  The FM Radio gets good reception, but the sound quality is so-so.  The unit displays photos well.  It would be nice if the converter would let you reorient the photo (landscape vs. portrait), but that is minor.  While this player is heavier than the Nano, it is still very light and is not noticeable in your pocket.   It was nice to be able to plug this Plays For Sure device into an XP machine and have the computer recognize it without the need for loading any drivers.  (You do need to load some software for video playback and photos).  The user replaceable battery rounds out a very nice package.  Battery life is long  I would definitely buy one again.

<Content>Last year I bought an iPod Nano and I thought it was the greatest MP3 player there was, for this year i recieved a 8 GB Sansa and it is so much better than the iPod Nano 1.)It is a lot cheaper the the Nano.  Why would you pay $250 for a 8GB Nano when you can get the same thing for a lot less? 2.)The radio is something the Nano doesn't have. 3.)Voice recording, 4.)After about a month, the back and the screen of the Nano was very scratched up. The iPod Nano is a great MP3 player, but don't waste money on that when you can get the cheaper and more efficient Sansa

<Title>Good features but hard to use and not well supported
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it for its video and photo features, in addition to its non-proprietary music formats. All are there and that's good.  I booted it up and charged it, which took about 6 hrs (I later found out charging depends on which USB port you use). Then I tried to update the firmware, which failed repeatedly. It also disconnected all the time when I tried to copy files to it. I called support, which took over 30 min to have a live person. It turned out I shouldn't be using the USB port from the monitor. Instead, one should be using the ones directly off the computer. No other USB devices had this problem.  Now it comes to copying files, videos and photo. It's soooo inconvenient! You have to use "Sansa Media Converter", which doesn't show what you have on the device and you have to type in the folder name, instead of browsing what's on the device. Every time you want to see what's already on the device, you'd have to unplug the cable and browse on the device. For photos, it only shows in Portrait. If you want to show Landscape, you'd have to convert the photo BEFORE storing on the device.  Video playback is not reliable (with the latest firmware 1.02.15). For the same pieces, it sometimes plays fine but causes hanging & reboots of the device other times. Half of the pieces I copied to the device hiss at words with "s". The hiss is apparently related to conversion from MPEG (.mpg) to QuickTime Movie (.mov), using Sansa Media Converter. I copied the converted files back to my PC and they had the same hiss using QuickTime player or iTune. No conversions required with MP3 files and no problems there.  All in all, it feels like a device lack of basic professional software support as expected these days. As a result, while I bought it for its video & photo features, I might end up using it mostly for MP3 playing, which is quite good. It's twice as thick and heavy as a Nano. I assume it's because of all the great features (video, etc) that are hard to use & unreliable. Too bad.

<Title>I've never owned an iPod
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just so you know in advance, I've never owned an iPod and won't be comparing the Sansa to one.  I purchased the e280 as a Christmas present for myself.  I plan to use it for mp3 songs and occasionally listen to the radio.  8 Gigs is plenty of space for me.  It's equivalent to over 11 CDRs of data.  I also like the smooth, professional look of the Sansa.  After receiving it, I'm very happy.  I immediately put it in a silicone protective case, and applied a 'stick-on' screen protector.  So, I'm not very worried about scratches.  The navigation screens are not only practical, but also beautiful to look at.  It interfaces well with my Windows XP computer.  I like the fact that I can 'drag-n-drop' songs onto the device.  It has a record button on the side, so you can start recording voice or radio anytime without hassle.  It's so easy to use.  You could hand it to almost anyone over the age of 5, and they'd figure it out within a minute.  It has a 'hold' switch to prevent accidental song skipping when it's in your pocket.  There are some things I would change if I could: I would add an FM transmitter, so I could play music in other people's cars without bringing any wires or accessories along.  I would make the buttons a little easier to push (their small size relative to the protruding navigation wheel is slightly cumbersome).  When playing a song, the large button in the middle does nothing.  The play/pause button is one of the outer buttons, located above the nav wheel.  I would consider also making the center button perform the 'play/pause' function.  Basically, it works as well as I expected and does everything I thought it would.  I highly recommend the Sansa e280.

<Title>Falls short from being a great MP3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this from Amazon.com. It came loaded with the latest firmware. I made sure also to install the "Sansa Updater" utility and now everytime plug it to the computer, it goes to cyberspace to find a newer firmware if available. OK, with the latest software, I now can say that there are still shortcomings on this player.  Sound quality: reproduction of high quality MP3 files is very good. In fact, the sound is warm and very balanced. Very nice. Unfortunately, during quiet passages or in between tracks, I can hear static noise. My Sansa c200 is completely quiet. The e280 is noisy in silent or quiet passages of music. I notice this problem more when I use a high end headphone like an etymotic er4b or sennheiser HD25. With regular earbuds, the floor noise is not so noticeable.  MP3 compatibility troubles: yes, even though my Sansa c200 plays all of my MP3s, the e280 picks and chooses. On certain MP3s, the e280 will not play a sound and then proceed to freeze.  Video playback and control response: video playback is very good. I was afraid I would not be able to read my anime subtitles, but this was no problem at all. The problem is that when Sansa plays a video, it seems as though the CPU gets overloaded and controls respond with a lag. It is pretty annoying when trying to FF or RW or stop playback and the e280 takes its time.  Video converter: it takes your mpeg, avi, and wmv files and converts them to quicktime MOV files. Problem is that the converted files are often bigger than the source files (often by a factor close to 2). One would think that after conversion, the file should be smaller since the Sansa screen is small and does not require full resolution.  FM recording: MONO, that's right, it is all mono. I was expecting the e280 to record in stereo. Recording sound quality itself is also not very impressive, with rolled highs and lows. Recordings sound very lo fi. Voice recordings sound very lo fi as well.  I still like it, but it if I had a choice today between the Sansa e280 and Zen 8GB, I would take the Zen 8GB.

Difficult to get the Sync operation to correctly work or play lists loaded. Operating player easy except for the back button (for a right handed person).

<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The product came shipped with instructions for a earlier model, the e200.  By comparing the e 200's insructions with my e280, they clearly don't have the same interface.  The e280 was supposed to come with a driver as well(according to the packaging and product description) but did not.  The device is not self-explanatory for this first time mp3 player's owner.  I contacted customer service twice with my issues and both times they directed me to their website for said instructions and driver.  Neither were available for this particular model however.  In fact the website's link for the e280's instructions took me to the instructions for the e200, the same set of instructions included in the packaging.  It was only after consulting several forums (unrelated to Sandisk) that I received the help I needed to get my player running properly.  Nice product but lousy customer service.  Thanks forums.

<Content>I bought the SanDisk Sansa as a Christmas gift for my 17 year old son.  He is really enjoying it.  He says that the size is ideal and the sound quality is excellent.  8GB seems to be enough for his music collection. He formerly had a Creative Jukebox which no longer works.  Compared to the Sansa, the Creative was much larger and the display was difficult to read.  It also cost about twice as much as the SanDisk.

<Title>Great Tiny Gadget
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This gadget really performs great!  I got this a week ago and have used  or "ABUSED" it as if I had this for a month.  Just right off the box, I plugged it to my laptop for charging and at the same time load with music, photos, and videos.  I uploaded tons of family pictures and tons of video clips (of about 30 to 40MB each), synchronized it with my laptop's Windows Media Player 11, trasferred and deleted songs, uploaded and deleted videos, recorded voice messages, tried the FM tuner and  used the pre-set function to mark my favorite stations - ALL WITHOUT FLAWS!!!  Battery life is also longer than I expected for this small gadget.  The navigation buttons are not the best compared to the other mp3 player I used before. They are just fine (not the best but it work).   One thing I have not tried is to upgrade firmware, which I think I will not do not unless it is really necessary. For now, I do not see any reason to do that because the device is performing excellently. I don't have a music subscription too, and I don't have plan on having one.  I travel frequently and now with Sansa E280 with me, I have enough music, videos, and photos that will keep me busy during my flights to South America and my trans-Pacific (13-hour) flights.  I never used an IPOD before so I cannot compare it with that device.  I highly recommend this gadget.

<Title>Elegant MP3 player which works great with Rhapsody
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa e280 is a stylish product that does exactly what it promises. I did not want to buy an iPod because I consider them to be overpriced and do not like Apple's monopolistic ambitions. The Sansa is a perfect alternative. It is relatively easy to use, compact, esthetically pleasing and moderately priced (at least here on Amazon).  Moreover it works with Rhapsody To Go which I consider to be the best way to access digital music, since you rent it for a small monthly fee, instead of paying a buck to download a single song. Why pay to fill up your hard drive with songs when you can just access them from a remote server whenever you want and for a lot less money?  I have long been a user of Rhapsody on my home stereo which gives me access to millions of songs for a modest fixed monthly price.  Up until now when I wanted to take music with me I would purchase songs or albums for a dollar or 10 dollars respectively and then transfer them to an SD card on my PDA or burn them on to Cd's to play on my car's MP3 player. This process always annoyed me because it was both expensive and time consuming.  Now, however, all I do is hook my Sansa up to my laptop and download nearly any song from the Rhapsody catalog onto the player. I can then listen to the songs on the Sansa or hook it up to my car stereo's auxiliary MP3 port and listen through the car stereo.  When I get tired of the songs on the player I just erase them and download something different without paying a penny extra just as I do on my stereo system at home.  The only time I have to pay a per item cost is if I wish to burn a song but I can't see any reason to do that unless I wish to give someone a gift.  Unlike what another reviewer says below, there is no need to buy the Rhapsody version of the player.  I have the generic version that Amazon sells and it works flawlessly with Rhapsody.  The Rhapsody version is more expensive and comes preloaded with songs most of which you probably don't want. One note about using Rhapsody To Go with the Sansa which I initially found a bit confusing (Rhapsody is a good product but Real often rushes software to market before it's quite finished leaving the user frustrated while they work the bugs out and, finally, Real has bad customer service with poorly trained service personal with questionable English skills. I really think that if they fixed this area of their business they'd be as successful as Apple and the iPod):  Rhapsody says that with Rhapsody To Go you can transfer nearly any subscription track to your Sansa, which is true, but first you have to DOWNLOAD the track to your PC before you can transfer it to the Sansa. It would be nice if you could just drag and drop from the Rhapsody catalog directly to the Sansa icon, (which I could do with Rhapsody 3.1, but cannot with Rhapsody 4.0); unfortunately it's now a two-step process in which you download to your PC first and then drag and drop to the Sansa.   The disadvantage of this is that you start filling up your computer's hard drive with songs that you can already stream just so you can put them on the Sansa E280.  I usually delete the downloads from my hard drive after I've transferred them to the Sansa, particularly when I'm using my laptop which has a smaller hard drive than my desktop machines.   (The new wireless Sansa should connect directly to the Rhapsody service allowing you to access the entire 3 million song catalog directly anytime you have a wireless connection and without the need of a PC).  All in all the Sansa is a very good product, particularly in conjunction with the Rhapsody To Go service. I like that fact that it has an FM radio and a voice recorder.  The photo and video players work fine although I don't use those features much because who wants to view images or video on a 2 inch screen? I think that's one of those things that people do just because it's cool that you CAN do it. But it's not comfortable, so I'll watch video on my big screen TV if I'm at home or my laptop if I'm traveling.

<Title>Great MP3 Player - Minor Problems
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just received my Sansa e280 a few days ago, was downloading music to it in minutes without loading anything onto my computer. It's so easy to use and I can't hardly put it down!  One problem I have had is when I try to rate a song it locks up.  It's done it 3 out of 4 times I've tried it. Another time the player got stuck between music files and showed half of one song and the other half of another.  I had to shut it down and reboot.  So mine has had an issue or two.  I used the disk that came with it to load the photo/video converter - it was simple. And you can select what you want to download from the disk.  I have already loaded over 1,400 songs and several pictures and one home video and still have 2.4 GB left.  My kids have the smaller version sandisk and are now wanting the e280 too.  No more lugging those CD's around!!

<Content>My daughter bought her dad this sandisk for Christmas. First of all I have to say that Amazon is awsome, our item was lost in the mail due to a severe storm here in CO. and it was replaced in no time at all.   I own the 4gb and it's perfect for me and my husband had an ipod but he likes this so much better. The controls are so easy to use. It's so easy to download songs,pictures and videos. This has replaced the satellite radio in our cars. We love the screen and it's colors. The fm tuner is a big plus and we love the fact that we can record little reminders for ourselves. I highly recommend the sandisk and Amazon has the best price on the 8gb.

The only downer is the headphones, but it seems all these units come with poor ones.  I bought a set of $20 buds ("JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Buds for iPod (Black)") along with this , and they work better and aren't painful to wear.

<Content>I've been waiting for awhile for the Sansa e200 series' prices to come down since they were released in 2006. It's tough to beat the features offered by Sansa e280, including FM radio and voice recorder not to mention the music and video players. Using the media converter is a bit of a hassle to add photos and videos, but still more user friendly than iPod/iTunes combo.   Few nits to pick: availability of accessories are slim as Sansa never came close to being the iPod Nano killer. There aren't enough protective skins available in the market. The "new" non Liquidmetal back case isn't as elegant as original Liquidmetal case. The included lanyard looks nice enough but the metal collar is in the perfect spot to scratch the display so I took it off after the first day.

<Title>Sansa E280 mp-3 player/FM radio
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros:  Small size, 8GB internal memory, 2GB extra with micro-SD card, video capable, FM radio, price (around $150).  Free 2 month Rhaphsody full membership. I have enjoyed mine since July 07 (6 months).  I'm a novice at mp3s, but found my way around without a problem.  If you want reliable, small player with a built in FM radio (a necessity for me), look hard at this model.  Pages are easy to navigate, long battery life between recharges.  Cons:  Earbuds provided are horribly uncomfortable.  Buy a $10 cushioned set.  I also went "wireless" by buying a Logitech (black (mp3), not white (IPOD)) transmitter and headphones for about $30 off Ebay. Small transmitter attaches to top of player and reaches about 30 feet.    Main negatives are about Raphsody, which is tied to Sansa like ITunes is to IPOD.  Rhaphsody service is a bit hard to use.  Everything you download will turn to dust after the 2 month free period unless you purchase the songs or sign up for monthly service at $15.  I bought a few at 89 cents then quit.  I can still plug in for free and pay 99 cents a song now.  Not a great selection on older songs (50s, 60s especially).    Other Comments:  Accessories are a bit expensive through Sansa, so recommend Ebay pack which contains: plug for playing in car over FM radio, hard rubber cover, AC charger and car charger, another USB charger for computer, arm band, all for about $25. Overall, I would buy the Sansa E280 again and highly recommend it!

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>SIMPLE USE Out of the box this mp3 player was not in MSC mode, so it took me a bit to figure out that I needed to switch it.  As soon I did, my computer recognized it as removable memory and I could simply drag mp3s from my computer onto the mp3 player.  This is one of the reasons I bought the mp3 player.  Since I have a computer at home and at work, it is nice to be able to just drag over a couple songs at a time.    The menu is easy to use, and it is straightforward to get an mp3 playing.  The buttons around the wheel are hard to push (I hope sandisk reads a few of these online reviews when coming out with the next version) but after you get used to them, they don't really hinder the functionality.  The earphones are your typical uncomfortable earbuds, but sound fine.  EXTRA FEATURES FM Radio:  Actually works quite well, and you can record it! (though I'm not sure why I ever would want to do that)  Voice recorder:  Easy to use and works great, though I haven't found a use for it...but I see voice recorders on sale in Radio Shack, so someone must need them.  Video playback:  Since you cannot output video to a TV, this feature is not that great.  I haven't watched any TV shows or anything like that on my Sansa though, so I'm probably not qualified to comment  Picture playback:  I easily put quite a few pictures on my Sansa with the included transfer utility and have shown them to a few people.  The screen is not that much smaller than a digital camera LCD, so if you think of it like that, it's not too bad!  The pictures look pretty good, but you have to be realistic about the size of the screen...if you want a large beautiful screen to watch videos and view pictures...get a Zune or something.  Conclusion:  I tried to write all of the bad things I could about this player, just so people know what they're getting in to, but overall I am extremely pleased with it (hence the four stars, which should be 4.4, but I rounded).  For what it is (an mp3 player) it is great.  The video and photo playback are fun little extras, but not a big selling point.  I highly recommend this player to anyone looking for a flash-based mp3 player.  ONE MORE THING... removable memory is cool...if 8 GB isn't enough for you, then you can throw another 2GB in (as soon as the price on microSD cards comes down a bit :)

<Title>Good Player - crappy material
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When will these MP3 player companies stop making the front of their players out of this shiny shellacked surface which is easily scratched? Likely an adult would not have as much of a problem, but my 13 year old scratched the heck out of the front of his after a week by having it in his pocket. The scratches are not deep gouges, but are rather more a haze of scratches making the surface over the LCD more opaque. I would have to say that a case is a must have.

<Title>Great MP3 Player, cheaper and more functions to IPOD
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think I've seen a 8GB nano, but it's twice as expensive as this one, whith less features. The recording function, along w/ FM radio, and video features are very nice. The downside to this is that it's a little bit of a pain to make playlists since you have to use media player to do it and sync it and transporting video files is slow and cumbersome and the files don't always work. However, it's still the best mp3 player out on the market.

<Title>Better than the I-Pod??
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Better than the I-Pod?? Well I have yet to find a reason not to make such an outlandish claim!! Well it has an extremely neat user friendly wheel that accesses everything in the menu with one thumb! Sweeeet!!! But so does the IPod. A wonderful screen that is bright colorful as well as a crisp and clean presentation. Yes, I am positive this aspect is better than the IPod. Sound, now I have to say I was almost detered by the fact that a couple of reviews I read said that the sound was poor and had a distinct fuzzy static. To this I say there are too many professional reviewers that get Apple/MAC/I-Pod kick backs for bad mouthing their competitors. I have not found that as a matter a fact I have played this MP3 player, through my Yamaha receiver and bose speakers and DAMNED if my buddies have not asked me if it was direct from a CD and not a compacted music file! So I am very pleased. But here is where I-Pod is equal to Sandisk they both sound really good! Now Price, right off the bat Sandisk is cheaper and has more functions (Very clear FM radio, easily add more memory with a card). Now one of the huge selling points is this is a sturdy product that I have dropped several times on the concrete and it playse like the very first day I bought it. But the fact that you are not tied in to using the Apple backed media "ONLY" as you do on an I-Pod product is a huge win for a rebbel like myself who likes his own freedom of choice. So don't listen to my review or anyone else for that matter this is a damned good product and I dare you to do a side by side comparrison on your own. Don't beleive the hype learn for yourself! I have given my I-Pod Shuffle and Nano to my kids this little puppy replaces them both at a better price and sturdier product. Ohh did I mention you can change batteries yourself just by removing 4 screws?? WIN WIN!!

<Title>Sansa e280 v2 purchase
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Thanks for the posts.  They proved helpful prior to the purchase of this unit.  This mp3 player is quite a gem.  First, update the firmware on your new device at the sandisk site to get yourself the MSC option, (to act like a USB device)then grab the sandisk video converter to play your videos.  Oh, and read the .pdf owners manual that comes with the firmware update.  The v2 posts caused some apprehension when I read some of the prior posts, but the latest firmware upgrade solves these issues, in my estimation.  For what you get here, you won't regret your purchase.  The earbuds won't fit your ears very well, unless you have ear canals the size of a Greyhound bus.  But hey, prior posts gave a heads up to the earbud issue.

You can copy music from the player to your computer which is great if you have many computers like I do.  The player has a fast startup and perfect sound quality.  The headphones that come with it are cheap low-quality little earbuds.  I picked up a nice pair of logitech noise cancelling headphones to go with it.

<Title>The best MP3 player all around for every need
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a lot of research prior to purchasing an MP3 player.  I wanted one that fits my needs...capable of holding a lot of music, something I could walk to work with and play at the office, easy to navigate and download music onto(as I am technologically challenged!) I decided on the 8GB and have been more than happy with my purchase.  It resembles the iPod,is  highly compatible, more durable, has many more functions than it's competitor, and significantly cheaper.  I was initially disappointed to see that the majority of accessories made for MP3 players were for iPods.  The Sandisk is very compatible with most of the iPod accessories, however, Sansa has it's own line of Sansa Sandisk accessories and they are have become more easily accessible.  I purchased a protector through Amazon (iPod covers won't work) for a very fair price.  I can utilize my computer speakers at work or my car/home system with a FM transmitter to play my Sandisk.  I have no complaints with this product...only compliments.  So much that I purchased 1GB's for my 7 and 9 year old daughters and my husband who is a cyclist and runner.  They are so affordable (Amazon has the best price I have found anywhere) and easy to use.  I would buy again!

I have about 6gb of music, some pictures and a movie on it now.   So why do I call this the ups and downs of sansa?  This is because the written information that comes with the sansa is pretty poor. As a result I have had to contact sansa support several times in order to get things to work.   I find that the email support is not very useful.  The saving grace here is that the direct phone support is extremely helpful and as a result I have been able to make the best use of this product.   The only other down side is that there are many more accessories for the ipod than for the sansa, but I feel this will be resolved in a short time.

<Title>Great Alternative to the Restrictive Ipod
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa e200 line is extremely versatile, Unlike the overly popular Ipod.  The e200 line is a great Mp3 player, but also runs Movies, stores Photos, has an FM Radio, and Voice Recording.  You would need several different Ipods and a hand full of add-ons to get this out of apple.  The e200 line is sleak...  With a long 1.5 inch screen viewing movies and photos is simple, with suprisingly good resolution.  The device itself is slightly thicker than the Ipod Nano, but still small enough to fit easily in your pocket.  The lighted (blue) scroll wheel makes it easy to navigated in the dark.  The Best Part of the Sansa e200...   You can add music from any source!  You are not restricted to an iTunes clone, or any other music software.  Windows Media Player can be used to sync the device (ala Ipod), but you can drag and drop files into it like a USB drive!  Super simple.  It would have gotten five stars but... The buttons around the scroll wheel can be a little difficult to press, but that is over come with use.  Turning the player on and off is not instantaneous, it can take a few seconds to reach the main menu (and the closer the device is to being full the longer the start up time).  The Go List (the on the fly playlist) is a little buggy, scrolling through a large Go List can take a long time. Also, Photos and Videos have to be put into a special codex by software included with the player, not a big complaint but the software can be a little confusing.  The e200 line beats out Apple in many ways, but easiest to see...   Price: the 8gb Sandisk = $184.99 on amazon, the 8gb Nano = $229.99.  Plus the e200 has a microSD expansion slot, making up to an extra 2gb of memory available.  That bumps the 8gb Sandisk to 10gb! For almost $50 less!  I'm very happy with mine, go get you own!

<Title>E280 Review
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>E280 review  PROS  This player has a lot of features: -FM Radio -Voice Recording -FM Recording -Standard mp3 player functionality -Picture Playback -Video Playback -Good screen size for the device size, good brightness, and resolution -Very good Pricepoint for features and storeage capacity   CONS  My main problem with this device is the software and the way it automatically organizes mp3 files.  You CAN technically drag and drop folders of music over to the device in explorer... HOWEVER, when you start the player up, the files will NOT be organized how they were when you transferred the folders over.  My iPod Nano did the same thing, and I was pretty dissapointed about that. Eventually I got over it and made my own playlists which leads to the next problem.  The Rhapsody Software to make playlists and transfer music is not even as good as iTunes, and I didn't even like iTunes that well...  -First of all, the Transfer speed for adding and deleting songs on the e280 is quite a bit slower than the Nano averaging 3-4 seconds per song instead of ~1 second per song. I was miffed that it actually took time to DELETE songs. Whether this is a software problem, or hardware I do not know. My guess would be the memory speed is slower than the Nano, which is one reason they price is cheaper   My other grips with Rhapsody include the fact that you can search within your library for songs/artists/albums, but you cannot search within your player. This makes things a huge pain when you're looking for a particular artist, song, or album to delete because you have to sort through 1000+ songs manually to find it while iTunes does let you search within your mp3 player.  And finally... I cannot even get Rhapsody to work AT ALL right now. I try to start it up, and it just freezes right when I get to the main interface. I've tried restarting, unistalling and reinstalling the software and it still won't work.  Conclusion: Decent hardware with lots of features for the price, but the software and song organization is very limiting and frustrating.

If you need help SanDisk customer support is very courteous educated, fast and easy. Who needs an iPod for more money and less of everything else?  One note: If you do not need to update the firmware maybe you should not update? If it works how it is why do it? Nothing to gain yet unless you use certain accessories. I have read some reports on the internet that convinced me not to upgrade the firmware unless needed. I am using 1.02.12A without a hint of trouble.

<Title>mtp vs. mrc
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good enough sounding unit but the controls are a little hard to use  (unless you have really small fingers) probably the price for being so small. I had problems with mtp mode / Rhapsody. After a rhapsody download, the rest of my music (loaded from cd) could no longer be located by the unit. the files were still there -  you just couldn't see or play them. I switched to mrc mode and discontinued Rhapsody and now everthing seems to be working fine.

<Title>Very good ipod  alternative......with one minor flaw
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had this player for about three days now. im not exaggerating when I say this is one amazing little device. it can do everything the ipod nano can do and more. I know some of the reviewers here have raved about the rhapsody service. I have tried the service and its decent enough, I just dont like using anything having to do with real networks. I switched to MTV's "urge" service and im very happy with it as it works seamlessly with WMP 11 and it likes my player. id also like to say that the volume reaches very high levels and im certainly glad about that. Now so far, ive encountered one moderate con with this device. Using the player one is able to rate songs when they are played. This feature is good because one will be able to make a "high rated playlist" in the future should one want to. Unfortunately, whenever I have used the rating feature, the player freezes anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds. The song still plays, but user control is completly frozen. After about 10 to 15 seconds, the player returns to normal. I called Sandisk tech support and the person I was connected with told me he never heard of such an issue, but would forward this to their research deptartment. He mentioned that maybe the Sansa needed to be formatted. I highly doubt mine needs to be being that I have only had it for less then a week. Now, in the grand scheme of things, this one flaw is minor as it only happens when I decide to rate a song. Other then the above said problem, this device is worth every penny.

<Content>This device is user friendly and has all of the features one could ever want from an MP3 player.  Good price. Excellent sound and video quality.  Battery life is sufficient. Improvements I would suggest are: smoother scrolling wheel (iPod is easier to use), better supporting software (support for POD casts and sources for video), accessory selection and availability is sparse.

<Title>Best for the money
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After a lot of looking and shopping around, it was the best for the money at the time (Christmas 2006) through Amazon.  Pros 1)Has a great battery life 2)Lots of memory built in and able to use a memory card for more. 3)Small Size and still able to have pictures and videos. 4) Firmware update easy 5) Radio with record  Cons 1) Not much control(Add/Delete/Move/rename etc..)if not connected to computer through USB 2) Not so user friendly. Having not much experience making playlists, it took a lot to try and organize some of my files also setting up slideshows was hard for me to figure out.  Overall, Very Happy with it after learning curve and getting it configured.

<Content>I put alot of time into researching mp3 players and what really sold me on the sansa brand was the opinion of Best Buy and Radio Shack sales staff who said stay away form Ipod and go with sansa.  The reasons given were low cost compared to all its features and that they had seen so few come back with issues.  I liked mine so much I bought my husband one. Radio tuner comes in great while working out and watching the tube, its a great solid little machine.

<Content>I love the product. It is simple to download songs or pictures and it's my first MP3. Sound is very good. The earbuds are fine but easy to break. The only complaint is that this 8mg is not going to store anything like 2000 songs. 464 songs loaded and less than 2mg is left. The controls are ok and the look is great. The screen is good for the small size. I bought another one for my daughter because I have not seen anything better. I don't expect to use the video and have not tried it.

<Title>Great Player!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player on impulse last week at Circuit City because it was on sale and was going to return it but I'm glad I changed my mind.  It feels nice in my hand and the sound is great.  I didn't like the earbuds that came with the player but I bought a pair of $20 Phillips earphones that are much more comfortable.   This Sansa is loaded with features, it has an FM radio tuner and it comes in really clear.  You can also record voice messages to yourself or record from the radio.  It's so easy to transfer music to the player I just drag and drop the songs from my computer to the Sansa.  I like having the freedom of using whatever music downloading system I want or none at all.  I'm very happy with this purchase, much cheaper and more features than the iPod Nano.  I highly recommend the Sansa.

<Content>I compared the sansa with I-Pod and it was close when it came to options/function.  However, the Sansa won hands down when it came to flexibility.  I've loaded it with videos and it works flawlessly.  I've sync'd it with Rhapsody and have over 2000 songs and several music channels that I've picked loaded on this device.  The music channels update automatically everytime I open Rhaphsody.  I love this online service and this device.  The two are a perfect combo.  Battery life is terrific.  You won't be sorry if you choose this over the I-Pod. Good Luck.

<Title>Good for music, FM, voice recording, Bad for video
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> I bought this 8G player at Amazon in Thanksgiving during its sale. The first thing that I noticed when I opened the package was that there were not an installation CD and a user manual. So I called Sandisk support asking for an installation CD and a lanyard. Their service team responded quickly and said it's going to be mailed out in a week. The next day, I asked them for a web link to download their Media Converter, since without this piece of software, I can't watch any video (details below). However, 2~3 days later I received an email notifying me that a lanyard was mailed out. I was worried about that they missed the installation CD and emailed back immediately about the CD. They told me it's included in the USPS mail. Unfortunately, when I finally got an envelop severl days later, there was only one lanyard. I had to ask them again for the installation CD, and this time, they didn't respond to me at all and closed the ticket. I thought about returning this player, but on a second thought, making my own CD by coping the downloaded Media Converter might save me lot of hassle of dealing with it. So I ended up making my own CD and began to play with this MP3 player. The following is what I found about it.  As an MP3 player, it plays well. Although the earset coming with it is not a high quality, it's good enough for enjoying most of songs. For music, you might need a better earplug. Its multiple functionalities, like FM, voice recording, work very well too. Voice recording is a must function to my sister, and I think this is a good choice for voice recording.  The most disappointing part is the video. First of all, you can not just copy a video file onto it. It simply doesn't play and reminds you to transfer the video with the Media Converter. In order to play, you have to transfer a video to the player by using the Sandisk Media Converter. Copying and converting using the Media Converter is much slower than direct copying, and it takes a while to transfer a 700M video. If you want to watch a video, the best way is to start copying before you go to bed, and it'll be ready the next morning when you get up.  Second, the Media Converter is pretty crapy. It seems to be single threaded program. When you copy a video to the player with it, you can't do anything with the player and the software until it's done. You can't play music, listen to radio etc. If you copy a video during the daytime, you have to wait until it's done.  Third, the little screen is not of good quality. Its brightness is so low that you can't almost see anything on the screen daytime outside. I tried to watch a movie while waiting a campus shuttle in a cloudy day. Although there was not sunshine, and I turned my body to the north, I couldn't see clearly what's on the screen. I can only watch the video inside a build or a room where the daylight is gone. However, once you're inside, you'll probably don't need to watch such a tiny screen; you have other better video sources.  Forth, even you can watch a video indoor, you have to look into the screen within a very narrow angle. Once you lean awry a little bit, the motion picture simply disappears. The screen is such a bad quality.  To make watching a video worse, the entire front of the player is glazed. It appears attractive, but it's a disaster for watching a movie on the screen. I can see the inflection of my face in the glaze while watching a movie. It's like you watch the CRT screen of a TV with a light next to you. You can see the light and yourself on the TV screen.  Another thing that harms watching a video is the lighting wheel. The control wheel lights up when you touch a button, which is nice without watching a movie. However, when you watch a movie on the screen, since the screen brightness is so low, when you touch any button, the wheel lights up, the light is bright enough to make the motion picture blur. It's like someone puts a bright light in front of your CRT TV screen.  My observation is that this player is good for non-video playing. It isn't worth buying it if you want to enjoy watching video. It's simply not made for watching video on that glazed outside, dark inside, and narrow angle screen with nearby disattractions. Better for the money, is a decent MP3 player without video support.  It looks like ZuiMei has a better screen, but I've never tried that. Anyone has an opinion on the alternative?

<Title>Value and Quality only on the rise.
<Date>Sat Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, the fact that Sansa's e200 series beats the nano seems to have been pretty well covered by other reviewers, so whether you agree or not, those aspects of the player I will not go over again. (i.e. replacable battery, fm tuner, playlist/equalizer options)  Second, as mentioned by many other reviewers as well, is the price.  If one is to look upon the market trends as indication of direction of price point,  I submit to you that Costco featured the 8 gb, e280 unit not too long ago at 80 dollars.  While this was a black Friday ad, the fact that Costco had far more than sufficient stock to cover sales throughout the whole weekend, suggests not only that Costco is likely  to feature it again at a similar if not identically reduced price point, but that the unit itself is capable of being and has already been sold at significantly reduced prices to accommodate market fluctuations, such as those accompanying large sale dates.  Third, despite its already sufficiently competitive if not superior nature to its I-pod equivalents, the unit shows significantly faster progression and potential for improvement.  To be honest, the first e200's to hit the market, hit it with more than a few kinks it still needed to work out (referring particularly to firmware issues). However, since its release continuous and rapid improvement of these same features have not ceased.  The firmware has continued to be updated, each update improving on primary issues such as earlier complaints of background noise (now nonexistent with current firmware and hardware versions), boot-time, compatability, etc.  On this last point, of particular need of mentioning, is the existence of an unofficial producer of a public sector firmware (The programming that is responsible for the user interface, amongst other things, think windows for the computer) known as "Rockbox," and the release of E200 V2's which boasts new hardware and new potential.  Rockbox - an open source firmware available for several mp3 players, seeks to improve and maximize the potential of mp3 units in areas such as file format support, applications, and utilities amongst others.  More than anything, the amazing capabilities of this firmware testifies to the  potential of future improvements on the sansa's.  The Rockbox patch as of November 2007 available for the Sansa boasted the following.  - capable of full support for file formats not originally supported like mpg and H264  - Capable of installation of applications such as stopwatch and text readers.  - a plethora of games ranging from a fully playable port of Doom to Gameboy rom's.    - Themes which can change the look of the browsing screen to look like windows start menu, and mp3 playing screen to look like a windows media player screen, or one of dozens of other looks (one even will make it look like the ipod album cover scroller style).  - whatever the people working on rocbox decide to put on it.  E200 v2 - beginning as early as august of 2007, reports of e200's with new hardware versions hitting the sales floor began.  After sifting through the initial confusion of those to whom the upgrade held primary significance (the people attempting to run rockbox), the following can be said. - The version 2 (v2) is not as of December 14, 2007 compatible with rock box.  (if you wish to install rockbox look for the older models usually packaged in a green and white box rather than the blue/black box of v2's) - The v2 is somewhat of a hybrid of earlier e200/e200r(rhapsody) models, in that it fully features the seamless rhapsody DNA that allows it to carry rhapsody channels (a service available with subscription that allows you to download random music of certain genres on your player for as long as your subscription continues) and allows for faster transfer of music via rhapsody. - the v2 has different hardware including but not limited to a new chip (a3525 instead of the previous PP5024, a portal player chip from the same company that has provided chips to companies such as I-pod and motorola)   The new chip actually features faster processing potential.  (as indicated by faster boot times which were already improving through firmware update)  So in the end, while rockbox is not yet ported to the v2's, if past progress is any indication of future direction, it is my opinion that the sansa will only increase it's already promising superiority over the i-pods and other mp3 units for that matter.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the 2nd 8GB Sansa player I have purchased and I am very pleased with the product (first one for myself; 2nd one for my wife).  One thing I hadn't tried before was to use a microdisc to store some music on.  I did so to store all my Christmas music on -- that way, when Christmas is over, I just remove the disk and store it away 'til next year.  Saving to the microdisc was easy.  THE ONE DRAWBACK was I thought that if I wanted to listen JUST to Christmas music, I could play JUST the songs on the microdisk.  No can do!  The player, upon booting up, integrates the music on the microdisk to the main player's list.  One way around some of that was that much of the music was then listed under the "Christmas" Genre, so I could play just that genre and it helped.  However, not all the Christmas songs ended up under that genre, though most did.  Seemed like an engineering design flaw to me -- I would think that it would be nice to save different categories on different microdisks that one would be able to play, without having to go through the lengthy making of a "Go" list.  Other than that, though, I couldn't be more pleased with the player.  Easy to use; works great.   I did have problems with the first player I bought for myself, but Sansa was very helpful and quick both on phone and through email to help solve the problems -- and, when in the end, they could not solve one problem I was having, was very efficient in the return and replacing of the product.

<Content>The Sandisk Sansa is easily better then the Apple Nano in price and features,  offering users FM radio, add on Memory and easy battery replacement. Apple just does not seem to care to offer these features even though they are offered in every other player out there. The 8 Gig model makes a great player even better and the price is just below the high end Nano. The Sansa works fine with Media Player and the ability to add music directly makes it even easier to use then previous models. The only beef I have is the lack of an AM player which would give it the A+ it deserves. Good job Sandisk and lets hope we get a Sansa with 20+ GB memory...

<Title>I'm completely satisfied
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this MP3 player for a few weeks now, and it has done everything I could possibly ask for.  My music is mostly Vinyl recorded into my PC and cleaned up in Sonic Foundry's (Sony now) Sound Forge with Vinyl Restoration, then converted over to MP3 format.  I download very little music, so synchronization with a service isn't an issue for me.   The ability to transfer files via MSC mode and the systems usage of the ID3 tags make management of my music within the unit very easy to set up as well as to navigate.    I've had no trouble at all with the controls.    I will say that the manual is a bit cryptic in places and expects you to know certain information that is not provided, but all in all I find everything in the unit's menus to be straight forward and easy enough for a first timer with an MP3 player.  The ability to place music directly onto and SD micro and exchange them is an added bonus.  I have one SD for classical and one for Jazz so far.     Definitely very satisfied.

If you're looking for more media versatility (FM tuner, video) from your MP3 player, this is a great choice.  Purchase the inexpensive 4+1 skin, arm band, car charger and home charger for more flexibility.

<Title>Great Buy!!!
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is everything it is advertised as.   The diplay is crystal clear and bright. I had to turn the display DOWN because it was so bright. Even in the sunlight I only have it set to 2. And we're talking desert sun here!   Music loading is a breeze. I have Windows Media Player 11 and have had no problems syncing with the e280. Switching music is just a matter of going in and erasing and then dropping more mp3's in. I had 1GB of music on it within 10 min of plugging it in!   Not sure about capacity. The manual says you can put about 2000 WMA or 1000 MP3's on the e280 (at avg 4 min song length). Everything of mine is in mp3 so I can't say for certain whether it's true or not. And then I have whole CDs in mine, so that really messes up the song count. Mine is telling me that I have 581 songs with a little over 1GB remaining. Alot of that would be due to the fact that I have several 40-60 min symphonies in there! LOL  Music playback is pretty good. Finding what you want to listen to is a snap if you have your ID3 tags set up right. If not (like me) it can be a pain. I have since corrected that though!!! Sound is good. The volume is plenty loud. I can drown out the music in the gym with it, standing next to the speaker and not even have it turned up all the way. The best setting is Custom, I think. The other settings can sound a little canned at times. Especially with the dynamics of classical. But with the Custom you can set what sounds best to YOU.  The FM radio is a nice touch. Haven't really used it though.   The Voice Recorder is the best feature yet. It picks up sounds across the room easily. And it has a button on the side that will override anything you are playing or doing. Takes a second to start recording, but it starts automatically.   Haven't tried it with any online music sources. I already have 12 GB of music on my PC, so I haven't needed to.   It does play video too, but I haven't tried that yet.  Other than that, it's a great buy. You won't be disappointed.

<Title>Spend the extra money and get an IPOD NANO
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Im currently waiting for my THIRD Sansa e280.  The first one never worked correctly, retuned it to SanDisk, got a new one which worked great for about a month and then froze and could not be reset.  Waiting on yet another new player to be sent to me.  Hopefully the third one is a charm.  Don't have any experience with the Nano, but it has to be better than this.

<Title>Great device, sounds better than my iPod, but the GUI isn't as easy as the iPod's
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The sound (lower end) is better than my 60GB photo ipod (4G).  The device's max volume isn't anywhere near that of the iPod (stupidly loud device, which is not a bad thing) but definitely not a weak device -- I've rarely had to use it above 3/4 to bring low-gain audio up to normal listening volume.  The customizable EQ works great and allows you to tweak the sound to personal taste -- something I regret my iPod cannot do. All around a fantastic sounding device with good volume.  Battery life is really good and just about at what Sandisk quotes -- I've not had any problem going several days of use without charging.  The battery does not drain noticeably when left off for extended periods (a week or so).    The video feature is O.K., but I don't really think video on a screen this small is really ideal. The screen is really vibrant and bright so video/pics will not look washed out.    The GUI is fairly easy to use, but navigating the menus are not as straight forward as the iPod's. Nothing earth-shaking -- it's a good system and works fine -- just takes a little adjustment time if you're used to the iPod.  The only gripe I have with the device is the lag from turning it on and actually being able to use it -- about 5 -7 seconds!  Don't know why it's not instant-on, instant-use (flash based device after all..) but it's not really that big of a deal, just kinda odd...  The replaceable battery is a great feature and having removed the back cover to see how difficult the replacement might be, found battery replacement drop-dead simple.  unscrew back cover, remov old battery, drop in new one, re-screw back cover. DONE! Apart from the screws, this is like replacing the battery in a cell phone.  For the price it's a fantatic player with a bevy of features!

<Content>Sansa e280 appears to be a very well featured product.  I looked at many mp3 and mp4 players, and this one appears to be superior in features, has a good price, and most importantly, is very well built.  I examined the Meizu player, but for the price, the Sansa seems better and more solidly constructed

<Title>Bought this player in February, no longer working in November
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item largely based on the good experience I had with an older Sandisk model (non-Sansa) which was stolen, and also the terrific reviews it has received here on Amazon. This is one time I've been steered wrong. Please note that many of the reviewers give their opinion after only a short time of owning this product. Well, I purchased this product at the end of February this year (2007) and it functioned - with various frustrations - until the end of November of this year.  My first frustration with this product was that it came with the Rhapsody player, in which I had no interest, and which I could not remove from the player even after my "trial period" ended. Much of the advice I found online for taking Rhapsody off (largely based on earlier models) did not work for this player. Despite my attempts to format the player, Rhapsody remained programmed onto the player, taking up about a gigabyte of space.  As another reviewer here noted, this unit does take a very long time to boot up. Of course, I have a friend who has a 30GB IPOD, and it takes about a second for that player to boot up, so I will leave it up to you to decide whether that is really a matter of the storage capacity. Additionally, when I connected the player to my computer, it did not show up as another drive, but as another item which I could not format or manipulate as easily.   I found the battery life to be rather acceptable, the sound quality was decent, although the FM tuner was quite weak. The design of the actual unit is quite durable, however, the screen is prone to scratches. It was fairly decent to use with Windows Media Player, but I found it difficult to organize the music in an order that I chose - it tended to load in a sort of alphabetical order (same as the old player, but with more grief).  In the past few weeks I stopped being able to sync new songs to the player. I was able to empty it, as several of the tracks were being skipped for some reason. But I was not able to write on it again, and it now freezes every time I try to connect the machine.   My old Sandisk was very easy to use and worked well for over a year until it was stolen. I paid about $200 for this product only 8 months ago, thinking I would get an even better product from the same manufacturer. I now feel as though I have wasted my money. I cannot in honesty recommend this product.   UPDATE: If you didn't find this review helpful, I would appreciate it if you could comment on exactly why. I strove to be as accurate as possible in my review, which were based on my experiences over the course of a few months. If there was something lacking in my review I would appreciate candid - though polite - feedback on what it was. If you found the review helpful and wish to comment, please also do so! Thank you.

<Title>good travelling companion
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have never had an MP3 player before, but I was planning a long bus trip and decided I needed something to keep me entertained.  I found the SanDisk SDMX4 loaded with my music and pod cast an excellent way to pass the time.  I chose this particular MP3 player for a number of reasons.  The 8 Gig size, the FM tunner, the estimated 20 hour play time and a price well below Apple products.  There are some things that I wish were better.  I found the ear buds uncomfortable, I would have liked a "scan for station" feature on the tunner.  Finally, I found it more difficult then necessary to load things on it from my computer.  For example, I wanted to put a picture of my family on there to be able to show people, but I had to mess around with several program to get a picture that visible.  Nevertheless I am not sorry that I got it.

<Title>screen too fragile
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This my 2nd Sansa that I purchased because of the over sensitive screen. If breathe on the screen the wrong way it will crack, even if you the protective covering. It takes too long to upload to your PC. It worked fairly decent. Hope fully Sansa will do something about the screen. It should not crack if you have the unit in your pocket unless you hit it with a hammer or something. I will wait until the Zune 8 GB go on sale on amazon. Right now it runs about $180.00, but in Feb, March it will be around the low $100's.

<Content>Had the San Disc e280 for a week and am enjoying it more than I ever did my 30 GB ipod. I am not very skilled when it comes to using new technology, but this unit is EASY to use when downloading on line music or from CD's. Best of all, when you call for tech. help from SanDisc, you actually get a person who will help you and cared about their product and that you were happy with it. The e280 is as advertised and more. The FM radio is very clear and a nice addition. When I download music to Windows Media Player and connect e280, it's on the e280 faster than you can imagine. If you're looking for a great product, get this one. I don't think you'll be sorry. I buy Amazon MP3 downloads and have had NO trouble. Take advantage of the free downloads you get with this e280 as well as the free downloads Amazon offers daily. Good deal.

<Content>I've had this player for a couple weeks now and I love it.  You can use media player to organize your music or just drag and drop.  I uploaded pictures and a movie onto it just to test and while you have to use their converting software it really was not a big deal.  I recommend getting better earbuds.  While these are not that bad I think the sound would be much better with higher quality ones.  I also recommend getting the travel kit and use the plastic screen saver & leather holder.  It cushions falls and protects the screen.

<Title>Good MP3: defective earphones
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The MP3 was fine. The earphones were defective. One side didn't work. Two calls to SanDisk were fruitless. They said the earphones were an accessory and not covered under warranty. But if they could find some they would send them. That was 7 weeks ago and no response despite another call getting the same response. The earphones came with the player, had Sansa name on them and are needed to use the player. So I bought another set of earphones. Pretty disappointed with a company with such a good reputation for quality products.

<Title>A great idea, but horribly executed.
<Date>Tue Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1.	The mechanical scroll wheel on this unit is hard to maneuver. One cannot make a full circle without readjusting, taking off and repositioning, the finger because the wheel is not very smooth, so it constantly stops when too much, or too little, pressure is applied. Which in turn makes it very difficult to quickly scroll through thousands of albums or songs or artists in search of that one particular file. The wheel itself has grip marks that feel very harsh on one's finger.  2.	System noise, a concept unfamiliar to I-Pod owners, can clearly be heard when starting a new song. It's an annoying surge like sound heard in the earpiece. A clear indicator that the unit lacks proper electronic refinement. 3.	The FM tuner is useful yet one cannot scroll through presets. You have to select the preset from a separate list of presets rather then from the main tuner screen.  4.	The center button feels like a cheap and loose piece of "about to fall out" plastic. 5.	The 4 buttons outside the wheel are too close to the wheel itself. The wheel is elevated a bit and unless you use your nails, or have very thin, super thin, fingers, it is hard to push the button without pushing the wheel. Basically, the buttons are too close to the wheel and are both too narrow and non-responsive to normal pressure. You will need both hands to get it right. 6.	Takes too long to start-up because of the refresh feature. The unit refreshes its memory every time it starts while there is a memory chip inserted.  7.	The video feature works well, but a separate conversion process is required before videos can be viewed.  8.	The earphones are the kind you get on cheap flights. 9.	The screen is prone to rainbow effects.

<Title>Good while it lasted - Warranty comes in handy...
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this Sansa8GB in mid Novermber, 2006.  Because I was looking for a flash player that plays my MP3 and wma collection, is not overwhelmed by proprietary licensing (ipod), and could withstand major activity.  Functionally it did:  my sansa has been sweated on at the gym, ran with on 5 mile runs, biked with in 40 mile rides, snowboarded with at -10 degrees and 13000 feet, and it still worked...even at altitiude and with snow on it!     Unfortunatley, it's demise was internal as the firmware got corrupted it could not be refreshed even with the help of Tech support.  I am being sent a new one under warranty so hopefully we don't get the same software bugs. We'll see how it goes...if this one craps out as well, I cannot recommend this player due to the software issues. Besides that, it is a functional player and is physically sturdy - wheel is fine, presets can be better managed (but I'm sure the next firmware can resolve this), logical and intuitive, and there's enough accessories and home-made programs to address issues....That's the cool thing about non-proprietary...you can get programmer geeks to release useful upgrades and other useful playlist programs...

<Title>Good Features.  Good Price.
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa is a very good MP3 player with respectable features and enough storage space for those who don't have 10,000 songs.  I have found that the Rhapsody software to be lacking in functionality particularly when syncing with the player.  Playlists that I initially created on the Sansa would not appear on the device via Rhapsody manager, and a number of songs I purchased from Musicmatch wouldn't copy over while others would.  Windows Media Player works much better.  Features are good, but I found that even though you can set the date and time, the date is never shown and the time only appears when you are not playing music.  There's plenty of screen space to put these things and even my old Rio Cali had the versatility to show them.  Another minor downside is the lack of accessories.  While iPod accents and cases are virtually everywhere, Sansa cases are relatively non-existent.  eBay and Amazon have the best selection since you probably won't find any at Walmart or Target.  Overall the player is well worth the price for those who want to save $50 or $60 over an equivalent iPod Nano.

<Title>Good but be aware...
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The sansa e280 isnt a bad choice for an mp3 player because unlike the ipod nano, you can remove the battery by yourself(Although I haven't tried it) and overall its pretty good for its price but there are a few things you should be aware of. These things aren't necessarily bad because other mp3 players might be the same and might not be much different but you should take these things into condsideration before buying it.  1. When it comes to photos and videos, the name will appear the way the actual file is named on the computer. So it's not like music where the file name can be GoD's PrOJeCt and on the mp3 player it says God's Project. The way it appears on the file name is the way it will appear on the screen.  2. Unlike the photos, you can't have seperate albums for your videos so you'll have to name your videos in a way that will organize them. So if you want all your rock videos in a section you could put a 1 in front of the name, then your rnb videos with a 2 in front of the name so that you don't have to scroll up or down and all over the place to find the videos you're looking for.  3. Because you can't fastforward or "scan" like in your songs, it'd be wise to NOT have a compilation of videos into one. This usually only happens with reggaeton videos where they'll show like two or three songs from the album on that one video alone. I haven't tried movies yet as their resolution is too high and it takes to long to cut them into parts but if you must, don't put the whole thing in one clip.  4. Unlike the videos which are formatted in the best way to fit the screen, the photos can be put in in different angles. If you want to get the pictures to fit the screen the best way possible, change their angle so its a standing rectangle just like the screen. It will fill most of the screen and you'll be able to see your pictures better.  5. There is a recorder for voice and FM but be aware, it won't sound as good as when you're recording the song you hear on the radio. This meaning you can't record, send to computer, turn into mp3, send back to sansa, and hear it with same quality sound. It's not totally useless as you can keep the recording until you find the name of the artist and/or song or you can understand the lyrics enough to find the name of the song. Hopefully in the future we'll be able to record the song from the radio and hear it with the same quality as when we were recording it but until then, use this as a way to find what you're looking for.  6. It can and will freeze. Don't worry it won't freeze that often but from time to time it will. I haven't found a way to fix it or unfreeze it so until then, take your time, pause what you're listening to before you change it, and just try not to do too much at one time.  7. Videos and photos are formatted to fit the screen on the sansa so it's not like you can put the photos and videos in, and then copy them back to the computer and see them with the same quality as the original file so keep the original files somewhere like a dvd disk in data mode which will hold more than 70 mb of space.  8. The buttons around the wheel may be hard to reach. Even I that I have skinny fingers, have a little trouble pressing those buttons. It's still better than the ipod where its hard to stop where you want it to so maybe they'll make the buttons wider and the wheel shorter next time.  Be a little realistic about these things though because some of these might be a downer but you might or might not even see that many photos or videos. Some people don't even organize their music or label it right and they have to look everywhere anyway. But if you're like me where you like your music, videos and picturess organized and easy to access, there's your alternative and solutions to some problems. I didn't see these things as that big of a problem and found ways around most of them so that's why I give it a 5.

<Title>Rhapsody killed my Sansa
<Date>Sat Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa E200 series is a very nice MP3 player.  However it comes with a reccomendation to use Rhapsody, and as well Rhapsody can be a very nice service in and of itself.  If you combine the two you can very easily cause a firmware error that will embed and prevent you from accessing it Via computer, formatting or really interacting in anyway.  I bought the Sansa E260 and used Rhapsody it was good at first , I've used Rhapsody for years.  However I decided to upgrade to the subscription service of theirs Rhapsody To Go,  I didn't sync my Sansa in 4 days and tried to play my non Rhapsody music it glitched and became junk.  Sansa says nothing can be done, however if I can find the serial number they will replace it and Rhapsody refuses to help or refund in anyway.  By the way the playlist thing, It doesn't have an operable way to put playlists on without windows media player and I'm still not sure if it just dumps all the songs into a folder ie a file that should be 20kilobytes can become 200 megabytes.  Not alot of info out there about that.  Anyway I may get mine replaced however I will never use it with Rhapsody or a subscription service again.  Its just not worth the hastle I have wasted more hours trying to fix it or get help to fix it then it would have taken me to earm enough money to get another and have some cash to goto a movie and get sushi and beer.  In short Sansa good, other than the playlist and that might be good still not really known, Rhapsody very very very bad with Sansa.  It can and will kill your device and unlike Sansa they will not help you.  They will not refund your account.  Rhapsody cost me 215 dollars between the subscription the MP3 player and the case.  What do I get back for them destroying it? "We are sorry the issue can't be resolved."  I can't really give it a rating I did really like it alot while it worked, it functioned well the little ring selector took a bit of time to get used to but works much better than you would think. I would probably reccomend this device to someone who wants a good mp3 player or viewer, really photos and videos I thought looked great on it.  For the price and the functionality it is very nice, maybe the best on the market.

<Title>Ergonomics
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are things I like about this device and things I don't like. Things I do not like make me give this player only 3 stars even though I am not going to return it and try something else. I like the extension SD slot (1GB microSD card can be attained for 14 bucks) but I don't like that cover art of albums played from the card aren't shown. I also do not like the opposite locations of the card slot and "Record" button. Each time I insert or remove a card, I am at risk of recording explicit words addressed to designers of the device. Sound quality is quite decent, but to enjoy it one must throw away the headphones shipped with the player and get a pair of ones that either cover one's ears or go deep inside them. Bundled headphones are unimaginably awful and should not have been even considered for mass production. I've invested fourteen dollars in a pair of in-ear headphones made by A4TECH (A4ordable TECHnology) and the difference is huge. Better headphones will yield even better sound. The wheel works fine, scrolling through menus and lists of artists, albums and songs is quick and easy. The buttons around the wheel is a different story; they are just not made to be pressed by fingers of human beings. Ones who like to navigate through menus a lot should not buy this device to avoid frustration. Battery life is good. Better than I thought it would be, but charging from a USB port takes forever. I leave the thing connected overnight to fully charge it. The screen is good; I dont's have one bad thing to say about it.  Just one more thing I don't like is startup time. It takes too long for the player to start and I hear too much noice in the process.

<Title>Can't beat this for the $
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this little thing.  IMO, so much more for you money than in the 8GB iPod based on what is included.  I have not used an iPod so I can't comment on this user interface compared to the iPod but I find it super easy to use (and I have somewhat big hands and have a little trouble with my fingers on some devices like the Moto Razr menu navigator).  My only complaint is that I would like the auto-off timer be more like a sleep timer on a TV so I can listen to music/ebooks to go to sleep with a time to shut off.  The timer only shuts this off, based on the time you select, after all applications are done running.  This is a minor thing though.  This is also nice because you can record the FM radio so any device that you can transmit over an FM modulator (such as your XM player or your even your PC) can be picked up recorded on here.  I have not used a micro SD with this yet since 8GB is already a lot of memory but I suspect if you buy a SanDisk card you would have no problems.

<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A pretty decent product overall.  Screens are clear and easy to use.  Video playback is touchy at times, and the Sansa Media Importer leaves a little to be desired (will not run under Vista, for example).  But as an MP3 player I have no complaints.

<Title>New Product Has Limited Functionality
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are two versions of the e280 - v1 and v2. v2 is NOT an upgrade but is in fact a downgrade and one that is not pointed out to the consumer. You are no longer permitted to switch your USB mode from MTP to MSC mode meaning your device no longer doubles as a USB drive! You are also locked into using Windows Media Player and DRM only mp3s. What an upgrade!  Aside from the rant, the product is a phenomenal piece of technology. I only wish I wasn't deceived into buying a newer, lower version of a fantastic product.

<Title>Well worth the money
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have avoided the i-pod because of the battery issues.  With a user replaceable battery, the Sansa was a lot more attractive to me.  I have had mine for over a year and a half, and the battery still keeps over 18 hours of charge - not so of the i-pod.  The only reason I haven't given the e-280 a five star rating is because of the voice record feature. It is way too easy to activate while I am holding it and navigating through menus (the button is on the side where you hold the mp3 player).  I purchased a charging unit that uses 4 AA batteries and an FM modulator that also charges the player. Although neither are made by Sansa, they have work very well with the player.

<Title>sandisk e280 mp3 player
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Good product overall. The PC running XP had no problem recognizing the scandisk as another drive. You can't load too much in terms of megabytes at one time. The device will freeze. I tried to load whole books of the 7-15 disk variety ripped as mp3s and sometimes it goes into a freeze. Never a problem with single music disks. The device works well with mp3s ripped using the open source CDex. You can't beat the price. $0. Newer models are coming out all the time but for now, this e280 is great. Buy a cover (tight fit rubber) and perhaps new earbuds. The ones that come with the scandisk are ok but do not block out background noise. There are only two volume settings normal and high but neither volume can compete with a truck rolling down the street.

<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player seems sturdy and has convenient features.  The sound is very good, and the voice recorder is moderately sensitive.  The device works in MTP or MSC mode, but you will need the MTP mode for using protected files like downloaded audio books, which is mostly what I do.  Unfortunately my computer with Windows XP didn't "find" the player except in MSC mode.  My audio books wouldn't play and I kept getting a message to synchronize, meaning that I needed to be in MTP mode.  A SanDisk technician had me download from Microsoft a "Media Transfer Protocol Porting Kit."  This either installed or repaired the necessary Windows files.  It solved the problem, and my player is recognized in MTP mode, meaning I can play protected files.

<Content>Bought this e280 for my son who is a Marine. He previously had an e260 which developed a quirky earphone jack after much abuse in the field.  He really likes the 8 gig capacity.  We added a 2 gig micro sd chip to make it 10 gigs total. The only complaint I had with the e260 was that at that time (18 months ago) accessories were hard to find.  Now they seem to be everywhere even in our local "big box store".

<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am giving this to my husband this Xmas and after playing with the Sansa for 2 days before I ship it out to him overseas, I want to keep it for myself. The 2 ipod that he brought in the last 3 years has stopped working and he wasn't gonna spend that much again to get a new one so I got this for him.  I actually received the case I ordered from ebay before I received the Sansa and was worried that I ordered the wrong case because it looked so small. When the Sansa finally arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that it's even smaller than my cell phone. One complain I have is I ordered this directly from Amazon but after opening the box, I found the CD and user's manual is missing. Since I only have 2 days before the USPS deadline to ship overseas, I don't have time to return it.   Also the quick start guide keep telling me to go and switch between MTP mode and MSC mode but the function is no where to be found. I finally understand why when I read in one of the review that there is 2 version of e280 - v1 and v2. v2 no longer permit you to switch the USB mode between MTP and MSC mode meaning the e280 v2. can no longer doubles as a USB drive! You are also locked into using Windows Media Player and DRM only mp3s. I wish this was

<Title>Better than the iPod Nano!
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, the pros: -Great controls, easy to learn and the wheel is much better (they now have v2 of the Sansa E280, which I received.) -Battery life is really nice!  Lasts much longer than any other MP3 player I've had. -Perfect Size! Fits in my hand very comfortably! -Many features other than playing songs - video, pictures, FM radio, recorder, audible, etc. -CHEAP!  8 gb FLASH MP3 player for $1oo is an amazing deal! -Stylish, sexy black and silver -User replaceable battery -v2 is very fast, loads up within 5 seconds unlike reviews for v1 which said it took over 10 seconds.  Cons: -Not the loudest MP3 I've played around with, decent quality though. -Uses its own type of port.  Would've been more compatible and easier with a USB mini port.  Needs a special cord. -Absolutely the worst thing!!!: ONLY A v2 "PROBLEM"! v2 REMOVED THE MSC FEATURE WHICH IS THE MAIN REASON I WANTED THIS!!! v2 is automatically in MTP so whenever you plug it in, it starts with WMP, and u cant change it! I wanted to use this as a regular USB drive also but they took out the feature to make this possible! I was about to return the product because of this!  Notice I said "about".  The reason I didn't return it was because you can change the USB mode! Simply have HOLD turned on and press the reverse/back button, then plug the cord in!  It will read it as a USB drive and you may store w/e you feel like on there!  With that said, the pros largely over weigh the cons...so get it!

<Content>I purchased the e280 in January and am amazed at how well this product works;  right out of the box my computer recognized it and I was off and running.  Whether I'm using Windows Media Player or the free online Rhapsody (one month) service I was able to put music into my e280 and pretty fast.  Deleting isn't a problem either.  I even loaded an audio book - just don't leave your e280 in the shuffle mode!  A FM transmitter (bought on eBay) turned my little device into a great car stereo.  I love my little sandisk - the size, ease of handling, different options (photos, music, videos, voice recorder, etc.), look, feel;  I highly recommend it.

<Title>The Sansa E280 Has Got to Be the Greatest!
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I spent weeks researching digital audio players, and finally decided on the Sansa E280.  Now, my decision was not made hastily, and I considered an Ipod Nano, and a Zune, also an 8 gig Philips.  I tried a friend's Nano and wasn't impressed, and I decided that the Zune while slim, has a footprint that's a little too large for my taste, and a little more $$$ than I wanted spring for. The Philips would have been okay, but in general,the Sansa E 200 series has better reviews. So, I ordered the Sansa E280, and wow, do I love it!  The sound quality, even with my cheap old headphones is terrific.  (I can't use the included ear-buds; that type just won't stay in my ears.) I think the menus are easy to use, and with all the options and extras it has, I think it's the best buy going.  I have a Sony boombox, and it sounds like junk compared to the Sansa on its Altec-Lansing speaker dock.  I especially like the ability to do my own voice recordings.  As a student, I read my notes into it, and presto! I can be listening to my study guides while doing chores.  After having this little gem for only a few days, I don't know what I'd do without it now.

<Content>I love my 8 gig Sansa. It works fantastic, sounds good, is easy to use, and seems bomb proof. 8 gigs is plenty of memory. I can even use the go list feature to set up songs for my radio show I do once a week. My only beef is the crappy headphones that come with it. They dont fit, they fall out easily, and the fuzzy little covers fall off. Not to mention the sound quality is lame. Pretty much any headphones you can find at Walmart for over 15 bucks will sound better. You'd think if you were paying $200 for a unit, a pair of decent headphones that they can probably get wholesale for $10 would at least be part of the deal.

Surprisingly, it played windows media, but who wants to watch any thing on 1.8" inch screen? Loading music was a breeze, organize the whole thing was or just like your computer. Little tricky that you have to read your manual, firmware update was easy too. The only problem I encountered with was the data cable, poor connection, wiggle hard and worked fine so far, may be have to call for warranty, other wise it has FM radio, and voice recorder built in compare to IPod that is 100 dollars extra.

<Title>Nice Little guy
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been researching buying a new Mp3 player for months. I wanted to upgrade to more memory from my Iriver (512mb). I selected the Sansa 8mb over Zune and Ipod, because it has FM tuner, recorder, and memory card slot for extra memory. The other two players do not. Transfering music is very easy and the sound is great. The menu buttons are easy to navigate. However, There are a couple of things I didn't like. (see below)  1. I purchased the player from [...] and it died after two days. The menu button got stuck and wouldn't stop rotating the menus. It would not even shut off. So, I let it run all night until the battery died.   2. When I am in the FM mode listening to the radio there is no stop button to stop the radio and return to the main menu. I had to get to the main menu an select music then turn off the player.  3. I wish Sand Disk would have included either the plastic or leather case, especially for the price paid for this item. The case included is cheap and non functional.  4. The earbuds included fall out of my ears. Fortunately, I have a pair of sony earbuds that work better which I had purchased to replaced the earbuds that came with my Iriver player.  5. The actual menu buttons could be little more prominate. Sometimes when I press the buttons I have to press them again because the buttons are so faint. I guess I just don't press hard enough.  6. The system works well with WMP, however, I use Music Match and had no problems downloading songs. The downside is I can't transfer playlist with MM. I can only transfer playlist using WMP. I have to export the playlist into WMP and it doesn't get all the information correct.  7. As note make sure your player is in MSC mode when you have card in the slot. That way you will see the card as a separate drive in Windows. I load songs on it and swap the card back and forth with my cell phone.  I really think this is a very nice player and If your buy it you will enjoy it. The color screen is really nice. I read some where that this player works well with Yahoo Music Player.

<Content>After probably too much research, I got the Sansa for about $100 less than the comparable Nano with an FM tuner and voice recorder.  The size is tiny yet the controls are accessible (I can control it well in my pocket without looking).  It has worked fine in the subzero temps of winter this month.  Works well with podcasts and WMP.  The only downside so far is that my FM presets got erased once and my Go List also disappeared once in the two months I've had it, I don't know why.  Overall, I would recommend this unit 100%.

<Title>Great mp3 player, Toss out the headphones.
<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For some reason, most audio players come with really cheap headphones. FM radio reception is poor indoors. Screen is very bright, but not really big enough for video. It does play both audio and video, but you are better off buying something else for movies. This is a very small player. (You should be able to fit this in your pocket.) 8 GB memory should be enough for mp3's. The type of memory used here is superior to a hard drive (with the notable exception of capacity).  This does what I bought it for (plays my mp3s with excellent sound quality). If you really need better sound quality than this, you would need lossless music. In which case, you are better off with real stereo equipment, not a portable.

<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Why I bought the e280: Small, light, long battery life, didn't care for video playback, not an iPod, large flash storage space (still not enough for all my music though), $[...] coupon at Costco, FM, voice and FM recorder, IT guy at work has 2 gig version, and finally I just liked it. Why I returned the e280: poor sound quality even with nicer headphones, can't delete from e280 (has to be done from computer), playlists are difficult (must sync with 3rd party software and then to delete manually using computer), lack of good software (relies on 3rd party), and not enough storage (but I knew that going in). I tried to like my e280.  I was disappointed over an over again and my wife could tell I just didn't like it. What finally did it for me was helping my mother-in-law set up her iPod Shuffle she got for her birthday. It was all so simple and seamless! I returned my e280 and I'm going to get an iPod.

<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For about a year I had a smaller, cheaper Sansa e140. It sounded great,  had the slot for an SD memory card, was very small and easy to use, but the AAA battery life sucked big time.  So when I looked for a replacement I checked out the reviews of several players and naturally searched for one with outstanding battery life and sound. And so I bought the e280.  It has it all - SUPER battery life, FM radio, SD card slot, EXCELLENT sound, headphones that are pretty decent, easy to load with tunes (and I don't mean iTunes).  It seems to be very well constructed and feels solid.  I wear it on my arm when I work out and no problems there.  The "wheel" for volume, tuning, etc. works well.  The menus are fairly intuitive and it uses playlists.  I use Yahoo music Jukebox and the tunes are EZ to load.  I haven't used the video or photo features yet, but overall I'd give this a strong 10.

<Title>Warning to fellow nerds: Do not buy this online!
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, if you're only interested in playing music, have 8GB of it, use Windows Media Player to manage your music and don't mind DRM crippleware, this is a five-star piece of hardware for a five-star price. My review and rating are intended for people like me who want (and expected) more.  DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER ONLINE. If you want full nerd functionality, you must check the box in person. Here's the deal: The original Sansa e200 series supported Universal Mass Storage mode (Sandisk calls it MSC, Mass Storage Class), to allow transferring arbitrary files to and from the device. It could be used as a media player *and* a portable storage device; I originally found out about it while running searches against "UMS". I needed UMS so I could connect it to my primary computer running Linux, and I chose to spend the extra on the 8GB version because I could also carry around non-music files on the extra space among my Windows, Linux and Mac boxes. Although the default firmware's OK if you use some user-created utilities, I also intended to put Rockbox on it for OGG Vorbis and better playlist support.  Nope. I just now found out that my device is a version 2. Version 2 players are crippled down to only support Windows Media Player's MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). The device will only talk to Windows Media Player on a Windows box, and will only transfer DRM-scrambled music onto it - no other files. Isn't that nice? This is exactly the kind of nonsense I wanted to avoid. It also has a different processor from v1, so even if you go through the contortions to trick it into sort-of connecting through a hardware backdoor, Rockbox won't run on it.   Apparently version 2s add a "v2" after the model number on the actual package. I bought from Amazon Marketplace; neither Amazon nor Amazon Marketplace (yet) make any distinction between the functional version 1 and broken version 2. Buy a v1 in person, and you'll have probably the best piece of hardware on the market right now - aside from not talking to anything my player looks good, feels great and runs like a dream. I know I'm going to be looking around for a v1. Just don't make my $120.00 mistake - Sandisk is reneging on their marketing by selling two very different machines under one model, and stores don't know to distinguish between them.

<Content>The player sounds better than my girlfriend's Ipod, (she says it isn't as easy to use as the Ipod but I disagree and actually has many better features) and the SanDisk works with more online services (but it won't work with most of the made for Ipod speaker systems).  The reason I'm writing this is because SanDisk phone support was kind and helpful.  Be careful how you delete tracks, I would recommend deleting tracks manually.. Don't re-format the Player as a way to clear all the music.  SanDisk + Rhapsody is a great combo!

<Title>Good Deal For The Money
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was in the market for a good MP3 player at a decent price with a larger than average capacity. I decided upon the Sansa e280, and purchased a refurbished player. I'm very satisfied about my purchase and would recommend this product to someone wanting a great MP3 player who doesn't want to shell out too much money. One of the main selling points was that this is a flash based player, so there is no skipping or worries about mini-drive crashes. The refurbished model that I received looked brand new, save for the silvery printing on the back labeling it as a refurb. The controls are fairly intuitive, and took less than a minute to get used to. There are several equalizer settings to adjust the sound levels for different types of music which really help to fine tune the experience. The sound quality is pretty good, and the included earbuds are better than average. The LCD screen is bright and crisp, and may be a little too bright in full dark situations--enough to find your keys in an unlit room at night. The scroll ring is a little small for my hands, but I assume that may just be because of how I hold it. The built in FM tuner is a nice feature, but isn't the powerhouse of reception I would want it to be. The screen is large enough to see pictures well, but not large enough to really scrutinize images. The only problem I have had is with organizing my files. I prefer to use the drag and drop method instead of synchronizing with Windows Media Player. The problem with this is if you don't have your ID3 tags in order a lot of music may end up in folders named Unknown or in several different folders depending on spelling errors. A real hassle when you've moved 3gigs and realize it after you're away from the computer. File transfer is speedy and easy to setup if using drag and drop. The file transfer cable is also the recharge cable, and it only connects to USB so you have to have a computer on to recharge the unit. Their proprietary software is required to transfer image or video files, I haven't tried using it so I can't say how difficult it is. Overall, a great player and definately worth the money.

<Content>The ONLY thing I don't like about my Sansa which I have had for 1 year IS that when you are in the category of all of your songs- If you wat to go back to the song list menu after you have listened to a song you have to start at the begining of the entire menu- which isn't long I just wish the BACK button would take me BACK to the song menu! THAT MAKES SENSE, RIGHT?

<Title>Sansa E280
<Date>Sat Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been thoroughly satisfied with the Sansa E280 MP3 Player and recommend it for anyone who is looking for a flash memory player.  I have about 465 songs on it now and have used 2.2GB of memory.  There is plenty of space left for more music or videos.  The FM receiver is excellent and a welcome addition.  The user interface is easy to use and downloading music has been a breeze (I use Rhapsody).  The relatively short play time is not a problem as I just include the E280 into my daily charging routine along with my smart phone, etc.  I have not used the earbuds that came with it very much as I have my own headphones so I can't really comment on them.  The shuffle may occasionally replay a song now and then but not as often as other music shufflers I have used.  In all, this is a well-deigner unit that does everything I want it to and more.

<Title>I-pod it aint...
<Date>Sat Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a guy with 3 Ipods in the house. I wanted to be the one hold out against the wife and kids Stepford devotion to the Ipod. I had hoped this Sansa would have been the fly in their ointment, but after a month with this monstrosity I have to admit, the Ipod would have been money better spent. I am a PC guy to the core and I really want to love anything not mac, but really this Sansa e280 is just badly done. Menu navigation is horrendous. If they want to save this thing, they should copy the Ipod format~NOW. The nano 8 gb model was $50 more than this e280 at the time I bought it. Considering that the Sansa accesories are so badly done, hard to find and expensive I regret not buying the Ipod nano. The first purchase of accesories offsets any savings with the base player. Throw in the nightmare menus and it is clear the Ipod is money better spent.

<Title>The best MP3 player I've ever had
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had a lot of MP3 players in my time, starting with the very first one available.  The e280 is the first one I've ever had that never irritates me and always just works.  The battery life is great and the sound quality is perfect for me.  I don't have audiophile ears, but the ones I do have don't detect any flaws.  I like the physical controls, and they got even better when I added the Koo Silicon Skin cover, which raises the buttons up above the scroll ring.  For those who have never updated the firmware in their e200 series, I highly recommend doing that ASAP, since playback order issues have been fixed in newer versions.  This is an awesome player.

<Title>Not quite an iPod killer, but a decent MP3 player nonetheless
<Date>Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After my old MP3 player broke (Creative Zen Xtra Jukebox; the LCD screen cracked after getting crushed in my backpack), I was in the market for a new MP3 player.  Since the main situation I used my old MP3 player was for running and I'm a fan of new technology, I wanted to get a flash memory-based MP3 player (for those of you not so technologically literate, flash memory is the same kind of memory in USB thumb drives and has numerous advantages over traditional hard drives although currently has less capacity).  I was faced with a difficult decision: go the iPod Nano route, or go with an off-brand, which worked very well for me last time?  I ended up choosing the latter by purchasing the Sansa e280, and while I don't regret my decision, I can comfortably say that the folks over at Apple needn't be trembling in fear about this product.  First, there are some definite advantages the Sansa has over the iPod Nano.  The most obvious one is price.  When I bought mine, the Sansa was a solid $30 lower than the iPod Nano 8 GB was at the moment.  Another perk is the presence of FM radio and Voice Memo on the player.  These options come in very handy and round the player out well.  In addition, the presence of two USB modes works to the Sansa's advantage.  The Sansa has two choices: MSC (Mass Storage Control) and MTP (Media Transfer Protocol).  In the MTP mode, the Sansa acts just like an iPod would, but with Windows Media Player instead of iTunes.  In the MSC mode, however, the Sansa in essence becomes a USB drive.  This is very helpful if you want to not add your entire music library on your (or someone else's) computer onto your MP3 player.  All those nice features aside, I've ran into my share of frustrating problems with my MP3 player.  The headphones and lanyard that came with the MP3 player were both rather low quality (the lanyard was obscenely long, which boggled my mind).  The firmware on the player has frozen on me occasionally, requiring a hard restart of the system.  Setting up a playlist on the Sansa is a pain; you have to be in MTP, set up a playlist, transfer it over to the device, and then sync it to the device (it's partially because I think Windows Media Player has a shabby interface and I don't like dealing with it, but I can't even transfer a playlist from another program I use to listen music, which bothers me).  The internal clock on the MP3 player seems to run slow.  There's usually a delay after you click to play a song.  I had some problems uploading videos to the device, but those were ironed out.    All in all, that's a lot of little annoyances to get in the way of an otherwise great MP3 player.  I think the number one thing that testifies to the comparative quality of the Sansa e280 to its Apple equivalent is that the interface is extremely similar to Apple's; in fact, the only major difference is that the scroll wheel moves instead of being touch sensitive.  It shows that the Sansa is trying to be like the iPod.  If an MP3 player is going to dethrone Apple, they need to do it by innovating instead of packing a few fancy features on an otherwise identical product.

<Title>Crappy screen will break on you !
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So I only owned my Sansa for two weeks when it broke! I even had it in a protective case. What a crock, the last mp3 player I owned (an iRiver iHP-120) lasted three years in my pocket almost every day, and held up much better then this piece of garbage.   So you figure I just bought it why not return it, or get Sandisk to replace it? Well I tried and had no luck. "Looks like you abused it" ....  I should have bought another iriver.   -- Original Review March 9th, Added Sept 27th --  (btw, I kept it in the pocket with my cell phone, when it cracked, my guess is the thing got some pressure on it from the cell phone, but nothing the iRiver hadn't seen hundreds of times before.)   So I got a hard plastic case for this PoS, hoping I could live with it for a while longer.   I was such an idiot why should my expectations of device improve. I am now lucky to get 15 minutes of battery life from it!!! What a PoS.   So I can't get it to keep alive long enough to make it to work (a 30 minute drive).   My usage of the device was to charge it every other day (now every single day) and use it on my drive to work (30 minutes each way). Now I am lucky to even make it to work before the battery dies.   What a crock.

<Title>How to play .wav files on this unit
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Many will buy into the Sansa E series because of the FM recording feature, which works very well, if the recording is less than 2 hours. Sansa stores these FM (and also voice) recordings in uncompressed .wav format. Some listeners, like me, despise compression because they can hear the difference and believe that compressed audio further dumbs down an already compromised audience who have lost touch with the sound of live music. Sermon over. Anyhoo, you CAN play uncompressed .wav music files, but not if you put the music files into the MUSIC folder. The MUSIC folder only supports the compressed audio codecs MP3 and WMA.  You have to drag-and-drop into the RECORD/FM or RECORD/VOICE folder. Sounds pretty dumb, eh? Sansa could have enabled WAV in the MUSIC folder, but in their finite wisdom, refuse to do so. It's a swell unit, and if you want to hear all the music that was actually recorded, use this workaround and you'll be happy.

<Content>Very happy with this little player.  I've never had an MP3 player that the battery is 'charged' on the computer through a port before. (Lithium?)   I've always had players that used regular AAA batteries.  I didn't think I would like that but now I prefer it!  The display screen is sharp and large enough. The buttons are easy to maneuver when you're going back and forth between catagories (once you get aquainted) and the quality of the device is actually pretty impressive for the money!  Easy to download photos. I haven't used the video feature yet but I'm confident that it will work just fine.  I like that you can save "playlists" and "go to" albums when the mood strikes.  Cool.

<Title>Best MP3 yet...
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned about a half dozen players so far.  I was toting around a Zen Vision M but found that I did not need all that much space and it is heavy.   When I saw the Sansa 8GB I figured I would give it a shot.  I mostly listen to podcasts and some music and rarely movies.  The first thing I did was add a 2 gig SD but found that the player needs to refresh every time it is turned off if a card is inserted.  My solution was to load the 8 gigs with music and podcasts and add some movies to the SD card which I do not leave in the player.  Battery life is excellent especially if you stick with audio.  GUI is very intuitive.  I always toss the included ear buds in favor of some good Sony's so I can not comment on those.  When I saw I could get the player for $115 I ordered and am very pleased with it, in fact I have not touched the Zen since this arrived a month ago.  The only thing I miss about the Zen is it's ability to progressively speed up when fast forwarding through long audio files.

<Title>The KEY--It has Micro SD storage!
<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great player, but not because it is some "iPod killer".  The iPod is primarily a "Movado" of audio gear.  It is beautiful, until you have to send it back to get a new battery, or until you drop it and realize the harddrive is fouled up.  And, should you wish to keep libraries of certain types of music - say Jazz, Classical, Rock. . .well you will not be able to do that on outboard media.  Enter the SanDisk.  Battery is replaceable after talking a screwdriver to the back.  There is outboard storage in microSD format.   Now available with 8 gig of main storage, and with a decent interface (not the equal of iPod, but what are you trying to achieve?  You want another PC. . .a handheld?  You should consider a Palm, or a HP handheld) And, should you wish you could put on pictures and movies.  I personally may put some family photos up there, just to have 'em handy, but there are better uses of the storage space.  How about mp3 audio?  Isn't that a good thing?  I think so.  I'll just keep putting audio on this unit.  There is a bit of noise in transitioning into new tunes.  But the conveniences basically outweight the minor annoyances.   So far I've added the Griffin FM interface for use in the car and that works great too.  Just drape the whole thing over the rear view mirror and go.  Tunes down to 87.5 FM, so I'm not near anything generally.  Recharges the SanDisk too.  Great form factor here.  This size is easy to have in a shirt pocket,or pants pocket.  I'm fussy about stuff sticking me from pockets so, If I'm good with it, then this is a comfortable store in a pocket.   Sound quality is good.  Controls logical.    I'd say you should seriously consider getting one.  Don't get hooked up with proprietary formats like with Apple.   Chris Tune

<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will try to make this short and sweet.  The ipods can't even compare to this...  -Superb mp3/wma playback and features (includes custom eq,album art,playlists)  -FM radio (includes radio recording with pause and resume function)  -Voice recording (with pause and resume function)  -Picture viewer  (includes thumbnail view, indivdual view, slideshow with  song playback)  -Video playback - don't worry about any problems because the videos are SUPERB quality  (includes video converter,play/pause,fast fwd./rew.,depending on what video you put on the player,they can be either fullscreen or widescreen)  -1.8" screen! (almost double the size of the ipod's)  -colorful screen and menus (who wants basic white like the ipod's)  -battery life (average of 20 hours)  -replaceable battery (in case it dies/doesn't work, you can get a new one, unlike the ipods)  -scroll wheel (works very wheel, and it's large enough to use)  -other buttons (don't worry about them being small,they're just the right size)  -ways to put data on the sansa (can be windows media player or by dragging and dropping files onto the sansa's drive/folder)  -size (about same size as Ipod Nano,but a little thicker so it's easier to  hold in your hand)  -price ($150 for 2gb Ipod Nano, $160-$190 dollars for 8GB VERSION WITH ALL OF THESE FEATURES!!!! Even if they both did the same things,you get 4 times the memory for about $15 more!!)  If you don't know what mp3 player to get, get this one, you will NOT be dissapointed.  NOTE: the only con is that the Sansa may get finger-printed because it's smooth/glossy. NOTE: if you take care of the Sansa, it willl NOT break or scratch.

<Content>I love the Sansa!!  My father has an ipod which I became very familiar with b/c I had to figure it out and teach him how to use!  The Sansa is slightly bigger but feels so much more durable.  I like the blue lit ring, the buttons work well.  I had problems using the Ipod buttons and my hands are small.  Loading is pretty easy too.  The only drawback is that it's not compatible with itunes which is where we loaded all my father's music so I could not load mine.  This is ok since we don't have the same taste.  There are a lot of other programs one could use though.  It has the fm radio and voice recorder over the ipod and the price was really reasonable.  The volume also seems ok to me.  I'm happy with the Sansa.

<Content>My ultimate criteria is sound quality - this is a five-star device.  Other's criticisms of the software and interface are justified for the most part.  The external video/photo converter is a bit clunky.  However, the ability to use MS Media player, or media monkey, or real player to sync the device is pretty flexible.  Or just drag files over to the device like it's a drive.  One thing that isn't obvious to me is how to create multiple playlists *on the device*; it comes with one called "Go List", but I can only add/delete it; I cannot create a new one.  Weird.

Lucky for me I discovered this little Sansa, I had never heard of them. I love the way it syncs with Windows media player and the drag and drop functions in explorer. I bought the E250 and I am so pleased with the player I wish I had bought the E280 now. I am going to buy one for my daughter and one for my nease for their birthday.

<Content>This is a great product from sandisk.  Sandisk rarely ever disappoints me with their products and this one is a winner. I purchased this sansa over an ipod/zune because it does not have a hard drive(see note below).  Just one note, if you are looking to put lots of movies on here then you will be sadly disapointed.  The most movies I could fit was about 5.  If you are looking to put oodles of movies on a player then go for the zune or ipod(but do remember you are getting a hard drive with zune/ipod versus a flash drive with sansa, and hard drives do breakdown over time).  I have had my sansa for 2 months and it has only crashed on me 4 times.  It does seem to crash more when I watch movies than when I just listen to music.   It also charges through the usb port, and will charge when you are downloading music to it(this takes away the frustation of having to fumble with an ac adapter).  Great product!

<Title>Poor customer support !
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've bought two sansas.  One went dead after 4 months of use... a problem known as 'Blue Ring'.  All of the sudden it went dead... I was disconnecting Sansa from Rhapsody and pooff... the blue ring goes on but nothing else happens.  If you search the web foruns you will find a lot of people with the same problem... but try to find a solution in Sansa's website.. no way !  Sandisk: be responsible for what you sell and find a way to solve this... I don't want to spend my money on products with such poor quality.  If you are looking for a player, beware.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing is great.  I have a few friends with Nanos, and other Ipods, and this is just as good if not better.  The sound is great, picture is good, features are good, etc.  I know that some people don't like the toggle wheel being tactile instead of smooth.  I like it.  I find it easier to control, because my fingertips are not at all sensitive, and with the Ipod, I often think I'm turning the wheel when I'm not.  Well worth the money.  I can't find a reason to justify the extra expense for the Ipod.

<Title>Great low price DAP, RockBox firmware a must
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The factory firmware on this device it nice and easy to use, but it only supports a mp3, wma, and wma-DRM codecs. For basic functionality it seems to get the job done pretty well.  But there is a better way. Get the Rockbox firmware! Though it isn't nearly as flashy as the factory firmware, it is still pretty easy to use. Best of all it supports all major non-DRM audio files (mp3, aac, wma, ogg, flac, mpa, mp4, and many many more). Games, well, with Rockbox has a bunch, you can even play Doom, solitaire, minesweeper, pong, and many more! Search for 'Rockbox' on your favorite search engine. It is pretty straight forward to install, just read through the how-to pages.

<Title>better than I expected
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first mp3 player and I now regret having waited so long to buy one. The 8G of memory sold this player to me as I have way more mp3 files than it can hold, but did not want a hard drive type player. My only problems with the unit are that I don't like the headphones, and windows media player does not always want to auto sync right with it once the memory is full, unless I manually delete files first. I bought koss portapro headphones for it and the sound quality I now get amazes me compared to the old walkman type players I have had. I didn't buy the ipod simply because of it's much higher price and now I am glad I saved the money. I would have given a 5 star rating if I considered the headphones even usable.

<Title>FANTASTIC

<Content>Sansa mp3 player, I have been using this mp3 player for about 3 wks. Fantastic sound, no Itune (I can get music from any music provider), what's not to love. My 2 daughters have ipods and this unit is better quality and sounds much better.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I finally decided to replace my ancient (I got it in 04) MP3 player.  Back then I payed 70 dollars for a 256 meg MP3 player.  A month ago, when I got this, I paid 120 for an 8 gig MP3 player. Moore, eat your heart out.  Positives: The capacity.  8 gigs is a lot of music. Using the expansion slot, you can add 2 more gigs with a microSD card for cheap (I got a 2gig for 12 bucks).  This nets you 10 gigs of capacity for 130 dollars or so--with a flash player.  I have 2,000 plus songs on mine.  It isn't my whole collection, but it's a good enough amount of music to last a while.  2000 songs translates to probably over 100 hours of music.    The fact it's flash: it doesn't skip, and battery life is better than HDD based players usually manage.  Very useful for the gym, or for use in my car on rough roads (using an adapter to play it over the radio).  I haven't run down my battery yet, although my use hasn't been too heavy (I bring it to the gym sometimes, use it on my lunch break, or when I'm driving).    The features: Some people scoff at FM tuners in MP3 players, but I actually use it sometimes.  Not all the time, but often enough to be glad of it.  Same goes for the voice recorder.  The interface: wow, easy to use!  Very easy to access different features, sync files, etc.  I'd call it as easy to use as an iPod, maybe more so. The buttons are responsive, the scroll wheel works well, etc.  Great ease of use (which is very important).  Good sound quality.  I don't know that it's the best out there, but I'm listening to 192 kb MP3s on 30 dollar earbuds; I don't think that I'll get better sound without first shelling out major bucks for high end headphones--and for my uses that's really not worth it.     The bad: If you use the expansion slot, it has to search the card every time you turn it on, which takes a few seconds.  Annoying but not terribly so.  The included earbuds suck.  Pick up some decent Shures or Koss or something; they sound much better.     I've been happily surprised by how good these are; I only picked them up because the WalMart I went to was out of the 8 gig Nanos, but the office store nearby had these on sale.   Color me impressed.  For the price, and features, and capacity, this is an amazing buy.

<Title>pretty sick mp3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the sandisk sansa a few weeks ago and I must say that I am very impressed with its look and capabilities. This is definitely worth the price (and a pretty small price at that: $120ish for a sweet 8gb mp3 player!) An 8gb is plenty of space to store a great amount of songs that will keep you occupied. It also has video, radio, and voice/radio recording!! I haven't really tried the video yet, the screen does look slightly small to be watching anything too long, but the colors do look gorgeous through the photos they already have presetted. The radio is okay, only a few channels worked well for me but its still better than nothing. The radio recording works well.   As for the look, i like the slick body of the mp3 and also the sturdiness of the backing which protects it from scratches. The buttons are nicely placed, however, I did have some trouble getting used to them in the beginning because you have to push down harder than an ipod and its right next to the scroll wheel. I like the blue lightup effect of the scroll wheel, but the feel seems somewhat cheap and it doesnt scroll as smoothly as an ipod. Also, another thing that bugged me was the position of the earphone jack next to the hold button, which made it kind of difficult to  hold/unhold. But these are really minor details which dont affect the mp3 that much.   The sound quality is pretty good, the earphones do their job well. I like the menu of this mp3, just being able to scroll through the various options. Everything is layed out really well and organized so its easy to pick which songs to listen to. Another great thing is the ease of adding songs to the mp3; you just click and drag. The size is also a big plus. For me, I wanted something that I could take to the gym and easily fit in my pocket and this sansa definitely fit my needs. Overall this mp3 player is great and will keep me entertained for a long time.
