<Title>I Love my I Pod Touch
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Being of the 40 over generation and needing reading glasses, the Ipod touch is wonderful, I don't have to squint to read those little buttons.  It's all on the screen and large enough to see. Then I just touch away.  Editing photos for my contacts is so easy, and I love showing off my I Pod touch to everyone and how easy it is to use.  Watching music videos and movies.  Now when I do have a long airplane ride ahead of me, I can download a movie or two and watch them while on the plane.  I also listen audio books, meditation music and classic rock and roll and even my some of my daughters music, which I probably woulnd't have done before, so I am keeping up on some of the newer music and videos.  My IPod touch is great.

<Content>My fiance and I bought iPod touches at the same time and we both LOVE them.  Wouldn't trade it for any other mp3 player.  The only thing that sucks is having to spend an additional 20 bucks to get the upgrade, but it is worth it.  We have reccomended this product to all our friends.  Everyone that has tried ours have felt the same about them as we have.

<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My review of the IPOD TOUCH  is just spectacular ,I give it this review because I drop my ipod in some water and didn't even realize it until it was to late and it got all wet' and I had just purchase it on the 27th of Jan, anyway I thought all was lost until 3 days later I put the ipod on the modem from my desktop which generates heat' by doing that the remaining water that was inside the IPOD gradually disappeared before u know it I was using my ipod again. I was really upset before this happen but luckily it returned to it's original form,"however APPLE design this product I give them a thumbs up, they must have had some type of protection around the chip inside but whatever it is it saved my ipod from destruction..

<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Apple iPod touch is a great electronic device. You have music, videos, photos, internet- everything at your fingertips literally!!  The touch interface is well designed, and the clarity of images are superb. The only things I have against this device is that my finger is a little too big for the tiny screen keyboard and browsing the web. I wish the screen could be a little bigger, but this would have a negative impact on the overall footprint. Great device!

<Title>Good but could be better
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted an ipod touch since the first moment I saw it. It is an excelent MP3 player, with the apple quality. The screen is amazing, the touch interface works perfectly. I think it has 2 things that could be better:  1- The back of the ipod get scratched so easy, I recommed get an ipod case, otherwise it will have hundreds of scratches in 2 days.  2- The volume, if you have your ipod playing and locked and you want to change the volume level, you must press the unlock button then slide the touch button to unlock it, go to "music" -> "playing now" and change the volume. This is very annoying!! sometimes I have the ipod in my pocket and have to do all that to change the volume, a little volume control out of the screen will make it a perfect MP3 player.  But well, this item is amazing, I recommend it.

<Title>Outraged that Apple is charging $20 for a system update!
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am outraged that Apple is charging early buyers of the iPod Touch $20 for a system update that ought to be free.  While I understand Apple's decision to charge money for the new applications the new $20 "application pack" also includes a SYSTEM UPDATE in the form of the home page editing, web clips, and lyrics features. All of these are updates to the currently existing iPod Touch software and NOT new applications, which means that they ought to be free to all users of the iPod Touch.  Adding insult to injury these applications are all hidden in the 1.1.3 system update, a whopping 104.4mb file that all users must download if they want to fix bugs in the system. These applications can only be used when you pay Apple $20 to "unlock" them, but even if you decide not to buy them they stay on your iPod taking up precious space that could be used for songs, videos, or photos.  Apple is normally wonderful when it comes to providing system support and updates, but having them shaft early adopters and loyal fans like this is offensive and shows that Apple has absolutely no regard for the iPod Touch community.  I was not planning on jailbreaking my iPod Touch, but after this outrageous behavior on the part of Apple I probably will.

<Title>Exquisite piece of technology
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got my first CD player about 15 years ago, but rarely purchased CDs.  The thought of spending $15 to $20 on every CD that may or may not have more than 1 song I liked on it seemed ridiculous.  You could say I've waited 15 years for this.  The iPod touch 8GB is absolutely beautiful.  The design is impeccable.  The system is so easy to learn.  But I do have one small complaint.  I would prefer a paper manual for quick reference in locating features of the iPod.  I agree that it is best to minimize over-production of paper products that can be supplemented by digital documents. But I still hate reading through manuals via my computer monitor.  Yet, the lack of paper manual, that I would have looked at only a few times, does not hold weight against my love for my iPod touch.       I am at a loss for where to begin a description of everything I love about the entire design and function.  But one thing I must point out is that the use of the internet browser is not frustrating.  I would have expected frustration in surfing the internet without a large monitor, mouse and keyboard.  Truly a remarkable design in making the speed & simplicity of surfing the net on a small iPod.     Thank you Apple, I love you.

I had a lot of trouble choosing between this and a kune but I'm happy with my decision to get the ipod. I bought it for the reduced price of about $260 then could'get the upgrades that came out the next week because Appple is cheap but I sort of knew that might happen.

<Content>I got this iPod for my husband for his birthday.  This is our first iPod, but not our first MP3 player.  He loves it and takes it everywhere he goes.  The 8 gig capacity has proven plenty for his favorite music and videos.  We have not tried it for movies.  This iPod has all the same features as my iPhone except the phone and external speaker.  The new feature pack is worth the $20 download cost.  He loves to check the weather and maps.

<Title>Worth it if you're willing to hack it
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iPod Touch is a great media player for people who don't have a million songs to upload. I am very picky with what goes onto my iPod and can barely fill up my 4GB nano 2G. It's sleek and have an intuitive OS, which probably doesn't surprise anybody familiar with Apple products.  What got me excited about this product is that it can act as a PDA if you're willing to put in the time. There are countless websites out there that explain how to "jailbreak" this device and installing free 3rd-party applications. Once you do that, you have a PDA and media player for a mere $260. One can even make free internet phone calls on it if by buying a proprietary microphone and installing VoIP software. In the end, the iPod Touch can be 95% like an iPhone for much less money. This product is fine on its own, but outstanding if you tweak it. Because of the potential in this device, I give it 5 stars.

<Title>Crazy Fun IPod
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, at first I thought it was a little radical with all the bells and whistles and what not, but when I used my friends, I was sold. I was deciding to get a new IPod because my old gen.1 Nano was starting to 'go' if you know what I mean. I have always been a nano lover, and I was gonna buy the Nano. Then I got curious, I looked into the Touch a little and was amazed. Then a couple of weeks later, my friend got one, and let me try it out. AMAZING. It's pros definetly outway it's cons.  PROS: 1. The nice slim body plate. It's cool how nice and small they got it for something with so much. 2. Even though this part is half pro half con (because you'll rarely use it after a while) The internet is REALLY nice. 3. Very nice looking. 4. Light weight design. 5. Many things to keep you occupied BESIDES listening to music.  CONS:  1. It's a bit over priced. 2. Kinda tricky to get used to, especially if you're used to other IPods. 3. Not really that much of a con, but some of the bells and whistles become not used after a couple of weeks.                   So the answer to the all important question:                           "Should I buy one?"                        If you can afford it: YES!

<Title>Great Design - Poor Performance
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The touch-screen and colors on the Ipod touch are superb. This is where the great story comes to an end and makes me cling onto my 4G and 5G Ipod's for performance. The user interface is sluggish and the time lag to response irritating. The Wi-Fi is so slow even when i stand on top of my DSL wireless router that it is waste of time to even try and check your email or surf any websites. What make things worse is that 2 of the keys on the "Virtual Keyboard" simply do not work. These are the 5 Key and R key. I am perplexed as every time i try and attempt this input with vertical or horizontal screen orientation the input character is the adjacent key. Therefore it is usually impossible for me to login to my Gmail. It may be a defect on the screen of just my unit - but i dont know if this is the case or whether the OS of the Touch is flawed. The sound quality is decent, but a lot needs to be done to get this Ipod to work fast , reliably and without input issues. Performance is as important as looks when you pay so much for a device.

<Title>Awesome New iPod
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple's newest iPod is really great. It has internet, youtube, photos, video and even iTunes. The most surprising thing about the iPod is that it's REALLY fast for such a small gadget. The iPod touch works much in the same as previous iPod, but it expands on the features.  The downside to the new iPod Touch is that it feels fragile. I would never want to put it in my pocket because I would be too afraid to scratch the screen or even break it. The ipod itself is super thin, which makes it easier to break.  The iPod touch is a great new iPod, but if your looking for something you can rough up a bit, try the iPod classic or nano.

<Title>Sweet advances
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking to upgrade my trooper of an Ipod Mini and was going to upgrade to an Ipod classic but when I saw what the touch offered I was intrigued. What sold me on the touch was the wi-fi capability. After many years I reuturned to college to pursue a bachelors degree and the touch's wi-fi capability has been an excellent feature. Many of my courses have an online component and instead of hauling my laptop or wating in line to use one of the university's computers, I can use my touch to check email or see the latest discussion postings or contribute to the discussions. Typing has been excellent, very few errors and I have gotten quite fast. I use the widescreen view when I observe web pages and the zoom function is just plain sweet. I am awed by the interface, very responsive. Any misses or non-responces are due to my errors and not the interfaces. You have to train yourself a little bit on using the touch screen but it's not difficult.  Some have complained about storage capacity but reality check people. Not everyone needs 80 or 160 gb's of storage. I have the 8 gb model of the touch which is double my old mini's capacity and it suits my needs perfectly. A couple of gb's of music and audiobooks, a few tv show episodes for when I have no reading or studying to do between classes, a few short films, and some photos to share with my classmates, such as my new niece.   Sound quality is excellent and I have had zero issues using the touch in my car with the power adaptor and fm transmitter. Battery life so far has been excellent with me mixing up music, video and photo slideshow use. I have not had any issues concerning the screan or the touch acting all wonky. At the moment I am using it an average of about five hours a day and zero issues as of this time.

<Title>Product's Great: Video selections mediocre
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iTouch is a great little device. It's easy to use, fun and great grown-up toy.  Since I already own an 8 gig ipod Nano, which I use for audio books and some music,  I bought this to view videos on long plane trips.  It's much more convenient that dragging out my laptop. The problem I have run into, however, is that iTunes doesn't have the most current or greatest selection of movies.  Hopefully, they'll come up to speed as more and more househoulds buy this product. In the meantime, I suppose I'll have to download tv re-runs and videos I've see before but still enjoy....

<Title>Great product, but it does need much more memory for the power users!
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Watching videos on the iPod Touch is quite an improvement over the iPod video, particularly, due to the bigger screen size. As commented by other reviewers, this gadget is wonderful, but if you are used to the kind of storage capacity of an iPod Video (30Gb) and you are serious about watching videos and movies with it, you are going to need much more memory, so at least go for the 16Gb version, or even better, wait until Apple decides to put more memory in it (30 Gb should be the minimum for music and video). Every iTunes movie is 1.6 Gb, then, with five movies the 8Gb will be full. Every music video is between 20-40 Mb. Then, with 50 videos (1.5Gb), and two movies there is only room left for 800 songs (4Mb each) and a few photos. I guess actual capacity is good only for Nano users.   Also be aware that your old cables for watching videos/movies on the TV are no good for the Touch. You will need a new set of video/audio cables because the format for video in the new devices is different, allegedly of better resolution. The old cables are good only for listening to music.  Due to the memory capacity limitations, I left all my music on my "old" 30Gb iPod Video (around 4,000 songs), and I am using my new iPod Touch just for photos, music videos and movies, and loading music only as you do with a iPod Shuffle, which is annoying, since I prefer to carry my entire collection of music, videos and photos together. Meanwhile, I will travel with both gadgets.   Aside from comments from other fellow reviewers, I will just add that the interface/software for surfing the web needs real improvements. I do better surfing with my cell phone's smaller screen than with the iPOD Touch.   After all this is always the price you pay for being among the first to use a new technology. I bet some patience will be fully rewarded in the very near future.

<Title>A revolutionary device, however...
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod Touch and don't have anything more positive to add than what's already here.  The reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that there there is a USB power issue that can affect older PCs.  If you read the technical support forums on Apple's site, media transfers can crap out after long transfer times.  Which means that on my 2.5 year old notebook, I cannot transfer large movies to my iPod Touch.  I need to use my newer laptop for syncing movies, which is very disappointing for me.

<Title>iPod Touch
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everyone who owns an iPod Touch knows it is an indispensable piece of electronic equipment.  Its dimensions are that of a Hershey's candy bar, and this is brilliant because the small size makes it easy to handle.  This particular version of an iPod serves as a computer, an MP3 player, and so much more.  One of its major features is its ability to access the Internet wherever there is a wireless modem.  Another feature is the impressive amount of music it can hold.  Specifically, the iPod Touch can store approximately 1,800 songs which play with just a touch of the screen.  This screen is very unique compared to any other MP3 player because it is sensitive to touch; therefore all of the controls are located on the screen itself.  Thus, the iPod "Touch."

<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player and after evaluating a few I checked the Touch.  I am glad I went with it because of the added features like internet connectivity and multiple other apps like mail, weather, contacts, maps, stocks, YouTube.  I have to be honest, I use it more for these other things than I do for music. I have even retired my windows based pda because the Touch does everything I used the pda for.  And the Touch also will transparently syncing with Outlook so my calendar and contacts are also there.  When I am not at home where I have wireless connectivity I don't have to go far to get connected.  While on vacation last week I was able to connect at every hotel/motel, restaurants, a library, a bank etc.  I can't imaging being without it.

<Title>treo user's review
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the itouch to hold me over until my treo's sprint contract completes.  If I actually walked around listening to music I would have just got the iphone.  My ipod is pretty much only used to play music in my cars.  I wanted the iphone without a contract.  The itouch was a perfect need-want compromise.  Technically the treo can do most things the itouch can but I'm already noticing how the itouch is changing how I do things.  In the morning I used to take a peek at email, the weather and stocks on my pc.  Now it's nice to do all this in bed on cold mornings as the heater kicks in.  I actually wish apple would make a slightly bigger itouch device to take around the house.  As small as the macbook air is, it's still a laptop.  Maybe because the itouch doesn't have a physical keyboard, it doesn't feel like some work shackle that I take around the house.  Also, my wife would kick me out of bed with a laptop.  Checking the weather and stocks on the treo is an ordeal.  On the itouch, you push one or two buttons.  I never watched youtube before but the resolution of the content and size of the itouch screen is a perfect fit.  Instead of seeing what's on tv, I'll poke around on youtube.    I have some gripes.  Browsing the web is pretty good but the experience gets me wishing for a slightly larger itouch.  It gets old expanding and moving every page.  Although not recommended, it's harder to change music in the car while driving because of the moving touch screen buttons and locking feature.  If your current ipod is close to being 8gb filled, then just get the next size up.  I spent 1.5 hours trying to figure out what content to exclude and will continue to have to do which wasn't worth saving $100.  Some conveniences I'm used to having with my treo make me want to just get the iphone now.  I google phone numbers all the time and wish I could click on the found number directly to call.  I'm also used to getting internet access anywhere with the treo where I'm confined to hotspots with the itouch.  Sure, open wi-fi is readily available, but rarely when you're stuck in bad traffic, in a car with a sleeping baby, or a long post office line.

It's an iPod; it's an Address Book; it's an Internet access device with real-time surfing of the web; it's a Photo album; and on and on. It's something completely new, with a real OSX foundation. I think that it's going to take a while to puzzle out everything that it can do. The future is limitless. . .

<Title>Fun new gizmo
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've looked at the Iphones and lve the look and feel.  But didn't want to bloat the monthly cell phone budget any further.   And I didn't need another Ipod.  My 30 GB video Ipod has worked great since I got it.   But I was drawn to the new Ipod Touch not just by its interface and sleek appearance.   It was the wi-fi.  I like using it to check emails or a quick browse in the early morning or at night when I don't want to boot up my computer.   Its quick and easy and the display is sharp enough to read text without a problem.    Another plus is the battery really lasts longer on this than on either or my two earlier Ipods.   Finally, they got that right.  The cover display on the music end is very crisp and it works great with my Unviersal dock and remote.     On the down side, its only 8 gigs.   But 2000 songs will last awhile.    The Ipod Touch is another step forward.

<Title>Just amazing!

<Content>It's amazing, simply amazing!!! You can't imagine how incredible it is until you lay your hands on it!!! Of course there are some issues that probably will be fixed with a firmware atualization but, even with these little problems it's the most incredible piece of hardware that I've ever seen...  Rate 1000/10....

<Title>I absolutely LOVE it, but...
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was a gift from my fiancee, and I have been having a great time with it.  For those of you who have not had an oportunity to see one in person, they are quite amazing: it feels like you are holding something from the future right in your hand.  The interface is great (go Apple) and coverflow works like a charm.  As an iPod, the hardware still has some issues.  On a couple of occasions, I have been showing-off the features to a friend (be prepared to do this a lot).  During navigating through playlists and songs, I (or friends)have accidentally started playing a song.  If the headphones aren't plugged in, this is easy to overlook, and the song will keep playing as you navigate through other features and later goes to sleep (still playing).  One day later, the battery will be dead.  It's not a big issue, but it wold be nice if there were a little led or perhaps a banner on the home screen to indicate that music is playing.  Another iPod consideration is that the touch screen means you can't operate the controls (brace yourself for irony) "by touch".  If you plan on using it for tunes in your car, you had better find a single playlist and a comfortable volume setting and leave it alone while driving.  On my old 2-Gen iPod, I can reach down and fast-forward, rewind, pause, lower the volume or turn off without taking my eyes off the road.  That isn't a criticism of the iPod touch per se, but it should be a consideration for those of you who are deciding between an 8GB touch and an 8GB nano for $100 less.  While driving, the iPod touch has even less functionality than a shuffle (you still can't see what's playing, but you can control the music by touch/feel).  The touch does have WiFi, which seems beyond cool at first, but zooming and panning (despite Apple's great pinch/stretch design) stops being interesting after a while, and you'll go back to browsing on your laptop.  You can check your mail using the WiFi and a web application, and I would expect that some of these web interfaces will become scaled specifically for the touch in the future.   There is also a calendar feature on the iPod touch, but unlike the iPhone, you cannot make any changes to the calendar (aka you cannot add "events").  I very much need an app where I can update my calendar on the go.  For now, I am still stuck with having to carry my palm pilot with me.  A working calendar, notepad, and other features may be available in a later software update.  If not, Apple is trying to release a (non-web-tethered)software developer's kit for the iPod and iPhone in early 2008.  I'm sure a good calendar app, contacts app, good notes app won't drag to far behind.  So, I love it.  Lots.  I hate myself for only giving it three stars, but a crippled calendar application and an all-to-easy way to leave your music running and drain your battery are below the standards I have for Apple's hardware.  If I had $300 for myself, I would buy a nano and have a $100 stockpile for accessories.  However, once I had the iPod touch in my hands, I couldn't let go.  ***EDIT 11/21/07*** With the latest iPod update (through iTunes), you can now add and edit events in your calendar.  My iPod touch can now replace my Palm Pilot, and I am a very happy camper.  I'd change my rating to four stars, if I could.

<Title>Great fun!

<Content>I held off on a portable video player till one came along that had all the features I felt were worth the cost.  This has the compact size, high resolution, long battery life and big screen size - and was worth the wait.  I've got 5 hours of video and another 5 of audio and it's only half full - I didn't feel the need to carry around a week's worth of entertainment so the 16 G wasn't worth the extra $$ for me.  The wi-fi link is also fun - great for checking weather when traveling.  Highly recommended.

<Title>Fantastico
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bueno, voy a ser muy corto.  Hace 5 d�as comprmi IPT de 8G y bueno, como por variar, el estilo que el Sr. Jobs acostumbra colocar en TODOS sus productos, simplemente estempacado como toda una joya, se puede comparar su embalaje con un reloj Cartier sin temor a exagerar, no hay nada mas que decir.  Con respecto al producto les puedo decir que b�sicamente es una palm al estilo Mac, esto a pesar que el mismo Sr. Jobs ha colocado muchas restricciones en las aplicaciones que se pueden correr en el iPod, lo que equivale a tener un Ferrari con un limitador de velocidad a las 20 mph, pero muy seguramente esto a las buenas o las "malas" tendrque cambiar.  La interface es completamente intuitiva, nada oculto, todo literalmente al alcance de un dedo y ademas es preciosa.  Bueno, espero que este peque�o resumen les pueda ayudar a tomar la decision de compra de este MAGNIFICO producto.

<Title>Great device, intentionally crippled
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first ipod I have owned (but not first mp3 player), so I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered it.  The touch has some very innovative features. The cover flow is a nice addition, the keyboard is surprisingly usable, and the built in wifi support is an incredibly useful thing to have.  However, those features cannot overcome the fact that Apple failed to include features that are a standard among every other MP3 player in the market, in some cases including their own products.  1) You cannot transfer songs, pictures, or any other form of media by using the mass storage (dragging and dropping through windows). This means that you cannot use this on any computer without itunes, and you can't use it on Linux or Solaris at all. This feature is present in literally all of the ipods competition.  2) Not only can you not transfer media, you can't use it to transfer files between computers at all. According to my brother, you can do this on even other ipods. I had planned on using this to transfer large projects between home and my school computer lab.   3) Software that came on the iphone was deliberately left out purely to separate it form the iphone. For example, notes is left out of the ipod. Why would you leave out Notes, But keep Calendar and Contacts? This is pure software, their is no reason Apple could not have put it on the ipod.  4) you can only sync with one computer. Since I own 2 computers that I use regularly, this is a serious problem.  5) You can't transfer mp3's between computers through itunes, but you can transfer itunes purchases. The only reason I can come up with for this is to cripple Amazons music service for use on ipods.  6) no hardware sound control. This means you cannot adjust the volume in your pocket. Instead you have to take the player out, turn on the screen, go through the unlock screen, then slide the volume bar.    So while the product is innovative and useful, it was also literally defective by design. And crippling a product for marketing and monopolistic abuse of market share is totally unacceptable.  To add insult to injury, the included headphones did not work in one ear.

<Title>Solid Piece
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The screen is very responsive to the touch. I believe it is using a heat sensing technology vs palm devices which uses the stylus. One bad thing about it is you can't add more applications to it w/o having to do some non-approved work around.   It doesnt have some applications found in the iphone such as map. Neither less, still highly recommended.

<Title>The iPod Touch Soars Over the Skys
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> 	It's a plane, it's a bird, no... it's the iPod touch? The iPod Touch soars high over all other gadgets that have come out in Singapore in the past few years.  It is amazing how you can now view, listen and touch your music all at the same time. Along with that, you can even surf the web with the fastest internet browser available today, watch your favorite movies and videos with the stunning graphics on the 3.5-inch (diagonal) widescreen screen (http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/specs.html) from iTunes or even from You-Tube like no other iPod before. Another great feature is the Wi-Fi music store, where you can buy as much music as you want on the go. You can do all this on the 8-millimeter thin iPod touch. Apple says it is the best iPod they have ever made other than it's big brother the iPhone (not available in Singapore yet) and with what I have seen, there is no doubt about that. By looking at the ratings that people have given the iPod Touch on Amazon.com, it looks like at least 90% of the people who own this product agree with me by giving a 4 or 5 star rating. My favorite feature is the Safari web browser. It looks exactly like the same browser you have on your Mac. You can zoom in and out with just two fingers. Surfing the web on the iPod Touch is first class.  You-Tube is great to have as one of your main applications. You can view nearly all videos at the touch of your fingers.  When you watch it on the large screen the iPod has, be prepared to be amazed. Viewing your music is better than any iPod before.  You can scroll through your music just like before, sorted by genre, song name, album, artist and so on. New in the music application is that if you turn your iPod to it's side, you are instantly able to view all your albums in cover flow, like on iTunes. If you hear a song you like and have your iPod handy, you can just easily tap the Wi-Fi music store and search for the song you want just like on the iTunes music store.  To buy the song all you have to do is log in to your iTunes account and click "buy song". The only downside I find to the iPod Touch is that you can surf the web, buy songs on the Wi-Fi music store, and view videos on You-Tube only if you are in a Wi-Fi area. For videos you don't have to worry so much because you can still watch them if you have downloaded them on to your iPod earlier. Just like the past iPods you can still view your great photographs, but this time, you can view them in landscape or vertical mode by just simply turning your iPod sideways.  I have now been using my iPod for over a month and there is nothing stopping me from saying that in my opinion, the iPod Touch is the best gadget ever made and sold in Singapore because of its sleek design and its truly amazing applications.
