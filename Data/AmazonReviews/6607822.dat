<Title>Worst product ever!  Don't bother buying it!
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My daughter needed a replacement MP3 player and when the store did not have the one we wanted, she picked this one.  It charged within 3 hrs like the directions said, then we loaded her songs, and within the first 15 minutes of play, the unit shut down and none of the buttons would work!!  We tried to reset it but nothing happened.  I tried to see if we needed to download the "firmware" from their website but the file format was something that I had to buy!!  So my husband brought it back to the store, we got a replacement of the same item....went through the whole process and AGAIN the unit shut down!  I then found some online reviews and basically, 9 of the 10 people gave it 1 star, and many had experienced the same problems!

<Content>i bought this as my 1st player.. works great, never has shut down on me. just from me not knowing, and media player not doing what i want it to do, it is hard to get the songs on the player... but its just me. One thing i hate is the only charger i can find for it is the usb cable it comes with. Wish there was a car charger or something.

<Content>Bought this mp3 yesterday and by last night I already knew it was a bad product.  I can't get it to power up and it has to be plugged in to a computer to get it to come on.  As I was scrolling through the songs it locked up and I had to reset it, luckily I hadn't taken the time to upload my cd's yet.  It has good sound quality but I can't stand ear buds so I've had to buy a different set, so I'm not sure if it's the new ear phones that sounds good or if it's the mp3.  I like the fact that it has a radio, and the 500 songs are nice to scan through and hear new stuff. Also has a mood feature for when you're in the mood to relax or when you need some high energy songs.   Also like the fact that it will play video, store pictures etc... I just wish I could turn the darn thing on when I want to listen to it instead of having to hunt down a computer to plug it in, just so I can get it to power on.  This is one that I'll have to end up taking back, wish I would have done my research on it first.  **Update**  Was pressing the wrong button for turning it on.. Doh!  :-) I'll give it a few more days until taking it back.  Change my rating from 1 to 3 stars.

<Title>There must better MP3 players out there
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm new to this MP3 player game, but I've had this for 2 weeks and I still cannot really recommend it.  First of all much the 4Gb memory is taken up by the 500 songs already added.  It would be nice, but most of them are pretty weak.  Eye of the beholder I suppose.  Also, good luck finding accessories.  Even amazon has no arm band or FM transmitters recommended.  Portability should be the emphasis.
