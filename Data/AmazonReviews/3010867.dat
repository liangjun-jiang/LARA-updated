<Content>Frankly speaking, I am fan of Creative. I bought this player from Toshiba out of curiosity... and because it was on sell ;-). I am really impressed by the quality of this tiny Toshiba player. The body is metallic and gives the feeling of long lasting. Battery life is remarkable - 20hours for audio compared side by side with 15 hours of ZENV. Boot up time is also very short - around 1 second (much shorter than the 4...5 seconds for ZEN V). On the "dark side", Gigabeat has less features and options but nothing that I cannot live without.  Regarding the comment of our friend HappyBruin, I agree with him regarding the obnoxiousness of the iPod software (this being one reason for which I would never buy one)... But that is not the case of the Toshiba player. You don't need any software to use it - Windows will see it as a storage device - as simple as that! I am sure that he would delete his comments now if they would not be the property of Amazon.com; perhaps next time he will do his homework before writing such negative comments about a more than decent product...  Bottom line, the Toshiba player is a very nice designed and engineered player and I warmly recommend it (I bought it for $50 - FYI).

<Title>Not bad, but will not work with windows 2000 or or media player 9

<Content>I am real disappointed in this mp3 player. The product discription did not say it would only work with XP or Vista and media player 10 or 11. My work computer is Windows 2000, so I cannot use the player at work. There is no dock station. It can only work with media player. There is no way to listen to it except by earphones. I wish I had order a Zune or Creative. I ordered it because of the audio, which I am not impressed with.

<Content>Nice quality good sound. I only gave it three stars because of the ear phones are junk. If it had better ear phones I'd give it five stars.
