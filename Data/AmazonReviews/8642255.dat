<Title>pretty good mp3 player...but it doesnt last too long
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i've had this mp3 player for about 2 years now and it's been pretty good. Well it was for about a year anyway. After that the buttons pretty much stopped working. At first, it was just one and then gradually they all stopped working. It really sucks because this is a good mp3 player and it holds all my music but now i cant use it because the buttons dont work. Besides the buttons not working, it also doesnt hold a charge for very long. It lasts for about 4 hours until it dies. If you want a mp3 player that lasts long and is durable then you should probably keep looking because this definitly doesnt. But it was good while it lasted =/

<Title>One of the worst MP3 players ever made
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm a big techno-geek, but this is been one of the most awkward, horrible experiences I've had trying to get this device to do the simplist things. The application to get your MP3s on this is not user friendly, not intuitive. It's like it's strived to be so different from the ipod that it took out all of the good and left the bad. The player doesn't even register half the time with my computer. It takes a good half hour of messing around with the device and the settings to get it to work. I plug in the Ipod and it takes maybe 30 seconds. 1 minute tops.  Save your money. Save your aggravation. Get something, anything else.

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Thu Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent player for those of you who dont like to use itunes. The hard drive went out on my first player, so i had to get a replacement, but the replacement works fine. The sound quality is better than my old ipod mini, the battery lasts longer than my ipod mini, and it plays wma. Also it works great with windows media player and my yahoo subscription, which is a big plus for me.

<Title>Who needs an iPod.....
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Really happy with the Zen Micro.  I am using it with Napster To Go and have am thrilled.  The playback sound is great (with smart volume on) and it looks cool.    A few gripes: - As a previous reviewer stated, the battery life was short at first, but after a couple full discharges - I'm getting at least 10 hours of music per charge. - The touchpad is WAY TOO SENSITIVE!  I have to lock it when I do not want to use the controls (and its on low sensitivity). - No accessories.  I can't find a holster/clip for this thing for use when exercising.  You'd think there would be tons out there....go figure. - Creative Media software is marginal. - it's the same toilet-white as an iPod on the sides and back.  All things being equal, I'd buy it again.

<Title>Zen MP3 player sounds great
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm new to MP3 players so I'm still working out how to transfer and arrage the files.  I say "files" rather than music because I'm more interested in recorded books and podcasts than music. Music does sound GREAT using the earphones that came with it - and the books sound great, too, but it's still a trial and error process getting all tracks of all discs of a book in order.  That will take a little more practice on my part.  The touchpad also took a little getting used to, but I was able to master it in a day or two. I was not happy when I realized that the only way provided to charge it was by hooking it up to the computer USB port.  That means you have to take your computer on the road with you.  No wall outlet or auto adapter was provided. All in all I'm pleased with this purchase - and I suspect I'll like it better after I've had some time to figure out how to arrange the files or playlists.

<Title>Best Value in the Land of Un-iPOD
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Micro is near perfect.    I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.    I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.  It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.  It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.  It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.    All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.  So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.  The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.    It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... charm.  When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.    It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!  Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.    My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.  It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.  over and over again.  But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.  I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.   The accesories that come with the player are great.  White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.  Also all the required cables and what not.  To me, currently at $218, this player is a best in class.  It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.    Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.    Pick your favorite color and buy it.

<Title>good so far
<Date>Sat Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for a little more than 4 hrs and from what i can see so far, it has alot of great things about it. At first i was like i dont know if i can get used to the touch pad and i eventually did. I plugged it in and after a fairly long install and a restart, i started loading songs onto it using the nice media organizer program. For the people that want to know how big it is, it fits very nicely into a standard pack of altoids. Or dimensions 3in. x 2in. x 3/4in. sorry metric people. One thing i must mention is the great sound quality. Before this player, i bought the Samsung blue square looking one, 512mb and i was not impressed so far as sound and navagation. Speaking of navigation, the buttons are layed out very nice. I dont use the drop down menu button very much. The menus all are easy to navigate. The radio is decent, and the recorder is O.K. also.   PROS  +STYLE +TOUCH PAD +AUDIO +GOOD EARBUDS +REMOVABLE BATTERY +MORE SPACE THAN IPODMINI +FITS EASILY IN HAND +ENTERTAINING BLUE GLOW  CONS -SOFTWARE COULD BE BETTER -HARD DRIVE BASED (POTENTIAL PROBLEMS?)  All in all, if you are looking for a good player, but dont want a mini then get the ZEN MICRO

<Title>IPOD Killer
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is awesome. I have nothing bad to say about it. The software is extremely easy to use. The only problem I have is trying to navigate the menu in the car (which I shouldn't be doing anyway) and really isn't the players fault I guess. One other thing is it only has a 3 bar battery monitor so when one bar is left you could have 10 mins or up to 8 hrs. Other than that though it is perfect. After using my brother's IPOD for a month prior to getting this, the Micro is preferable in many ways (most important to me is ease of use and it is considerably smaller).

<Title>Average mp3 player and don't buy to use with Napster to go!
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Do not use with Napster to go!!!! The firmware upgrade needed to be compatible with napster to go is only in beta form and last I checked has not been updated by Creative Labs (what's up with that!?!) It makes the zen micro freeze up in the middle of songs for no reason, it loses lincenses needed to play songs you have downloaded (and even purchased), then it freezes completly and the reset button and removing the battery do nothing. After that it is just an expensive and pretty paper weight.      Other then that if you keep the firmware it came with it's a pretty cool mp3 player. It's small, visually atractive, has a FM tuner, and ok sound qaulity. However, it's not very loud at it's highest volume.      I've read a lot about the sound qaulity being so great, but I disagree. It's not bad sound qaulity, it's not good either. Just average and acceptable. And better headphones only minimally help the sound qaulity, but I don't think many people will pay more for their headphones or earbuds then they paid for their mp3 player (but you should because they are worth it!!)If you want sound qaulity go for an Iriver h320 or a Cowon X5 or experiment for yourself.      Also, if this review darkened your dream of using the zen micro with napster to go, don't worry, the Iriver H320 is compatible (and superior!)     Oh and one last thing, you can not customize the equallizer settings, they are all preset, which sucks!    Well I hope that this has been a helpful review.

<Title>.....AWESOME PRODUCT.....
<Date>Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>NOTE: this review is for the 5gb player. I wrote this lengthy review for that model, and it didn't show up and I can't re-submit it now. DARN thing! All the specs should be the same though.  I've been behind the times using the same portable CD player for the last 6 or 7 years... so this was really a BIG step up for me. Hopefully this review will be helpful if you have never owned an mp3 player before.... I have no idea how this compares to the ipod, but here is a list of the lesser known features of the zen micro:  PROS  +++ It tells you the number of tracks, albums & playlists uploaded. Total Mb & Mb remaining. +++ FM radio. +++ Removable battery & micro hard disc. +++ If you're halfway through a song (or paused) & you shut it down (or it shuts down after being inactive for a while, IT RESUMES WHERE IT LEFT OFF in the middle of a song when your turn it back on again!! :-) +++ You can change the idle shutdown time, backlight time, contrast, touchpad sensitivity, language (there are 15 languages installed!!) +++ sleep timer +++ You can personalise (configure) menus, much like with mobile phones. +++ PLAY MODES: normal, repeat track, repeat all, shuffle, shuffle repeat & track once. +++ You can find songs by albums, artists, genre, playlist +++ DJ menu: album of the day, random play all, most popular & rarely heard tracks. +++ There are 10 bookmarks, which I have absolutely no idea how to use, but it must be put onto this list anyway. ;-) +++ 12/24hr time, alarm, calendar, date (several date formats and you can even choose between the following separators: space, dot, dash, slash) +++ Variable microphone sensitivity. +++ Organiser; tasks + contact lists. (synchronised with creative sync manager) +++ Smart volume + Equaliser (numerous modes: Off, custom, acoustic, classical, disco, jazz, new age, pop, rock, or vocal) +++ master reset.    :-0 +++ track name, title & artist on LCD display.+ battery indication, and various other on-screen icons while a song is playing, such as EQ & repeat modes. +++ Gives the length of a song as a bar graph so you can tell the progress of the song... +++ A lot of stuff in the box: remote control, belt clip & cradle, pouch, usb cable, charger, earphones, software (easy enough to figure out)..... +++ Last but not least: a cool blue glow + white backlit screen!!! +++ There ISN'T a one second delay between playing each song. +++ My zen micro hasn't crashed on me yet (and I have been sucessful in crashing every computer product known to man, eg: my Ericsson T39m phone several times!)  CONS: --- The touch pad can be annoying sometimes. So you either have to hold it by the edges when playing a song or put it on hold mode, otherwise your palm will set off a whole bunch of menus.  It's okay when you're using it though.   --- You can't hear any music while fast-forwarding through a song. I am used to being able to go by ear while doing this, but you can't do that with this thing. Maybe a future firmware upgrade will fix this issue? Please??! Creative???!!  --- I walked all around sydney and couldn't find this in *ANY* shop. So I had to buy it online. All the photos of the zen on the 'net are front on.... and I didn't realise until I opened the box that the back & sides of the zen micro were coloured WHITE!!! ARRRRGHHHH! I hate white! Aaaahhh well, I suppose I'll get used to it soon enough.  --- I find the lowest volume setting isn't all that low. I can still hear songs well in a fairly quiet room during the daytime. At 3:00am I think this might be just a tad louder than I would have liked. [This is with panasonic earbuds though]  --- You have to first aportion (partition) the HDD to be used as an extrenal flash drive. Available sizes are: 128, 256, 512Mb, 1, 2Gb. You should be able to just use whatever is available. This isn't a big problem though.  --- Earbuds are too thick for my ears. Wearing them is like stuffing a peanut lengthwise in your ear. It pulls your earlobes out.  --- There is practically zero information (on how to use the menus) in the instruction manual.

<Title>Nice is an understatement
<Date>Sun May 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the 4GB version of this  player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.   The Look & Feel:  I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing. The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). It feels tiny in the hand without it. The stand that comes with it is very usefult to prop it up on the desk. The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot. The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.  The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   Reliability & Build   I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. The hardcase they give with it must work well.  It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.   Sound   I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.   Utility  Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book. The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.   Software  The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it does the job well. Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.   There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.  Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.

<Title>Why I Decided to Buy A Zen Micro Instead of An iPOD
<Date>Wed May 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been using the Zen Micro 6GB for about 3 weeks now. I spent some time before the purchase with a ZM and an equivalent iPOD. I chose the ZM for a number of reasons. Both are fine players, but here is what sent me to the ZM.  Design ZM is sturdy, with an easy to read screen. Similar case volume to IP but thicker and shorter so feels more compact. I can nearly hide ZM inside my fist. (I have big hands). Case is very smooth. Replaceable battery is a huge advantage over IP. But, design is not as MOMA artsy as IP.  Battery Life The first few charge/discharge cycles with the ZM were short, about 4-6  hours. But after that I started getting 10 hours at full volume, 12 at normal human volumes. Seems the battery likes to be conditioned a little. Do a couple of full charge and then fully discharge before recharging cycles.  Audio Quality Playing compressed music on audiophile systems is a waste. So I used Sennhesier PX100s (which I think sound much better than the Senn PX200's - but that's another review), OEM Toyota Car Audio and Tivoli Model One Radio. Although I restricted the ZM to only 128kbps WMA, to my ears, the ZM was noticeably better, with greater presence, better dynamic range and more accurate transients. This was true whether direct link via miniplug, cassette adaptor (SONY adaptor -lower noise) or FM broadcast (Belkin Tunecast II - lower noise better signal more options). Some of the quality difference may have been the different encoding schemes used by IP and ZM rather than the players themselves.  Capacity Virtually identical. I have nearly 50 hours of 128kbps WMA music and the ZM is only half full. ADVICE - Like all hard drives, both IP and ZM minidrives need some free space to perform housekeeping and other duties. I don't recommend filling either an IP or ZM drive to 100% capacity.  Accessories. IP wins hands down in number and variety of accessories. Colored covers, bags, pouches, plastic overlays, lights and more. For me, if it doesn't improve the playing experience, I'm not interested. Anything beyond that is a fashion issue. (Think $2000 car with $5,000 worth of trim, wheels and chrome.) You may have other priorities. At a minimum, get a good car charger, wall charger and remote. Both IP and ZM have excellent products available. However, I prefer the standard USB power/PC interface of ZM over the unique IP connections because I've been trapped in proprietary connectors and formats too many times before.  Music Download Although the iTunes site had a great selection of music, I didn't like iTunes for Windows client or being essentially locked into the iTunes site. I liked the ability to use lots of places to download music for ZM. Creative Organizer software was usable for me without reading the instructions.  Controls Had no problem with the touchpad controls on ZM even at medium sensitivity. But my notebook PC uses a touchpad and I'm very comfortable with a control interface that does not provide tactile feedback. IP wheel gives you that feedback. ZM alternative response is their wired remote which provides tactile feedback in a more traditional way.  Suggested ZM Product Improvements (Are you listening Creative?)  1) Silicone Cases - I use BoxWave Flexiskin because it makes the case less slippery and allows me to cover the white back of the case with a color. (My ZM is Black on Black). 2) Hard Cases - Look at the sweet Altoids hacks people have created. The demand is there. 3) Wireless remote - Who needs more wires in their life? 4) A Dock - The interfaces are all on the top, so invert the unit in the dock. A simple firmware mod would allow the screen to invert when docked. Dock is much better than loose wires on the counter. 5) Electronic Manuals as Adobe documents are okay, but format them for 8.5x11 paper so we can print them out if we wish. Leaving them formatted as 7x4 because the summary instructions are like that is wasteful.  I'm very happy with the product and feel I made the right choice for me. Your experience and opinion may vary. Enjoy!!

<Title>Sad Day
<Date>Mon May 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking forward to this product so much!! But, I was let down...a lot.  It looked great when I got it out of the box, and sounded beautiful for the full 15 minutes it worked.  I turned it off, and then couldn't get it to turn on again--ever. I called the company and asked them about it, they were nice, but couldn't solve the problem so they told me to send it back in--which meant it would be at least another 2 weeks before I could get the replacement.  I opted to return it instead and get my money back.  I'm now looking at the Iriver, but I may buy another Zen Micro, but this time I'll be buying it at a store so if it dies on me again, I won't have to wait 2 weeks for a new one.

<Title>Bang for your buck.
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When trying to decide what new mp3 player to purchase, I was very torn between the Ipod Mini and the Zen Micro. In the end it came down to one thing: bang for your buck. In order for Mac to reduce the price of the 5 gig Mini to about $199, they stopped including a charger in the package. The Mini will still charge while hooked up to your PC, but if you plan on going anywhere for a day or two and will not have access to your computer, you're out of luck. Now you can shell out the extra $40 bucks for a charger, or you can use the $40 to purchase the Zen Micro (as in, there is less than a $40 difference in price, the Zen being more expensive.), which not only includes a charger, but an extra gig of space (about 200 songs) for a total of 6 gigs of space, a hard case to protect from the inevitable butter-fingers moments, and two attatchments for the hard case which enable the Zen to either clip to a belt or stand upright on a flat surface, such as a desk or table. The Zen also comes with software that makes it exceptionally easy to add or remove music from your player and/or your PC music library. The software also manages your entire music library, allowing you to burn and copy cd's, create playlists for use on your pc, etc. And, finally, the Zen comes in a greater variety of colors than does the Mini, which is an added bonus. So, which sounds like the better buy to you?

<Title>Great alternative to iPod for WMA collections
<Date>Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was close to getting an iPod based on it's market presence.  But on further research went for this unit instead, mainly because I've ripped a lot of music into WMA format on my PC and preferred not to have to redo that.  I am VERY pleased with this unit:  The setup is a piece of cake Software is very good Sound quality is excellent It's tiny and light. The controls on the unit are intuitive and easy to use. Cool looking - blue glowing buttons.  I would have liked it to come with a belt clip or some sort of holder -- I'll have to get that as an accessory.  I'm not sure there's anything that jumps out as being superior to an iPod (a little more disk for the money, but not much difference).    But if you have a wma collection, this is a no brainer.

<Content>this is the worst product you can ever buy.  I recently purchased it and when i opened it i was like ok nice styling. i then read the directions and realized that the people who wrote it had no clue what they were talking about.  They say that you charge it and load songs {if tht even works for you} by using 2 different cables.  Only one comes this just shows u the incompetence of the manufacturer. Even after this i plug it into my computer and try to load songs with the included software. I was sure that it was fully pluged into my computer in the usb port and it said something along hte lines of "player not read please plug player into computer"  This mp3 player has caused me more frustration than anything else the only this i can say is buy an ipod this company is horrible dont even try to deal with them

<Content>Wow, I am often resistant to try new technology.  I mean I had a several CD Players, computers, DVD players that play CDs...what did I need with a MP3 player?  Well, I did and I finally took the plunge.  I wanted one with plenty of memory.  This was does.  6 Gig.  Sheesh, I think my first computer barely had that!  It's so small, fits in your palm.  Easy to use touch controls, with slide control to scan the play lists.  Quick touch volume adjustment.  Easy to install and use.  Out of the box you are charging in a minute.  It charged quick.  Less than three hours.  The charge is still going on 9 hours now -- they say 12.  Very readers display.  Mine was white and red (which I ordered) but they come in black, blue, white, silver and purple.  This is loaded with so many features that I will still be experimenting with everything for days.  The software is a quick load.  Once it's done, you plug in the player, and it opens the controls.  I just did a Select All and dragged it to the Zen playlists and it downloaded them all very quick.  Absolutely, love all the features, up to 3000 songs, the ease, the richness of the music.  Worth every penny!

<Title>Flawless
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own this player, my uncle bought it as a present for my aunt. I recently got a first hand look at this simply amazing product.   +Design+ The Creative Zen Micro 6 GB is very well designed. The buttons are large and easy to push, also, they are very simple to use. The front is very attractive, with the bright, blue hue light that lights up on the side. The back is awesome, it has a little design similar to a riple in the water that says "zen."   +Listening to music+ The Creative Zen Micro actually makes music fun to listen to. The simple menu is very easy to use, it seperates songs by anyway you want.   +Battery+ After the iPod scare that the batteries are not replacable, that made me like this player even more. The battery life is over 12 hours, very excellent. Simply connect the recharger cable and it will begin to recharge. The battery is totally removable, but it falls of a little too easy.   +Other functions+ This mp3 player also doubles as a personal organizer. It has a calender, memo pad, and contact list. Awesome.  +FM Tuner+ The FM tuner on this baby is great. It is crystal clear.   +Over all+ This is a great investment. It has about 2500 song capacity, organizer, FM tuner, great lighting, and very fun. One way this player can be improved is: that it can have a color screen so that you can view pictures and videos you make on your digital camera.   This player is simply undescrible. So great.  I am getting the 5 GB for my birthday. I can't wait!  Last Word: Creative, you really did good on this one!

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased the Creative Zen Micro 6 GB MP3 player and have filled it up already (in two weeks)! What a great unit this is! The sound is incredible, playback is easy (I use for the gym, on my motorcycle, on my lawn tractor, in my car through the cassette adapter, on my weekly airplane flights with a noise canceling headphone), I love it! Did take some time for big fingers to get used to the touch screen, but now I breeze through. I would recommend this unit for anyone looking at the I-POD or in my case, retiring a Sony MD player! Great buy!

<Title>Zen Micro Is still one of the most versital players
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have Had many MP3 players but always go back to my Zen Micro. I am using a 6gb that I purchased on ebay for a song. It had a bad headphone jack. I figured out how to fix the headphone jack problem, so now it looks and works like new. I realy like that you can remove the battery from it. All the curent models of mp3 players out there  have perminit batterys, so when the battery goes dead the player is dumpster food. I also keep a charged extra battery in the its case. I listen to audio books and the Micro has a bookmark. so you can mark your place. I do wish that the text readout was a little bigger my eyes arn't as good as they use to be, so I have to put reading glasses on to see what's on my player. I think that the Micro is a well desinged and built player.

<Title>more bang than an ipod
<Date>Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I must admit that I went to the store to pick up an ipod when the salesgirl asked me, "what do you need it to do". I hadn't thought about that, but when I told her; she suggested I check out the Micro. For the same price, I could not only download and listen to songs; but I can also record songs live and from the radio, convert files from wav to mp3 and back, and do things that a performer needs to do.  Now I don't leave home without it. I use it to record live gigs with my band, rehearsals, and sometimes auditions (I just drop it in my bag when I walk in the room). I've recorded shows I've done from the audience and the sounds come out great.  I really like this one and recommend it to anyone who is a performer or writer (I easily record my song ideas on trains, planes, buses, etc) or anyone who has to record and remember things; and they easily transfer to the computer to save or burn onto a disk.  Customer service was also great when I had a little problem with the headphone jack. They fixed it in a matter of days and sent it back out to me like brand new.

<Title>Not worth it
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have read through the other reviews but they must have been written right after buying the product. The number one rule of reviews is to do it several weeks after buying the product. I own a 6GB zen micro and the 1yr warranty that comes with the product is not enough. Within the first 2 months, I had the same headphone jack problem everyone who owns a micro will have. If you are an average Joe like me who doesn't want to take it apart and tighten whatever may be loose, YOU WILL HAVE TO SEND IT BACK.   My micro failed twice after the headphone jack issue and all within the first yr of ownership. The first was the jack, the second time was the firmware issue. I tried several things including downloading the free software online but that didn't help. The player eventually died (it wouldn't come on) and it wasn't a battery issue. I had to send it in a second time and I was very upset because it seemed like I barely had time to enjoy my player before I had to send it in to the shop again. The third time my micro failed was 1wk after the warranty was up. Since I was out of warranty, they said I had to pay [...] for service which is almost enough to buy 2 new micros!! Of course I wasn't dumb enough to take that offer. My Micro is still sitting dead and I am not a very happy customer.  The reason why I bought the Micro is because I am quite anti-apple. I was looking for a good alternative but I should have waited a little while because now there are so many other options to the I-Pod. DON'T BUY THE MICRO because YOU WILL HAVE AT LEAST THE PHONE JACK ISSUE TO DEAL WITH GUARANTEED. Also, creative products don't last long. I own headphones and speakers by creative and they all died in less than a yr after I bought them brand new from Amazon. A friend of mine sent her micro back twice within one yr and they eventually told her they couldn't fix it so she had to pay for a new one.   This isn't a 'hate' review. The Micro does offer really good features as described in other reviews. It's just that they should spend more time on R&D as well as quality and durability. Even though I will never buy an IPod, I have to admit that the IPod is built to last and is rugged. I have several friends with IPods and they have never complained or had to send it back as far as I know. I am going to try the SanDisk Sansa e-series now because I have had other SanDisk falsh products for about 3 yrs now and it still works as well as the first day I bought it.

<Content>This player has been absolutely fantastic. The battery life has been great, it has been easy to use, and the software that comes with it is easy to use. I love it so much that I bought another and gave this one to my daughter. She dropped it in the toilet and I thought it was ruined. After it dried out all I had to do was recharge the battery and it was good to go. All of the songs were still on it. It is a fantastic product!

<Title>God awful piece o' c**p!!!
<Date>Sun Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Occasionally, I can get the thing to work. Crashes on a regular basis, and doesn't always feel like rebooting. It's definitely a good thing that it has a removable battery, because otherwise I'd have to wait for the battery to die before I could reboot it. I've had to reset everything multiple times, and every so often, it decides to wipe out the DMR licenses to music I've purchased. I have to say one thing....it is better than the neeon. That I couldn't get to work for more than a month before I had to replace that. Save the money you'd spend on this paperweight for something more useful, like paying to have pitbulls rip you apart.

<Title>much glitz, little real quality
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I must be the only owner (I have the 5mb model) not to have had the earphone jack problem. But there is still much not to like. To wit: 1. touch pad is too sensitive. It's nearly impossible to get the track I want. 2. The rewind doesn't work and just jumps to the beginning of the track. 3. the battery discharges even when the player is turned off. 4. it's often hard to get the battery to recharge. It takes a bit of fiddling, removing and replacing the battery, to get it to start charging.  5. The fast forward is hard to use; it's difficult to get to where you want in the track.  On the latter point, I should explain that I listen to 1-hour news shows, not 3-minute songs, so it's important to me to be able to fast forward and rewind.   The feature of picking up where you left off only works if you leave the battery in and pick up within a particular time. If you try recharging the battery, it will come up on the right track but at the beginning of it.   The battery has gradually deteriorated since I got it (Dec 05) so that it now is hard to recharge and a charge only lasts about an hour. I just ordered a new battery and think I may have made a mistake. Wish I'd red these reviews first.

<Content>The Zen Micro is a great mp3 player. For all you faithful iPod lover's this thing kills it. I owned 3 different iPods. A 60 gig, the nano and the mini each worked pretty well. But when I decided to change to Zen I was amazed. The ipod has good sound but the Zen Micro has so much better quality not only that but the earphones are about ten times better. Only flaw is hard drive based but thats only a small problem. Go with this if given the choice and besides ipods break within a year excluding the nano.

<Content>Just bought my new MP3 player yesterday and I absolutely love it. I had an iPod and gave it to my daughter to use while she works out. She can keep it, I love the functionality of this player. A little tricky at first because of the sensitivity setting, but I set mine to low and no problems. The only other thing I would change is the menu setup. It took me a minute to figure out how to get the music library to show up on the menu and the owner's manual wasn't any help. Maybe I'm just slow like that! Overall, I'm more than pleased with the unit and I'll continue to let me daughter think she's gotten over on me...

<Title>Nice But........
<Date>Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The review by: "Mr. Leslie Brown (Sydney, NSW Australia)" was spot on, but I have a few more additions.  Pros:  - The thing is well built and quite tough. I've dropped it a few times and have expierenced no problems. It does not scratch easially. - Removeable battery. - The Micro is small and fits nicely in the hand.   Cons: - The software is a complete mess. The player must be attached via USB if you want to use the software. For example, you are unable to make playlists or move songs in or out of the software.  - The documentation included is almost worthless. There is no information on how to work the menus. One of the first pages of the "user guide" is on how to charge the unit. It states to plug in the player with the wall charger. The unit does not come with a wall charger! Later, I found a little insert that gave instructions on how to charge with the supplied USB cable. Chargers for wall and car are about $30.00 each.  Note: This is my first MP3 player, and if you are looking for your first player I suggest that you first decide what software you want to use. I have both Media Player 10 and iTunes on my system. I primarialy use iTunes because it's so easy to use. I convert the iTunes format to MP3 or WMA's so I can listen to them on my player, but that means that I have doubles of all my songs.  For me, there are too many cons to owning an iPod, so for now I have to deal with converting songs.

<Title>ALL IPODS SUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ZEN MICRO ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! USE NAPSTER TO GO AND SAVE $$$ DONT PAY 99 CENTS A SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A lot , and I mean a lot of people criticize 2go when easy to use.  I also wrote how to use 2go with any wma compatible player, that aint a ipod.  also people criticize for no guide, which I included.   SYNCING MUSIC USING NAPSTER 2GO  I have recently bought a Zen micro and have used all the different Ipods and it is the way better. My Zen came with a 30-day trail of 2go and it works great if you know the trick, many people are commenting on how Napster to go does not work.  1) the trick is to down load all the songs you want off Napster and wait until the music is done down loading.   2)then open up windows media player  3)click on the add to library button  4)a window will open up and click the top button or by searching computer  5)another window will pop up, then click the browse button  6)then another window will pop up, click the my music folder and click ok  7)a similar window will pop up and click new files only (fast)  8)all windows will close and a another window will pop up showing the music being loaded up  9)when it is finished click out of the window and select all the new music (it will be located on the bottom until you open a different folder or option) left click and click add to...  10) select sync list 11 hook your Zen to the USB port and select the sync option on windows media player, on the left will show all the song and on top will be a button that says start sync, click it  11)there should be two arrows in a circle around a music note on a piece of paper, if its gray it needs more time if its clear, then its done  you might want to up grade the new firmware that really works.  you can ask Napster for help about why music isn't showing up in wmplayer if you have a problems.  and I stongly suggest the silver because the blue backlight looks great.  If you haven't seen the Zen Micro the color is only on the front the sides and back are white.   Enjoy  INSTRUCTION BOOKLET  In the Zen's box there should a CD for the software, when you put in the CD there will a window, (too many windows i know) after you enter all the info and install, on the bottom of the window it say view under it, it says users guide, which is an adobe instruction book list.  Pros  Built in microphone Easy to use touch pad (put on low Sensitivity) Cool pulsing glow when charger You came name your Zen by going to options 12hr battery Backlight Fm radio Record fm radio too Removable and changeable battery Equalizer (if you use custom you can change the setting but rest are preset) Stellar ear buds that extremely loud w/creative products Winner of the prestigious "Best of DigitalLife 2004" and "Editor's Choice" awards from CNET, the Zen Micro continues to offer the most variety, without any compromise in features. Customize menu Date and time Alarm Create play lists on player Cons Touch screen is hard to get use to but after a few days it gets easier Charge through computer w/ basic package  Scratches easily with environmentally safe plastic  HOW TO MAKE A PLAY LIST Go to now playing and click the menu button and select the remove, click all, go to music you want on list, and click menu button (or tap scroll bar) and click the add to selected music    My friend has an Ipod and we both agree that the Zen is a better deal Cases for an Ipod are over $20 and cover the back WAHOO! Another one of my friends owns a mini and says that  zen micro is way better    I know of two other micro users in my school and they love it and hate ipods.  the only problems i've had with it is freezing up, just take out battery, and napster's site being down.  over all great product p.s. clean out micro after while using 2go it fills up fast!!!!!

The software is easy to use, and you really can use this thing without reading the instructions. You can rip your CD's or download music very easily and the tranfer is very quick. The battery lasts a very long time. There really aren't any directions on using the menus but it's not difficult to figure out. Anyone with half a brain can figure it out no problem. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I will continue to buy creative products.

<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In the box you find the Zen Micro, a carrying bag, a CD-ROM with all the needed software, a belt clip to carry the device + charging module, USB cable, two li-ion batteries and 2 headphones from Creative.  After buying this player the first thing I did was charging it until the battery was full. This went easy by using included adapter. A full-charge took about 2.5 hours.   Before you can download your MP3s to the Creative Zen Micro you will need to install the included software from Creative. Without this software you will not be able to transfer any date to your Zen. This is somewhat a drawback of this device.   During the installation one of the first things that happened was a crash. But I don't know whether it was just my PC or the software :p  I wanted to listen to my MP3s as quickly as possible because I was dying to test out my little MP3 player I just bought. The software from Creative looked a bit difficult at first because of all its different features.   You can do a lot with it but I wouldn't rate it as a very user-friendly program. The software allows you to listen to MP3s on your PC, upload them to your Zen Micro, burn a CD, watch movies and more..   A few minutes later I had transferred a fair amount of MP3s and I was ready to give it a go. I immediately noticed that the included earphones perform very well. The sound quality is very good and it the player delivers fine basses.   A lot of information is displayed on the LCD screen of this player. It tells you the songname, artist and from which CD the MP3 came. It also displays a counter. When used the players lights up blue - which is cool to see!   The menus of the Zen Micro are easy to use. You can scroll through your playlist by using the vertical touch pad. It's very sensitive but you are able to adjust this to your own needs. Confirming something needs to be done by gently ticking the touch pad.   There are also a few other buttons on this player. Above the touch pad - from left to right - the previous , play/pauze and next button. Under the touch pad there is a `go back' button on the left and a `menu options' button on the right.   On top of the player is the USB port, audio-output and a `key lock' button.   One of the other features of the Zen Micro is the ability to listen to FM-radio. This was one of the functions I like. The device is able to store up to 32 presets which you can give a custom name. The Zen Micro can also scan for radio stations with a good receivement but this function didn't work well. Some of the stations it picked still had a lot of noise.   Also included is a belt clip to carry the device while doing some sports for instance. You can also lock its keys by using the `key lock' button.   On top next to the USB port is also a small hole. This is the built-in micro which can be used to record conversations. I tested this from a close distance and from a few meters away.   The file that I recorded from a close distance was very clear and easy to understand. From a few meters away it was hard to understand because it was recorded way to silent.   Another additional feature of the Zen Micro is its calendar and its addressbook. But to use these you'll need to use Microsoft Outlook. Data can not be inserted on the device, you can only view data transferred from your PC.   Conclusion The Zen Micro from Creative is an easy to use audio player but at first you need to get used to its touchpad interface. You slowly get the feeling for it it and then it will work flawless. The included software offers a lot of options but unfortunately you are forced to use it. Because of this you can't use the Zen Micro as an external HDD because other PCs will need the software from Creative to recognize the player. And lastly the audio quality from the Creative Zen Micro can be rated is being very high.   Update:: A new firmware update from Creative fixes one of the negative points I mentioned in this review. The new update allows you to transfer files directly to your device without needing to use the Creative software.

<Title>An amazing piece of gadget
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It took me a very long time to finally decide to get an MP3 player due to the many options that I have.  However, I'm very glad that I waited this long to decide to get the Creative Zen Micro.  I think I got the best deal as far as features, quality, and cost.  I especially got a $50 automatic rebate from a "huge, electronic store" (which I won't mention here) and I can't be any more happier.  I can't believe that there are still stores that are selling the 5GB for almost $200, and I got a $50 rebate for the 6GB which is much less (cost-wise) than the 5GB!  I've had the Zen Micro for about a month now and I'm loving it more and more so I'm doing a review here for all of you.  I definitely recommend this to everyone.  FEATURES that I like: *The equalizer.  It's great to have an equalizer that you can customize and it has a 5-band one.  Also, it has a bunch of preset EQ from rock to pop to disco, jazz to classical, etc.  *Search for playlists, artists, genres, album, etc.  *It tallys the most popular tunes that you play.  Everytime you play a song, it adds a "1 count" to it.  You can even view how many times a song is played so you can even cheat! :-)  The DJ function lists the TOP 20 songs :)  *It has a "play mode" to shuffle (random).  Shuffle works within whatever playlist you are in, or shuffle EVERYTHING.  I love this!  *It has an FM radio and it can automatically scan every available radio station wherever you are located.  Hey, that *other* MP3 player doesn't have one! :-)  *You can bookmark 10 of your favorite songs.  *The Zen Micro works very well with Realplayer Jukebox.  It's so easy to copy songs from Realplayer to the Micro by just "dragging and dropping" playlists or songs.  *It has an onboard microphone for recording memos/notes to yourself like a voice recorder.  *It has an organizer with calendar, tasks, contact to synchronize with Creative Sync Manager.  *It can be used as a removable external disk drive.  FEATURES I don't like much:  *The touch pad was way too sensitive when I first got it.  After getting used to the sensitivity of the pad, it's not much of an issue anymore.  You WILL get used to it in about 3 days or so.  You can change the sensitivity to LOW if you'd like, though.  *The bass on the sound isn't too great.  The volume is loud, but the bass is something that needs to be improved on the next upgrade.  Overall, I'm very happy with the Creative Zen Micro despite of the 2 negative things I said above.  It's very worth the money I paid for and it has more features that anyone can expect in an MP3 player.  I highly recommend it!

Stopped excepting new music two (2) months after repair. Rebuilding the library caused it to erase all music placed on the device the previous day. Had to place music on it every day and try to keep it on all day. finally, stopped altogether... replaced it with iAudio 6, which did somewhat the same.

<Title>A little quirky sometimes but sounds great
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to use mainly with the Rhapsody subscription service and my own private collection.  MP3s and WMAs that I ripped from my own collection are easy to load and play great.  I have had several instances of the player not being able to find the licences to play the Rhapsody tracks.  Once the license expires (after a month or so) you have to delete the tracks and reload them.  The other thing is that the time and date on the Zen have to exactly match the time and date on the computer your are downloading from or the files will not play.  I took a while to figure this one out.  Some how the time has gotten changed on the Zen a few times without me realizing it. I don't know if I let the battery get too low or if it was caused by removing the battery or what but from now on when the files will not play the time and date are the first things I will check.   I used the Zen almost exclusivly in my two cars to play through the aux inputs and the sound is incredible.  The reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 are the synchronization problems stated above and the control panel - when you are sitting still it's pretty easy to navigate but it is almost impossible to do while driving (and you thought cell phones were dangerous!)  That brings up a cool feature of this player - the data storage funcion.  I have set up a portion of the players hard drive to act as data storage which I loaded with mp3s.  On of my Kenwood head units has a USB input which I plug the Zen into and I can then control the music through the head unit.  You could also use this feature to transfer large files between computers. As a side note, I've been using the Zen for about nine months and I have yet to have a problem with the headphone jack.

<Title>Great While It Lasted...
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Micro for over a year now, and when it worked, I loved it! However, I'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue; the sound is output in layers, and I am constantly trying to "reposition" my headphones to get full sound. My husband called Creative Labs for assistance, and he was told that it would cost him [...] per month for a "customer service subscription." After reading these reviews, it seems we'd be paying Creative Labs [...] so that they could tell us there's nothing they can (or will) do. Next brand, please...

<Title>zenner
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched various MP3 players and chose Zen for recording capability, FM radio, replacable battery and format compatability. I came across complaints from people about the headphone thing, but I have not had that issue. As for battery life...I played it throught my home stereo, it lasted about 8 hours before I turned it off, it may have lasted another hour or so looking at the battery hourglass monitor. As for the battery lasting 2 hours...I think the volume people play their MP3 players affects how must the battery is eaten up, but 2 hours is odd. I think like any product,some will have success, others will have misery. It's a crap shoot.PS: I had issues with Rhapsody too. Now  I use Yahoo with no problems!

<Title>Creative Sound quality with some HFE problems
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used the Zen Micro (6GB) for about 4-5 months now and I am satisfied with the product. There is a lot of storage space to carry all the songs and most importantly the sound quality is excellent. Sound quality has as much to do with the earphones as with the player itself and I am more than satisfied with both. The interface on the player is easy to use and directory structure, etc. is clear. The interface (button) sensitivity is easily adjustable which helps, especially while travelling.   On the negative side, the human factor engineering could use some development. I have consistantly found it difficult to access the storage (Data as opposed to music) difficult to access and retrive data from. However, the software controls for loading music on the player is simple and easy to use.   All in all, given the excellent sound quality I declare myself a satisfied customer and I may consider another Creative product in the future.

It was super easy to install, works with RealPlayer and Windows Media Player.  Also works great with Belkin Tunecast for the car.

Not only is this Zen cheaper it stores more music and dont worry about how thick it is. It make the Zen more durrable because I have dropped mine many many times and it works perfect. The only problem I have ever had with this product is. That after 3 months the left earphone would not work so i sent it back and its perfect now. It also has Great sound qualiy.

<Content>One main selling point for me. I was orginaly going to get an iPod Nano (I was caught up in the "iPod rules all" craze), but one of my friends told me to take a look at Creative. When I saw this baby, I knew it was for me. I mean, you can get a 2 GB Nano for the same price as a 6 GB.  A few other things that are nice about this lil' gadget are the orginizer, FM Radio/recorder, voice recorder, and customizable menus-another great thing.  I suggest to anyone who is looking at a Nano to check out Creative's lil' powerhouse.

<Content>Most newer mp3 players dont require any software install, they are recognized as a storage unit, you drag and drop mp3 files to them and they play.  But this does not appear to work on the zen micro.  One has to install their software first in order to transfer mp3 files.  Why?  It makes no sense to me.  And if you do enable the unit as a removable drive and drag mp3 files to it, they wont play!  WUWT?  Is there a law against ease-of-use?

<Title>AmAzinG & Deflinitely CREATIVE !
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me 1st say that this is 1 of the best MP3 Players out there... If the Creative Zen could be improved a little more it would out beat the iPod like nothing. In my case I wanted somethin unique... every1 I know that has an Mp3 Player has a type of ipod so i went to get something different... and it turns out that the Creative is  better than the iPod and other skimpy mp3's.  Here is what I thought of this product:  THE PROS: 1) Has a built in Radio, very good quality 2) Has a built in Microphone, record anything & Also you can record from the redio 3) Organizer - (you have to write in the organizer thru a software on the computer then transfer it to the Creative) 4) Great Quality Sound. 5) Accepts songs in MP3,WMA, WAV(u mite want to convert this to wma or mp3 because it takes up ALOT of space when u put it in the Creative) Formats 6) User-Friendly with organizing songs thru software 7) stores DATA files, so it works like a memory card, that you can easily use. THE CONS (now this is why I rated it 4 stars) 1) scroll and enter button is too sensitive & is one button. (this is not so bad) Its just that when u wants to select like letters (or to set the date and time) and you are scrolling it, the same button works as a enter button so it enters when u dont wnat it to. What I suggest is to make the enter button as a different button like the PLAY button. 2)I REALLY Would like if the playlist could be grouped by Artist. Similarly how it is grouped alphabetically, they should make an option so that u can group the set of ALL songs by Artist or Album.        OVERALL I WOULD SAY CREATIVE ZEN IS MUCH BETTER THAN AN IPOD OR OTHE MP3'S. IT HAS MORE FEATURES AND IS MORE STYLISH. SO GO OUT THERE AND GET A CREATIVE ZEN !

<Title>End of the honeymoon
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is actually my first MP3 player. I wasn't going with the crowd on the ipod, but I knida wish I had. At first the thing seemed great. Not too big with a lot of space. I liked how you can organize things, but don't know how this compares to other players.   However, after a while the button sensitivity seemed to freak out a bit. Too light and it doesn't pick it up, to hard and you've just pushed it twice. Sometimes hard of soft touch doesn't work I just have to keep pushing it repeatedly to get it too work, only to have pushed the button twice again according to the micro. This is the main problem though, the music cuts out. After having it for a while I would start to lose part of the sound if the headphone jack was moved slightly. Over time it got worse and now I have to twist the jack until I find just the right position or I loose all sound. So pretty much I can't walk or even shift my weight too much while listening to this thing. Which is really bad for me because I go running a lot. My brother and sister don't have as much trouble with theirs, but they do  loose half the sound if the jack is in the wrong position. I've had it about 6 months now, but only had a 3 month warranty. So, I'm looking into an ipod with some Christmas money. And a very very good warranty.

We have two computers, one with Windows 98SE, the other with XP, and neither one can load the software successfully and recognize that the player is plugged in, and I have to wait 48 hrs. for any customer service?

<Title>IT RUINED MY CHRISTMAS
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>IF I COULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS, I WOULD!!  I had obsessed over getting a Creative Zen Mirco for the past year, that's why I was so excited to find it under my tree on christmas.  It was the greatest feeling in the world but it slowly turned into the greatest dissapointment...  THE CONS  --Software The software is Terriable! The worst ever. It set up just fine but when I tried to put songs on it everything went wrong.  The software didn't reconize the device, the software froze the computer, just everything was a mess.  So I ended up spending christmas day trying to fix it, and I was not happy.  --Costumer Service Okay so after all this i try calling the company, no there not open on christmas.  Fine, I understand there not open.  The next day I call and there still not open! So after getting fed up I go online and check there hours. 9am-6pm Centural Time *Not open on hoildays or the day after hoildays So I send an email.  They wirte back and its in another langauage!! In there email they tell me directions using terms only a rocket scientist would know!! There Costumer service stinks!  --The Product Overall theres nothing speical about it.  It doesnt even have a colored screen.  In the stores it only comes in black.  And the touch pad takes a while. to get used too.  --The Earbuds So with this terriabe product they could at least put in some nice headphones but no.  They have to throw in the worst made headphones known to man!  --The USB The USB is only 20 3/4 inches.  It cant reach far and its a piece of junk! It's also the only way to charge the Creative Zen Mirco.  If I don't have a computer handy, how do I charge it?  Well you can go to their website and buy one!  What a rip-off  But I guess in the end there are a few pros  THE PROS  ++Good Sound Quaility ++Sleek Design ++Great Value ++Good storage  So far I am not happy and I wish I could get mine to work.  I need help and the stupid service won't even help me.  If I can't get it to work by tomorrow I'm trading it in for an ipod nano because at least they work!

<Title>I like it,even though I`m not Buddhist (Zen)
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>What`s with the Buddhism push on these electronics items nowadays? Somebody else calls theirs "Karma". At any rate (and I do rate - 4 out of 5 stars!) This really is a great player. Let me mention the few things I don`t like first,even though they`re fairly minor:  1)The white back and the gloss-black "spray-paint-looking" front. 2)The touchy touchpad. Hey! The touchpad`s touchy! BWAHAHAHA!! 3)Should be a few "instant access" buttons like for FM and record. Menu somewhat "cumbersome" (for our Maryland friends!)  I like mine though. A lot. This is my first hard-drive based MP3 player,and the fact that it plays MP3s perfectly without squawking and chirping in the audio (like the flash players I`ve had) is great. I don`t know how to act! Don`t have to record everything in WMA anymore,even though this unit will play that format as well. There have not been any glitches in the sound or in the functions of the unit at all. (At first I could not get the software to install on my computer,but that problem went away after I deleted I-tunes and some other Apple-related program.) Battery life is really good. The volume level is JUST loud enough on my headphones,which I didn`t think it would be at first,due to the non-linearity of the volume bar to actual expected volume. The display is easy to read,although monochrome.  Some people have complained about the headphone jack,and there may be an issue with mine later on,but people need to realize something: With ever-decreasing circuit board size,integrity of solder-on connectors and jacks has to diminish somewhat,because they are bulky and heavy,and vibration-sensitive when attached to a dinky little board. Headphone jacks cannot be made any smaller,so they are going to be a problem on lots of things. As an electronics repair tech,I can tell you jacks break loose on nearly everything these days. Jacks are the connection point between the delicate internal world and the rough and tumble outside world. A permanent fix would be to bond the jack to the case,then run wires from it to the board. But items are not hand-built anymore,so it`s just wishful thinking. So if it breaks loose,just pop it apart and resolder it to the board! :)  Overall,it`s worth the money,and most people will be happy with this unit. Especially if you concentrate on the important things,like sound quality,features,and capacity.

<Title>many pros, many cons
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is based on the 5GB model.   The Zen player has some big advantages over the ipod. It is easy to use w/many different types of software (you don't need itunes). The sound quality is good and it's easy to hook it up to any set of speakers using the headphone jack. However, it has also some major glitches: the hard drive seems pretty vulnerable to crashing. I had one player that stopped working just in time for me to get it replaced in the one-year warranty. My replacement player was a little stickier than the first one but it worked pretty well until its hard drive just crashed for no good after about 9 months. So...as one reviewer said, there are some pretty serious problems with this player, but customer service is OK. I recommend getting the extension of the warranty because you can almost bet that this player will break if you use it much. Despite these problems, the next mp3 player I buy will probably be another creative zen micro, in hopes that the newer models will have worked out the kinks.   My much cheaper creative player with a flash drive works way better.

<Title>First MP3 Player and I love it!
<Date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Zen for almost a year now.  It has given me no problems whatsoever and integrates seamlessly with my PC.  The sould quality is great especially with the Zen Micro TravelDock (which I couldn't live without).  It's easy to use, has many playing modes, FM radio, cool blue backlight.  Only problem is........I've filled it up.  So, low and behold, I bought another one.  This time an 8 GB Zen Micro Photo.  Now I can store my soothing new age and classical on one Zen, and all of my more upbeat music on the other; plus photos (awesome).  I can't wait to get my new one loaded.  I also purchased an I-River FM Transmitter so I can hear my tunes in my car.  I haven't tried it out yet, but will review it here on Amazon when I do.  I stongly suggest that you get this MP3 player.  I've never used an iPod, but feel that I don't need to.  The Zen does everything I want it to do.

<Title>What's an iPod?
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned this mp3 player for over a year and have used it almost daily.  I have to admit, in terms of price, this is the best hard-drive mp3 player you could get for your money.  Sure, iPods have more eye-candy and if you like iTunes, then an iPod is probably the way to go.  However, if you use regular mp3 files and wma files, then I highly recommend this.  The sound is excellent.  With an equalizer and great volume controls, you won't be disappointed with the quality of the sound.  The one thing you have to get rid of, however, is the ear buds.  Don't blame Creative though, I've never seen a company issue high-quality or even decent quality ear buds with their mp3 players.    I also think that the handling of this mp3 player is much easier and faster than an iPod.  You can set the speed and sensitivity of the touchpad, so anyone can configure it according to his or her needs.  It doesn't take a long time to get used to and it's very easy to use once you get the hang of it.  I prefer it over iPod's wheel-style controls anyday.    The space is perfect.  For most of us, it wouldn't make sense to get a huge capacity mp3 player because of this reason: technology gets old.  By the time a few years pass, that $300, 80 gigabyte mp3 player you bought will be obsolete.  If you get this, however, it'll get old but at least you won't have spent a fortune.    Regarding the battery life: yes, the battery may seem to have a lot less life than advertised.  However, keep in mind that all companies follow this battery scheme.  Basically, the company loads a very large playlist and leaves the mp3 player on.  After a certain number of hours, the battery dies and the number of hours surpassed is recorded.  For most people, this is not exactly true.  For most of us, we have to fiddle with the volume, change songs, turn the player on/off, switch menus, etc.., which all drain battery life, especially with the backlight enabled.  So yes, theoretically, the battery could last 12 hours if under the best conditions.  Realistically, however, it's about half of that for most of us.   Finally, there are enough extras to keep anyone happy.  You could use this mp3 player as a USB flash drive(up to 4gb!), voice recorder, contact list, and even an alarm!    I absolutely love this mp3 player and when this one gets obsolete (it will) I'm going to buy another mp3 player from Creative.

After only normal use this player developed the same headphone jack problem that thousands of other suckers reported.

The bottom line - don't buy a Creative product because they don't stand behind their own (shoddy) work.  Spend a little more for a QUALITY product

<Title>Serious Problems.
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this player from Best Buy and thought that I had gotten a good deal. The battery life is very misleading. A charge overnight is supposed to give you 12 hours of battery life. With normal menu usage and about 600 songs the battery life dropped to maybe 2 hours.   For the first two and a half months the player was fine and there was no trouble. Now my player freezes up within minutes of turning it on. The tech support from Creative is practivally non existent. I will have to send it in for repairs and hopefully have a better time. Thank God I bought the service plan from Best Buy.

<Title>Poor Quality Control
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The player itself gets 4.5 stars, but the quality control/documentation gets 0.  The player itself seems to work fine once I got it working.  The controls take some getting used to.  The USB cord is ridiculously too short, especially since they recommend not using a hub.  A belt clip would have been nice, too.  There are apparently two versions of firmware for the player.  Version 1 is the basic one that allows the player to work on Windows 98SE, 2000, ME and XP.  Version 2 is the PlaysForSure enabled version that allows (allegedly) full compatibility with many subscription services and Windows Media Player (a big advantage over the ipod which currently does not support this).  The catch is that Version 2 only works on XP at this time.  The MP3 player I received was shipped with version 2 firmware.  Luckily I use XP, but those without it are stuck with a player that doesn't work.  You can downgrade to version 1, but you need an XP system to do it!  Additionally, the Zen Micro Media Explorer has two versions, one for Version 1 firmware and one for Version 2 firmware.  My player was shipped with the software for version 1 firmware, consequently the software didn't recognize the version 2 firmware on my MP3.  I had to download the corrected software and finally I got everything working.  On the plus side, Creative has a nice website with troubleshooting tips (none that helped here), plenty of downloadable updated software, and a user forum that was invaluable to helping me get things figured out.  Creative needs to communicate clearly what firmware to use with which software and operating system.  Their biggest blunder was shipping a player that can only be used on XP despite the box saying it could be used on 98SE,ME,2000,XP.  This is unacceptable and I'll think long and hard about buying their products again.

<Content>Great product.  I've had it for a little over half a year now and it still works..never had any problems and was very easy to use.  ++ Light up screen ++ Great software ++ Easy to put songs on ++ Affordable ++ More space than the Nano and Mini although they are in the same price range ++ Great Sound Quality  -- Touch pad is sensative -- Headphones that were supplied were uncomfortable (just my opinion)   Great product, cheap, very trendy looking.   You'll be happy you purchased this!

<Title>Close but, half a cigar.
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this for Christmas and was pretty excited about using it right away. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't. A few things bothered me about it.  One of the top ones would be I couldn't connect or "sync" it to my computer.  I fiddled around with the thing for a day or so and then called Creative customer support(which by the way is not a free 800 number. I advise using a prepaid card or something.) I called as soon as the offices opened and was only waiting for about fifteen minutes. The tech support guy told me to go through various menus on the player and my computer and came to the conclusion that I needed to download windows service pack 2. With my dial-up connection it would take around 20 hours! So to put my music on it I have to have a friend with a high-speed connection save it to a flash drive first and then port it to my pc. Another draw back is that it can only charge with the supplied USB cable. There is no included charger as there is with the 5 gig model. Since I have a laptop computer, I couldn't get it to fully charge. I left it connected to my computer for over five hours and it's only supposed to take three. I have since tried again and switched the lock switch on while it charged and it worked. Full Charge! It does have an FM recorder though.  I've been able to record programming from an xm radio 2 go by transmitting music over it's FM transmitter and recording it on to the player. This will work ok for now until I get it going.     Negatives aside though, I love the player. It is extremely cool. The back of it is white, but it looks good with the dark blue at least in my opinion. It also has this cool little water drip graphic on the back. I haven't had a problem with the touch pad sensitivity at it's default setting at all.  The menus are pretty good too. You can customize them to display the things you want.The only thing that really bothered me was the fricken ear buds. They are BIG! They also have a little fuzzy covering on them that I found was great for pushing out your ear lobe and making the inside of your ear itchy. I took those off of the buds and that makes them a more comfortable fit. Problem now is they tend to fall out easier which isn't to big a deal. The sound quality on them is surprisingly good though. The player isn't super prone to scratches either. The back might be but you can't tell because it's white. I suppose you could squint really hard to find a scratch on the back but if you do that, frankly, you've got problems. The front of it won't get scratched because of the weird texture on the touchpad. The screen could but it won't easily like I've heard an IPOD does. I'm not going to name off all the features because that's in another review. So let me get straight to the point.   If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the IPOD then this is it. The player is great and I love it. Even though I have been critical of the flaws, this device is a winner. The downside would be the crappy device to computer interface and the trouble getting started.  After that It's all gravy. If you do get it I suggest buying an AC adapter. I have not been able to find them at any retail store so far so save yourself the time and gas and just get it off of the Creative website. If you have trouble then don't waste anytime and call the creative helpline. I would definitely recomend over IPOD. Happy listening.

<Title>Give it a month or two...
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I opened up my zen micro and I thought it was AMAZING.  It is small, light weight, cool touchpad, and I thought it was perfect.  I had read the reviews about how after a few months of use the headphone jack would kind of give out, and you would only be able to hear one frequency.  I thought that I would be careful enough, and this problem wouldn't happen to mine.  WRONG.  I was so careful with my player.  I had it in a case, I carried it carefully, I didn't put in my pockets, I never dropped it, etc.  5 months after having it, the headphone jack went bad, and now I have to jiggle it to find the perfect position so that I can hear.  Its not the headphones, I replaced those and still had the same problem.  Then a couple months after the headphone jack initially went bad, the player started acting really annoying. It would randomly turn on, and I would go to use it and the battery would be dead because it had been playing while I was away.  ANNOYING!  Then, it got so bad, that it would randomly turn on, I would turn it off, then it would turn on again, and so on.  Now, I have to take the battery out just to turn it off, and I keep it out until I'm ready to use it.  What a HASSLE.  I figured out that it has something to do with the headphone jack, which is right next to the on off switch.  I think inside the player, the headphone jack is rubbing up against the on off switch which causes it to turn on.  So, taking the headphones out of it when its not being used does help a little, but thats kind of annoying to have to do, and I think it losens the jack even more, which in turn, makes it worse when you want to listen to it.  This player also locks up every once in a while, which means you have to take the battery out, put it back in, and wait for it to do its thing and get back to normal.  You can definitely get a much better player for just a few bucks more, and I would definitely recommend doing so.  I wouldn't base your decision on the reviews by the people who just got their Zen Micro a few days ago, or even a few weeks ago, because as I said, its a pretty good player the first couple months.  Don't buy this player!

<Title>I know they seem cool, but RUN AWAY!!!
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was a huge fan of the Zen Micro when I first got mine.  In fact, I loved it so much I bought one for my wife for her birthday, and then my 14 year old son got one for his birthday too.  Within three months all three of the hard drives broke.  Each had the same problem.    The worst was when we called Creative for service, they refused to honor the warranty because we did not have the original receipts.  We offered to show bank records of the purchase, but that was not good enough  because the cancelled check did not show what we purchased.    We sent the broken units back anyway, and they did not fix them.  So now we have invested $750.00 for nothing.  I would have been fine if they had even offered to fix it for a small fee or something, but their attitude was that we were out of luck.  Who keeps receipts for three months? Well if you buy a Zen Micro, you better!  It was such a disappointment because the product was cool.    Also, even before it breaks, if you want to use it with a subscription service, get ready for a real project on the computer with plenty of system freezes and frustration.  I do miss my Zen Micro, but I'm getting over it.  Avoid the heartbreak and buy an IPOD.  At least Apple will stand behind their product.

<Title>Disapointment
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this the other day and was excited that a mp3 player with such large storage had a fm radio tuner which is great because I travel a lot so I get more music out of my mp3 player. When I got home and installed the 'Creative MediaSource' I spent 5 hours trying to get my music from iTunes into it. Only 350 went in out of  1,348, then it started to delete songs off of my computer. Just all by it's self it errored out at least 200 and deleted 100 without any sign. The 'songs' that were now in the 'creative' mediaSoure were mostly old podcasts and music tripled. I really love the zen, it looks great, love the blue with the black and the fading when it idles the headphones are awesome, but I'm going to have to turn to the iPod. Something that is in print 'Compatible with iTunes'

<Content>Go to their website; under support user's forum, search: zen micro headphone jack defective.   You will see 875 reasons not to buy this junk. The first article is on how to fix your defective ZEN with a glue gun and a soldering iron,..and it has 875 hits,..well, 876 including me now. What a club of losers I now belong to. I seriously suspect that all these folks giving rave reviews have not owned their ZENs very long. I loved it when I first got it, too.   Then I searched the creative website,..they say "we have not yet determined if the headphone jack is defective"...great way to treat your customers, folks. You need to fire your QC manager ASAP for spoiling the reputation of your brand. And own up to the defect, on your website,..and fix our broken ZENs, regardless of warranty or receipts, etc,..or you're going to have zero customers in a couple years.

<Content>I'm on my third one in less than a year. The first one came with "black sand" under the screen. Returned it next day. The second one failed with the headphone jack cutting out. Sent it back for warranty repair, they sent me back a different unit. Last nite the third one failed with the headphone jack cutting out, same as the second one. There's not a single scratch on this thing, I treated all three like the wonderously expensive babies that they are. This third one is hardly used at all!  Oh, and have fun racking up a fortune in long-distance phone calls to get the return info! I've spent so much time redialing, and on hold, and at the post office, I think I could have bought another MP3 player with the cell-phone HOURS I've wasted. Once you get through to their service center at the Carl Sagan base-station on Mars, be sure to have a linguist and phone amplifier on site or you'll go insane. Your "very important call" will be dumped once you get to the fifth or sixth level of their voice mail system, so be sure to have the model and serial number and purchase date, etc, memorized, as you'll be needing them over and over and over again.  I am not going to bother returning this third Creative Zen,..I just lost 250 bucks for a year of frustration. It's obviously a defective product,..so why should I waste another week in long distance phone calls just to exchange it for another piece of garbage.  This would have been a fantastic gadget had it worked. Unfortunately, ALL THREE of mine did not.

<Content>So far, I have had this product for 8 months and have not had a single problem with it. I have heard of some people complaining about the headphone jack dying, but that never happened with me. It is very small and light ( although a little thick) which makes it very easy to carry around.  It was so much cheaper than the iPods and it has more memory than them. I hope that it continues to work this well.

<Title>Windows 98SE users beware!
<Date>Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zen Micro does NOT, as Creative's website and the package both indicate, work with Windows 98 Second Edition.  Wanting more storage, I bought the Micro after spending several months being extremely pleased with the Zen Nano Plus.  But the only way (using W 98 SE) to transfer music to the Micro is with Windows Media Player 9 (ugh), and then only in WMA format (ugh).  Not mp3, as stated in the description.  Plus, you can't rip directly from CD.  You have to copy into wmp9 first, and then into the player.  The included Zen Micro Media Explorer does not recognize the device.  After searching the forums at Creative's site, it became obvious that they have known about this problem for over a year.  Spoke with a tech support rep who knew all about the problem, said all Micros are shipped with firmware that only works with XP, and cannot be 'downgraded' to a version compatible with 98SE.  He suggested going out and buying Windows XP.  He also tried selling me the extended warranty.  Ha ha.  It turns out that by using the absolute highest bitrate, both into WMP9 and then into the player, nearly all of the songs sound pretty good.  NOT through headphones, though.  (Not really an issue since the Micro gets used mainly thru the car stereo.)  Through headphones (decent ones) there's a high-pitched squeal for a few seconds at the start of each track, apparently due to EM interference from the disk drive.  So be wary of the Micro, and if you have Windows 98SE, don't even bother.

<Title>Very poor PC integration
<Date>Sun Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What an awful integration with XP!  The syncronization is problematic. I got errors like "General error" during the syncronization with XP. What is one supposed to deduce from such a detailed error? This is not something I would expect from a mature product, and it is not something I ever got with my iPod.  If you want to hear podcasts, you will have to use their ZenCast software. This product is, at best, in the beta stage. I found it impossible to sync the Zen Micro with the software.   All in all, I would say that the iPod is a much better product.

<Title>Zen Micro
<Date>Wed Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been disapointed in this player.  It was given as a gift eight months ago, and I am now returning it to the manufacturer for service.  A few days ago, the player froze mid-song and crashed.  I was unable to get it to reboot by either removing and then replacing the battery or using the website-recommended "reformat"/ "reboot" function.  Upon reading other reviews and talking with others who have owned this product, this is apparently a VERY common problem--one friend had the same thing happen with TWO consecutive products. Fortunately, I am still under the 1 year warranty period, and although the company wants to charge a minimum of $12.99 per customer service call, they do offer free email support.    Aside from this problem, the controls are awkward (the touch screen takes some getting used to, but it's bearable), and the playing options are frustrating.  For instance, the player does not allow you to shuffle all songs by a certain artist--you must navigate to that artist, then navigate to a particular album and are able to play only those songs.  The software does not support an option to view all tracks on the player without grouping them into individual artists/albums, so if you're looking for a particular song, you must navigate through the artist/album first.  Add to this, the battery life is also somewhat less than advertised.  Overall, this player is NOT to be recommended.

<Title>Tried to buck the trend and paid the price...
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So I decided to be different and get a Zen rather than an Ipod.  I read the reviews, and was attracted to the replaceable battery, built in radio and extra storage space.  Certainly the Zen looks great on paper, then you get get one...   Let's start with ergonomics, the "touch pad" controls while having a gee wiz component are entirely impractical in the real world.  You cannot even graze the front of this thing without it stopping, fast-forwarding etc., so you have to lock the touch-pad to keep it in your pocket, holder etc.  Only problem there is you now have take it back out and unlock every time you actually DO want to fast forward etc.  Also, Creative does not make ANY gym/excercise holder for this model despite it being 3 years in production. Next is the operating system and software.  The Creative media source software is actually really good, it mirrors Apple's very closely, but here is the problem...Creative does not have an online music store, and the software will not work with ANY of the online stores to manage your song list, i.e., Windows Media Player, Itunes, Napster, etc. So unless you want to keep importing new downloads twice (once with whatever store, and then again into the Creative song list)the only solution is to install a new OS from Microsoft that works with Windows Media and Napster, but this new OS does not let you use the old software at all, and does not import your song lists, etc., also Windows Media player is terrible for managing this, it keeps re-importing songs you have removed and generates errors every time you synch.  So I finally reached my frustration point and got a new Ipod last week.  It just kicks the [...] out of the Zen players for the above reasons and also sound quality.  I am a musician so I think my ear is discerning. The Ipod has a built in EQ with 20 different sound modes, and the depth and detail of the sound is just well beyond what the Zen can produce.

<Content> I've had my zen for about a year and a half. It would freeze up once in a while so i would take out the battery and it would work fine. It froze up on me, i took out the battery and put it back in, and the screen said Hardware Problem. I tryed to get customer service, but since the warrenty ran out i'm not entitled to on line customer service, the won't help. You can however call a number, the charge is 29.99 $ for 1/2 of service for only ONE issue, hope you don't have more than one. I will never buy a creative  product again. My opinion is even though your warrenty is expired, customer support should still help, for FREE.

<Title>YOU'RE GONNA BE VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OKAY HERE IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ZEN MICRO: (What Creative doesn't want you to know) 1)Battery life, you'll get your 12 hours if you only have about 10 songs on in. The battery life DRAMATICLY DECREASES upon usage. I only had about 400 songs (around 1gb) and an overnight charge gets me about 1 hour of music.   2)It's gonna crash, and Creative have the worse tech support. 3)Did I mention,Terrible battery life! Other than that it's cute,has FM radio and doubles as a flash drive, but again your only gonna get about 2 months out of it, so does that matter! (Oh yeah and tech support doesn't care!)  So if you are looking for a TEMPORARY mp3 player, go with the Micro. Only if u need it for about umm 2 MONTHS then it's dead!Please shop around, maybe the Ipod isn't as bad as we think it is.....

<Title>GET THIS! ITS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPENT!
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In this review,I will go over the player itself,controls,durability,controls,etc.                 OPENING THE BOX/ACCESSORIES  This,and every other mp3 player on the market,in no doubt the funnest part. When you open the box,there are 2 flaps concealing the mp3 and the accessories.Inside the box contains the following:  1.Creative Zen Micro 2.USB/CHARGER cable 3.Silk Baggy(this is completely useless,and looks kind of gay) 4.start-up CD/SOFTWARE(no hassle,really,just very time-consuming to download) 5.Earbuds(the sound quality is very good for packaged-earbuds,but are quite big on the side-may not satisfy everyone)                           NOTE:               If you go to www.creative.com,click on mp3 players,and go to the micro section then click on accessories,there is a leather case you can purchase for around $30 dollars.This is pricey on the hand,but it is made out of very nice leather,also has a screen cover built-in to the item itself)  I think thats about it for the accessories-I may be forgetting something,but im to lazy to check LOL.                      THE ZEN MICRO  Now for the player itself. MANY people like it(I do a lot) but MANY people don't. The reason being is because there are reported hardware failures,freezes on the player,on and off by itself,no picture on the screen,, and the most infamous of them all- the headphone jack!(dum dum duuuuuuuuuum). This is the worst of them all-mostly because after several months the headohne jack usually died out on the users. Now,thats was more in 2004,when the player was brand new. Everything has been fixed by creative.Well,still some freezes,but for the most part,its all good. And now for the hands-on review of the player. In order to download ANY song to the micro,you MUST have the software downloaded into your computer(the software is included) though I didnt mind,it did take quite a while for to get through the whole process itself.In other words,its just flat-out time consuming.But,not everythings perfect. I recommend charging it before doing any downloading to it. When you put on the player for the first time,I have to tell ya,it takes a good 10-15 seconds for it just to turn on! now,I love this thing,but thats unnacceptable. But youll be paying attention more toward the features than the time to load up. A very nice touch is that awesome blue-glow. That is one of the most unique things ive seen in an mp3 player in a while. When you look at the menu(if you havent seen the ipods menu)its ver much alike. Now if you havent,thats OK,i got you covered. The menu consists of Music Library,Now Playing,Play Mode,FM Radio,Extras,and System.It has a cuple of things to get you started out in the listening-area,with its creative demo ,commercial, and sound testing. Unless you download any songs to it ,thats about it for the menu part.                              THE DESIGN  As mentioned before,it has a blue-glow affect,mostly surrounding the edge of the player.When its charging(I find this so sweet) is it has a breathing-glow like affect. When you you actually hold the thing,Its short and thick.This isnt actually a bad thing at all because with its also well-built design,you have a very compact type-feeling affect goin on. Ive personally dropped the player about 5 times on flat-out concrete-and its STILL living! Now of course it suffered its nicks and scratches(thats why I got the case he he ) its still fully functional-which is a great thing because I drop things on accident quite a bit. The touchpad is actually a gimmick(in my opinion) of the ipods scroll-wheel.But,of course,not in a bad way.Instead of circles,its strictly up and down. I prefer this no doubt over the ipods scroll wheel,I can never get the hang of that thing. There are sensitivity settings on this thing,which consists of Low,Medium,and High. Now it does take a little bit to get used to(the touchpad),but its very different and unique compared to other players out there.                                       FM/VOICE CAPABILTITIES  I dont understand why the ipod hasnt done this yet=its so hogh-tech wih all the other feature it HAS to have them-but no-they dont. The voice-recording is a very nice feature to the product,making short notes and meetings a breeze to record.The sound quality is very nice for the recording,considering how crappy other player manage to scoop out. The FM isnt terrible-depending where you are. Most of the time it flat out sucks. But,for what it is,you cant really ask for any better than that.                               THE SOUND  Kind of more in the zen micro section,but,eh,who cares? The sound is the best ive ever heard on an mp3 player.And yes,it does beat the ipod in sound quality.The volume can go up to 25,but is good at around 10-15.                             THE CONCLUSION  YES!!!! THE CONCLUSION!!! AFTER ALMOST AN HOUR OF TYPING-IM DONE!!!!!!!!!!YAY!!!!!!!!!!!............ aaaanywho. I really hope all this info helped you to get a better idea about what this player all about. To the touch pad to the design,the easy-to-use interface and to the features,please consider getting this player,and overall it stands strong at 5 out of 5. Please decide if this was helpful or not. Later!

Makes everything sound washed out and flat -No way to attach to a wriststrap -Included carrying bag is too big for player, the play flops around in it.  Overall, its a good mp3 player.  The software setup is complicated, you have to install the software, then update the firmware of the Zen Micro after you restart for the PC to see it. Took me a while to figure that out.. But once its all setup, transferring music with WMP10 or other programs is simple and straightforward.

<Title>Love my zen micro
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Although I have only had my zen micro for a month, I am thoroughly enjoying it and have not experienced any problems.  The storage capability is what really sold me, but the sound quality is excellent as well.  Yes, the touchpad is sensitive, but I got adjusted to it within the same day of receiving it, so problem solved.

<Title>Overall very happy with my purchase
<Date>Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This has been a very good mp3 player for me. A large enough size to fit most people's taste. Lots of features and excellent sound quality.  The down side is the touch screen-ish interface which is too sensitive IMHO ... even when low sensitivity is selected. Also you have to update the firmware and software and its not that user friendly until everything is updated.  I'd highly recommend this product to people very comfortable using a computer, but if you want a no-brainer ... this isn't it.  If I lost mine today I'd still buy the same one again, or perhaps one with a bit more memory. It's a darn good unit if you put in a little time to get it right.  Don't buy it from Crutchfield however. They are one of those companies that is says something is in stock when its not and tells you after the purchase. They were even late at being late. They missed 3 dates they told me it would ship.

<Title>Some good.. some bad...
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>in general this is a reasonably nice mp3 player. There are some negatives however..  1. the touchpad: this thing is kind of wierd sometimes, it would be nice if the play/stop/select/back things were buttons as opposed to bein part of the touch pad as they do not always work as expected (having to push the button several times for it to work).  2: Battery: if you only use this player for a few minutes at a time (say for 20 minutes one day and 30 minutes another) your battery life will be FAR shorter than 12 hours. it will probably be about 3-4 hours as the device goes into standby mode for several hours after getting turned off, using a fair amount of battery power.  3. freezing: sometimes the unit will freeze up when turning it on, requiring you to take the battery out and resetting the device.  there are several amazing features worth considering as well.  1. compatibility with subscription services: for $15 a month you can get an almost unlimited supply of music from napster/yahoo/rhapsody.. sure beats 99cents a song from the (in my opinion) overrated iTunes.  2. removable storage capability: you can choose to make this device a "flash drive" in sizes of 128mb;256mb;512mb;1gb;1.5gb;2gb;3gb;4gb... a very nice feature if you need a remote storage device if you don't need the full 6 gigs for music.  3.FM radio: while the antenna is not very strong, the FM radio tuner is a nice addition to this unit.  4. PIM functionality: sync with your outlook calender to keep track of things on the go.  this device is deffinatly worth considering for someone who is interested in a subscription based music store and doesn't mind owning something other than an "iPod" which is quite overrated in my opinion....

<Title>The best deal for your $$$
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've read other reviews that cover (in great detail) specific pros and cons of this unit so I'll not go into those details.    Overall, I am extremely pleased with my ZEN.  I paid way less for this 6GB unit than I would have for an iPod of the same capacity.  It's easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the headphones provided have excellent sound quality.  Also, the software it comes with makes it easy to transfer music back and forth between the Zen and my computer, and makes playlists easy to create.  Good luck doing in on the Zen itself... just use the software  It does have some quirks to it and what others say about the instruction manual not having any instruction on how to use the menus is absolutely true.  Also, you can't listen to it while it's charging.

<Title>Great Music Player
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We order one without ever having seen it, and we love it. It is so small and works so well.   The first thing I noticed taking it out of the box was the size, it is tiny. Much smaller then my last MP3 player. Next the fit in your hand, feels like it was made for mine. The controls take a few minutes to get used to, but once you have figured out that you do not have to push them and just slide your finger it is very easy. The software was a snap and download speed was almost magic. A single download of a song takes 2 - 3 seconds! I had the entire thing working 5 minutes out of the box and have never had to read the manual.  I had a problem with short battery life (~5 hours), but after updating the firmware theat issue has gone away. Now the battery life is no problem, I can use it all day and the battery still shows a full charge! The FM radio link is a must if you want to use it in your car - tune your radio to a pre set station and listen to all your tunes withouth wires!  The only negative thing I have found is the fact you can't view pictures while you play music. This would be nice, but has not really impacted my ability in using the player.

<Title>Pretty damn good
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>got this a few days ago after suffering cheap chinese MP3 players for a few months. out of the box, it seemed pretty sturdy (it comes with a little pouch to keep it scratch free), the scroll wheel is a bit iffy at first, but after getting used to it, its easier than the ipods. the headphones supplied, however, are too big and bulky/scary looking to be effective, but i'll be using my sony ones when i get them back anyway. the headphone jack is just a little bit fragile, but unless you sling it into your pocket upside down and lift it by the headphones, it won't break. and soldering isn't hard anyway.   the one major setback of it, is that it doesnt come with an AC adaptor, so i have to have my PC booted up to charge, and because of it being USB if the pc resets itself (BSOD) or goes into sleep, the ports will be powered down (that is, unless you set it up in the power savings options).  i would have loved this to have worked as a removeable disk out of the box, as im not generally fond of bundled software. however, i've never used the program (the long install put me off it too), since i can still right click > send to as with removeable drives or sync in WMP, no itunes babble. it can also play WMA's, which is what i rip my music as (early WMP had no MP3 ripping support)  sound quality is amazing, but what else would you expect from creative? they make amazing high end sound cards.  as for people saying its not showing up in windows when its connected, its because after 5 minutes of idle when its charged, it will shut down to save battery. its not all that hard to slide it across to on. the only problem is the USB cable is so short that you have to rest it fairly close to the pc (mine sits on top of it)  now my replies to other people  Thomas J. Russ: thats what the hold function is for. maybe have a think about it. its exactly the same function as on every MP3 player on the market  The Last Word: the Ipod doesnt play WMA. sure, apple make amazing computers and the Ipod is popular because of its ease of use, but saying its more compatible and better is just kissing apple ;)  Kimberlie J. Womac: look at the base. mine has 2 small holes. slide the cover off, and the wriststrap goes near the base of the battery

<Title>GREAT FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS...
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I assume most people writing reviews on here have just recieved their players. I was as stoked as they were when I first got my hands on my new Creative Zen Micro. The sound is great, it stores a good amount, was pretty cheap, and looked sweet.  Fast foward about a year. The player is chips and faded. The lights barely work. The battery is almostunresponsive to charges.   But, the MAIN PROBLEM is with the headphone jack. The sound is echoey, sometimes just plays music, sometimes just voices. You have to hold the player at ludacris angles and press on the headphone plug to get the sound to work. MY FRIEND HAS ONE AND GO IT A LITTLE BEFORE ME, AND HAS  THE SAME PROBLEM!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS FAULTY. IF YOU PURCHASE IT YOU ARE MAKING A MISTAKE...AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME YOU WILL FIND OUT.  It's very hard to explain this universal problem, but trust me, it renders the device painfully unusable and annoying. Don't buy it.

<Title>It's good, but it can be better.
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the size, and the battery life; but there are some issues with the Zen Micro.   My biggest complaint is, I listen to audio books. While I can say I have no problems with the size, there tends to be a problem with the player holding my place in the book when I have to plug it in to recharge or if it's not use in a few hours (that can get annoying).   Also the documentation is sparse at best, and the online guide isn't much better.   This is also the second one I receive. the first had a major failure in the second week I owned it. This did not bode well for the player.   So far there have not been may problems with the second one. I do get "pops" and for no reason the track will start over (but this could be due to the battery being low).   Over all I bought the player with a $[...] off from audible, so it made buying the player a bit less painful.

<Title>Too many problems
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wish I had bought something else. I have had my micro for about a year and a half. I got it because I was going overseas for the year and wanted something with a lot of memory but still physically small. About eight months after I bought it, the headphone jack came loose. Sound came in and out. It slowly got worse, to the point where now to listen to music I have to put my thumb against the base of the headphone connecter to push the pin against the metal contact inside the player or otherwise I get no sound. When I came home I read that it was a fairly common problem and so I wrote creative to see how to send it back and get it fixed. They wrote back to tell me that since it had been more than a year I no longer received complimentary email support and would have to find my answer online.      If not for those two things - the headphone jack and the customer service - I would give it 4 stars. It has nice features. I really like that it has fm radio. I still wouldn't give it five stars though because the touch pad format is annoying. It's too easy to accidentally change songs. Putting it in your pocket without locking it means that every time you move your body the song will skip ahead or start over.  There is an adapter you can buy to deal with the touchpad problem. It's a headphone cord extender with its own volume control and track ahead/backward buttons. I recommend that if you do buy the micro.  But overall I would recommend buying something else. The headphone problem is such an annoyance that I don't take the player with me anymore when I leave the house. I wish I had spent my money on something that would have lasted more than eight months.

<Title>Better than the Ipod!!!!
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have an Ipod and The Creative Zen. I have recommended the Zen to several people that were in the market for an MP3 player. Of course with all the hype, they were going to purchase the Ipod. I showed them both players and let them listen and also how much easier it is to upload songs to the Zen. All you need is Media player, not the unnecessary iTunes! It's a breeze to set up, the sound is just as good if not better than the Ipod, and the price...well price it yourself! Ditch the Ipod and go with the Zen Micro! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is the touch pad is a little to sensitive. I think they could have done a little better with that.

<Title>Piece of junk, could've been great
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zen micro could've been the ultimate alternative to the IPOD. It has everything-and more-that you could want in an mp3 player. Unfortunatley, it's  works for only about 2 months before the headphone jack goes out. I bought on for my self and a friend. His wife then bought one. Same problem: Headphone jack fails. It's a piece of garbage. This is my second review on this item, and I'm writing because there have been other people since the first review who have been victimized by this company. Creative acknowledge the problem is a design flaw. check the bullentin boards: There are sites dedicated to showing you how to repair the headphone jack. However, you will need to know elemenatary soldering and you will have to void the warranty. It's garbage, save you self time, money and trouble. Again, it's garbage.

<Title>It's okay.
<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this MP3 in february this year. I had it for about 4 months until i decided to get an iPod video instead. While I had the zen micro the sound quality worked fine, i never experienced it skip once. The voice recorder and the radio were really nice features considering that you didn't have to buy them as extra accessories. The screen quality isn't that good though. The screen is rather small and the text is even smaller. And because the screen does not have any color it may be hard for some people to see the text. It is small and fits in your pocket easily. It is pretty thick but no very noticably. The real problem that I had was that somehow dirt and dust got under the plastic and infront of the screen it caused even more problems in seeing the text. I gave the zen to my mom and it works fine for her. If you are just going to be using it for working out and running this is probably a very wise choice, but if you are using it for casual use I would suggest the zen micro photo.

<Title>Zen device OK, but the PC software is horrible
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Most reviews have focused on the Zen device, but don't forget you must synch up your music files from your PC with Creative Media Organizer software.  This is where Creative dropped the ball.  I first bought a 5GB Zen Micro, but that failed so I replaced it with a 6GB device.  It came with upgraded Media Organizer software, so I attempted to uninstall and install the software.  It works, but the program hangs and can't close unless I go into Windows Task Manager and kill the app.  I emailed Creative Support (email response time was not bad; received responses within 36 hours) and they provided me with a HIGHLY complex process to fully uninstall the software (get this: disable Starup Group via msconfig, re-boot in Safe Mode, set file directories to find hidden files....etc. etc. sheesh!!! Far too complex for the average user.  You can't just simply remove the software from the Control Panel!!!) and told me to try again.  I did and it got worse; the PC wouldn't shut down.  After much tinkering I'm stable, but it still hangs.  SO BEWARE: the software is clearly invasive and if you got it up and running don't touch it.

<Content>This player, while only my second, is very good. It has alot of features that are all very easy to use, even for me and I'm not too technology oriented. Some people have complained about the software, and I'll just say it's too minor a problem to mention and definitely doesn't take away from the value. The sound quality is very nice. Transfer is easy and everything works perfectly. I did an entire week's worth of research and this is by far the best player I found for the price, yes it's even better than Ipod (alot better.) So the bottom line here is GET THIS PLAYER and you will NOT REGRET IT, EVER!!

<Title>Beware!
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As good as the design of this product may be, and no matter how good the features are, there is an underlying problem with this corporation's treatment of its customers.  I have had a really nasty experience with the Creative Lab Zen Xtra 40G, which convinced me to stop purchasing any of the company's products. Unfortunately most of my computer sound related accessories are Creative ones.  The problem arose when one of the company's new firmware release bricked the player. After this there was no way to reset the device in any of the ways accessible to owners, it had to be sent back to the labs to restore it.   I exhausted every possible way of getting the Tech support department to take responsibility for this bad piece of software and wave the fees associated with the restoration. Even the supervisor I talked with refused to assist and insisted on referring to the warranty, which in my view has nothing to do with a companies responsibility to wards it's clients.  An owner should not be responsible in regards to the breaking of hardware due to buggy software by the manufacturer itself.

<Title>Poor quality and Customer Service;  No Toll Free Phone Number..
<Date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Several weeks after I purchased my Zen Micro, I started to get dropouts which I attributed to a faulty headphone jack.  Upon reseaching the forums, I found that this is a fairly common problem with Creative players.  It appears to be a result of a poor internal solder connection.    To make matters worse, Creative doesn't have a toll free customer support number.  So you have to call on you own dime and wait for a long period of time.  After spending 45 minutes on the phone, I finally got an RMA number and returned the unit for replacement.  After waiting for four weeks and making a series of calls to find out about the delay, I finally got a repaired unit in the mail.  Since I didn't want to go through this hassle again, I sold this player on eBay and bought an iPod Nano.  At least Apple has a tool free number.  In this day and age, any consumer electronics company that doesn't have a tool free support number is totally out of it.  This is a sign that Creative doesn't want to deal with customers after the sale is made.  Won't be a problem for me, because I will never be buying another Creative product again.

<Title>just what I needed
<Date>Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I needed a player that would play the WMA format and was audible ready.  This little beauty also came with a $100 instant rebate from Audible, it does not get much better than that!  I had just signed up for a music subsciption with the to go feature( if you have the right player ) and just because a player has the plays for sure logo on it does not mean it works with a subscription service.  The micro does and now I have a (2 million song library) from charter high speed.  Anyone can get the subcription if you have a highspeed conection by going to Charter.net. Now about the player itself......it is a little beauty of a device and the sound quality is superb.  As to the gripes of some reviews I have seen, a little reserch and using the very comprehensive guide which comes on the software disk that comes with the player solves all......... I considered buying a gel case for the player but I like the look and feel of it so much that I just use the satin bag that comes with it.  This was just the second thing I purchaced from Amazon but will not be the last,they were great! Hope this review helps someone who has the same needs I had.  Richard

<Title>broke down in short order!
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was so excited to get this product!  Thankfully,  I didnt spend full price on this mp3 player.  I didnt get to use it right away when I got it because I didnt have time to set it all up.  I used this product for aproximately 2 months before it would not work anymore.  The mp3 player got stuck on building library and would not do anything else after that.  I turned it off and then I took the battery out.  I hooked it up to my computer to see if I could just wipe it clean and start over, but nothing would happen.  I am so disappointed in this product and I am very happy that I only spent $100 on it.  I had a phillips mp3 player before I had ordered this one and I love it and will be using that one from now on.  I was going to give the phillips one to my husband because it doesnt have as much storage.  I guess that I will have to keep searching for a different mp3 player that has more storage and actually works right.  I also didnt care for the whole set up of the menu on this mp3 player, alot more difficult to figure out than the phillip player!  The really bad part is that it has been past the warranty so I cant do anything about it.  If you are going to buy this product I would recommend an extended warranty with it!

<Title>Not so good
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I only bought this one instead of an iPod because it works with Rhapsody. The product has been a little disappointing, here's the pros and cons:  Pros:  + Looks good. + Sounds good. + Very handy.  Cons:  - Quality: had to ask for replacement after jack failed. - Skips: Almost all the music I have, I got it from Rhapsody, so it seems sometimes the device has to check for track license or something before playing, so this produces an annoying skip between songs, sometimes more than 3 seconds. - Most of the time it doesn't work quite well with Rhapsody software, sometimes it freezes when trying to upload songs, and have to restart the program or unplug the device from my computer. - Battery life is not really good, and I use it with volume 10 (out of 25) and don't mess a lot with the controls.  Another con, related with this product, although not rated here, is the beltclip, is a really cheap piece of plastic that breaks easily, although got a replacement after the first one broke, that one also broke, so now I'm waiting for a second replacement, although this time I asked for a leather poucher.  Finally, if you are a music fan, you might find this product, combined with a music service (e.g. Rhapsody, Napster) very enjoyable, if it doesn't break of course.

<Content>6GB just wasn't enough memory for my CD collection.  When you rip your CD's at 128 kbps, it only saves about 1,000 songs, not 3,000.  So I returned it and bought something with 20GB.  Much better!  If you don't need a ton of memory, it's certainly functional.  It was easy to use, small, and light.  But just not enough memory for me.
