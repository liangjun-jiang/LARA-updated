<Title>An updated version is better
<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After i read millions of reviews of this product, i went to target and bought it.I was sceptical that it would hold enough music for me to be happy with, but decided to give it a try.    Several Reviewers complained about sony sonic stage..i think its no worse than the i-tunes software and once you get the hang of it (one or 2 days max) its really simple to use, once you buy music from the sony connect store, it automatically downloads to the program, and if you choose, will send straight to your mp3 player as well.Its simple to arrange the playlist into folders. One downside is that the sony  connect site is only for sony products, but you can convert to mp3 and burn a cd straight from the program as well. Ive come to a conclusion that all the programs want you to buy music, and all will make it hard to exchange music from one computer to another. sony will let you authorize up to 5 computers to accept music from..   I give this 4 stars because the first nwe305 i bought, the cover for the built in usb connector was breaking. I returned it to target, and got a new one, no hassle. the new one i noticed is remodeled slightly from the other one, so i think that the usb cover has been strengthened.   I love the sound quality, and lots of options to choose from on the display. I did get some better headphones from sony. I recommend this, cause i forgot them one day and used a cheapie pair, i couldnt figure out why it sounded so strange. then i realized it was the crappy headphones. It does make a difference! I like the sony ones that go behind your neck. they are the least obtrusive and dont fall off when running.  I happen to love that the thing charges from the computer,no ac adapter needed. the battery lasts days and days after charging an hour max. I really wanted to test the battery myself, so i intentionally left the thing on all night, about 10 hours strait and it was still on 3/4ths battery.   I am pleased with the amount of music i am able to shove into this thing. IVe so far put 123 songs on here, with 345 supposed to be max. Im at about 1/2 memory left, and lots of my tracks are really long.   I am hoping they will come out with more accessories for this item, I find it odd that the player comes with a spot to hang a lanyard or hook something on it, but there wasnt anything included. Its not usually a problem but when i dont have a pocket it is inconvienent.

<Title>Nice looking but too fragile!
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got one of these cute lil' "beans" for a present, and it was extremely adorable. Nice feel when you hold it in your palm. (Received quite a bit of ooh's and ahh's among my friends!) But there was some sort of a bug when I installed Sonic Stage. With some frustation I got it solved, finding that SS  was a very bad software. You cannot drag files directly into the bean. SS also makes your computer very slow. Then, just as I was starting to enjoy this little guy, it fell from my table and went bad. A table no more than 3 feet and with a carpet on the floor! Now the bean does not funtion properly--its keys are extremely sticky (does not  respond regularly) and there is a big ugly crack. I am now planning to send it back--or maybe buy a new mp3 that is tougher.  Still, the bean is really really cute--if you are careful enough!!

<Title>Doesn't convert wma or wav files
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this radio and returned i tthe very next day, why? because they force you to buy all the music from their Connect.com website. I had 50 songs on my windows media player and some songs I bought off walmart.com for .88  NONE were compatible with the MP3. they were in either wma or wav format which it "says" it can convert but it never did, it always stayed on 0% when converting, I ended up calling their customer support the next morning and they told me no song that was copywrite protected could be downloaded (even if I paid for it legally on walmart.com) I would have to re-buy all my songs through their site for them to be compatible. I returned it and bought a RCA that is compatible with my windows media player.

<Title>I thought it was good...
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At first, I got it for christmas, and it was great, great sound and great all around. Then my first problem came, I couldn't download ANY songs off the conect store and the support team was no help what so ever. And then a couple days ago, I dropped it on the ground maybe a 2 foot drop and it will not turn on. So know I am going to buy a new mp3, and it won't be a bean!

<Title>Definately do your homework on this one
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the bean just before I had my first baby thinking it would be great to have in the hospital.  Boy was I wrong.  I brought it home and tried to install the software onto my computer.  The program kept canceling the installation process and when I went online to get the so called patch it did nothing to help me.  NONE of the music that I had PAID for and downloaded onto my computer were compatable with the SonicStage.  I became very frustrated and deleted the whole thing off my computer and returned it.  When I went to return it the lady told me that it sounded like I got a corrupt disc, which I bought her story and exchanged it for a new bean. Same thing happened, I couldn't get the program to complete the installation process and took the whole thing back AGAIN to Target.  Definately a waste of my time.  The player looks cute and is nice in your hand but definately not worth the hassle it has with it.  Don't waste your time in my opinion.

<Title>The coolest littttle gadget, much nicer than the  ipod Shuffle
<Date>Sat May 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow This Baby is sooooooooooo nice. I don't have any comments at all other than the software it comes with is clunky, but just DL from sonys web page and its much easy to use. I do think 512mb is a bit small, so maybe go for the 1gb instead. I love this thing, its PERFECT for when i workout or play poker. The hidden USB plus is the coolest feature about this gadgets, it is spring loaded behind a small little door. Man this is nice. Give it a try!

<Title>Great deal!
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did not buy the Bean through Amazon - I actually got it as a gift. But, I did want to say a few things about the product, because I was surprised there were a few bad reviews on the page...  First of all - the software was an effortless install, even with my anti-virus running the entire time. If you have a PC running anything but XP, you might have issues (and the install instructions CLEARLY warn you of this possibility). But, let's be serious here. It's 2006 - upgrade to a machine with XP loaded as the Operating System.  Secondly - the software DOES convert .wav files and Windows files.  And, finally - Stop with the complaining about having to pay to download from the Sony store. You can use the included software to burn music you bought from the Sony store to a CD - as well as using it to upload to the Bean. With iTunes, you can upload ONLY to the iPod... and you can forget about burning to CD ANY downloads from the iTunes store...  For the money - this is a great deal.  Only complaint I have is about the Sony store itself... While there is a lot of available music, I would like to see more.

<Title>Great Little Bean
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I could have purchased something a little cheaper with the same storage size, but we love Sony products so I went with this after looking at mp3 players for a long time.  It is SO Cute!  Mom's need a few cute things that are their own.  512MB seems miniscule compared to the multi-GB models of players out there now, but really, I just download radio show files that I don't get to listen to normally to listen to them when I walk...along with 50 or 60 songs that I really like.  So it's perfect for me.  You can always swap them out.  Plus I'm not storing my entire music library on there, and I don't think most people that have everything loaded on their players listen to 10% of the files.  I LOVE the USB connect/charger.  Easy to use.  The software isn't so bad.  My computer is just under a year old, so that might help.  I'm still trying to figure out the details on it, but I never read the instructions so it's my own fault...and thanks to the other reviewer that mentioned the wallpaper thing.  I don't wear a watch normally, so the fact you can put a clock on there is great to know.  Only downside I've come across is the slow fast forward function...I get by though.

<Date>Wed Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>after reading the reviews on amazon.com and being an older guy who is used to discman technology i said what the heck ill try it this device is extremelly user friendly the quality is outstanding, of course its not surround sound but i put my cds in my computer and downloaded all 75 songs in 8 minutes to this great device. for those that like to work out sony even offers a armband wich will hold it for 19 dollars .the device  is about 3 inches long but what can i say its a sony product  the sound is great and it is extremelly simple to operate if your considering one of these devices go for it you will not be disappointed now i got to figure out who to give my clunky discman away. buy it and you also will have great fun
