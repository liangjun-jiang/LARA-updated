<Title>1st MP3 Player & impressed what all the features!
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 1st MP3 player and am totally pleased. Read all the Negative reviews first than the positive. To my surprise none of the negative items reported happened to me, yet. First they say battery life stinks well I read that the iRiver comes only 50% charged and it takes 1 hour to charge at 50% & 2 1/2 for full charge. Not bad when you get at least 20 hours of use for full charge.  Only being able to use Windows media player is not bad but there are so many options like rating your songs, artist, playlists, genres & star system. FM radio is great either in the car with FM transmitter or on the fly. The finger print situation is real but I bought a Invisible Shield for $9.99 with a lifetime warranty works great.  The toggle screen is ok but when you start listening to a song and the screen goes black to save battery life you have to press the screen twice once to get it illuminated and the other to go where you want just irritating.  Did not use the earbuds because it is not applicable to my ears but bought Phillips behind the head headphones here on amazon and the sound is great from the iRiver. Did not use the video option yet because I just wanted the MP3 option so maybe later when I expand to video we will see but I see no point. Also the pictures may be a faster option that I want to use and you will need a converter from iRiver website (free) to resize the image to fit on your iRiver screen and with the excellent clarity it will be great. The cradle is nice and sounds better than I thought but when you want to connect to your Home Theater receiver you need to purchase a y adapter cable unless you have a new receiver for USB connection.  If you already have a cable to connect to your Receiver than forget it because it will not fit into the back of the cradle you need the cable that came with the cradle since the housing is smaller.  The iRiver will charge from your laptop computer with no problems my main way of charging.  Also bought the iRiver FM Transmitter and works great if you can find a dead station to broadcast your signal and it has 3 presets.  So far there is no problem at all, great product and well worth the money sometimes there are problems with products and/or ignorance from users but take a chance if you read all the bad and good reviews and if this unit fits your needs!

<Title>good purchase
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was referred this product by my good friend.  Overall, I like this product, the only downfalls are: 1) a little difficult to use and 2) the battery life...  in previously owned mp3 players, I get a beep or a warning whenever the battery is running low.  However with this iriver, it just shuts off completely when battery is down.  the radio function is excellent.

<Title>Do Not Buy iRiver
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the very short period of time it worked, it was great. It began freezing up with software problems, and support is the helplessdesk. These poor people have been contracted by iRiver and abandoned. I really believed, even after many weeks of research, that I was getting a quality product. It is junk. Don't waste your money or your time.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The click system is fun and easy to use. The player itself is nice and compact, and thin. The sound and movie quality are top notch. The packaging itself shows the effort that went into the product. It looks great and oozes a lot of wows from others. Overall great product.

<Title>Very nice, a bit small and died after a year
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Got the 2GB Clix ($135) in Dec 2006 for my 14-year-old teen.  The screen is very small and it is very easy to use. It is a nice MP3 and Video (avi) player and very cool with lots of features like Flash games, nice FM radio, Alarm clock etc. A few days after the 1-year warranty passed, it suddenly stopped showing up as a Flash drive when connected to a PC. The support person said he works for a third party service and that this problem is common... If this had happened a few days ago, I would have been able to send it for repair. Unfortunately, while trying to troubleshoot the problem, I formatted the device so all we can do with it now is listen to radio...

<Title>good one, but not excellent
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am satisfied with it. Many features are very good. The sound quality is as good as ipod and others. The FM radio can receive signal in many place, quality is also good. The picture quality is wonderful, better than I expected. Some review said about the charging problem, saying it can only be charged through the computer. I bought chargers so don't have that problem.  There are several things I am not happy with. First, it is not very easy to learn how to transmit resources from computer, especially in vista. I still can not find the way to put in video and songs which are not mp3 files. Second, after charged, it can not find back where I was listening.

<Title>Charging the Clix battery "requires" XP SP1
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice product, but beware. No mention is ever made that the Clix will *NOT* charge the battery without XP SP1 or SP2 running. USB power bricks and computers running any other OS will *NOT* charge the battery. I've tested the power output with an electrical meter on several computer USB ports and this issue is not related to the power output of the port. The product will "connect" but it will not charge.

<Title>Great -- for the short time it worked
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really enjoyed this player--for a week. Great battery life, very simple to use, beautiful screen, intuitive interface. Sound quality is absolutely first rate.  BUT: A few cons. After a week, it just froze up, refused to power up, and couldn't even be re-set. It just died. Also, Windows Media Player, which you must use to get the most out of this device, is in beta, and so is full of bugs. You can use the Clix with version 10, but you miss out on many features. Lastly, the included earbuds are very mediocre.  I plan to return the Clix to Best Buy and get a replacement. If the new one dies too, I'll post a follow up review.

<Title>My New Best Friend
<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my IRiver Clix for about 2 weeks now and it's probably the best thing since the internet. User Friendly, portable, so small you can put it in your pocket. Must have - clix cradle which allows you to listen to your clix without headphones.

<Title>Die ipod, die!
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been waiting a while now for a better nano alternative, (the U10 didn't have enough flash memory to convince me) and now thank god for the Clix!  This is an absolute must have for anyone in the market for a new handheld media player, because this little sucker has it all.  Prior to this all I had was my cellphone to use as a portable mp3 player.  My first impressions on the layout and overall look of the Clix (and U10) are that it is a welcome change in a world of Sansa-esque iPod copycats.  Good riddance to that stupid clickwheel!  The screen is vibrant and colorful, the video playback on it is exceptional considering the size of the screen.  So far I've only watched the included clips, but they both looked surprisingly good.  But in general the images are very clear and the text is easy to read.  Audio playback was my primary desire in purchasing the Clix and it certainly delivers in that respect!  The included earbuds are atteast as good as the ones you get with an iPod, but any audiophiles will probably throw them away and buy some that cost as much as the Clix itself.  The music interface is easy to navigate and the sound quality is superb. It has included EQ's which you can change in real-time and pick the one you want.  It also has a customizable feature and SRS WOW effects ala Windows Media Player.  The dedicated volume control is on the side of the player and this thing can get loud.  FM radio!  Wow, and it's even crystal clear.  I'm listening to it as I type actually, here in my bedroom.  I haven't tried it outside yet, but the walls must be filled with lead or concrete because I can't get any cellphone reception but the radio is coming through nicely.  You can also record from the radio, save presets or adjust the tuner region if you leave the country.  The Clix interface is so sweet!  There is a button under the faceplate on each edge of the screen and the arrows on the screen make navigation easy.  The lock mechanism to disable the buttons is very cool too, it physically disables the buttons so they won't click at all, instead of just being an electronic switch like I had been expecting.  The screen does get smudged pretty easily and getting a clear screen protector is a really good idea.  There aren't a host of options for cases and accessories like for a nano, but the U10 gadgets will fit the Clix since they are basically identical.  The protective sleeve included with the unit is a nice touch however.  Even when the Clix is in there it will still fit easily in a pocket and not get scratched.  I don't have the docking station, but it seems pretty neat.  The flash games are cool too.  It comes with sudoku, a frogger type game, a puzzle game and some others.  It's also got an alarm clock feature, which I haven't used personally.  All in all this thing is way better than an iPod.  I had been using iTunes prior to my purchase (now I use WMP 11) and thankfully I had never saved any songs in my 10gb library in Apple's AAC song format.  I kept them as 160bit mp3's which were located easily by WMP and fully accessible in their iTunes folders.  WMP 11 is still a little buggy, but as I understand its still in beta.  My only real problem was that it had some trouble with the ID3 tags on some of the songs and mislabelled them in seperate versions of the same cd.  It wasn't heard to fix, I just checked off the "retrieve additional information from the internet" checkbox under the options and fixed the ID3 tags myself rejoining the songs into albums properly.  Hopefully this will be an issue addressed in a future patch for WMP.  All that being said, I strongly encourage you to go down to your local store who carries the Clix (got mine at Best Buy) and look at it youself, compare side by side to the nano and hopefully this review will help you make an informed decision.

<Title>Truly the best of the best of flash players.
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this item for only a week now - not too long - but I have to say that this is among my top three greatest purchases of all time.  To establish some credibility here, when I shop for electronics I always want the best of the best and don't settle for less.  I research a purchase for a long period of time before I actually make it, to remove any likelihood of regret.  I don't recall a time when I've regreted such a purchase.  Now, the Clix is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I have never seen such a small, but proportionately functional, player.  The screen resolution is amazing (I would honestly compare it to my high-end LCD).  The display and video playback frame-rate are also very pleasing - they say it only gets 15 FPS, but it's so negligible that I can't complain (the skip is honestly hardly noticable).  I am also very pleased with the navigation of the menu system - it's so smooth and user-friendly.  When I first began exploring the menus it was almost like going through my computer's operating system for the first time.  I mean that in a good way - it was so feature rich and every functional feature that I wanted was present and well placed.  I also love the physical navigation.  I admit I was a little unsure about clicking the screen to navigate, but it's so seemless and natural that it almost feels like every other way is irritating.  I am usually pleased with my electronic purchases and quite well enjoy them, but in this rare case I was truly ecstatic.  I must have said "wow" at least a couple dozen times.  If I had enough money I would honestly buy one of these for everyone I know.  I still can't believe that they can sell such a feature rich and perfectly constructed item for so little.  However, to play the devil's advocate, so to speak, I will say that there is one small issue that I have with this player: the storage capacity.  It's only 2GB and, at least for me, it's not enough.  Now, I'm not saying I will listen to all of those 2GBs before I have a chance to switch some files around :) , but it would be nice to have at least 4GB.  I'm sure iRiver will release a 4GB version sometime this year, and when they do, barring any unforeseen releases of some other player that could hold up against this one, the 4GB Clix will be hands down, in my humble opinion, the best digital audio player on the market.  If you think the iPod nano is a better purchase then hunt down two people who have each of these players and take a look for yourself.  I'm confident that most, if not all, of the people who experience both players will agree that the Clix is the best option.  If you're looking for a feature-rich, ultra-portable and well-built flash audio player, do yourself a favor and get this one.

<Title>things you should know
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iriver clix is a great sounding mp3 player with a great picture. There are things you should know that the manual doesn't explain to sync cds to your player you need to make sure your windows media player is set to rip them as mp3. In the advanced setting mode theres a option to reformat your mp3 player. It recomends doing it if you encounter fatal errors. Definately do not use it unless iriver tells you to do it to fix your player not only will it erase everything in the memory but it also reformats it in a way that your player will hold alot less music. Don't get me wrong this is a great player but if your electronically challenged like my self you can really screw up your player.

<Title>Great features, battery...not so much
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great product full of features. Sound, image and video quality are great. But, that great screen quality has one drawback, it sucks the batteries dry. The advertised battery life is true, as long as you just let it play. Changing the volume level and skipping tracks however turn on the screen, which devours the battery quickly. Overall, a great product with an abundance of features.

<Title>Video converter is poor, it basically disables the function
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The reason I bought this one is the functionality. So far, the radio works fine, mp3 quality is good, the games look fun. Battery life needs to improve. But the biggest disspointment comes with the video. The video converter provided is poor. I tried a couple of WMV files, none of them turned out nice.

<Title>it delivers what it promises 
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read alot about mp3 players for quite awhile. I highly suggest cnet.com for great unbiased reviews. I LOVE my iclix. The only negative about it is it is only 2GB. Other than that, it does what it promises. The sound is great (that's with the earbuds that come with it) and it CRANKS. I have used the voice recorder a couple of times, and it is decent. The FM tuner is great when you are sitting still. I actually enjoy the flash games too. It downloads songs very quickly and is very easy to navigate through the system. This is my first player, and I expect to use the full amount of applications. I can't imagine needing more than what it comes loaded with.

<Title>The best mp3 player.
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very well designed and quality built device. Sound quality is above average, you can set your own equalizer settings or use the preloaded ones.  You can download your own pictures onto it and set them as a background, or view them while listening to your music. Their are several play optionsfor your music. Videos look crisp and clear. The interface is the very easy to use, it felt natural right away. Flash games play well with the click design. Text files look good. The f.m. reciever gets excellent reception, and the record quality is better than any other player that I've heard. Everyone who I've let use my clix player has said this will be their next mp3 player that they purchase. Definately worth the price, excellent quality.
