<Title>Simple jet set
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted something really simple and inexpensive.  I really like the little player because of the ease of use.  I bought it as a workout buddy.  It came with 2 bands so you could wear it.  I like both.  The controls are easy to use with 1 hand.  The player and earphones sound decent for such a little cheapy player.  The only complaint I have is that you cannot pause a song/podcast and then turn off the player.  If you do this, you lose your spot.  You can fast forward or rewind to the spot you left off at, but if you  had a 2 hour podcast this can be a total hassel.  I hope they come up with a fix.  I do like this little gadget.  Not nearly as good as the Sandisk Sansa, but again, it's a 3rd of the price and has 1/3 of the goodies.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I would have given it a solid 4 stars had the player been able to pause and pick up where you left off once you turned off the player.  But, since it is so frustrating to find where you left off, I give it a 3.  Battery life is decent and I noticed the radio signal isn't too bad.  Again it depends on how much ambient interference you have.

<Title>great item!!

<Content>i love it so far.  it is very easy to transfer music to, and easy to use.  the small size is great for workouts, or flying.  i was surprised how easy it was to use, and transfer music to and from.  the only thing i see wrong with it is that it has no hold button, and the menu is pretty extensive for just two buttons.  other than that, i love it!!  very easy, pretty cheap and good brand!!

<Title>Broke after one week.
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this player for Christmas, and the week that it worked, I loved it.  It has the same memory as the ipod shuffle, but the RCA Jet has a screen, and an FM tuner, and the ability to arrange the songs into folders easily, etc.  I thought it was a great deal, and everything was good until last night.  I go to put some new music on it, but I notice that as I'm erasing some music to make room, my available disc space is staying the same.  I end up erasing ALL of the music off of it, and it still says that I only have 24 mb of free space left!  The music folder says "empty", but I still have no free space.  The instructions tell me to hit the reset button in the back (which is all but unreachable), but pushing it doesn't seem to help at all.  RCA has a very nice little flash web site for the player, but it really doesn't have any support for it at all.  It suggests I download the latest firmware for it, but the player already has a more recent one installed (v.1.5), then the one they offer to download from the website (v.1.3).  Then the website has a troubleshooting page, but it only has ONE QUESTION, "does the player work with Windows vista"!  So after working with this little thing all day, the only thing I can think to do is exchange it for an Ipod shuffle, despite my desire to keep the RCA Jet.  At least Apple offers a little more support for their player.  I would give this thing one star, but I figure I'll give it at least two, because I liked it so much when it worked.

<Content>What an awesome product! It is smaller than I thought it would be, but tough little thing. Just right for my 9 yr old grandson for xmas! With bands that attach to the side "wings" hopefully it can't be left somewhere inadvertantly ;-))
