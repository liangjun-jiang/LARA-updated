<Title>Great for audio books too
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I listen to digital audio books when I'm traveling and my old Pocket PC was painfully slow to load new book files.  The iPod photo USB 2.0 file tranfer rates are fantastic, the sound quality is great and the interface better than my pocket PC.  Getting the iPod to work with Audible.com was no problem.  Since I have a Windows PC I use iTunes (free) for automatically moving my audio files, copying my CD music collection (fast!) and family photos to the iPod.  The color and fonts on the iPod photo are better for my aging eyes.  No extra software is needed - read the manual.  I love the iPod photo and use it every day.

<Title>Look at the alternatives
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife bought me one of these for Christmas. Even though I count two Macs among my computer collection, I had her return it, unopened.  Yes, the iPod has a great UI. Yes, it's cute looking. But it has several flaws that, combined with its premium price, make it unacceptable in my opinion:  1. The battery is not user-replaceable. Li-ion batteries have a notoriously short cycle-life. Why pay for a new unit or an expensive repair when so many other portable digital music players use cheap, generic, user-replaceable AA and AAA batteries?  2. The iPod does not support my preferred audio format: Ogg Vorbis. I consider it unacceptable to lock myself into a proprietary, patent-encumbered format like AAC that no one else but Apple supports when a free and completely open alternative exists that is either just as good or even better.   Sure, a few people have reportedly managed to hack the iPod to handle Ogg Vorbis, but why bother when again there are competitive products on the market that already do what you want? As a consumer, the only way you can possibly influence a company's direction is to take your business elsewhere. Why send Apple the wrong message?  If Apple adds Ogg Vorbis support to the iPod, I might buy one even if the battery still isn't user-replaceable. Until then, I'll continue to use my iRiver IFP-390T flash player. Sure, it can't hold much, but it's much smaller, lighter and cheaper than an iPod, runs on a single AA battery, and I can quickly load it with several hours of Ogg Vorbis-format music from my laptop.

<Title>More applause for Apple's iPod Photo
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife and I share our MP3 players and this one now brings us up to 4 or 5 we've been through.  This one is by far the best, and that includes experience with an iPod Mini just last year (which is still going strong).  Interestingly, we didn't buy it for the photo features. I bought it because we were frustrated waiting for our local dealers to get the 40GB iPod back in stock.  We decided to upgrade from the mini back before Christmas because we were tired of swapping music off and on it's puny (ha, can't believe a year ago I thought it was huge) 4GB hard drive.  It's a champ and we're still debating if we should actually sell it now....but onto the iPod Photo.  The two negative themes I have read over and over again about this unit is the pricing and the poor integration of the photo capabilities in the iTunes software.  Well the integration is poor.  You do need another piece of software to organize your photos and then the key piece for loading it is buried as an option in iTunes.  Tonight however, I did try loading some of my photos and it worked very smoothly.  And despite the potential software integration issues I had a couple hundred photos on it loaded on it withing about 5 minutes.  Within the next 5 minutes I had it plugged into my TV dazzling my family with a slideshow and one of my daughters favorite playlists as background music playing through the TV as well.  Slick!  It will be interesting to see how much I and my family actually use this feature.  I have been concerned with what I should do with all of my family's digital pictures, the photo albums seem...well...so yesterday.  And have you tried printing a stack of 20 photos on your home printer?  I've got better things to do...  As for music, it does that too with typical iPod style and grace, but even better.  The click wheel seems to operate even more smoothly and navigating the menus is faster.  A big plus is the vibrant and crisp display.  The bigger and higher resolution screen is much easier to read (especially for those of us wading into bifocal territory).  The battery also gets a boost with a runtime north of 15 hours.  Of course the 40GB disk is very nice to have.  I look forward to moving even more of my music collection onto it.  For the same money you can also get one of the new Personal Media Centers by Creative Labs or Archos (and I'm sure many others).  Those may be highly worthwhile depending on your needs (I would have loved one when I used to commute via train), but you need to factor in the cost of your time to record and load the media.  I have spent some time this past year also playing with PC based TV tuners and capturing digital video.  It hasn't quite evolved to be the simple and smooth experience the iPod and iTunes have become.  My wife and kids aren't as enthusiastic nor as patient as I am.  After my experiences with other digital media I was pretty confident a portable media center would collect dust in my house.  To wrap this up, I highly recommend the iPod Photo as an MP3 player--despite the $500 price--and the fact that it displays photos is just icing on the cake.

<Title>To photo or not to photo - worth the extra $100?  DEPENDS!
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The big question with the 40 gb iPod photo is whether to get it or the regular b&w 40gb iPod.  The price difference, around $100, requires justification.  Is the color screen and whirligig pizazz worth the cost?  Well, it isn't just the color screen, improved battery life, or ability to view pictures that you're getting with that $100.  The iPod photo comes with hardware extras that you don't get with the regular iPod.  These include:   - Case with belt clip  - Docking station  - Firewire *AND* USB cables  - Cable to hook up the iPod photo to your TV  When you can spend up to $20 for a USB cable in a store, having one right in the box is convenient.  And if you add in the dock and the case, you've already found out where a chunk of that $100 is going.  The color screen has nice brightness and the pics add a niftiness factor; the new generations of iPods will all have color screens, so if you get a b&w now you may regret it later when your iPod starts looking "old".  "Grandma, why is your iPod gray?"  In the end, I decided the upgrade to the iPod photo was worth the price, considering how much I was already going to pay for a regular iPod.  It's like choosing a Lexus over a Camry.  If you can afford to splurge, why not go for the better model?  Also, despite what another reviewer said, you don't need a special program like Adobe Elements to import photos.  In iTunes you can import them straight from a folder.  The programs mentioned in the other reviews make it arguably easier to sync a photo collection or create "albums", but they aren't necessary.  My iPod works just fine without them.

<Title>Here is the latest news about iPod photo
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>**** LATEST update to iPod family **** - iPod & iPod photo lines merged; no more iPod photo 30 GB - iPod comes in two capacities - 20 GB ($299), 60 GB ($399) with color screen & photo support - U2 iPod (20 GB) down to $329 from $349 - with color screen & photo support - iPod shuffle 1 GB down to $129 from $149 - iPod 60 GB down to $399 from $449 - new version of iTunes (4.9) that support podcasts *************************************** Today (23 Feb 2005), Apple announced a major change in its iPod lineup and here is how it affects iPod photo models: > iPod 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 30 GB (new product) replaces the 40 GB iPod photo and the regular iPod 40 GB  > iPod photo 60 GB now costs $150 less -- $449 instead of $599  > iPod photo 30 GB costs $349 ($150 less than iPod photo 40 GB and $50 less than regular iPod 40 GB)  > iPod dock ($39), AV cable ($19), carrying case ($29), and firewire cable ($19) do not ship with iPod photo (you may not really need them)  > Now we get three things with iPod photo: earphones, USB (not firewire) based AC adapter, USB 2.0 cable > In additon to the above, a firewire cable continues to ship with iPod 20 GB & iPod U2 edition > iPod photo Camera Connector is introduced - this can be used for connecting your digital camera directly to the iPod  As this product has been discontinued, you should be looking at iPod photo 30 GB from now on!  Since I have iPod 40 GB as well as iPod photo 60 GB, I strongly recommend iPod photo for those who are looking beyond the iPod 20 GB. The color screen has much better resolution and it also has a scrolling feature for long texts.

<Title>Get the 40GB iPod Photo while it lasts
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This review is based solely on the value of this 40GB iPod Photo that was recently discontinued versus the 2nd generation 30GB iPod Photo.  With the price drop on the 40GB iPod photo to clear out the stock, you get a tremenedous value.    This product comes with - a carrying case with belt clip - a connector to connect your iPod to your Television set to play slideshows (with music) on your tv - Firewire connector in addition to the USB 2.0 connector - Dock Connector.  The new 30GB and 60GB products do not come with any of these accesories anymore.  While it is good that Apple allows the consumer to pick and choose what you want and dramatically drop the starting point cost for the product.  Given the reduced price for this 40GB model, you are getting a lot more value for the money not to mention an additional 10GB of memory.  The only drawback to the 40GB iPod Photo versus the 30GB from what I can tell is the 30GB version is a little lighter and thinner.  I have long appreciated the iPod and think the general product is excellent and am very happy with this product.  But I will defer to some other excellent reviews here in regards to technical information about this version.

<Title>Hidden Costs of iPod iPhoto 30GB
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Boy! Capitalism rears it's ugly head again! I owned a 40GB iPod last November and returned it because the new iPhoto was coming out. I just bought the iPhoto for 349.00 and realized how much MORE money I have to spend to get the same use/functionality out of the iPhoto version...  1. NO docking station included in this version. (39.99)!! 2. NO firewire cable included (25.00)!!! 3. Power adapter is USB only!!!! 4. Only get USB 2.0 cable!!!!  What bothers me about it is:  1. You can't charge your iPod using the provided 2.0 USB cable when the iPod is connected to the computer. (I have a 15" PowerBook that HAS 2 High-speed USB plugs)  2. You can't use the iPod as a "PDA" to sync dates and address book unless you're using the firewire cable.  3. IF I were to buy the firewire cable...I would THEN need to BUY the power adapter that plugs into the wall....MORE MONEY....  In the end...for this 30GB iPhoto to be as functional as the 40GB iPod would cost 400+ (an extra 40 dollars).  Don't get me wrong the iPod is great, and color makes it better...but c'mon hiding costs is a horrible way to do business.   I hope this enlightens anyone considering dumping the 40gb for the 30gb iPod iPhoto.

<Title>Buy it now before it's too late
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased this ipod model based on the soon-to-be released photo / camera connector from Apple.  I take a lot of digital pics and the upload functionality would be a great use for me.  If you're thinking about an ipod photo this is currently the best one to buy because:  1. It's only $30 more than the 30 GB photo. 2. You get 10 more gigs, dock, av cables, and fire wire.    You would spend way more getting these "accessories" seperately. None of the 4G second version photo comes with the extras. Stop thinking and buy now.

<Title>Very Dissapointing Amazon

<Content>I ordered this iPod Photo 40GB on March 20th. Didn't care about reviewing the order receipt because Amazon has NEVER dissapointed me about their delivery estimates, NEVER, in 5 years I've been a regular customer. 3 or so days later, I go checked my order and realized that the "estimate" shipping date was and still is MAY 24TH!!!!! I wrote and then called customer service, and they confirmed that was correct!!! They said that "sometimes the product information page doesn't get updated" And still, in the product page they keep claiming that it "Usually ships within 2 or 3 days"????? HOW DARE YOU???? This a 2 or 3 MONTHS shipping estimate instead!!!!  Or..... I wonder if it has to do with the fact that I used a $45 gift coupon???? Mmmmhh???  They claim their "distributor" is going to refill their stock on those dates... HOW are they going to accomplish that if the WHOLE WORLD knows this model has been discontinued by Apple more than a month ago??? I'm very mad and dissapointed at Amazon...

<Title>Perfect---With Minor Flaws 
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent machine. It's compatible with Windows, easy to install, quick to upload, and just generally great. You can check out all the other reviews here for the details on how good it is. The photo screen is nice, but I really didn't find it all that necessary.  There are some minor problems that need to be taken care of when you purchase this:  1) BUY A CASE- The case that comes with this is not very good because the screen can get scratched easily. This is necessary.  2) BUY A WARRANTY- The internal battery will probably die within a year, so it's necessary to get a good warranty.  3) CONVERT YOUR WMA FILES- The most annoying thing about this is that it doesn't take Windows Media files. Convert all of your WMA files to the ipod-compatible format. If you have protected files, re-upload them in the iTunes format.  Enjoy your ipod!

<Title>Pros and Cons
<Date>Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros:  If you buy the 40 gig right now, you get an AV Cable, a dock and some other stuff that don't come with the new 30 gig or 60 gig, so for just a few bucks more than the 30 gig, you get a bunch of extra pricey stuff.  Great looking screen, easy interface, easy to download and arrange songs.  Cons: Can't figure out how to get/display album art for the CD's I've been ripping to my ipod. I've got a ton of discs I wanted to consolodate and put away. I'm disappointed that the album art is apparently not displayable.  Software didn't come with necessary version if iphoto, Apple's website helpfully (?) suggests I buy iLife '05, (which is also rather pricey.) I've managed to buy a copy of iLife '04, which I hope will solve my problem, but why not give me all the software I need to run the device as designed?  I'm going to like my iPod, but no one ever likes a "bait and switch."  Addendum: OK, so I figured out how to get the album art on my iPod, but why doesn't cddb automatically download it? I have to search for it myself on Google and drag and drop it to iTunes. Dumb.  Another Addendum:  I'd like to add to some of the "Why do you need this much storage space" reviewers--I have now uploaded my ENTIRE cd collection to my ipod and stored them all in the attic. (Whew! Took a while!) Using the cradle (that was included with this 40 gig photo ipod, but not with others, apparently) I listen to all of them through my home stereo. Pop it in, listen through speakers, take it out and on the road. It's super. (Thanks for asking!)  So now I've basically got 30 gig worth of music loaded into a tiny little jukebox. I put away my 100 cd changer and all my cds. Yay!

<Title>the ipod
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple Ipod photo is something that after you use it for a time it becomes something that you cannot leave the house with. As a person who spends about 8 hrs a day with the stereo on this is something that is used a lot during the day, and needs to be of high quality. This product is that high quality needed. The Ipod is something that you can use almost anywhere, the car, the home, and at work.   	Currently my Ipod has taken over my CD collection in my car. The pure convenience of having over 5000 songs with me in the car is something that after having the Ipod I could not go back to CD's. Currently I have the Ipod ran in with a Line In cord into the back of my stereo for people who have a line on your stereo this is the way to go. The FM transmitters are something that works, but not well and any audiophile will frown upon. If this is the route your looking into the best way to run this is the 1/8'' to composite cable with the SIK line out adapter. The SIK plugs into the Ipod and then the SIK's 1/8'' runs into the stereo. This provides the best quality connection to the car.   	At my house my Ipod has become my new CD changer. Again having over 5000 songs on one stereo component is something that becomes so convenient, you can't go back. The Dock that came with the Ipod is something that is very convenient and provides a great place to place the Ipod to avoid scratches. The dock provides a Line out port so it is easy to hook up to a stereo and provides a great sound quality. Also the dock can be used on the computer to sync the Ipod with your Itunes music library or used just as a charging base.   	At work my Ipod is just hooked up to a pair of computer speakers. With all my music right there next to my computer typing all those boring reports and fixing computers (I'm a computer tech. at a hospital) goes a little bit faster. Also sharing music at work becomes a little easier because of the Ipod's easy interface anyone can figure out how to play a song.   	Overall the Apple Ipod is a great product that can be used anywhere. Though pricy the quality really makes it worth it. I've had other MP3 players and none of them just feel as good as this one does in the hand. Ipod is a great tool for anyone who loves music or someone just looking for a good way to carry a few tunes around with them.

<Title>Great item, Good deal

<Content>I bought this for $10 more than the new 30gig model, and I'm pleased to say I got my money's worth.  It comes with photo dock, firewire cable, and av cable, which are worth more than $10, not to mention the extra 10 gigs(keep in mind these accesories dont come with the the new 30 or 60 gig versions. I broke my old 20gig ipod by dropping it from two feet, i recomend you buy an iskin because the case that comes with this ipod offers zero protection as i found. Despite what other reviews say you do NOT need any other software with this package, you can add photos and album art if you know how to use itunes. The color screen is very nice with good resolution.  My only problem with the ipod photo is that it's like a cell phone screen which means you have to be in  a well lit place in order to read the screen without the backlight, which wastes battery. The battery really does last longer on these models than on regular ipods.  Great product, Good deal.

<Date>Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Warning: attempting to get an iPod through a "no cost offer" is hazardous to your email inbox!  Think about it for a moment: how can somebody give away a $300+ item? It's obvious that it's impossible.  Anybody familiar with marketing bounties knows that companies like AOL only pay, at most, a few dollars for a new customer. Can you guess how the "free" people make up the difference?  Answer: flooding you with junk email, telemarketing calls, and junk faxes.  I love my 40Gb iPod Photo. Apple, as usual, has designed a great product. Too bad a bunch of bad apples-pun intended-are using iPods as bait.

<Content>This is my dream mp3 player/photo album.  I love the color LCD screen, it looks great!

I use it mostly for music and I have plenty of room for all my songs that can run forever on the long battery life.  Plus, it's real easy to enter and scroll through the few photos I have.  Besides the initial problem of figuring out how to wake it from "sleep" mode, the main problem is the EXCESSIVE price.  [...]

<Title>(Quite) A Few Quibbles
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, let me start by saying that this is a very good product. But it is FAR from perfect. I have many complaints, often quite petty (after all, this is my first iPod), but for the $400 or so price tag I expect CLOSE to perfect...   Quibbles:  1. You can't load pictures directly from the camera/memory card onto the iPod. Or, rather, you can't view photos loaded directly. In order to view photos, they must be moved to your computer and loaded through the iPhoto software. This is a MAJOR dissapointment for anyone travelling with their iPod and camera.   2. The (necessary) iTunes software is not compatible with Windows 98 or ME. Devastating to those of us with older computers full of MP3s.   3. The iTunes software is constantly redirecting me to their store. Very obnoxious.   4. I firmly believe that any product that costs me over a week's salary should come with all the necessary accessories. Noticably absent: a carrying case (if you dont want it severely scratched), flash card reader, fire wire, decent headphones, etc. etc. All told, be ready to sink another hundred (or three...) on "fun add-ons".   5. Could they not add some better games?? My cell phone has way better games than this. My TI-83 calculator (yeah, I was a bit of a nerd in high school) had better games than this. What a waste of a color screen...   Complaints aside, the iPod still rocks. The sound quality and design are unsurpassed; the software and database style song sorting are strong - there are clear reasons why the iPod is becoming a cultural icon of the digital age. But, given the price and potential for improvement, I wish I'd waited for a better version.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The player sticks regularly and then jumps several songs ahead when it finally recovers.  The charging is inconsistent, it will say it is charged when plugged in and then the battery indicator does not reflect a full charge... is it charged or not?  The controls are clumsy, especially to turn the IPOD off.  Currently, my "Hold" button will not disengage so all buttons are inoperable.  I called Apple support and all they would talk to me about is buying an extended warranty (my 1 year is not over yet).  I need to send the IPOD back to Apple at my own expense.  It does work ok as an external hard drive.   This really isn't a very good product especially for the price.  I'm back to using my old RIO.
