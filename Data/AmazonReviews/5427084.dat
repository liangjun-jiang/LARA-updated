<Title>WOW! THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO MUSIC!
<Date>Sun Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!

<Title>The first MP3 Handheld available on the Consumer market
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I had high hopes for the Diamond Rio and it certainly lived up 2 the hype. Lightweight and excellent quality with some good connecting software. My only gripe can be with memory. You definately need another 32Mb to store  your music. If you want one, my advice is to wait for the new upgraded  version with 64Mb and a graphic equaliser!

<Title>Next Millenium Consumer Electronics
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<p>Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3). This makes  its use and performance comparable with other CD-quality playing devices  while putting the power of the internet into the palm of your hand. If you  want to make a statement of &quot;being digital&quot;, the RIO is a must!

<Title>Brilliant!
<Date>Tue Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Remember when the Walkman hit the market years ago?  At first it was fad, then it became a craze before finally becoming as ubiquitous as taxi cabs in Manhattan.  The Diamond Rio is the first product with the potential to  eventually REPLACE the Walkman.  Think about it - portable music that  sounds as clear as a compact disc from a device that looks and feels like a  pager.  Unshockable, no matter how much you jump around or how bumpy the  bus ride.  This is the perfect gift for your favorite &quot;gadget  junkie&quot;, as long as they have a PC to download from.  Pssst...here's a  secret:  you can record your own CD's into MP3 format and download the  songs into your RIO - it isn't just for internet music!!  Great product.

<Title>pretty cool gadget but...
<Date>Thu Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>...the 'Windows' software to download songs to the device DOES NOT WORK WITH Windows NT.<p>Also, the headphones are low quality so you might want to get some better ones because the actual quality of the audio signal is  pretty good.  The solid-state walkman has arrived.

<Title>Do your self a favor and get a portable mini disc player.
<Date>Mon Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Only a half an hour of &quot;near&quot; quality music makes this format seriously flawed. To change music you eventually have to upload new music, i.e. a huge inconveneince when a computer is available. Mini disc is also  shock proof, recordable, near cd quality but in addition you can change  music with out the inconvenience of uploading music from a computer.
