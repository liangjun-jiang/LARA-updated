<Title>the best mp3 player I've used.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the third digital media player I've owned.  I had a Creative Zen Tough 40 gigs, and a Creative Zen Vision:M 30 gigs before this.  I loved them both dearly but they became unusable a few months after I bought them.  I was super disappointed with the customer service for Creative, so I decided to get a Zune.  I've never had much of an interest in an iPod.  It's not a "I want to be different from everybody" thing so much as Apple just isn't my aesthetic and I wanted all my software to be of the same company.  The packaging is a winner.  I never really thought much about the packaging for a product.  The box it came in was sturdy and attractive and I still have it after two months.  The updated software runs kind of slow but it's still faster than any of the Creative softwares I used.  It helps a lot to not run any other program while you're using it.  Syncing songs to the player takes about one second per song.  Super fast.  The Zune Marketplace is also a winner.  I purchased the Zune Pass and it's really thrilling to use.  All the music I want for 15 dollars a month is a winner.  DRM protection's kind of a drag, but I think it's worth it.  I don't know anything about iTunes so unfortunately I can't compare the two.  You can't put the downloaded songs on a CD or play them on anything else but the Zune software and the Zune, but that doesn't really affect me.    I really love the hardware.  The double shot effect is really neat!  The device feels really nice and substancial in my hand.  It's actually kind of small compared to the huge Zens I used to have.  I honestly don't understand how people say the Zune's too bulky.  There's not too much to say about the firmware.  It's really easy to use, and I like how the letters on the main menu are really big.  It's easy to read, even if you have a lighter background.  It's really nice though, to have the firmware update automatically, because with the Zen, you had to go to Creative's website and download it yourself and put it on the player yourself and the whole thing took about two hours.  It was crazy!  I've always been impressed with Microsoft's customer service.  A couple weeks ago none of the media would play and they walked me through everything and the person I talked to was super nice.  There are a few things that keep it from being completely perfect.  These are pretty minor details though for the most part.  The least minor thing is the quality of the video.  With my Creative Zen V:M, the video was absolutely superb, crisper than a TV.  It was so impressive, and I kind of miss it with the Zune.  I really really don't care about video though, so it doesn't matter much to me, but if video is important to you, consider the Zen.  Another big thing for me is you don't have the ability to turn the zune to the other side so the controls are on the left when viewing pictures and video.  I'm left handed and it's incredibly awkward to use my right hand to control it.  Also, a clock would be such a convenient addition.  Voice recording and the ability to use the device as an external hard drive would be nice too.  The ability to record FM radio like you can with the Zen would be super.  I don't care at all about accessories but that's a huge factor for some people.  There's a company called Vaja Cases that make really super nice custom leather cases for the Zune 30.  I'm not sure they make them for the 80, or the flash drive based devices.  You can find plastic cases at like Best Buy too.  There's an A/C adapter too but I heard that it kind of sucks.  I have a radio adapter that plugs into any headphone jack and I like to use it in the car and whatnot.  Overall though I totally recommend the Zune 30.  It's super sturdy, and the software and everything is awesome.  Definitely consider it if you're looking at hard drive based mp3 players.

<Title>Amazing, Better than Ipod!!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is very Good, Great Sound, and if you buy the premium headphones, you get great sound, plus noise cancelling, great for the gym, or traveling.  Definitely you must get the membership on zune marketplace, were for $15 bucks a month you can download EVERYTHING you want. Rather than Buying from Itunes.  Zune beats Apple in about one hundred ways.  Tip:  You get three accounts for one membership, so you might get 3 friends, and each will pay only $5, for unlimited downloads, podcasts, videos, etc.  Very Cheap!!

<Title>My savior!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this Zune for a while now before bothering to write a review, but it's definitely worth buying.  The new Zunes are out, and I can't attest to their functionality myself, but microsoft keeps coming up with better and better ideas.  This thing is easy to operate, syncs easily, and is more durable than anyone should probably need.  I've dropped it plenty of times, and it's still kickin'.

<Title>Great deal
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Title>Solid device with a great screen
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned a Zen portable media center, and while the screen was bigger, it was not nearly as sharp as the Zune screen. With Zune, both my kids can watch it at once since the viewing angle is so wide. I'm glad I have one.

<Title>Unlike many other reviewers, I actually own a Zune
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Many of the reviews here are from (and will most likely continue to be from) people who neither own a Zune nor have they ever touched a Zune.  A majority of the remaining reviews are commentary on the Zune vs. iPod battle without regard to a legitimate compare and contrast of the players themselves (possibly legitimate discussions, but discussions that shouldn't really be regarded as reviews).  My review is intended to be my first impression of my Zune along with a bit of compare and contrast as I make a switch (possibly permanent or maybe temporary) from an iPod to a Zune.  The Zune is a great player.  A large bright screen that presents a great user interface when navigating through your library or settings.  The screen is also beautiful for watching video and in particular works very well with pictures.  Despite it's slightly bulky look and large dimensions when next to other players in its class, the Zune feels just right in your hand.  Maybe a bit large to cram into a pocket, but seriously, it fits your hand like a glove.  Pre-release, many have knocked the brown, but it's a real nice color.  It has a subtle green accent that runs around the edge of the player and the contrast adds a lot of class to the player.  The software is not quite up to iTunes, or in reality maybe it's just that I'm used to iTunes.  The software is simply a better looking version of Windows Media Player (I guess that should be taken as a compliment to the Zune, because it really is a nice looking piece of software).  So, if you're comfortable with that you'll love this.  If you don't like Windows Media Player, you may not like this much more.  The wireless capabilities of the Zune has been a huge push from Microsoft.  This feature has been implemented quite well, but it will take some time for enough Zunes to be out the for the sharing to really take off.  Sound quality is no better, no worse than other players.  Overall the Zune is a welcome departure from the category leading player, the iPod, if for no reason other than it's something new in a category that has gotten a little repetitive over the last couple upgrade cycles from Apple.  The software though not as refined as iTunes, is a bit of a warmer looking alternative and it's UI differences may even grow on me enough to eventually like it more than the competition.  The player's menu navigation has every other player in the market beat.  Picture and video viewing is also at the top of the class.

<Content>Could you please only write a review if you have first hand experiance, you people gave it one star based on critiques from other firms, people check the amazon feedback to get reviews based on first hand account, they can look up cnn's review on their own.  I know that you guys are probably self proclaimed consumer advocates, but come on.

<Title>Big screen and good design
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've tried out all the iPod competitors.  In general they have all disappointed me, but this is the first one that I really like.  The only downside is that it's not as thin as the iPod, but the iPod scratches so easily that it requires a case which adds extra thickness anyway.  (+) 3" screen is GREAT.   44% bigger than iPod video.  For the first time, showing a friend my travel pictures over coffee, etc. is an enjoyable experience.  You can even zoom into pictures to see details.  And now I can actually enjoy watching videos while sitting in a cafe.  My iPod video's screen is just too small.  I also like seeing the big album art while a song is playing.  (+) It plays ALL my songs and videos iPod won't play any WMV videos, AVI video, WMA songs, etc.  The Zune plays everything I have. iPod video doesn't.  (+) Landscape mode   When playing a video or watching movies, the Zune automatically switches to landscape orientation.  (+) Controls I really like the control layout.  Easier to adjust the volume than on the iPod.  When you switch to landscape mode, it's smart enough to automatically rotate the controls so that pressing "up" always scrolls up.  (+) No scratches. The case is made out of scratch-proof, matte finish material.  It looks and feels good.  My iPod video with it's high gloss finish looked great for the first month, now it's covered with scratches and looks like crap.  That's why everyone's obsessed with keeping their iPod's in a case-- which only adds cost and thickness and keeps you from seeing how shiny it is anyway.  (+) Music Sharing You can listen to your friend's music wirelessly.  And even take it with you for a few days. No need to plug into a computer.  You just stand in front of each other and transfer the music wirelessly.  (+) FM Radio. I didn't think I'd use it, but I do. Cool interface.  (+) Menu design makes sense.  Easy to use.  (-) Thickness The Zune is .58" thick.  The 30Gb iPod is .43" thick. Of course, you have to buy a case for your shiny, scratch-prone iPod and that will add more than the difference in thickness.  (-) Looks like a scroll wheel. It looks like the Zune has an iPod-like scroll wheel, even though that's not how it functions.  They should have done something to make it look different.  Now people will probably think they just copied the scroll wheel, even though they didn't.

<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice try ... it does the job but needs more work. The feel is very nice but the sharing is only good for three plays and then you must buy the song. It's screen is 320X240. Bla. I'll stay with the iPod for now.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As I write this review I am listening to some classic Hendrix tracks through my home-stereo via my brand new black Zune. I've had the product for a few hours now and I've been nothing but impressed. The zune software is very similar to WMP 11 and it was a breeze to set up. In fact, within 3 minutes I was syncing all of my exising MP3 and WMA tracks with the Zune and downloading brand new content from the Zune store for free with my 14 day trial pass. The interface is very user-friendly, and I prefer its look to the increasingly cumbersome interface of the itunes music store.   The Zune itself is just ridiculously cool. The screen is as nice as I've seen on a handheld device, and the interface took me all of 10 seconds to master. Everything about the product makes wonderful sense. The ability to use this with the zune subscription music service is a fantastic feature as I am an avid fan of all-you-can-download music.   So let's recap: Fast, easy, problem free installation of software.                 Ingenius user interface                 Beautiful LCD screen                  Zune store allows subscription downloads   I'm still undecided about sound quality, but so far I can't complain. I also can't comment on battery life because I've only had the zune for maybe four hours now. This product kills all other hard-drive based MP3 players in terms of over-all end-user experience. I've owned an iriver, ipod, and zen nano before and this is my favorite player thus far. I-Pod could compete with this only if they put a larger screen on gen. six ipods and allow subscription based downloads in itunes.   Okay, the wireless sharing feature will be a gimmick as far as i'm concerned because the chances of me meeting many people who also own a zune seem quite remote.. let's face it, not that many people are sporting 250 dollar MP3 players at my apartment complex or my college campus.

<Title>No Unicode and WMA Lossless support
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got my Zune this morning and I like it a lot. Installation is very straight forward. The interface is intuitive and responsive. However I am going to return it because it does not support Unicode. My Chinese and Japanese song title becomes a bunch of squares. It also does not support any lossless format, not even WMA Lossless.

<Title>Does not work with Macs, iTunes, or your new car
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Crazy. Everyone uses iTunes because it rocks, excuse the pun, and has the exact same features on PC as it has on Macs, but this Zune does not work with iTunes, even on the PC. Doesn't work with my Mac either. Nor does it work in my car which has an iPod connector as most do these days. Not really a viable option beyond some marketing guy's white board. Maybe the next one will address these bugs.

<Title>Dear Santa...
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While holiday shopping this afternoon I got a chance to try out the new Zune.  The user interface is extremely easy to use - perhaps even more intuitive than the I-pod.  I'm not as enamored with the "wheel" motion of the I-pod player as some, so I was pleased to find the Zune's D-pad style controls responding as I would expect. Everything had that familiar feel - even for a first time user.    I liked how the menus went both deep and broad - I had the option to drill down into a specific category, but then I could also scroll across song options within that category.  I had a good sense of direction throughout the experience.  The music sounded good and crisp.  The video seemed fluid - I didn't notice any pixellation.  I liked the radio feature too - something I'm more likely to use than the alarm clock or calendar feature on the I-pod.  The addition of games would be nice - perhaps something to purchased off of the Zune Marketplace down the road.  I would have liked to see a Zune player without the wi-fi at a cheaper price point, but we'll just have to wait and see if the wi-fi music world that Microsoft is promoting really takes off.    All-in-all, a good player.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked to have seen a AC or car adapter included in the package - you're looking at an additional $40 for the official Power Kit.    This one is going on my list to Santa (or in my case - Mrs. Claus).  And yes, I'll probably ask for the brown.

<Title>Do not buy first generation of Zune.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well...I know I would regret it and I did. I got myself a Zune and it's going back tomorrow. I wanted to like the Zune because I think Apple needs a nemisis. (competition is good as the saying goes) But, the product feels like a prototype. I placed the Zune next to my IPod. The Ipod looks sleek and elegant and the Zune looks like it's ugly cousin. It's bigger, heavier and chunky.   OK! So it has wireless but so what. How many Zune are you going to find out there. Let's say you want to use it to tape a lecture or a meeting and you want to pass it along with your Zune buddy. Well that lecture or anything you created also dies in 3 play or 3 days. And let's say you play 30 seconds of the song and decide to stop, well counts as 1 play.   The Big screen...Well the screen is bigger but the resolution is the same. The test shot I did didn't look good and the album covers look fuzzier and not as crisp as it did not IPod.   13 hour battery life is not true. If you want 13 hour battery life you have to listen to in default volume and play the same album over and over and turn off the wireless.   It may have an OK interface and the guest sync is good but if you are in the market for a MP3 player, don't go for the Zune. While it has feature Ipod doesn't you won't be sharing anything with anybody because they are not going to be popular. There aren't that many songs, the marketplace doesn't have podcast, tv shows, video and host of other things you can get from Itunes.   In short if you really want a MS product wait for the 4th generation and maybe then you should get it.
