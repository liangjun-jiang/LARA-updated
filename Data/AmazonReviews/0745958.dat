<Title>Not what it says.
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Even though the ad says you can use this as a flash drive, after I ordered one and spent two hours trying to figure out how to drag and drop mp3 files to it, and checked for online support files (for this model, as of 5 DEC 06, there IS no online support file), I contacted CENTON and this is what they replied: ''Thank you for contacting Centon, your incident number is 12276. Unfortunately there is no way to turn off the option to use it as a media device since this depends on the operating system, windows XP will only recognize the player as a media device, other versions of windows (ME and 2000 ) will recognize it as a mass storage device instead.( you have the player with the sigmatel chip so it cannot be changed to a mass storage device manually ).'' So, if you have XP, you can NOT use this as a flash drive. My only option would be to 'synch' with media player, except when I try to synch with media player, media player says 'no device found'.

<Title>Packed with features, but terribly frustrating to use
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this device (Centon 2GB MP3 Player with FM Tuner and Voice Recording) from TigerDirect one week ago. Unlike the other reviewer, I do not have any problems with "drag-and-drop" file transfer under Windows XP. However, I am still very unhappy with this device for the following reasons:  1. Slow data transfer speed: The product specification page at TigerDirect clearly stated (twice) that this device has an USB 2.0 interface. But it is actually USB 1.1, because the data rate I benchmarked is under 0.5M Bytes per second. On the package (see my Customer Image above) it says "USB 2.0 Compatible", which is just a deceptive way of saying that it is NOT an USB 2.0 interface.  2. Poor User Manual: Badly-written English does not bother me. But this manual is so full of incorrect information, it can only be referring to a different firmware version. I have to figure out a lot of commands (such as how to delete a file) through trial-and-error.  3. Brain-Dead User Interface: - You can store 500+ MP3 songs in 1.9GB of storage, but only the first 360 songs can be played. (The firmware was probably written back when 512MB was the limit) - There's no easy way to navigate over folders. You just have to start from song#1 and fast forward/reverse to #360, one file at a time. - Each time you delete a file, you are thrown back to song#360 (or whatever is the last song) and have to navigate your way back, one file at a time. - Command feedbacks are extremely slow. For example, if you press "forward" during playback, the display will simply freeze up for 10 seconds before starting to play the next song.  Power consumption during playback is around 130mW, or 110mA at 1.2V battery voltage. So you can expect 7-8 hours of playtime from one 900mAh rechargeable battery. (This is just for your info)   After fighting with this device for a week (not to mention fighting with TigerDirect's so-call Help Desk) I finally have to return it for a refund. I'll give the Creative Muvo V100 2GB MP3 Player a try next.  [Update on Jan 9, 2007]: I received the MuVo V100 and guess what? The USB data transfer rate is just as slow! Oh well. At least the user interface of MuVo is implemented correctly.  Interesting observation: the user manual for this Centon MP3 player seems to be written based on functionalities of the MuVo... except that Centon did not actually implement some of those functions.

<Title>Frustrating to use.

<Content>I received this player for Christmas and am disappointed. I guess I was expecting a tiny little walkman. Instead I get a device that is nearly impossible to use. Thank heavens my daughter preloaded the player with music. And if I only want to listen to the music on the player, turn it off and on, I'm okay. However, after spending 8 to 10 hours with the manual and trial-and-error I'm going to buy a new walkman and get on with my life. The manual is hilarious because it's written in terrible English. And the instructions are vague and useless. Sorry, but this is not an easy player to use.

<Title>Not really USB2.0
<Date>Mon Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like the 512MB and 1GB players in this line, Centon bills this player as a "Full Speed USB2.0" device.  A little research will show that "Full Speed" actually means the same speed as USB1.1 (12mbps) - what people usually think of as "USB2" is actually called "Hi-Speed" and is 480mbps, 40x faster.  USB1.1 speeds are too slow for a unit with 2GB of storage - they're barely acceptable with a 512MB unit.  (Imagine having a 2GB flash drive that could only read and write at USB1.1 speeds - that's basically the situation with this.)  In this unit's defense, like the 512MB model, it's got more bells and whistles than a similar iPod shuffle - but the USB1.1 speeds are a real deal-breaker.
