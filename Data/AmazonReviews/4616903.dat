<Title>Great little multimedia player
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player in a good deal on e-bay and have been using it for about 5 months now.  The size of the player is just enough to slide it into the shirt pocket.  The screen in this player is big enough.  Double the size of an iPod.  The resolution is a bit low for such a big screen.  It looks pixalated when watching the player very close to the eyes.  But does not matter, the picture is clearer when at a distance.  The interface and the two way buttons on the right are easy to use.  It has got a tiny speaker.  The sound from this speaker is not loud enough but is good to hear in a silent room.  The headphone provided with this unit is of very low quality.  I'm using a Sony MDR-EX51LP headphone which sounds great.  The equalizer in this unit is not very effective.  It does not produce a sound that of a Creative, but the bass in this unit is good.  The unit is capable of playing only a few formats of video out from factory.  Incase you want other video compatiblity, the plug-ins need to be purchased seperately and installed on the player.  I have installed both the Podcast and Movie plug-ins in my unit.  Even then the player does not support some video formats like older versions of WMV like verion 8 and below.  It only supports WMV 9.  This I feel is a major drawback since most of the videos I download form the internet is of WMV8 format and it is not supported by the player even with the plug-ins installed.  The unit comes with a USB cable to connect to the PC.  The connector on the player side is a propretory connector.  Other universal USB cables could not be used with the player.  But, with the DVR Docking Station universal USB cable could be used.  One of the excellent feature of the player is its cabability to record video from any source and playback video.  The DVR Docking Station (to be purchased seperately) is required inorder to make use of this feature.  With the docking station, I'm able to record video from TV and charge the unit at the same time.  It is also useful to playback the recorded video in TV through the video/audio out in the docking station.  I'm not sure if the travel adapter could be used to record video from TV.  But the DVR Docking Station does it all and it also comes with a remote control to operate the player.  This unit also records sound through a tiny inbuilt microphone.  The sound quality of the recorded audio is good.  The player comes with a leather sliding case which is decent.  But you will need to take the player out of the case to watch video and adjust controls.  The case does not have a window to expose the screen or the buttons on the player.  And also when I try to play a MOV video file from a DVD, there is no option to change the language.  It just plays the audio in some language which is not default to the region of the DVD.  Overall this player is good for its video recording and playback capabilities.  This is something that the iPods, Creative Zens and Others cannot do.  Highly recommended if you are looking for this feature in a multimedia player.

<Title>RUN AWAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THIS PLAYER, PLEASE
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't buy it if you don't have time and energy to figure out how to turn it on right off the box. I got my today. After 3 hours of charging, it doesn't bother to be on. I am calling Archos while I type this review. There is no help from them at all ( "your call is important to us...." but I have been waiting for 68 minutes). Why they don't pick the damn phone to talk to me. That is suck!!!  Never buy anything from Archos again. Piece of crab. Run away from it as far as you can, please. Give up on this player. Don't waste your time and money like me!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Really 4.5 Stars
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great Multi-Media player. Huge screen for such a portable size. Easy to use. Decent sized hard drive lets me store all the music, video, as well as store a lot of work-related data. Can also read pdf's though this feature slow as each page loads seperatly. Also with accessories can record and playback to your tv. Very nice. The player is recognized as a hard drive so you can just drag and drop files in windows explorer. In other words you don't have to install fascist software that takes over all the media on your PC and controls what you do with it.   As has been said the internal speaker is terrible, but headphones or portalble speakers fix that. Also, to play .mov and a few other formats requires you to pay more for plugins. You should not have to pay more for your media player to play media!   Overall it is very good.

<Title>Archos devices for do it for yoursleves
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device is perfect for those who really know how to use a computer, so on that note, I am sorry apple users. The company gives you the option to synchronize with Windows Media Player 10 or higher, but it is not essential. Just drag and drop files into the folders inside external drive icon.  It can play several file formats like mp3, wma, wmv, and whatever else. It can't play an astonishing number and you need plugins for a couple of encoded formats, which you can purchase from the company. DON'T WHANT TO? Well then how bout you open the file in a media editing software and render it again in wmv, or wma and compressed it to a 75%(save some space)...It is not that hard People, one of the biggest complaints are that it doesn't play the podcast files you got or something like. Well if you are expecting to let the magic of technology do everything for you then you have a problem with this device, LEARN HOW TO DO SOMETHING YOURSELF!!!!!!  Not everything is Wonderful with this particular model. The 404 has a built in battery, like the ipod when it goes down you have to pay to repair the thing. TigerDirect did a poor job handling my order and return so after I returned it and upgraded with Amazon to a 604 Wifi, for 19 dollars more!!!!! and it has a replacesable battery, so if your battery breaks then buy another one, it is cheaper.  Nice things about the device: Really powerful accesories, The optional port is a great thing to use for do it yourselves.PDF file reader (I got French and Italian comics, e-books and magazine articles in pdf format), if you want all that then again learn to use Adobe Acrobat people!!!! A built in microphone records straight into the hard drive, good for when I am on meetings or critiques.  Archos company: Archos has been making portable devices for 20 years, other than sony and some other giants there aren't a lot of people that can say that.  Again Learn to do some things yourself. This is something not only important for this but for everything else in your life.

<Title>Archos 404 All Around Good PVP+MP3 Player.
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I got my Archos 404 30GB about two weeks ago, and as of this point, I'm in love with this little device. It works well for videos and music, and photo's look great.  Pros: Great looking video's and photo's. Resilient LCD, I've used this device quite a lot, and so far not a single scratch. Gapless playback. Portable and Compact. Tactile Buttons- I like these!  Cons: Gets hot, gets hot rather fast. Video Format can be hard to get right, but Total Video Converter works well. AAC, have to buy plug-in for this. Battery Life-Haven't gotten much for video on it....Ah well!  All in all, I think its a great product, but could use some refining! Other than that, I totally recommend this product!

<Title>A multi-functional mp3 player.
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Archos 404 to replace a Gmini402 whose screen broke, and I like the new 404 better in some ways, but worse in others.  I had all of my files backed up as mp3's and was able to copy them directly into the Archos 404 and be up using them very quickly.  The UI is about the same.  I really like the larger color display, and being able to view video's is nice, but I got it mostly for music.  I was able to record wav files into my Gmini402 directly, and they sounded pretty good, when I used an external mixer.  Also, I did like the option of being able to copy my camera's pictures to the 404, which I couldn't do with the Gmini.   The features were not documented well enough on the Archos 404, and indeed I can do the same, but discovered I needed to buy the DVR station to do most of the things I took for granted, and that's a pretty spendy add-on.  By reading the info I could get my hands on, I decided to "cheap out" and buy the $27 Docking Adapter.  With it, I could charge my unit from the wall, and use it to transfer files between my camera and the unit.  It works fine.  I also thought I could plug a audio Line in cable into my headphone jack (with an archos supplied addapter) to get the audio line-in signal into the unit, but after ordering the video/audio cable for $20 incl shipping, I discovered that didn't work, and I need to buy the Travel adapter for another $60 to get that, and only suspect it will work to record just the audio, since I can't find that documented anywhere.  Maybe I should have gone with the DVR station, but I wasn't interested in using the unit as a DVR.    I tried to play some of the video's my little Casio camera took after loading them into the Archos 404, but discovered that the format wasn't compatible.  I figured out how to use Windows Media player to convert the video files to the right format on my computer -so I'll still need to bring it with me on trips if I want to review them in the field, but then discovered I needed to order the $20 Cinema plug-in SW to do view them on my unit even after I converted them with Windows Media Player.  I've thrown another $100 at the basic unit to get most of the functionality I "need", but I've resigned to not bother with anything better than recording from the internal microphone.

<Title>Major output power problem
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am surprised that none of the reviews here has mentioned one truly serious problem with this device. This player suffers from a very low and insufficient output power.  Actually the output signal is so week that even my high power vehicle and home stereo systems can not get the music to loud enough levels ( I am using a direct audio-out cable). When used in sports this gets really irritating. I have been pleased with the various video formats that it supports and I have been using it to watch DVD quality movies while on long flights. I was able to play WMV and AVI files out of the box while for the MPEG2 I did purchase the additional Cinema plug-in from ARCHOS Web site.  The following are additional cons: *	Cumbersome stone age menu and controls *	In video mode the battery dries out very quickly *	No power supply included *	The device crashes from time to time in the midst of playing a file. This does not happen very often but still it might be irritating *	For some reasons it would not play some AVI/DiVX/MPEG4 files. I can't explain this and I am unsure why would it play perfectly some files while fail with some other files.  In summary it is still probably one of the best players around due to the wide range of supported video file formats and outstanding screen quality.

<Title>Very good pmp device.
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned a Zune 30 before i bought this. But the new updated software just killed the Zune. I had been looking at this Archos 404 for sometime now. This blows away any Zune or Ipod and its 4th generation. I forgot how great it is to have a device thats not linked to bad software or any software period. It does everything really easy and video and music look and sound great on it. You can buy the 2 extra plugins for it to give you more codec choice and thats only 40 dollars more,but trust me its worth it. The device will almost play anything. Drag and drop truely is a wonderful thing. I have put my Zune up for sale and i'm glad i finally got the 404.
