<Title>Not worth the money
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You are probably looking at this item and thinking the same thing I was thinking before I bought this: It's very cheap, doesn't look so bad, and what can possibly go wrong. Boy was I wrong. After the first week, the garbage headphones that it came with stopped working. After a month, the sound kept on going on and off and stopped working the next week. It is also very hard to navigate around this thing. Save yourself the time and money and buy yourself something like the SanDisk Sansa m230 which is a little more money, but probably worth it. Now I'm stuck with a broken mp3 and I am going for the  m230. Trust the reviews. The people that gave this a good review, probably rated this a day after they received their mp3 player. I should have trusted the reviews before buying this. Don't get stuck with this like I did. I only rated this 2 stars, since it lasted 5 weeks.

<Title>They don't last
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased three of these this summer. I am now back to purchase something different. For the MP3 part :: One died quickly and quietly. The other two took awhile.   When you first get them they work great but after awhile they start to act up.  At first it is little glitches in the interface and then they just up and stop working.  You can replace the battery and do a reset but that only works temporarily.  It must be some tiny part or something that wears out. The voice recorder and as a Jump drive they are still working today. If you are buying as a JUMPDRIVE and VOICE RECORDER Go for it.  The MP3 part of the deal is not worth the time or money!

<Title>Nowhere near as bad as made out to be - come on people!
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Machspeed Trio 512mb nearly 2 years ago and it is working just fine - STILL!  So, to the reviewer who thinks the people giving a good review are probably reviewing after just taking their product out of the package and reviewing with one days use, I think you are not being fair and your comment is out of line.  Maybe this device works differently than others (?), but it does work!    I just purchased another unit for my adult daughter to use when she works out and bought the larger memory, same unit.  Since I plan to give her a "gadget basket" full of modern technology for Xmas (she still uses floppies...) I was trying to keep the prices in line and why I chose this device.  I wanted to set it up for her and load it with MP3 files so that when she opens, it is all ready to play.  I suppose the saavy factor should be the other way around but ironically, I am an older person who has had experience with gadgets and my daughter - d/t her lifestyle and studies, is only just beginning, and why I wanted to get her set up.      Upon opening the package I plugged the unit into my PC USB and opened as a removable drive.  Amongst the software and such pre-loaded onto the drive, there were 2 pre-loaded songs that played on my PC just fine.  Next, via drag and drop, I loaded up the unit with MP3's, closed the drive, removed from my PC USB, added a battery to the back of unit, turned it on and proceeded to set up the device.  Additionally, I chose the white background as I find the colors make the text difficult to read.    Maybe I should have read the directions (and I am female, lol...sorry guys) but I did not and relied on my intuitive skills...  Initially, I was a bit frustrated until I discovered how to use the rocker switch atop the unit but after that it was smooth sailing!  I don't care much for the sound quality via the supplied earbuds, they lack the features of a decent set of buds - but that seems commonplace with "almost" any device with supplied earbuds.  With that in mind, I purchased better quality buds for a reasonable price and resolved that issue; said and done. Of course it would be nice to have quality buds come with the device, but this is not an iPod and that was not to be the case, plus, I liked the inexpensive pricing!  Better buds come in an assortment of pricing that is not outlandish.    It seems to have a bit of a delayed start-up and the menu took a bit of patience to scroll through, learn and set up - but if old me can do this, I would venture to guess most anyone can tackle this too.  This player is all plastic and feels like you'd want to handle with care and hope to not drop.  Maybe even get some kind of a clip or velcro fastener strip for carrying.  With my older player, the USB cap lost it tight grip and would easily slip off and I suspect this device will do the same.  A piece of masking tape holds my end cap on (ugh).  My older player has some scratches in the casing, but otherwise, plays very well and lately, I have been using it as a portable storage instead of dedicated music player only b/c my cell phone conveniently has MP3, FM and voice record. This device works both ways if you outgrow it's memory size, or whatever...  Also, with both players, I find it too easy to erase songs, thus keep back-ups loaded on my PC just in case that happens. Or you could say that I only copy my songs to the device verses moving the file.   Additionally, there is a "hold" switch on the "bottom" of player for lock and unlock that can easily be bumped and one might want to keep that in mind.  As well, upon set-up there is an option to how your files will play, so make sure you have that set to your choice so you aren't left wondering why another song won't play, or not playing in order.  Optionally, one can plug this device into a portable speaker unit to enjoy your music while in the bathroom, fixing your hair and getting ready, or whatever may apply!  Overall, this player does exactly what it claims to and with better buds, sounds even better.  I like it and don't understand what all the fuss is about.  For this price, I'd give it 5 stars if it came with better quality buds...but then the pricing would go up!

<Title>Not user friendly
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>But works well once you figure it out.  Does anyone know how to turn this off without taking the battery out?  I just ordered two and the poorly written manual indicates to "hold the play button down for seconds."  I held it for 5 seconds, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc....nothing turned them off!  Help!

<Title>It's Okay,But.....
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm 13 and I had bought this with my Christmas money in hopes of having my first mp3 player...but, when I gave it to my dad to put the program that came with it that's supposed to make you be able to put music on it and all it came with was an upgrade for the program.Then, my dad went online trying to find a link and when he clicked on the link it had a black screen that said YOU ARE AN IDIOT  with a scary clown voice and i started crying cuz i was dissapointed or something and my dad eventually figured out how to put music on it without the program cuz he's a whiz at that stuff so... remember that if you try to buy it

<Title>Great for kids!
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a simple mp3 player for my 6 year old (and my 38 year old too) but I didn't want to spend $80 or more just to have it get lost or forgotten somewhere.  Even the so called "kids" mp3 players available are at least $80 or more in the toy stores.  I found this one for under $40 and it has been a great bang for the buck!  It actually does a bit more than I expected for the price.  It allows you to scroll through menus to choose music, ebooks, sort through your albums and even has a little voice recorder.  The voice recorder is great fun for the kids.  It is smaller than I expected too but the buttons are easy to learn and it is so light weight.   The earbuds are less than comfortable, but what do you expect when they "come with".  For the price, don't expect alot of bells and whistles, but this one has enough to compete with the pricey models out there.

<Content>This product was a Christmas gift for my nephew.  He didn't get to keep it because it said on the packaging that it contains a chemical that causes birth defects.  I felt really bad that he didn't get to enjoy the MP3 Player.

<Title>Bogus Rebate!!!! BUYER BEWARE-UNDERHANDED COMPANY THAT CHEATS THEIR CUSTOMERS! 
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased many items with rebates last Christmas. Digging through my records it looks as though this is the only one that didn't come. I bought it and mailed the items out correctly, and on time.  Today reading the small print and wondering why I didn't get my money, I discovered it says you have to wait 10 weeks to get your rebate, but if you don't receive it, you must contact them no later then 120 days after the promotion ends. So you have to wait 70 days, then somehow remember that you were not sent the rebate, but before 120 days is up, you have to remind them that you still want it. Otherwise you forfeit your rebate. What a scam this is. Shame on you Machspeed Technologies. All for a stupid $10 rebate. Very underhanded company.  Now to just post this review for every item they sell!

<Title>Not recommended
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My wife bought this for me so I could record audio quickly and scroll around playing back stuff and deleting what I don't want.  I find it to be a completely unintuitive product.  Most of the display is unreadable to my 50 y.o. eyes, even with reading glasses, and it has just been $40 worth of frustration for me.  The audio quality seems good, the features sound good in the manual but implementation of them is another story.  I thought I was just impatient and needed to read the manual more carefully, but after I did that I found the manual was just flat out wrong or misstated some of the products functions.  Example:  Manual says to turn player on, press and hold play button for 5 seconds.  This is not true, you simply press it and it turns on.  If you hold it for five seconds it turns off.  Manual goes on to say that to stop playing a song you hold the play button for 3 seconds.  This will actually turn the whole player off.  5 seconds are not actually required.  Having the same button that with one press turns the player on, with another press plays a song (if you are in the right mode), with another press and some amount of holding pauses the song, with another press and more holding but not too much ends the song, and with yet another press and more holding turns the player off is simply assigning too much responsibility to one button.  The interface is unusable to me, I would not buy from this company again.
