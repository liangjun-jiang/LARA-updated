<Content>This is an awesome product by Wolverine. Very easy to use. Plug and play in real sense! I could just copy DAT file from my VCD and played it on my TV. No conversions required!   Sound, video quality is great. And support to 7 types of memory cards is a blessing!!  You have to get this one for sure!!  Thanks Wolverine!

<Title>Can't be happier !!!!!

<Content>If you are thinking about getting an IPOD or other multi-media player, think again. I have had my MVP for almost two months. Other than being somewhat large, I'm more than impressed. I was looking for a player than could hold my entire CD and DVD collection, that could connect to my home stereo and replace my bulky multi-disc player. This unit was the ticket. After looking at the minimal amount of storage that the others offered, as well as the multitude of other accessories for their players, I went with the Wolverine. It sounds amazing and it's very easy to use. Equally important to the player, is the customer service. In all my years in the banking business, I'm always impressed by amazing customer service. This company takes it to a new level. I had a problem with my player due to a virus traveling to the external drive. I sent them the player, they transferred all my files and sent me a new player immmediately, no questions asked. (2) of my co-workers just purchased IPODs and are kicking themselves, due to versatility of the Wolverine MVP. I have it hooked to my Denon receiver and have given my multi-disc player to my daughters. Go Wolverine MVP, you can't miss !

<Title>The Perfect Accessory
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered the 60 GB Wolverine MVP player after several months of shopping. I wanted a portable unit that I could download my CF cards too while shooting, take audio notes on, and play music on. The MVP is perfect! So far, my battery seems to last for about seven hours of music play, and I can show hundreds of photos to people very easily. I've played with the audio recording function, and the built-in microphone seems to perform well for my needs. The only thing I haven't used this for is to watch any kind of video yet, mostly because I don't do a lot in that medium.

<Title>Great if it only worked
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I needed an MP3 player that would allow picture storage especially during travel. My wife takes a lot of pictures. The concept of Wolverine seemed great. No propriatory software, direct download from multiple card formats, music player, video etc. When I received it I was definitely disappointed with the size. It is a BRICK!!!!!. They do not offer any decent carrying cases that would allow easy access while walking etc and protect it at the same time, like some cases for the iPod. The only one on their accessory list is very unappealing. These are minor things. I ordered mine from Costco. It took 2 weeks to arrive and did not work. After an hour with a support representative (very good and patient) we could not make my two different computers recognize the device. They offered to send me a replacement one but I declined. I am not sure we started off on the right foot. I hope they make some adjustments in the size and software. I may give it a second chance some time in the future. For now I got a Phillips GoGear 8GB for music, radio while jogging and we will continue to use our old portable CD burner to transfer photos. By the way GoGear is great and beats comparable iPods hands down as far as both price and features.

<Title>Versatile Device
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the 80GB version and it's working out great.  Don't buy it if all you want is an MP3 player!  The reviewers who did that all whine about the size and I don't think that's what this machine is about, although I loaded tons of music directly, not the proprietary tunes, but MP3's directly from the PC--just drag and drop, no strain, and they sound great with the Sony 'phones I use.  Where this thing shines, for my use, is the ability to download and save images directly from memory cards--works with both SD and CF cards so far and is as fast downloading the HS cards as my PC is.  Awesome in the field and simple to B/U cards with a couple clicks, and even easier to xfr the files to a computer, as the Wolverine is recognized simply as an HD in XP.  I fully intend to use the mike, too.  Sound quality is better than my Sansa, would be fine for lectures, and I'm looking forward to getting night sounds from the jungle to accompany my slide shows.  BTW, the included remote works nicely.    The battery seems to have pretty good life, downloads 12GB + many on-screen reviews between charges and is totally user replaceable--a spare with external charger is ~$20 from the mfgr.  Haven't tried max listening time with music.  For its size, I'm not sure why they didn't just toss in an FM tuner as the other non-Apple competition did so nicely, but again that would be redundant for my photo storage focus anyway.  The price is right for such a versatile, multipurpose device.

<Title>Yeah about that... 
<Date>Sat Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing blows... I think they had all there workers write these reviews because it is  1. TOO big WAY big like omg you think you wont mind its not that big but no it really is WAY TOO BIG 2. It freezes... a lot 3. It is not compatible with most music download programs 4. The color is obnoxious  5. Sure it will play the music you have cd's for 6. OK the picture uploading ability is cool but honestly... why not just get a bigger card for your camera? I thought I would use it a lot but its not the reality.  I definitely lost on this deal.

<Title>Wolverine MVP Portable Storage
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this product primarily for photo storage so I haven't yet used the other features. I used it on a trip to Alaska where I took hundreds of pictures. Instead of having to buy numerous memory cards, I was able to transfer photos to the Woverine & re-use the memory card. Then, I loaded the photos onto my computer. The Wolverine screen is easy to read & the instructions are good. I've been a little disappointed with the battery life as I have to re-charge it frequently. However, it is a great companion for those wanting to store photos, music & videos all in one unit.

<Content>This device is a foolproff way to make your JPegs totally portable with excellent clarity. A perfect product, but battery life sucks and sound quality way behind an iPod.

<Title>Exactly what I wanted
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I didn't want to carry a lap top on my trip as I don't edit my photos until I return home. I wanted a photo storage device that would allow me to store and review my photos while traveling and that is exactly what I got. I downloaded my pictures on a daily basis and didn't have to worry about losing all my photos if the card failed or was corrupted. I could also share my photos with others or view them on the TV in my room. I'm very pleased with my purchase.

<Title>Poor CF receiver, worst Customer Service
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The CF receiver pins bent after light use. I also have a Dooin which is the same type of unit but without the display. I have used the Dooin for several years without a problem. When I email Customer Service Rico stated it used caused by user error. I do not understand how they could reach this decision without looking at the unit. I ask him to have Matt the owner contact me... he has not.  They do have warning about inserting the CF card. They have a bad design and they need to fix it.  This unit might be ok using SD or anything other than CF, but watch out if you need to deal with customer service.
