<Title>Good features, great price,  works good for a light user
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a CD buyer by heart, and MP3 players are just toys for me when I'm traveling or my wife is working out.  This MP3 player has so far done it all for me.  It holds around 500 mp3's, and I prefer to use the MP3 file format exclusively.  All of my mp3's have worked so far, wheather I have made them, or downloaded them from a sharesite.  The sound is not that bad, I didn't expect much from the sound, but I'm pleasently surprised. The customizable equalizer works reasonably well.  Even if this player does have issues, I purchased the extended warranty for 2 years, replacement garunteed under normal use conditions, so i'll keep replacing it with the same or equivelent.  This is on sale at a big chain store this week, worth picking up for a travel unit, but not as the be all, end all of an avid MP3 downloader user.    Only con-this did not come with an armband, but it's not to expensive to pick up a clip/band.  Worth a shot, I think you will like it.  It is on sale at a big chain store this week (9-10-9/16 2006) for 90 dollars.  not bad.  I even had a coupon

<Title>Great Value player, plays most everything, Nice color screen
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I also have the M230 512mb model from sandisk. It has been a nice addition to my gadgit collection.  This model is a big step up to 2 gigabytes and a color screen, but maintains most of the same features as my other player. This model also features a build in FM receiver, which is nice for days you want to list to the radio or news.  This player uses windows media player 9 to load mp3 files to the device, but you can also drag and drop if preferred.  As far as battery life, to new to tell. I see a prior reveiwer had problems with battery life in this model, but you can controll the length the backlight stays on, as well as a power save setting that will shut the player off after a set amount of time of inactivity, good if you use the player at night at bedtime.  I know on the other player of mine, I got around 12 hours of life, but with the color screen this may use a bit more.  This model, as well as the others, does have a neat little equalizer setting to it, and the earbuds acutally deliver a good sound.  So as a MP3 player, this is a great value. Again, does not play Itunes, but their are plenty of other services that it does play.

<Title>Not as Thin as It Looks
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The photos of this product are misleading.  This product is described as "ultra-thin", however it's actually almost an inch thick.  That makes it nearly three times thicker than an ipod nano.  The photos don't show the rear, which has a rounded shape to accomodate the AAA battery.

<Title>Serious Flaw in Product parts
<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for about 4 months. I need to replace the USB transfer cable. I cannot find a source for this cable....The MP3 player is useless without the cable. How could SanDisk sell this item with replacement parts?

<Title>Good unit for the price!
<Date>Fri Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned three other Sandisk MP3 players and had no problems with any of them. Some of the issues in other reviews here can be solved by reading the manual.  Simply set to MSC mode and the player acts just like a removeable hard drive when connected via USB. Very simple to transfer or delete songs etc.  The 2Gb is reasonably good capacity... in fact, great capacity considering the price. The FM radio works fine, although a little trickier to navigate than some older sandisk models. Color screen is good, although a little too small to be practicable to view photos on. The song title can also take a little too long to scroll fully.   I had no trouble with sound quality or crackling or clipping at start of song. Sound quality is fine! Battery life also seems good for me. I have even ran some el cheapo batteries with it and had good life up to the stated specs (although this depends on how much you press buttons and have the screen lit up).   Voice recorder is handy, although I find I don't use it too much, your mileage may vary though. As a basic MP3 player and radio, I find it hard to beat given the price tag. I have no issues with size of the unit. Sure its not as thin as an Ipod Nano, but it takes one AAA battery which you can get anywhere. No need to have a power point to recharge.  I think some people expect perfection for a budget price!
