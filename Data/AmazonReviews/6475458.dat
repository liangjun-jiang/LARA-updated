<Title>The Worst Purchase I've Ever Made
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I regret purchasing Creative's Zen Vision W 100%. I spent a lot of time researching players, and narrowed it down to the Vision W and Zune's 30 GB player, and I made the wrong choice. Though I haven't loaded any pictures or video yet, I will say that the screen is BEAUTIFUL -very clear and I love the widescreen. The sound is great, even with my mediocre headphones. It's big, though, and heavy, though that didn't bother me at all. I cannot give this item anything but an F, and if I could give it zero or negative stars, I would.  When I received the player I was able to load 1300 songs right away. No problems whatsoever. However, starting with the very next day, when I tried to load more, I had nothing but complete failure. Suddenly the device wasn't recognized, other than maybe once every 15 tries. Even in that one time the player was recognized, it froze in 'DOCKING' mode before any songs could be added, and the only way to do anything -even turn it off -was to remove the battery and then have the system 'REBUILD.' I hate this player, and will never buy another Creative product. The Creative website, too, is a joke. There are all these questions you have to answer -none of which gives you an answer, other than something like, 'You should change your Reg files. Here's how to do it.' Then it tells you, once you update the Reg files, your system may become unstable. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! I'm going to do that when I don't even know what the problem is? I notice, also, that CL obviously doesn't want to talk to customers -all CS is YOU spending time troubleshooting. I finally fired off an email -I'm sick of wasting my time. I paid $258 to waste my time? So the emails tell me to reboot, then when that didn't work to update the Reg files, which I did. Nothing helped. Customer service then told me I would have to send the player in to have it analyzed, and if they couldn't find anything wrong, I'd be charged for postage both ways. In a last-ditch effort I finally reformatted the stupid thing -erasing the nearly 4 hours of time spent downloading the 1300+ songs already on the beast. Only then could I re-load the songs. After doing that I knew the next day would be make-or-break. I tried adding more songs. Nope. Apparently, one had better load all the songs one ever wants at one time, or forget about it. I had the same exact problems as before -freezing in docking mode and an unrecognized device. Thankfully, Amazon is great. I've purchased so much from them over the years and this is the first item I've ever had to return anything. They made the entire process completely painless, as far as returning the defective item for a full refund. I do not recommend the Creative Zen Vision W AT ALL. It's garbage, and their customer service is severely lacking.

<Title>Good player if only I can get it to connect
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this 2 weeks ago and was able to play with it.  I immediately updated the firmware and tranferred a few GB of files.  Unfortunately, the connection broke and I'm now unable to connect the device to my computer via USB.  It just won't detect it.  I looked on the forums and quite a few people have this problem.  I tried this on 2 computers and got the same problem.  With the files I was able to play I really do like the player.  The screen is nice and it comes with a screen protector.  The movies play a bit slow especially bigger ones.  I have only 2 gripes about this besides the USB connection issue.  1) No strap.  Isn't the reason for having a mobile player is to bring it around.  Having a device of this size I would expect a strap so that I feel safe holding out just in case someone bumps into me.  There wasn't even a hole for my own strap!  2) Audio and video adjuster.  It would be nice to have some control to adjust the video settings and audio settings while playing a video.

<Title>Great improvement over the old Vision!
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my second pvp after the original creative zen vision and this version basically picked up where the old unit left off and corrected the minor issues for a stellar little machine!!  1.The viewing angle issues that plagued the first generation are gone completely allowing me to share the video with multiple ppl without having to adjust everyone in some exact manner.  2.No one ever fussed about the speaker and neither did I until I fired up the little speaker on this baby that blew away the previous model's COMPLETELY!!  3.I have bad vision and the small letters on the vision were slightly annoying because of that...but NO MORE with these big clear letters on this big beautiful screen!!!  4.The jump in video quality is very noticeable even by average joe sixpack...and the screen size increase is a very welcome improvement as well which only adds to that nice and sturdy feeling that assures you that this product should work for a long time.  5.One thing that bothered me about the old model was it's visual appeal with that tacky chrome-like bordering which also left fingerprints, and made it look sorta cheap...thank god Creative fixed that with that brushed metal look and the screws that keep them locked on to the Zen making it look like a real fashionable yet tough machine invulnerable to that annoying fingerprint that plauges the ipod and several other electronics.  So basically all in all it's the result of Creative's will to please it's fanbase and create an affordable alternative to the ever so mundane smallscreen videoplaying MP3 players out there.

<Title>non-tech review
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My Creative Zen player died on me (through carelessness on my own part) and I decided to get a replacement. I was looking for another mp3 player but spotted this instead. Afer much deliberation - I only wanted to spend under $100 on an mp3 player, so I had to take in account the other features that come with this - I decided to go for it. And I have not regretted it since.   Like I mentioned in review title, this is strictly non-technical, because I am as layman a user as you can get, so the technical stuff just go over my head. I will simply tell you what I like about this player and why I feel every penny spent is justified. I'm not someone who will read the whole manual, and I'd rather just start using and learn as I use the item. Only when I am stuck or something bad happens do I start looking through, therefore everything I say here is from my own experience with my player. This might be a good review for someone else like me.  My findings:   The screen is very good, the picture is clear and the angle of view is good. My friends and I crowded around it when I first got it, and everyone could see clearly what was shown on the screen. The sound on the built-in speaker isn't that great for songs, but for watching a movie, it works good.   It plays everything I have downloaded so far. When the format or file is unsuitable, the software automatically tells you to convert. All you have to do is follow the steps and the files will be changed to fit into the player. It will even transfer the file when the conversion is finished. Granted, conversion takes a while (I don't know what a standard time to convert a full movie file is though) but usually I leave it to convert and transfer while I sleep and everything's done by the time I wake up. I love how I can just leave it to work while I go away or to sleep.  The files you download, if under a folder, will automatically be transferred under a folder of the same name. I haven't worked out if I can move the files around in the player yet (when hooked to the computer), because I would like to just have all movies under one folder instead of having 20 differently named folders with 1 movie in each. But some people might like this aspect, so it's a personal issue for me.  A small thing that I like is that the album picture of the song you're playing will be displayed when you play the song. This is not the case for all songs, especially if downloaded from unknown sources online. But if you ripped it from your cds, it should display the picture.  I'm still a little confused about how the fast forward and rewind button works. It seems that for some movies it will simply skip to bookmarked points, whereas others it will work as if it's a VCR and you have to stop it. When in such a "VCR mode", picture doesn't run while in fast forward or rewind, so you'll need to get used and I bet you'll be able to estimate well with experience.  There are a few view modes on this player, Fit to Screen, Stretch to Full,  Zoom to Full & Original Size. I find myself using Zoom to Full when viewing widescreen movies. The Stretch to Full makes everything look out of proportion, so I'm not touching that.  I tried the built in microphone once to record my friend snoring from about 2 feet away. I couldn't hear it when I play back on the built-in speaker but I can hear the snoring when I use the headphones. Another instance I recorded my friends and I chatting normally while sitting at different positions in a enclosed room, and we could hear just fine from the speakers when we play it back. So it might be ok for normal volume recording but most likely you'll use it for personal voice recording.  I don't know if it's a technical issue, but I'm bummed that you can't use the fm radio without using the headphones. It'd have been nice to be able to set it down and listen to the radio sometimes.  I haven't had the player go flat on me yet - it charges up whenever it's plugged through the USB, so I never have to worry about it. I only plug it in with the adaptor when I am in a hurry to charge it up, otherwise I wait till I am transferring files on it. It gives good playback life, although I haven't really timed it. All I know is I bring it with me on the road and after watching 2 or 3 movies, it's still not out. The auto-shutdown feature is great because there will be the occasion when you just forget to turn it off and you'll be glad that it didn't run flat because of that.  I uploaded photographs and although the quality of the pictures isn't perfect (you get that compressed look), it's more than sufficient to be able to view the photographs in detail. You can even rate your pictures so that you can view only pictures from a certain rating that you wish. Of course, the slideshow feature is always a good thing.  Plugging the player into the tv was easy! Once plugged in, your tv screen will reflect what is shown on the player. All you have to do is select your movie/music/photo slideshow and play as per normal! It's that simple!  A lot of people have complained about the size of it, though I admit it is a little bulky, I don't see the point of having a tiny player which will come with a tiny screen and then you won't be able to view much anyway. So for my viewing enjoyment, I'll gladly accept the size :)  Hope this has been helpful to you!

<Title>Excellent, but not perfect; great software.
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to agree with all the previous reviews that this is an amazing product. I can do so much more with this thing than my last PMC which got stolen.:( the sound quality is great, and the colors on the videos are amazing. I liked the calendar feature, the memory card feature, and especially being able to change the background and the theme. I also found that the creative software is great for converting videos from google video, itunes, and recordings from a computer. The bag it comes in is useless, and the cord broke the second day of use. So i bought a psp screen cover for $5 at target that fits the screen perfectly.i am also thinging about buying the leather case for more protection. Also, if you have a lot of music artists, you can scroll down them alphabeticlly on the side. i really like that. my only gripe is that you have to put the player on hold for the screen to completely go off to save the battery. Overall, a great product that i hope will last me for years to come. DONT BUY AN IPOD!! this thing is tons better and cost the same! if you do your homework, you will find that this,a nd many other products are far better than the ipod.

<Title>Great gadget
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This devise is very slick. It does everything it advertises, and for me so far, it does them perfectly. I just wish we could mix such great features into a wireless phone and add WiFi and bluetooth. Such a combination would satisfy my tech needs for quite some time.  I have found the W to be very easy to use. There are not a lot of places yet to easily get video for such devices though. I have found the usual places, but I can watch dvds on my home player. Getting personal video onto the computer is very time consuming, but that is not the fault of the ZVW. I love the FM radio and I like the fact that I can easily transfer my podcasts to the ZVW.

<Title>Loved it, but not enough to keep it...
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read most of the positive reviews and ordered the Zen Vision W. I got mine today. Used it for several hours and am sending it back tomorrow. Why you ask?  The screen is gorgeous. I love the screen. It is so much better than my video iPod's.  But it had some quirky things I didn't care for. Lots of buttons and not all in the best positions. Not a deal-breaker, just something I thought was ergonomically off (ps - I don't care all that much for the iPod wheel either)...  I hated the software that comes with the Zen. It is nowhere near as good as iTunes and requires way too many programs to do badly whay iTunes does great.  I signed up for the IzzyVideo ZenCast (I have all o fthe iPod version Izzy as well). They downloaded fine and then took forever to "convert" into the Zen. Convert? Geez, I thought it read just about everything. Half the things I tried to download gave conversion errors. Maybe I was doing something wrong, but if I was, the software wasn't intuitive enough...   Unlike my iPod, I can't simply drag and drop items into it from my file explorer...   The Zen was slow. It loaded videos and music quite slowly which surprised me. It also seemed to have no volume control that worked. With headphones on the only volume available was loud. It would not allow me to lower the volume even though I had the volume level to zero... Didn't seem to affect it and my ears were ringing it was so loud...  All in all, I feel so sad sending it back and looking at my iPod video... I can only hope the widescreen iPod is good (if it's real as the rumors say)...

<Title>BEUATIFUL & SIMPLE TO USE!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Beautiful is one of the only words you can use to describe the still and video images this player is capable of. They can be absolutely stunning. This pmp is so easy to navigate that my 95 year old grandmother wants one after she saw it! There is just tons of space on this thing. I've already put almost all my music (which is farely extensive) and about 3 years worth of photos on it and i've barely scratched the surface! I still have about 26gb left! I don't have any videos on it yet. It is so cool even for the technology challenged person. It can easily be connected to any tv using the av jacks. The only real downside to this pmp is that it doesn't record video so you can't use it like a dvr. Creative doesn't make a zen player with that capability that i'm aware of. If it did it would be second to none. It's not a big deal if you're not really into movies, but if you are it's kind of a blow, because it would be much simpler to direct record something off your tv than converting all those video files and stuff just to get a dvd on the thing, especially for the techno challenged consumer. If it were a recorder you would just simply put the dvd in the player and record directly from the tv and voila, your favorite movie is now on your player. One other drawback at this time is the lack of a good wireless remote accessory. They only have one that is barely available and i think there are some problems with it, because i don't think it was designed specifically for this pmp. Again, it might not seem like a big deal, but remember this is multimedia playe,not just a mp3 player/photoviewer. If they want you to put your life's entertainment on it, it would be a lot easier to navigate with a good remote! When you connect to a tv, the remote is a almost a must, it's a pain without it!

<Title>I love it
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I do not normally write reviews, but after reading others I'd like to clear a few things up. A. It does have a volume control. B. It plays almost any downloaded .avi video file you can throw at it without the admittedly long conversion time needed. A simple check of the file you want will let you know if conversion is needed. The player only accepts avi files with an mp3 audio track, otherwise conversion will happen during transfer. It is usually the audio format that requires conversion. I have had no trouble on my aging Win XP using the software provided. C. It is easy to convert a DVD to a format for this player and it takes about an hour on a 4 year old OLD AMD 1800+ Athlon. Figure your time if you have a newer 'puter to be faster. I especially like third party programs such as cloneDVDmobile for this purpose. D. Drag and drop DOES work.   This player suits my needs PERFECTLY.   I exercise on machines and love to watch videos time shifted from my computer's TV card. The 4.3 inch screen is the size that just tips the scale to comfortable viewing in my opinion. The Zume while bigger than most is not as big as the Vision W nor as colorful.   It is super in hotel rooms as it hooks up easily to 90 percent of the cheap 27 inch televisions I find. It goes right in the front of the set and you are done; where my laptop outputs only s-video and needs an act of congress to configure IF there is an s-video input which is almost never.   The audio is excellent. Playlists are a snap to configure with or without your computer. There is room for up to ten bookmarks for audio. Resume play works for audio or video files in which your shut the player down in the middle of a file and play is resumed at that point when you turn the player back on. I like that when I am reading an audiobook in the car or watching a movie in pieces as I sometimes do during exercise.  If you jog or like to use your player in your pocket while you are active this or ANY TRUE portable media player (meaning with a decent sized screen) is NOT for you. While it will fit in almost any pocket and is easy to tote from place to place this way, it will become uncomfortable if you are exercizing and bouncing around a lot because of its weight.  It is unfortunate that this player is not in the major brick and mortars to see and touch before you buy it. If I had been able to see it in one of those places, I would have bought it MUCH sooner as I was worried about the chance of spending money on a screen that was too small to use and an item too big and heavy to carry in a pocket. Turns out that it was a flawless match for my needs.

<Title>Good for video.
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned this Zen Vision W for a few months now and I love it. It's got a great screen and 30 GB is big enough. I got it as a birthday gift, otherwise I probably wouldn't have bought it on my own.  Pros: Great screen. Good hard drive. Easy to use.  Cons: Not great as an MP3 player (too big). Can't play a folder of videos, just one file at a time. Trouble transferring stuff in and getting it to fit exactly to the screen size, even though Creative feels like they dealt with this using a "Zoom to Fit" feature.  Overall, it's a neat tool. Best for taking ALL of your family photos with you and being able to setup slide shows for the Grandparents. Or catching up on vidcasts.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a present for my wife.  She loves being able to load it up with lots of photos to show off the grandkids and still have plenty of space for music.  Display and sound quality are good. The menus are simple to use, which is a big plus for her. The included software isn't fancy but it does the job. I like being able to use it as an external data drive. It comes in handy if we're visiting and I don't have a thumb drive with me. The only real complaint is that the instructions could be better, especially for the software.  I recommend buying the optional rubberized skin.  The non-skid surface gives the player a better feel and doesn't interfere with operation.
