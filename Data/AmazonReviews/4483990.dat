<Title>Poor Design - Poor Battery Life - I returned it
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Briefly put:  1- The toggle switch was easily bumped, thus suddenly switching songs, etc... such as when carrying in pocket, or when running with it in the sport band. (I did not discover a way to lock these features when using) 2- The battery life (it takes 1 AA battery and is not rechargeable) lasts about 2 hours before needing replacement. 3- It does not remember where you were in a song, podcast, or playlist, so if you turn it off and come back, one searches to find where one was at. 4- The forward search is very slow. 5- The fm radio only pulls in the strongest stations in the area. After 28 days I returned it, just in time (30 days window to the store I bought it from).

<Title>Was ok, but...
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, this was my first experience with an MP3 player, I figured I'd try them before I go for the IPOD. Maybe I should have gone all out from the beginning.  I initially liked it's features. The fm tuner was nice, for when I wanted to listen to my favorite show. I also liked the stopwatch. The sound is pretty good, too.  Then, things started to break. First, the battery clip broke off, but I coould still force it closed. Then one day I turned it on and all of my songs had been erased, I had to reload them, I was very annoyed.  Lastly, I turned it on last week and it now reads "boot error" I have tried everything but nothing seems to work. I have this thing  for less than three months, so this is a little frustrating.  Hope this helps,   EW

<Title>Failure After Failure
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My first mp3 player, a little 1GB FM-tuner off-brand, lasted eighteen months of daily usage before I broke the headphone jack.  Seeking a similarly-priced substitute, I bought this one.  I regret it.  The concept of this device is attractive - a 2GB player with a space for another 1GB card, plus an FM tuner and some strange My DJ feature that a podcaster like me never used, but the actual player failed in three key ways.  The first failure came right out of the box:  The FM reception is extremely poor.  In my area, there are six 100,000W stations, and only three come in, some with heavy static when a roof is overhead.  The auto-search feature will sometimes find one or all six, but also includes stations without an actual signal, necessitating the time to delete and replace most of the presets.  That is the second failure:  Random preset deletion.  Every few weeks, I'll turn on the player to find the volume all the way up and all my presets gone, not to mention the full reversal of my audio file listings (e.g. the first song in the folder is #16 on the album, the last is #1).  There is no pattern to this that I can tell, though sometimes it will occur if I leave a dead battery in the player for a few days.  The third, and catastrophic, failure is a fault in the software preventing me from loading, well, anything at all.  One morning, I connected the USB to load the day's podcasts and it came back with an obscure disconnection error.  After some testing, I found I could load a single (4MB) file at a time, then manually disconnect, reconnect, and do another.  Larger files or multiple files trigger a disconnection, preventing any practical mp3 functionality.  The device failed completely when I threw it against the wall.    If you want a good MP3 player with a radio tuner, this is not it.  An IPod Mini, even with its flaws, is by far preferrable.
