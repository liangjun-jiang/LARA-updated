<Content>This product is awesome! I swim a mile 3x's a week and was getting a little bored but loved the exercise. This solved that problem completely. The sound is great and I haven't had a single problem yet. I have recharged the battery after about 5 workouts but was not having any issues with the battery at that point. I have 30 songs loaded but it has more space so I think you could get more like 35 songs on it. It has shuffle and all the features you need. I highly recommend it!

<Content>I like swimming with this mp3 player but I am a little concerned about what will happen when the strap breaks. I have had several goggles where the strap broke. I hope the strap on this mp3 does not wear out. I also wish the software would let me organize a play list. It shows up as a hard drive on my desktop and I have no idea what order the songs will play in. I am on a Macintosh.   One more thing but I don't know how to solve this problem. The sound of the water splashing while you swim can get in the way of your music. After a few laps I notice that I block out the water sound. It also takes me a few laps to adjust the goggles to keep the water out of my eyes.

<Title>Makes the boredom go away
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a fantastic product. I use it everytime I swim. The only issue I have is when I flip turn the pads move over my ears, and the sound can get LOUD. But, I am just nit picking. The sound quality is great esp. in the water, where it is meant to be used.  Anything easy listening will be hard to hear around the splashing of the water, but I listen to alot of rock and metal which comes through just fine.  This product is made for lap swimmers, it successfully removes the inevitable boredom that comes with swimming endless laps.
