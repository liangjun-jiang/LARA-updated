<Title>Amazing player! It does it ALL!!!!

<Content>If you're thinking of any kind of getting any kind of mp3 player. Get this one!! Was hesitate to purchase this player, but after reading other positive reviews I went ahead and got it off their website.  The transaction was smooth. They notified me 24hours after I made payment that it was shipped out and with a tracking number. 2 days later the player is at my doors, and in my hands. Fast shipping time!  First thing I noticed about is is the screen, upon turning it on I was greeted with a beautiful color display. The menus are very organized and straightforwardly labeled. Everything is easily accessible through the menus.  I proceeded to go ahead add music to my new player :) I looked at the manual to see how to put music on it and it was pretty clear, and straight to the point, everything you needed to know, nothing you dont.  Plugged it into my computer's USB port and everything was up and running. Just dragged some of my songs from my computer and onto the player. Unplugged it from the computer after it was done. Turned on the player and there it was. WAY EASIER then my friend's iPod!!!! Sound is clear either through the headphone or the built in speakers (Which are great!!)   The video is also very clear for a screen of it'z size and portability. Video/Audio sync is perfect. I have a lot of little video clips on there. It's fun for when you're on the go and need a little visual entertainment.  Besides video and music, you can also put your personal pictures to show off to your friends and family. FM radio gets good reception and sounds as good as any other FM radio I've used.  Overall I' am VERY HAPPY with this player. If you're looking for one get this one!!! MUSIC, VIDEOS, PICTURES, FM RADIO, VOICE RECORDER, and 1GB of storage!!! It doesn't get any better then this when it comes to mp3 players.  Don't let the price fool you. This is a GREAT DEEAL, this small player packs a BIG punch!!

<Title>dead device- no customer service
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Visual-land 1GB MP3/MP4 player in April 2006. I was pleasantly suprised at how easy it was to download music to and used it 3-5 times a week while walking to work.  It was very genlty used & never dropped. It was recharged over the weekend, but it appeared that the charges did not last more than 3-4hours.  Then on July 7th 2006, it died.  I sent an e-mail to VisualLand, Inc.and have not received a reply.  To date I have sent 3 e-mails & still no response. I will never purchase another electronic product over the internet and maybe it is not the fault of the internet but of the manufacturer. I would not recommend this product because if something goes wrong they don't appear to support their product.

<Title>Bought 4 for Christmas 05
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 4 of these for Christmas gifts in November 2005. For my sons(adult) I picked the 1g and for 2 other adult male family members the 512mb.  Had to send 1 back as it did not work and they responded in reasonable time.   Pros: good price AT TIME for 1g + had viewer,user friendly, easy to load, nice quality picture (over age 50 forget it ...too small for using as a movie viewer), really nice sound. The 512mb-1 stopped working and was put way for a few weeks then tried on a whim to recharge-still working. Other 512mb is still working-only been used a few times.   Con: They are not reliable. The 1g(s) stopped working after about 4 months of normal use-didn't hold charge. The 512mb-1 stopped working and was put way for a few weeks then tried on a whim to recharge-still working. It is being used frequently now and forsee it not lasting much longer...the charges are getting weaker. The 1g were left for awhile and tried to recharge also...didn't work.  Overall: I bought these when MP3s were very expensive and there really were no MP4(viewer) players out. They were a great gift(at the time) and thought that they would hold up better than they did. If visual land made them more reliable with battery performance I think they have a really good product. (I pretty sure I paid 129 each for the 1g and 79 for the 512mb)
