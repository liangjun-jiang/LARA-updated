<Date>Mon Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>well i bought this one knowing it was cheap, i guess i just wanted to try for a couple of bucks if i could avoid spending 150 dollars on the speedo mp3.... bad choise it turns out to be a very cheap 128 mega mp3 that goes inside a pretty big and not so nice looking plastic bubble thats almost the size of a big red bull can (energizer drink) and its pretty hard to swim with it..... and worst of all, the mp3 player did not work, so i use it now as a pretty limited usb drive(memory stick) red colored and expensive, knowing that the 1 giga usb stick goes around 14.99 (kingstone) so i got a 40 something dollar mp3 player that dosent work good and looks bad, so save yourself a couple of bucks.... the one thing its pretty good are the waterproof earbuds, but i can use the with out and mp3 of course.   thank you for your time.

<Title>Best Waterproof MP3 Player On The Market
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't know what "Picasso" was talking about, since first of all the H20 Man is 512 MB, not 128 (which was, I think, an old original product). Secondly, the bubble - which has all the controls on the outside; easily pressed in the water - is small, and fits on the front or the back of my bathing suit (or even on the band of a scuba mask if you snorkel, which I do) or on the velcro armband that comes with it.  Third, this little thing has great stereo sound - even better under water! - and best of all the silicone earplugs don't fall out of your ears when you're moving fast.  It's drag and drop too, so I just connect it to my laptop and drag all my MP3's on it. The 512 MB holds a ton, and sometimes I put an entire audio book on it for a different kind of workout instead. The price is amazing - though I admit I got it for a bit less on The Writers' Collective site, and the one I got a year ago is still going strong.

<Title>Decent

<Content>I bought this over a year ago (cost me $75!) and I loved it while it lasted. The plastic bubble may not be slick or pretty, but the player is not at all cumbersome while swimming; the sound is quite good and the batteries last a long time. The player functions suddenly stopped about a month ago, but for the price now, I would definitely get another one. I am not upset that it stopped working, actually I put it through a LOT because I was using it heavily for memory as well as playing music outside the water all this time. If anything I am surprised at its sturdiness.

<Title>not bad, for the price

<Content>I've been using this mp3 player for about 9 mos. It takes some time getting used to it though. The housing is bulky and annoying. The headphones have been working, but lately the sound is fading in one of them. They are also bulky and I have a hard time keeping them in my ears- and after an hour swim they hurt. But overall, for the price it does the job.
