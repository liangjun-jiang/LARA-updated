<Content>I did a lot of research into the different MP3 players before selecting this one almost a year ago. I wanted one that was small, had approximately 1-2 gigs of space and would be easy to use. It exceeded my expectations. I wouldn't trade it for a different mp3 player.

<Content>I bought this for my 24 year old son for christmas. He loves it. It is easy to download music. He likes the size and all the features this player has. As I read in other reviews of this product, the ear buds are not the best, they won't stay in his ears very well.He purchased a different pair, but a great player for the price.If you are wanting to spend about this much it is well worth it.
