<Content>This Media Player is really worth the price.  I did a lot of searching and this one seemed to offer everything I needed without having to spend a lot.  It plays clear and the support is great. I downloaded free stuff from the site and will buy another one for girlfriend since she's always using mine.

<Title>Great Player For Everybody
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got 2 of these. One for my husbad that travels and another for the home. I can convert a whole DVD in 2 steps (mpeg2 then dvix) the final file is around 89-129MB depending on the length of the movie. Watch the width size or file may not play. 160-144 pixles is great. 15 fps gets the size smaller. Dr Divx is an older program but works awsome.  Picture clarity on screen great, sound good, battery life up to 2 movies. So far on a 2 gig card ( I got $18.00 new egg) I stored 8 movies , variety of music , and about 120 pictures. Be sure and reduce to size of pictures or it could take up to five seconds for the zvue to adjust it for you to fit. The pictures can play in a slidshow mode. Great settings.  Customer support Awsome. They answer right away at night WOW. Had trouble updating firmware and player froze (my fault). I paniced cause I wanted to give it at Christmas Day, which was 2 days away, and support one day aired me a 128MB card that had the new firmware upgrade and problemed solved. I was able to wrap and give ready with movies working.   My only complaint is their Zapp software doesn't convert the files small enough. A movie with their soft ware is 500-600MB. So Be advised you'll have to use 3rd party software and again watch the pixle width so it will play properly. Drag and drop your converted files via USB into the formated card in it's proper file. I only use Zapp software to format the SD card. If you use their software to transfer files it will want to reconvert it and then size is increaded. If you are not tech savey then software will work fine just be sure to get a 4Gig card.

<Title>Great little media player
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did the research and even bought a couple of the other media players, the Ipod Video and the Samsung T9.  I didn't like the hassle of iTunes and the Samsung had limited space.  The Zvue has an SD expansion slot.  I already had a few SD cards left over from my old digital camera so I'm set.  Also, the cards are now available up to 8gb.  The sound quality is pretty good even with the volume turned up all the way.  The video is a little pixelated but it depends on what you're watching and how close you hold it.  It's very easy to transfer files and to navigate.  Overall, I'm very pleased.

<Title>Awful waste of time
<Date>Wed Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was a present for my 9-yr-old. From the reviews that I read, it seemed like a good replacement for the more expensive iPod Video but that is simply not true. You can only download the company's [ZVUE] videos and music, none of which are child-friendly except if your child is a half-wit...iTunes is a much easier and more varied company to buy music and videos from. I am now sorry that I will need to spend the extra $100 to replace this mess with an iPod Video; a present is a present...

<Title>Not an iPod killer, but it'll do.
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was never one to follow trends. Especially, overly-hyped ones. So I've never watched "Miami Vice," "Survivor," "ER". Never had a pet rock or My Little Pony. I will never own a Blackberry, or a Razr, or a Chocolate (cell phone that is, of course I'll eat the candy). So when iPod came along, with their ubiquitous multi-media ad campaigns, I just ignored the annoying, little upstart and ended up getting an iRiver which has suited me just fine for the past few years.  Well, now there's media players that not only play music, but pictures, videos and movies. So when I saw the mostly-positive reviews of zVue on Amazon, I decided to look at this more closely.  I picked this up for $79 at Wal-mart. For the same price, I could buy an iPod Shuffle, but that ONLY plays music.  And, okay, so I won't be downloading any of the music or movies off of zVue's site, because they suck. But, with a 2gb sd card I managed to load almost 200 songs, which my iPod-wielding friends say is nothing compared to having their entire cd collection in their pocket. Well, you know what? I don't see why I would want my entire cd collection in my pocket. I use my player to listen to cd's I just bought, then after a while keep the songs that I like then delete the rest. Also, I keep older favorite songs that I like listening to over and over. There's less than a hundred songs that fit into that category.  The one irritating thing about the zVue is how it stops playing the song when you press the Menu button. I don't understand why it does that.  I haven't yet played my DVDs on the zVue. I'll update this review after I have figured out how to convert vob's to avi's.

<Title>zvue personal media player
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Zvue returned as the customer service is non responsive. Upon receiving the player I charged it over nite. The next day plugged in an already created 1gb mp3 card. Played it beautifully and the sound quality was nice... for two hours. Thats right, a fully charged battery played MP3 for 2 hours.  I called customerservice who told me second level would get right back to me as a fully charged player should play from 4 to 6 hours.  No call back so called customerservice again... was told there was no record of my call. This time gave me a ticket number and told me second level would call me back.... after 3 days still no call back. Now when calling customerservice get a voicemail box... and you guessed it NO CALL  BACK  If you are lucky to get a player without problems and never need customer service this might be the player for you... but a brand new player out of the box has problems... the warranty is useless if they don't stand behind the product

<Title>Not your best option.
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Okay, the Zvue seemed like a good buy at the time. But it was not. It only came with a 125mb card wich can only hold like 25 songs. I wanted it to have a 4gb memory, so i went to the store and it costs 50 dollars or more for one. So it would be much easier to just buy another mp3 player (at the same price as the Zvue with a 4gb memory card[total of about 180 dollars or so]) at the same price and get 8gb or more and you could probably get a better video player on that mp3. So its much easier to buy a Zune or even an ipod. But i must say that it does have great sound and two headphone docks so you can listen with a friend. But the flaws outweigh the good.

<Content>Good product and works as advertised. Unfortunately we didn't use it much as it was replaced by an iPod classic. Good basic unit that will perform functions it says it will.
