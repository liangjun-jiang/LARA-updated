<Content>Well, here's Samsung's answer to the ipod nano, and it's a beauty.  Yes, this is the RED Samsung K3 2GB mp3 player with built-in FM tuner.  The unit is sleek, stylish, easy to use, and it offers EXCELLENT sound.  The earbuds provided sound as good as my Sennheiser earbuds, unexpected performance for pack-ins.  Though I haven't filled the K3's memory to capacity, it would appear to hold around thirty albums or 500 songs at the standard 128bit sound quality.  There are a number of EQ settings designed for different types of music, but you can also set up your own custom setting using the built-in seven-band equalizer.  FM performance is excellent as well, with adjustable sensitivity.  The little color screen works great as a GUI but washes out in sunlight and doesn't do the greatest justice to your photos.  This unit excels at playing music, not displaying photos.  Beyond that, battery life is claimed to be 25 hours.  I have been using the K3 with the Belkin mp3 armband designed for nanos and K3's, and it's very unobtrusive and comfortable to wear.  For someone who grew up in an era of portable battery-powered record players accompanied by a stack of worn 45's, this is an amazing device!

<Content>I bought this item about 6 months ago, to replace my outdated Creative MuVo n200. I have loved every minute with it. The user interface is very intuitive, and in my opinion it makes more sense than the ipod's. The touch controls are great too, because there aren't any moving buttons for dust to get down into. The casing is very sturdy, and with six months of shuffling through my backpack and being thrown on my desk, it still has only a few minor scratches on the back and none on the screen/front. Two more great things: 1.) The earbuds. I have tried several that I have bought in the store, expecting greater sound quality. I haven't found any. The earbuds are comfortable for long periods of listening, they stay in my ear, and they have good sound quality. 2.) The battery life. I can use this for (it seems) days on end without recharging it. I drove 8 hours in one day, 4 to my destination and 4 back, listening to music the entire way. The battery still had 3/4 charge left. One possible con: the memory size. I'm quickly running out of space for my music, and I'm having to be more selective about what I put on it. It's only 2 gigabytes, but I believe that Samsung has a newer version with more space, which I may be looking at soon. Definitely go with Samsung: their mp3 players beat ipods in both price and quality.

<Content>Overall this is a fairly good product.  I like the option of the FM radio in addition to the MP3, screen looks good, easy to use.  The down side is that the battery doesn't seem to last very long, the plug for the USB doesn't seem to stay in very well when charging, and the software is not very intuitive.  All in all it is still a good option over the iPod especially for a kid.
