<Title>1st MP3 Player & impressed what all the features!
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 1st MP3 player and am totally pleased. Read all the Negative reviews first than the positive. To my surprise none of the negative items reported happened to me, yet. First they say battery life stinks well I read that the iRiver comes only 50% charged and it takes 1 hour to charge at 50% & 2 1/2 for full charge. Not bad when you get at least 20 hours of use for full charge.  Only being able to use Windows media player is not bad but there are so many options like rating your songs, artist, playlists, genres & star system. FM radio is great either in the car with FM transmitter or on the fly. The finger print situation is real but I bought a Invisible Shield for $9.99 with a lifetime warranty works great.  The toggle screen is ok but when you start listening to a song and the screen goes black to save battery life you have to press the screen twice once to get it illuminated and the other to go where you want just irritating.  Did not use the earbuds because it is not applicable to my ears but bought Phillips behind the head headphones here on amazon and the sound is great from the iRiver. Did not use the video option yet because I just wanted the MP3 option so maybe later when I expand to video we will see but I see no point. Also the pictures may be a faster option that I want to use and you will need a converter from iRiver website (free) to resize the image to fit on your iRiver screen and with the excellent clarity it will be great. The cradle is nice and sounds better than I thought but when you want to connect to your Home Theater receiver you need to purchase a y adapter cable unless you have a new receiver for USB connection.  If you already have a cable to connect to your Receiver than forget it because it will not fit into the back of the cradle you need the cable that came with the cradle since the housing is smaller.  The iRiver will charge from your laptop computer with no problems my main way of charging.  Also bought the iRiver FM Transmitter and works great if you can find a dead station to broadcast your signal and it has 3 presets.  So far there is no problem at all, great product and well worth the money sometimes there are problems with products and/or ignorance from users but take a chance if you read all the bad and good reviews and if this unit fits your needs!

<Title>good purchase
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was referred this product by my good friend.  Overall, I like this product, the only downfalls are: 1) a little difficult to use and 2) the battery life...  in previously owned mp3 players, I get a beep or a warning whenever the battery is running low.  However with this iriver, it just shuts off completely when battery is down.  the radio function is excellent.

<Title>Do Not Buy iRiver
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the very short period of time it worked, it was great. It began freezing up with software problems, and support is the helplessdesk. These poor people have been contracted by iRiver and abandoned. I really believed, even after many weeks of research, that I was getting a quality product. It is junk. Don't waste your money or your time.

<Content>The click system is fun and easy to use. The player itself is nice and compact, and thin. The sound and movie quality are top notch. The packaging itself shows the effort that went into the product. It looks great and oozes a lot of wows from others. Overall great product.

<Title>Very nice, a bit small and died after a year
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Got the 2GB Clix ($135) in Dec 2006 for my 14-year-old teen.  The screen is very small and it is very easy to use. It is a nice MP3 and Video (avi) player and very cool with lots of features like Flash games, nice FM radio, Alarm clock etc. A few days after the 1-year warranty passed, it suddenly stopped showing up as a Flash drive when connected to a PC. The support person said he works for a third party service and that this problem is common... If this had happened a few days ago, I would have been able to send it for repair. Unfortunately, while trying to troubleshoot the problem, I formatted the device so all we can do with it now is listen to radio...

<Title>good one, but not excellent
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am satisfied with it. Many features are very good. The sound quality is as good as ipod and others. The FM radio can receive signal in many place, quality is also good. The picture quality is wonderful, better than I expected. Some review said about the charging problem, saying it can only be charged through the computer. I bought chargers so don't have that problem.  There are several things I am not happy with. First, it is not very easy to learn how to transmit resources from computer, especially in vista. I still can not find the way to put in video and songs which are not mp3 files. Second, after charged, it can not find back where I was listening.

<Title>Charging the Clix battery "requires" XP SP1
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice product, but beware. No mention is ever made that the Clix will *NOT* charge the battery without XP SP1 or SP2 running. USB power bricks and computers running any other OS will *NOT* charge the battery. I've tested the power output with an electrical meter on several computer USB ports and this issue is not related to the power output of the port. The product will "connect" but it will not charge.

<Title>Great -- for the short time it worked
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really enjoyed this player--for a week. Great battery life, very simple to use, beautiful screen, intuitive interface. Sound quality is absolutely first rate.  BUT: A few cons. After a week, it just froze up, refused to power up, and couldn't even be re-set. It just died. Also, Windows Media Player, which you must use to get the most out of this device, is in beta, and so is full of bugs. You can use the Clix with version 10, but you miss out on many features. Lastly, the included earbuds are very mediocre.  I plan to return the Clix to Best Buy and get a replacement. If the new one dies too, I'll post a follow up review.

<Title>Die ipod, die!
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been waiting a while now for a better nano alternative, (the U10 didn't have enough flash memory to convince me) and now thank god for the Clix!  This is an absolute must have for anyone in the market for a new handheld media player, because this little sucker has it all.  Prior to this all I had was my cellphone to use as a portable mp3 player.  My first impressions on the layout and overall look of the Clix (and U10) are that it is a welcome change in a world of Sansa-esque iPod copycats.  Good riddance to that stupid clickwheel!  The screen is vibrant and colorful, the video playback on it is exceptional considering the size of the screen.  So far I've only watched the included clips, but they both looked surprisingly good.  But in general the images are very clear and the text is easy to read.  Audio playback was my primary desire in purchasing the Clix and it certainly delivers in that respect!  The included earbuds are atteast as good as the ones you get with an iPod, but any audiophiles will probably throw them away and buy some that cost as much as the Clix itself.  The music interface is easy to navigate and the sound quality is superb. It has included EQ's which you can change in real-time and pick the one you want.  It also has a customizable feature and SRS WOW effects ala Windows Media Player.  The dedicated volume control is on the side of the player and this thing can get loud.  FM radio!  Wow, and it's even crystal clear.  I'm listening to it as I type actually, here in my bedroom.  I haven't tried it outside yet, but the walls must be filled with lead or concrete because I can't get any cellphone reception but the radio is coming through nicely.  You can also record from the radio, save presets or adjust the tuner region if you leave the country.  The Clix interface is so sweet!  There is a button under the faceplate on each edge of the screen and the arrows on the screen make navigation easy.  The lock mechanism to disable the buttons is very cool too, it physically disables the buttons so they won't click at all, instead of just being an electronic switch like I had been expecting.  The screen does get smudged pretty easily and getting a clear screen protector is a really good idea.  There aren't a host of options for cases and accessories like for a nano, but the U10 gadgets will fit the Clix since they are basically identical.  The protective sleeve included with the unit is a nice touch however.  Even when the Clix is in there it will still fit easily in a pocket and not get scratched.  I don't have the docking station, but it seems pretty neat.  The flash games are cool too.  It comes with sudoku, a frogger type game, a puzzle game and some others.  It's also got an alarm clock feature, which I haven't used personally.  All in all this thing is way better than an iPod.  I had been using iTunes prior to my purchase (now I use WMP 11) and thankfully I had never saved any songs in my 10gb library in Apple's AAC song format.  I kept them as 160bit mp3's which were located easily by WMP and fully accessible in their iTunes folders.  WMP 11 is still a little buggy, but as I understand its still in beta.  My only real problem was that it had some trouble with the ID3 tags on some of the songs and mislabelled them in seperate versions of the same cd.  It wasn't heard to fix, I just checked off the "retrieve additional information from the internet" checkbox under the options and fixed the ID3 tags myself rejoining the songs into albums properly.  Hopefully this will be an issue addressed in a future patch for WMP.  All that being said, I strongly encourage you to go down to your local store who carries the Clix (got mine at Best Buy) and look at it youself, compare side by side to the nano and hopefully this review will help you make an informed decision.

<Title>Truly the best of the best of flash players.
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this item for only a week now - not too long - but I have to say that this is among my top three greatest purchases of all time.  To establish some credibility here, when I shop for electronics I always want the best of the best and don't settle for less.  I research a purchase for a long period of time before I actually make it, to remove any likelihood of regret.  I don't recall a time when I've regreted such a purchase.  Now, the Clix is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I have never seen such a small, but proportionately functional, player.  The screen resolution is amazing (I would honestly compare it to my high-end LCD).  The display and video playback frame-rate are also very pleasing - they say it only gets 15 FPS, but it's so negligible that I can't complain (the skip is honestly hardly noticable).  I am also very pleased with the navigation of the menu system - it's so smooth and user-friendly.  When I first began exploring the menus it was almost like going through my computer's operating system for the first time.  I mean that in a good way - it was so feature rich and every functional feature that I wanted was present and well placed.  I also love the physical navigation.  I admit I was a little unsure about clicking the screen to navigate, but it's so seemless and natural that it almost feels like every other way is irritating.  I am usually pleased with my electronic purchases and quite well enjoy them, but in this rare case I was truly ecstatic.  I must have said "wow" at least a couple dozen times.  If I had enough money I would honestly buy one of these for everyone I know.  I still can't believe that they can sell such a feature rich and perfectly constructed item for so little.  However, to play the devil's advocate, so to speak, I will say that there is one small issue that I have with this player: the storage capacity.  It's only 2GB and, at least for me, it's not enough.  Now, I'm not saying I will listen to all of those 2GBs before I have a chance to switch some files around :) , but it would be nice to have at least 4GB.  I'm sure iRiver will release a 4GB version sometime this year, and when they do, barring any unforeseen releases of some other player that could hold up against this one, the 4GB Clix will be hands down, in my humble opinion, the best digital audio player on the market.  If you think the iPod nano is a better purchase then hunt down two people who have each of these players and take a look for yourself.  I'm confident that most, if not all, of the people who experience both players will agree that the Clix is the best option.  If you're looking for a feature-rich, ultra-portable and well-built flash audio player, do yourself a favor and get this one.

<Title>things you should know
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iriver clix is a great sounding mp3 player with a great picture. There are things you should know that the manual doesn't explain to sync cds to your player you need to make sure your windows media player is set to rip them as mp3. In the advanced setting mode theres a option to reformat your mp3 player. It recomends doing it if you encounter fatal errors. Definately do not use it unless iriver tells you to do it to fix your player not only will it erase everything in the memory but it also reformats it in a way that your player will hold alot less music. Don't get me wrong this is a great player but if your electronically challenged like my self you can really screw up your player.

<Title>Great features, battery...not so much
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great product full of features. Sound, image and video quality are great. But, that great screen quality has one drawback, it sucks the batteries dry. The advertised battery life is true, as long as you just let it play. Changing the volume level and skipping tracks however turn on the screen, which devours the battery quickly. Overall, a great product with an abundance of features.

<Title>it delivers what it promises 
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read alot about mp3 players for quite awhile. I highly suggest cnet.com for great unbiased reviews. I LOVE my iclix. The only negative about it is it is only 2GB. Other than that, it does what it promises. The sound is great (that's with the earbuds that come with it) and it CRANKS. I have used the voice recorder a couple of times, and it is decent. The FM tuner is great when you are sitting still. I actually enjoy the flash games too. It downloads songs very quickly and is very easy to navigate through the system. This is my first player, and I expect to use the full amount of applications. I can't imagine needing more than what it comes loaded with.

<Title>The best mp3 player.
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very well designed and quality built device. Sound quality is above average, you can set your own equalizer settings or use the preloaded ones.  You can download your own pictures onto it and set them as a background, or view them while listening to your music. Their are several play optionsfor your music. Videos look crisp and clear. The interface is the very easy to use, it felt natural right away. Flash games play well with the click design. Text files look good. The f.m. reciever gets excellent reception, and the record quality is better than any other player that I've heard. Everyone who I've let use my clix player has said this will be their next mp3 player that they purchase. Definately worth the price, excellent quality.

<Title>IRiver...What's The Problem?
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know if I just lucked out and got the only bad one in the lot, but this device seems to have nine kinds of problems with .mp3 files that don't end abruptly.  If the song fades out, or fades into another song on the same album, the unit either locks up completely, or shuts off to the point where it needs a complete reset.  I got tired of being interrupted up to three times during my workouts to reset the device, which can take up to one minute each time.  I have already had to delete any Black Eyed Peas file, and incidentally Joan Baez seems to have the same problem.  (I don't work out to Joan Baez, by the way.) This unit may accidentally have a 45 lb. plate dropped onto it...three or four times, just like the last mp3 player that failed to satisfy me.  A very poor performance by a device which seemed to have great reviews from everyone else.  Everything else with the device seems to be fine, the menus are easy to understand, and the transfer of music is adequate.

<Title>Iriver Clix
<Date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I puchased the Iriver Clix specifically for use in my new car....which can accept input from an MP3 player.  The Clix works flawlessly, from  downloading music and pictures from my computer and playing them back through the car radio.  The only problem I`ve had is that the volume level of the playback is low and needs to be turned up quite a lot compared to the volume of the other sources played through the radio.  However there is no distortion of the sound at the higher volumes setting.   I`m pleased with the performance of the Iriver Clix and would recommend it to other customers for use in the kind of application I have experience with.

<Title>DON'T BUY THIS PLAYER!
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Unless you have money to throw away, do yourself a favor and don't buy this player. Iriver usually makes great MP3 Players, but this one is really bad. You actually have to press the screen, which is built like a button itself, this leads to fingerprint marks on the display and scratches over time. Don't worry about it though this display/button will not last very long! After just a couple of months mine stopped working! People gave this player great reviews and that's what made me buy this thing! I got another one, and guess what, the same thing happened! Never again though! It seems that"customers"(by which I mean Iriver employees!) who write these reviews do not have to use that thing. It is not built to last, and the battery will give you great performance for... 3 weeks at least and will start fading really fast. I wish there was a way we could try these products out before we purchased them. Be careful buyers,be very careful, there are a lot of bad products out there and even more people who will leave a positive review for a bad product!

I absolutely love being able to share photos of my family with coworkers as well as wearing this while walking the dogs.  It is so portable and easily fits in a pocket or using the carrying case.  I can download and use any picture I want as my screen background and change it as often as I like.  The battery life is amazing only needing to be charged every couple days or so.  You can download play lists from either Real Player or Windows Media player.  It is so user friendly I would recommend it to anyone.  Even my 6 & 9 year olds can use it!

<Title>A very helpful study aid
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iRiver CXW-2G is actually my first MP3 player (w/ video).  So, I had to think a lot when I was choosing this product over other products.    My main reason for choosing this item was it has built-in FM radio.  When I heard FM radio after receiving this item, the sound quality was great: The sound was as good as my portable Sony radio.  Now, I can exercise in  the gym while listening to my favorite FM station.  Moreover, I have a comprehensive examination coming and must listen to many required musical works amounting to 12 CDs (I'm a music major).  Thus, I was very happy when I found out that I could record all 12 CDs into this tiny item and and can listen to them anywhere, any time.  That's the reason I gave "five stars" for the rating.  Besides, it looks  cute and is easy to use.  Well, I have to mention that when I charge it, it seems to take at least two hours through USB connection to my laptop.  It isn't a problem to me, though.  I'm very happy with this iRiver.

<Title>Better than an iPod Nano
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this for my girlfriend (a pc user) and she loves it. Very intuitive interface. Syncs easily with Windows Media Player 10. Can very easily convert video using the program Badak. Thats a free piece of software available through the iRiver website and thru various online sites. Badak works well and easily. Follow the instructions on the iRiver site and you'll be fine. Video looks really good. I found that it reduces a 700 megabyte .avi file down to around 300 megs. You loose a lot of quality there but since you are watching on such a small screen you don't notice the quality loss. Therefore you can fit around 6-7 300 g movies on it, I haven't tried with tv episodes yet so I can't specify anything there. But for a player to be able to hold 3 full movies, at least 200 songs, a few games, and pictures.... thats a far more versatile device than a nano. It feels good in the hand, doesn't feel flimsy. This is truly a great player.

<Title>Awseome Audio
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can second the positive comments that everyone else made. The device is excellent. The sound quality is impressive (I was a television production technician for 10 years, so I know audio pretty well.) But, since nothing is perfect, here are few things to be aware of:  * The Clix does NOT have a timer-record function for FM radio. It is possible that it will be added in a later firmware release.  * It does NOT support Audible. Again, maybe later.  * The included ear buds sound pretty good, especially for ear buds, but didn't work real well for my ears- the buds didn't want to stay in place, and they were uncomfortable. YMMV, I'm sure.  * WMP is the only means of synching audio files. Although you can copy files over yourself using Windows Explorer, it is not reccommended.  * Mine froze up several times, but only during certain songs that had a scrolling title (I've had it just a few days). Tech support is very good. This is a known problem, and the current solution (should be fixed in next firmware release- I have 1.11) is to reformat the device and re-synch everything. Not a big deal, as synching is very fast, but you do lose the pre-loaded games and videos. Many games are available for free on iRiver's web site, as are some other videos, but not all of the original games are there, nor are the videos. So, if you need to re-format, back up everything to your PC first using Windows Explorer. So far, no freezes after the reformatting.  * Sound volume may be too low depending on your source material, phones, listening environment, and ripping method. If you use WMP to rip, you can't adjust the volume at rip time. I suggest using a free ripping program (such as FreeRip) that allows for volume adjustment and/or normalization. The volume is fine under most conditions, but just be aware of the issues, and if you have a problem, the solution is easy and free.  Anyway, overall, I am very happy with the Clix. Would I buy it again? Without hesitation. Go for it.

I don't use the voice recorder a lot but when I did use it, it worked very well.  Watching videos is an enjoyable experience.  I have no problem watching movies.  The screen for me is big enough and it doesn't hurt my eyes.  The player has great flash games that can be very addicting.  Adding album art to the player is another great addition to an already amazing player.  If you are going to buy this player I would recommend buying the cradle.  It's a great accessory to have.  Another thing that you need to get for it is a silicone case from Javoskin.  It protects your mp3 player from bumps and scratches.  Iriver also sells a silicone case but I have found that the Javoskin silicone case is a better choice.  To get the Javoskin silicon case, just go to Javoedge.com and select  Iriver Clix from the list.  It also comes with a belt clip and a laynard, and it is cheaper than iriver's silicone case.  To sum up this is the best mp3 player to have.  It will keep you occupied.  To find out more about this mp3 player go to cnet.com.  They have a full review of it and they even have a great video about the Iriver Clix.  This mp3 player I would recommend to anyone.  5 out of 5!

<Title>Great Product!!!!!
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just wish it had more space than 2GB.  That is the only short coming in my opinion.  And also the fact that you need to download a video converter from Iriver just to transfer you video files too. Besides those 2 aspects, this is one of THE BEST MP3 Players I've ever purchased. I sold my Ipod NANO as soon as I discovered the CLIX.

<Title>Nice alternative to iPod
<Date>Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using this product for over a week and impressed by its aesthetics, functionality, and performance. The player is small, yet good enough to view videos, photos, and text files. The unique feature of this product is that its design is not inspired by iPod unlike most other mp3 players.   The sound quality is awesome. It has good mix of lows, mids, and highs. Interestingly, the stock earphones sound pretty good. May be, some aftermarket earphones might furthur improve the sound quality (only for audiophiles).   Display is bright and crisp. Customizing the picture/video  orientation (portrait/landscape) is a nice touch. Of course, the display is susceptible to finger impressions, as is the case with any display. So, I am not referring to this as a con. Anyway, there is a carry pouch that comes along with the player.  Control buttons are located on the edges of the player. So, there is much space left for the display. Navigation buttons are the ends of the display.  Also, enabling the hold button disables the navigation buttons by making the display ends non-clickable.  Availability of a smart button that is configurable. Battery (rechargeable)life seems good (I have used it for about 14 hours after the initial charge, and so far it is working fine). Battery life is estimated at 25 hours by iRiver.  Using the menus in the player and installation of Windows Media Player 11, required to sync the player are a breeze. Of course, you can also drag-drop music files, photos onto the device directly, like a USB drive. But, drag-drop might not work properly for videos. You can make use of the iriverter software (open-source) to convert videos to suit the player's requirements.   The player supports a few features like line in recording from any audio source through the Cradle. It is an accessory that needs to be purchased separately. The cradle has in-built speakers, line-in and line-out ports on the back. It has a nice little remote that can be used to control the iRiver Clix.   Well, the player does not have really any cons. But, I feel it can be made much better.  Display size can be increased for better viewing. If the player's size is that of a video ipod, then viewing videos will be a pleasure.  2 Gb is good for storing music and photos, but might be less for storing videos. We can expect some higher capacity versions of this in the near future.  On the whole, iRiver Clix looks stylish and does what it is supposed to do. It is certainly worth the money and I would strongly recommend this to everyone planning to buy an mp3 player.

<Title>WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!
<Date>Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just as it is said on the title. But to make it more elaborate, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU MAKE ANY KIND OF MISTAKE, AT ALL! Read over the rest, if you want to know what happened exactly. But otherwise, I am complaining about the iRiver player purchasing because my iRiver clix player was broken because it was so fragile, and the damage is not covered under warranty!   And I am not certainly the only one who had this problem, please read over this following forum post if you want to know what I mean:  [...]  Maybe it is possible to say that, because I have been using the product for only a month, I cannot really justify the pros and the cons of the iRiver. But I am definitely a hardcore user when it comes to a technological gadget, so I can probably say that I have thoroughly played with all the features of the product, though that is the probably the reason why I broke the product so early.  The accident happened when I tried to put the iRiver clix player through the armband and it just slipped and fell to the floor. Because the player was turned off before it fell down, I did not know the LCD screen was broken until I tried to turn it on later. That is, I admit that the accident was clearly a mistake due to my clumsiness. But I also did not expect that the LCD screen would be broken so easily with such minor damage. So, I contacted the iRiver customer service through the e-mail I found from the iRiver America website and soon got the response that the player is not fixable. While I was disappointed to hear such response, I was not exactly dissatisfied with the customer service itself because the response was prompt enough. However, what concerned me is that the product was so fragile yet the system is not covered under the warranty service, if it is due by accident.   When I tried to make the purchase of the product, I was considering between the iPod nano, iRiver clix, and the Samsung's nano like player. After reading the various articles from the online and the magazines, I decided to go with the iRiver clix because there were reviews by Cnet and PC Magazine that have favorable views about the iRiver clix. But another main reason that made me to purchase the iRiver clix was that because I read over warranty term of iRiver clix and because I found iPod nano's easily scratching surface rather faulty. Of course, I should take notice of the fragile appearance of the iRiver clix player. But I thought it was possible that, due to the immense improvement of electrical appliances technologies, such problem was almost eliminated. Beside, because the iRiver clix is a flash memory based player than a hard disk memory player, I believed that the iRiver clix can easily take some damages and still be okay.    When I called the customer service by the phone today, I found that the prompt response by the customer service representative and the interface of the phone guide to be good enough, unlike some customer services like American On Line or Paypal. And while the customer service representative's tone sounded bit tired, his detail of instruction regarding what to do about the product was competent enough. But from what I realized about the structure of the warranty service, it looks fatally flawed. I mean, I understand that the iRiver company itself has not established itself for long enough in the United States compared to the companies like Apple, but it still should have the descent service centers set up to fix the product for a free or for a reasonable price. To be frank, I am a student almost done with engineering study, so I understand how unattractive it is to fix an electronic product without a reasonable fee. Yet the Apple is doing it, so why shouldn't iRiver? Besides, the CEO Jeff Bezos from the Amazon.com constructed its company with the central premise to make almost idealistically perfect customer service for the people, as he demonstrated by he personally delivered a product to the Japan as a way of showing the thanks for having a first international buyer. And although more of monetary oriented guy than the Jeff Bezo is, the CEO Michael Dell from Dell computer also established his company with the consider how to deal directly with people with better customer service. My point is that, to be successful in business, whether it is in the United States or in some place else, I believe it is most important to pursue for a perfect customer service, rather than caring simply about how much money it will make.   I know the iRiver is trying to expand its business to the world by starting itself from the South Korea. And while it is certainly a head start to get the outstand reviews from the popular magazines and the websites, no company can go for too long if it neglects to satisfy the customer. As an example, if I have terrible experience in using the iRiver clix, I can write badly about the product by writing on the blog sites, Amazon review site, Cnet review site, etc. But if I think that the product and the service are really great, I am willing to tell my friends how good the product is and so forth. And wouldn't that be a way really to increase the sale quota of the products made from iRiver clix, especially right now where the word is so easily spread able through out the internet and the media? And besides making the truly unique products in the reasonable price, I think providing the unique customer service by a company is the only way to distinguish the corporation from the rest of others. If anyone thinks that the iRiver is doing fairly well compared to the other competitions, I guess it really depends on the perspective because I remember a South Korean reviewer who wrote unfavorably about the business performance of iRiver even in the South Korea and losing its ground to the iPod nano from Apple while making an analogy of Hyundai cars versus Honda Civic.   But now, I do not even get any response from the iRiver, despite I sent a second message. They talked something about the reward program, but I could not find it anywhere. Although I really liked the design of iRiver clix, I will be afraid to make any new purchase from iRiver now. I was even thinking about making the purchase of iRiver clix craddle, but now I will just think about choosing Samsung or Apple mp3 player instead on my next purchase.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After enjoying A LOT my Creative Zen Jukebox 20 GByte player, I decided to buy a flash memory player, and iRiver Clix seemed like the obvious choice.  I am NOT disappointed, and I think that this is an amazing gadget!  It is incredibly small, at least compared to my older Jukebox, it has no moving parts, and the sound quality, enhanced by several user options is TOTALLY OUTSTANDING!!!  I listen to it with my Shure E4 earphones and I just completely lose myself into the music. The included earphones are great, but I find them uncomfortable to wear.  I like the FM Tuner feature, and, although it was a bit of a try-fail-and-try-again effort to learn how to program it (the manual lacks specificity, on MANY subjects), I was able to finally program my favorite stations.  The reception quality is terrific.  My ONLY disappointment is with the memory capacity of Clix. It offers a 2 Gbyte memory, which is fine, for most of my needs, but I do wish I had a lot more "reserve" memory for future growth.  Any future growth can only be accommodated by deleting lower priority "albums", which is never the best option.  I also found that the Windows Media Player interface was cumbersome, and it took me a lot of working with it to understand how to manage my music collection.  Apparently, the Media Player Library is nowhere linked to the data folders one sets up using Windows Explorer, which I think is unfortunate. It takes a while to understand how the process works to update the iRiver Clix, but it has now become quite manageable.  Bottom line, it's an amazing gadget, and I will enjoy it a heck of a lot during my 16-day transatlantic cruise in November, and hopefully, well beyond that....

<Title>Feature Overload
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I bought my Clix a couple weeks ago and I was a little skeptical from my friends who owned iriver mp3's and said they had hell of a time with downloads and crashes but, the reviews on the Clix made me think otherwise... And low and behold this is by far the best MP3 I have ever owned!! The features are plenty and the ease of use is amazing from navigation to downloading. Works excellent with WMP11 and cant be easier with MTV's URGE to get all the songs I need. The video is very good to. With 15fps it still performs well. The FM Tuner is sharp and strong is a great bonus to have for morning shows or news on the go. Alot of people complain about storage, this unit is what it is 2GB and thats not enough DONT buy it. IF the only other thing people complain about it "finger prints" then this is the best value MP3 on the market right now.

<Title>Excellent Small Player
<Date>Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The UI is incredible... I love it.  It's very easy to operate, and a delight to use.    The video quality is good.  You don't notice the 15fps unless you look for it, and it doesn't show up at all in cartoons and other low-quality sources.  If you think of it as a nano-type player that can play video too, you'll be very satisfied.    I managed to convert several avi files to its native format using the iriverter tool, and they look great.  I even figured out how to copy from a dvd, and to convert streamed flash videos (like google and youtube).  Very fun!  The file sizes end up being pretty small: about 75 MB for 1 hour of video... So you could fit  about 13 hours of video on it.    The sync rate with windows media player is FAST.  I used to have an H10 with yahoo music service, and this is WAY faster.  I was very pleased, because I thought the switch to MTP was a mistake, but after using WMP11 I am very satisfied with the interface.  it  is very integrated and easy to use.    Go get it!  It's awesome.

<Title>A man and his toys are a given
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm 53 years old. and have been playing games since Commodor 64 days. Have three uber gamming computers. I have bought about every electronic toy known to mankind. This is the VERY best "toy" I have ever bought. Small, SUPER easy interface, crystal clear screen,(especially for it's size) sounds as good as you can want. Bought one for my son. He loves it. He also owns a ipod. (Which are very nice also but just wanted to be Windows Father-Son more intergrated...) Sure would have been nice to have 30 gigs instead of the two gigs it does have. But like I told my son, Why do you need to "store" stuff? Right now I have 20 pictures, 85 soungs, 5 games, three full length movies and still have 300 megs left over. Like I told him, when you are done watching a movie, delete it. No need to keep it in storage. Also the FM radio is much sweetness!!! Do yourself a favor. buy it.

<Title>So many features!
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Clix last week, and the novelty has yet to wear off. It does so many different things very well. I had read lots of reviews before I made the purchase, including complaints about the converter that you have to download to put videos onto your Clix. I downloaded the converter and its beyond easy to use, so no complaints about that. Right now I have about 420 songs on it, as well as 4 videos and 20 pictures. I only have a couple of minor complaints. The first being that the Clix comes with a Windows Media Player cd thats supposed to install wmp on your computer. Well, its wmp 11, which is in beta, and it kind of screwed with the rest of my computer. I just deleted it, and am using the standard wmp.  The only other issue I have is that I have found the headphones to be almost unbearably uncomfortable. I have average ears, but one of the headphones is always falling out, I must say I had an ipod before, and I found their headphones to be alot better. Overall though, the Clix is an amazing little mp3 player that does it all! I highly recommend it!

<Title>iRiver Clix
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had read the other reviews and decided on the IRiver Clix because its easy to switch selections with my big fat fingers.  Its a good little player, plenty of variables to put your all types of e-files into. I do wish it had more memory like 4Gb.  The ear buds it came with are little weak, they tend to pop out of your ears if you work out with them.  The volume level could go up a couple of notches too, though that could be for ear safety. The battery lasts about 3 hours, no notice on how much time left except for a icon in the corner.  I don't suggest the cradle but you may want to get the FM transmitter along with the car battery charger for those long trips in your car.  And if you work out get the arm band holder, this is very light and will go flying unless its secured.

<Title>iRiver and windows media player equals PROBLEMS
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Clix 2 because of Consumer's Report's recommendation of it.  After attempting to use it and windows media player, I am not sure if Consumer's Report really tried using it.  Media player is fine for playing cds and mp3s on the computer, but it did not sync easliy with the clix 2.  It would NOT download audio files.  The help from WMP was not helpful.  It simply walked me through the steps of downloading that the clix 2 demonstrated in its materials.  The iRiver customer support is terrible.  You will not speak to a live person.  When calling the 800 number on the iRiver site, it is a recording that loops the suggestion of using the online help.  I used the online help and it walked me reduntantly through the repetitive steps I had already performed.  I does offer a feed back email, and an iRiver rep did correspond with me three days after the initial complaint.  His help consisted of explaining the same redudant steps I had already performed.  He did provide follow up emails, but it never really answered my questions- just the same redundant steps.  I am not sure if the previous emails regarding the problem were reviewed although it was the same customer service rep.    I returned the clix 2 last week and bought an ipod nano 4G.  The ipod works perfectly.  It downloads audio files.  It is simple to use iTunes.  Its only draw back is that it has no FM tuner which is the only feature that was better in the clix2.

Resetting didn't work.  I've tried everything I can think of.  Unfortunately I can't send it back to Amazon and I've emailed iRiver with the problem and still haven't heard back. The only reason I gave it one star becuase 0 wasn't an option.  Even if iRiver decides to honor their warrenty I would rather send it back for a refund and buy something else...unfortunately I'm now stuck with an expensive paperweight I no longer want.

<Title>not perfect in absolute terms but probably the best one can buy
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3/video player for my girlfriend, mostly because she wants to listen to and watch lectures on the go. I must say she was amazed since the first day she saw the player, and usually she doesn't get impressed by gadgets. After 1 month of using it she loves it more and more.  So this player has a jaw dropping factor for anybody (confirmed by all the people who saw it and who tried it): - it's a tiny cute little player - yet it has a full color, bright and high quality display that lets you even see movies (I was skeptical about it too, but I test it and it's an acceptable way to watch movies especially when you consider the size of the player you carry with you; you can even convert DVDs to play them on iriver). - impressive sound quality and fidelity: my music never sounded so good as on this player (and this is using the supplied headphones)  Other positives: - high quality Li-Polymer battery - extra features like flash games, FM radio, ability to display text and pictures. I didn't use those much, but I test them and they work fine and it's nice to have them. - important advantage over ipod: the iriver player works with popular  music formats like mp3, wav, wma, ogg, and avi for the movies. With an ipod you need either to convert all your media library to Apple's proprietary format or to buy media from them (the latter is I think the reason why they restrict the ipod users to their proprietary media format) - works with most music subscription services (with an ipod you can only buy songs at $1/song): yahoo music, napster, rhapsody, urge etc - fairly easy to use, and unlike ipod you can skip to the next song, pause and restart playing without pulling the player out from your pocket or/and taking off your gloves. This is because of the clix system.  On the down side:  Not so much here from my point of view. However if you're a mac or linux user you might want to consider the U10 version of this player (only 1GB of storage) as you can use the firmware upgrade utility to convert that player to a compatible mode of operation.  Also I would like to see on the nice color screen more information about the song I play. Unfortunately I can't see the bitrate, the file type, and neither other information from the ID3 tag. And why not, I would like to see some graphic representation of the sound level.   My conclusion:  If you own a PC (especially a windows PC) I don't think you can find a better player on the market. Even if you would compare only the music playing features I think this player is superior in quality and it comes at an affordable price.  The video playing feature shouldn't be neglected though, as it could be quite a nice and useful feature (maybe along with the FM tunning).

<Content>I wanted to get a Kodax PhotoShare, but for the price the iRiver Clix was a better deal, holds more, and does more. The Clix is easy to use, even for the technically challenged. Moving between menu items is as easy as pressing the edge of the display. The display quality of digital photos is very good. The music quality is also very good. A homemade DVD was excellent and the sound quality was good. The unit is small and packs more features than the PhotoShare I was considering.

<Content>I ABSOLUTELY love my iriver clix 2gb MP3 player.  I am a young senior citizen and challenged technologically & electronically, and this was the easiest to use. I downloaded 300 songs from my collection on a Saturday morning. The instructions were excellent.  I never had a glitch and the SOUND. I can't say enough about the ease of use and the excellent quality of sound. I am going to get my hubby one for his upcoming 65th birthday so he can enjoy the sounds while bike riding, running and mowing.. I have not downloaded video or purchased tunes yet but I have downloaded photos with the same ease as music.  One step at a time.

<Title>Major Power and Charging Issues
<Date>Wed Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player has serious battery and charging issues that buyers must be aware of - had I known what I know now, I would never have gotten this player.    The player will not get 'up to 25 hours' of battery life if you use it like a normal person.  I don't play games or watch videos on it, just play music at the gym, on the train to work, etc, and can't get it to go for more than 12 to 15 hours per charge. It even goes from 3 bars to one bar overnight while its turned off - how it can lose so much power overnight when its turned off is beyond me.  I returned my first two Clixs thinking that the batteries were malfunctioning, but this is just the way it is.  There are only 2 ways to charge this player - you must be aware that there is no travel charger available according to Customer Service, so you either have to hook it to a computer to charge, or you can get a car charger (another $70).  Since I live in the city and don't have a car, that means that I'm stuck draging my laptop with me on weekends and other trips just to charge my Clix, which I find unacceptable.  For those of us who travel extensively either for work or pleasure, having to drag a $1000 computer to use as a charger for Clix is ridiculous.  It seems like all I do is constantly worry about how much power I have left and when I can find time to charge it again.  You should also note that it will not charge in the optional Cradle, it runs on the internal battery when playing in the Cradle (unless the Cradle is connected to a computer - how dumb!).  I would love an alternative to the ipod but this player with these major battery and lack of charging choices does not fit the needs of an on the go person like me.

<Title>Nano who? (Clix with Cradle Dock Review)
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>*I bought the Clix with the Dock as a complete package from iRiver and this review covers both items*  Packaging  iRiver does a good job with their packaging by making it simple and clean, probably taking note of Apple's packaging strategy, though not as refined.  All the included accessories are placed in clearly labeled paper boxes making it simple and easy to find what you need quickly.  There is no foam padding of any sort to protect any of the accessories or the player itself but I do not think this will be a problem because the Clix is a flash based player.  The Clix itself is protected by a sticker with a printed on animation of the "now playing" screen.  There is a "starter kit" that comes with the Clix that contains the manual, quick start guide, software CD, various documentations, and a neoprene case with a screen cleaner.  The case fits the player very snugly and is padded enough to ensure proper protection.  The screen cleaner does a decent job though I sometimes found that it just smeared the oils from my skin instead of absorbing it.   The packaging for the cradle dock contains a series of boxes as well with no foam padding to protect anything but everything came out of the box in perfect condition.  The cradle comes with a line-in cable, 3.5mm extension plug, the dock itself, and an IR remote.    I enjoyed the packaging but it did not wow me as Apple's packaging does.  I was concerned with the lack of protection for the components though none of them were damaged.  I would like it if iRiver included some plastic molds to hold their components to make it seem more professional while adding some protection at the same time.    Design  The Clix is one of the most beautifully designed MP3 players I have ever seen.  The button-less screen creates a very clean and sleek look that resembles a flat panel television.  Since there are no buttons to press, navigation is done through pressing the sides of the screen.  The sides of the screen are tactile buttons and not touch sensitive, which would have made it too sensitive.  The rest of the controls are located on the sides of the player which include dedicated volume buttons, a power button, a "smart key," and a hold switch.  The hold switch does not only cease the function of the screen buttons but actually locks the screen buttons into place so they can not be pressed.  This is a wise choice by iRiver because it will prevent wear and tear on the buttons.  The back of the player is made of glossy white plastic and has a clean look to it instead of having a bunch of Windows, SRS, WOW, and other logos.  While the screen of the player seems very scratch resistant, the back seems to be more prone to scratching so users should exercise caution.  One of my favorite design features of the Clix is its ability to switch between landscape and portrait modes.  Portrait mode is useful in allowing one-handed operation of the player, though it is a little more difficult that I would have liked it to be.  Since users have to touch the sides of the player to navigate, they will find their thumbs and hands obstructing their view when pressing some buttons.  Though it this is a little annoying, it is bearable and does not take away from the overall pleasurable experience of using the player.  Another gripe is that the reset button can only be pressed by inserting a paperclip into a pin-sized hole located at the bottom of the player.  Both Creative and iRiver have to find a simpler way to reset the player.  I really like the simple button combo that makes the iPod reset itself.  Creative and iRiver should take note.  Once in the Cradle Dock, the player will resemble a retro-style television which will draw stares and wow your friends.  There are tiny speakers on the back of the dock that allow wireless use of your player.  The dock gives the player the awesome feature of line-in recording but also disables an important feature, the FM tuner.  I assume this happens because there is no headphone lead to act as an antenna, which would have given the player horrible reception.  The dock also lets you connect a line-out cable so you can listen to your music on better speakers and there is a mini-USB connector to allow you to sync your player while it is still in the dock.  The included IR remote is the only method of navigating the player while it is in the dock.  The remote has a very slim profile and membrane type buttons and while this remote provides excellent functionality for the player while it is in the dock, it is poorly designed because the buttons become a little exhausting after prolonged use and the directional buttons are a bit more spread out than I would have liked.  The remote also looks quite cheap with an uneven fit and finish and lack of attention to detail.  Perhaps I am being nit-picky but I do enjoy the fact that every function can be accessed wirelessly.   One design feature that I find refreshing is the USB cable that is provided with the player.  It has a mechanism that locks the player into place on the cable and can only be unlocked by holding buttons on the side.  This results in a secure attachment to your computer, making it impossible to accidentally disconnect your player while it is performing a sync which could wreck the player.  More manufacturers should take note of this simple, yet ingenious locking mechanism.    Finally, if you are worried about the durability of Clix, worry no more.  I gave this Clix to my sister as a present and she has the reputation of having the "touch of death" with all things electronic.  It has been over two weeks and I'm happy to report that the player has not scratched.  This is truly an amazing testament to the kind of plastic that iRiver chose to make the Clix's screen with.    Performance  Once I fired up the player for the first time, I was immediately impressed with the fluidity of the interface and how beautifully simplistic, yet sophisticated the menus were laid out.  Everything is laid out very logically and can be picked up without reading the instruction manual, which I believe most people do.  The GUI reminds me of Windows Media Center, which makes sense because iRiver worked very closely with Microsoft on the development of this player.  The "now playing" screen really impresses me in that it uses its screen real estate to deliver tons of information without searching through a sub menu.  Song title, album name, song rating, artist name, year of album release, time, battery meter, EQ setting, number of songs in current playlist, and my favorite, next song.  More companies should add a "next song" display on their players.  Though this may seem like an overwhelming amount of information to be displayed on one screen, I did not find it confusing at all.  One thing that bugged me about the interface was the fact that you could not delete songs or recordings from the player.   Pictures are browsed on the player in list form, displaying a small thumbnail of the highlighted picture.  Photos look accurate and fluid on the screen as it would on the computer screen though detail is lost because of the 320x240 resolution.  There is no over saturation as with other players, namely my Creative Zen Vision: M.  Videos can also be played on this device and look good for 15 frames per second (fps).  I expected the video experience to be severely degraded compared to the 30fps that my Vision: M is capable of but I am pleasantly surprised that there was minimal difference.  Music videos looked great and the screen provided excellent viewing angles.  I would advise against watching anything longer than a few minutes on the Clix because of two reasons: one being that the screen is so small and will fatigue your eyes and two being the fact that the player maxes out at a dainty 2 GB.   My favorite feature about the Clix is its ability to record in several different ways.  There is FM recording which is very handy for catching shows or songs you want to save, thought the RIAA will not be happy about the latter.  You can also perform voice recordings and line-in recordings.  Voice recordings were of average quality and had a hard time picking up sounds that were far away.  I would not use the Clix to record lectures or conferences though it is a handy tool for taking notes or to do a casual podcast.  Line-in recording provided much more of a use because of its excellent recording quality.  If set at "high" recording quality, files are encoded at 256kbps MP3s and 128kbps at "medium" quality.  Recording whole albums is a simple process though editing the file names and ID3 tags of the songs is not as fun or pleasurable.  I did encounter a few problems when recording, one of which was the recording volume.  Even when set at the highest recording volume and max volume from the recording source (my ZVM) the volume of the recorded tracks was still lower than I would have liked them to be.  Another problem I encountered was the track splitting function which breaks up the recording when it doesn't sense any sound for 2 seconds.  For classical albums, it could not sense the gaps correctly and recorded the album as one huge MP3.  My final gripe about the line-in recording function is that the recordings are stored deep in the submenus of the "Extras" section which is irritating when you want to find your recordings and listen to them since they are not included in your library.  Hopefully a firmware update will place a folder in the music library for recordings.   With all of these extra features, it is easy to forget what the Clix was designed to do and that is to play music and boy does the Clix deliver.  This is one of the best sounding MP3 players I have ever heard.  There is also an incredible amount of adjustability with this player.  Users can choose from a number of very good EQ presets or tweak the SRS and WOW features to their liking.  The SRS WOW features really impressed me by generating great sound to whatever type of music I was listening to.  The TruBass provided enough bass to literally blow my brains out.  I could feel the insides of my ears vibrating from the powerful bass.  One downside to all of this adjustability is that users might be intimidated or might not know how to adjust the settings to make their music sound great.  It takes some time to fiddle around with what settings sound best but once you find them, you will experience musical nirvana.  Clich I know, but there is no way else to put it.   The included headphones may not be the most stylish but they do sound pretty good for stock headphones.  They reproduce a neutral sound across the spectrum but a little more bass than the stock headphones from Apple and Creative.  The ear-bud design may be problematic for some as they easily fall out, which is the case for both my sister and father.  As with all the cables that come with the dock and player, the headphones are gold plated for better conductivity.  Though the stock headphones are decent, anyone looking to improve their musical experience should definitely look into buying noise isolating or noise canceling headphones.   Syncing the Clix with Window Media Player 11 is a pleasure.  Everything works seamlessly and swiftly.  I am impressed with its sync speeds and how the Clix did not have to rebuild its library after syncing which means it can be unplugged and is ready to use in an instant.  Throughout the whole experience, I never had the player freeze on me except when the battery was completely drained.  I tried connecting the player after its battery had drained to recharge it but it would not respond at all.  I had to reset the player and everything worked again.  This is quite odd as there should be a little battery life left to sustain the player long enough to be connected.  I would advise users to charge their players without draining them all the way first because lithium ion batteries do not like being completely discharged.  Continually draining the battery until there is no power left will hurt the battery, causing lowered capacity which equates to shorter battery life.   As you can tell, I am enamored with the Clix but there is one thing that bugs me to no end which is that audio files are not normalized.  This is annoying beyond belief because I have to keep lowering or turning up the volume for different artists and albums.  One thing that iRiver can learn from Creative is the "Smart Volume" function that is included on many of Creative's players which normalizes the tracks automatically.  Users can use programs such as MP3Gain to normalize their MP3 on their computer but it would be more convenient ifthe player itself handled all the normalization.    Conclusion  iRiver has created a beautifully designed and incredible performing MP3 player that they can be proud of.  Despite its few flaws, I fell in love with the Clix and would definitely recommend it to anyone.  It is easy to use yet has a billion features that will satisfy the most demanding techie.  I hope that iRiver will come out with a Clix that has a higher capacity, which should not be too hard seeing as Sandisk just released the Sansa E280 which has a whopping 8GB of flash memory and an expandable Micro SD slot which makes it capable for a mind blowing 10GB of storage.  Once iRiver crams more memory into the Clix and fixes its other minor problems, they might finally be able to compete with the Apple juggernaut.  I am so impressed with the Clix that I'm going to say it is an iPod killer.  Let the flaming begin.   Nano who?

<Title>Great compact music player
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's a great mp3 player. You can sync music using WMP 10 just like iPod does it with iTunes. Also, you can just copy/paste or drag the files to Clix using Windows explorer, works like USB drive.  Only thing I want them to add is the font size and car mode. I use the mp3 players in the car. iPod is good to control while driving. Clix is easy to control but reacts with some response time. When I clis one side of Clix, the screen doesn't light up until 3 sec later.

<Title>Very bad product
<Date>Sun Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all do not get this product because you want to play video. The memory is so little and battery life so small that it barely holds anything. The music program is the worst, it slows down your computer, and is very complicated. Its not a touch screen, it clicks up down right left, notice how they maneged to forget to put that. It is smaller than it seems and the screen is even smaller. The screen is very bad, fingerprints of DEATH!

<Content>I like this player even though the memory is considerably, okay a lot, smaller than my last player. The positive is I no longer have a brick for an Mp3 player, the sound quality is great, the screen is bright and easy to read except in sunlight, the headphones fit comfortably in my ears, the games keep me occupied when I am ignoring my teachers at school, and Ive dropped it a few times and it hasnt broken yet. Only negative is that it seems to take to finger prints like a duck to water.

<Title>iRiver Clix... I love it! 
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, all I can say is that this machine would put a serious dent in the Ipod business if iRiver where to really get behind it.  It has great functionality, is intuitive, has great sound quality and the headphones are the best base level headphone to come with any of the players.  It's small, very light and very compact.  The click screen works very well.  Seriously, its screen is significantly bigger than it's competitor so if you are video inclined, it's good.  However, I don't really think you get a 2gb ultraportable flash player to watch video... But each to there own.  The only thing that I'm a bit disappointed in is the fact that there is no power adapter.  This is a problem because it means you cannot listen to your Clix while it is plugged into the computer to charge.  Mind you, this is probably only a problem for me because the computer I'm currently using is without Sound Card so I can't listen to music without my Clix, but if you have a Sound Card (who doeesn't... I mean really...) then you'll listen to your music on your computer while your charging your Clix.  It would be good though to be able to plug it into an adapter so that you could put it in it's cradle, sit it on the stereo and play tunes through that...   However, all in all, I think this little player is worth 5 stars for sound quality alone.  After all, it is a portable music player first and foremost!

<Title>LOVE THIS ITEM!! MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE!!
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I absolutly am in love with this mp3 player!!!! This is perfect for the tech wiz people because you can mess around with it with the many cool features AND for the technology challenged because it is so easy to rip and/or download songs onto this device using WMP(for best results, use the most updated version)and then find them again. If you REALLY get stuck, there is even a iriver clix tutorial on the player that goes through all the important features of the player. Just go to extras, then to flash games, then scroll down to "iriver clix tutorial". The recording for both the fm radio and voice work great. I have even dropped this a couple times(not lightly either) and it didn't skip or break or anything!! The only problems are that it may not be enough memory for some people(2GB is enough to put on your favorite songs, have a bundle of voice recordings, pictures of your friends and family[yes, you can store pictures on it. Just one of the features I love about this thing!!] and maybe even have a movie on it, if you can figure it out.[see below])Another bad thing is that I can't figure out how to get on a video clip. If you can figure it out, great for you!! If not, it's still better than an Ipod nano, which by the way has no fm radio capability. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS THING!! BUY IT!!!!

<Title>If you like podcasts or video, stay away.
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Clix has very nice deep sound and makes a wonderful music player.  It integrates with Windows Media Player 11 like a charm and the music services from URGE, Yahoo Music, Napster, etc. make filling the device full of music a simple task.  If you only want to listen to music and just really hate iPods for some reason, get this player, no question.  I have also has a Sansa and this player is worth the extra cost.  If you want to listen to podcasts on this device, you will be down right angry.  Windows Media has no podcast feature, so you will need to get another program to get the podcasts and then you will need to add them to player, this is very annoying.  Also, there is not software included for video converting, if you want watch video you will be sent to an open source project and there you will download some crummy software.  So overall, sound quality is great, but the software is down right awful.  If you want podcasts and video, so with a iPod.

<Title>nearly perfect
<Date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have been wanting this for a while and i wasn't dissappointed. i thought this thing would be difficult to use with one hand but i was wrong. my hands are about 7 inches long from wrist to tip and can easily use the clix with one hand.  It has amazing surround sound, much better than a nano which i bought for my gf. i put a few episodes of family guy and south park on there and it runs smooth and looks fantastic. you probably dont wnat to put any huge movies in there and stare at a small screen for 2 hours. if you are a student than the text feature is great for studying as you can upload text files into the clix. my only complaint is that loading videos is a tad bit of a hassle, especially if you are not tech-savvy. however, it is not too difficult and should get the hang of it after half an hr or so. IMO this is the best mp3 player of its size and price range currently on the market.

<Title>Great MP3 for Great Price
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a smaller-space sized MP3 player for my Mother for Christmas. She's not extremely technical, so I needed it to be easy to use. She absolutely loves it. The screen is very easy to read and navigation is simple enough that my mother picked it up within minutes. The sound quality is great and there are several added features (FM radio, voice recorder, etc.) The transfer speed was very quick. I also got her a set of speakers to use in her office. She is now the envy of all her friends.   The only negative thing i have found is the method for recharging the device. The only method at this point supported by iRiver for recharging the the battery is plugging it in via USB. Their is no iRiver supported car or AC adapter. Even the docking station doesn't charge unless its plugged in via USB.

<Content>This is my first player and I have absolutely fallen in love with this product. Only drawback is its 2GB of memory. But since iRiver has come with a 4GB version, it's building on its weakness. Wish iRiver would have included the optional speakers with the Clix, but you can live without. You only lose the alarm clock functionality. The built in recorder is awesome as the recordings come out with greater clarity than my Olympus voice recorder. All in all a great buy.

<Title>iriver Clix more than everything
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I saw this extraordinary device, I was surprised with comparing the ipod nano. This device everything in it and fully functional. If you are thinking to buy a mp3, video player, I can say that do not hesitate just buy the clix. Because the LCD screen is so clear and vivid, sound quality is perfect, and it has some special functions that make clix's usability max. And synchronization with Windows Media Player is very effective.         But it has some cons that you can not use the player when you connect the device to the PC but there is a solution there is a charger that charges LG phone so you can use it. Another thing is the charge level that does not show exactly remaining charge because When I saw one level line it is usually shut down itself.  It does not support all video files but there is a solution software that is iriverter 0.16 with this program you can convert every video file to clix video file format. Another issue is the processing speed between each move your click to use the device, I was getting angry with the slow move to add quick list songs but there is firmware solution. New firmware 2.01 is very good to solve the slow moves.  To sum up, general aspect of this product is superb.   Strongly Recommended by goksel

<Title>Great Sound!
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased two of these as gifts for my teenage children (one i-river was replacing a 2 year old i-pod nano). At first, they seemed dissapointed because they weren't i-pods. When they learned that these could be used with subscription music service and understood all the benefits that brought over the i-pod/i-tunes monopoly, they were quickly excited. I set the i-river's up for them (download and install latest i-river firmware; make sure all recent windows updates are installed on your computer), got them going with the Rhapsody subscription service, and they were and still are thrilled.  The Clix looks and sounds great. My son used it at a party by supplying the music from his Clix to the stereo being played at the party. All the other kids loved the look of the Clix and when they heard all of the latest music that he had put on it in just the short time he owned it, they were amazed and jelous. They all wished that they had known about the Clix before the holidays, as many of them lamented that they would be stuck with the I-Pod and begging mom and dad for money to buy .99 cent songs  while my son has his Clix packed with the latest and greatest music.

<Content>I must admit that I'm not an expert in the personal audio area, but I did my research and saw that this was the best one on the market.  When I received it, I was surprised and wowed by its appearance.  I had read plenty of reviews and opinions on it, but it's so much more impressive when you actually have it in your hand.  The music quality is great and the alarm clock (I got the dock too) and FM radio features are awesome.  I also particularly like the recording features, which I haven't used yet.  I've had a couple of problems w/ it freezing when I played this one song, but I restarted it and upgraded the firmware.  Then I reloaded the song and it seems to be ok.  Overall though, it's an extremely small and versatile mp3 player that fits my needs.

<Content>The moment I saw it online, I knew I had to get it.  I wanted to wait for the prices to fall (since $200 seemed unreasonable for 2gig mem), but I couldn't resist.  -sound is amazing. you cannot appreciate it with the stock headphones though. i suggest you invest a lil extra, it's definately worth it.  -screen is beautiful. color is very vivid, high definition. nice and crisp. i do wish they would add a feature offering different font colors.  -fingerprints? yes, but only on the edges where you'd click, so no huge biggie.  -video: yes, you do have to download a crummy software, but it works fine. i didn't like how it doesn't have much of any instructions, but i didn't have much trouble converting videos.  -the quicklist feature very friendly. i just browse through my songs, hold right click, add to quicklist then bam. my mix according to my mood in a bundle.  -games are alright. nothing to go crazy over though. just a lil something to do when you're dying of boredom. but... i did get sick of it fairly quickly. but really, who needs it?  -voice recorder. i thought for sure i'd never use this feature. wrong. for someone with my memory span, this feature's a blessing. plus, there was a phone conversation i needed to record for court use, and the built in microphone did an amazing job in picking up the other line! i thought for sure it wouldn't, but... it did. loud and clear.  -2gig memory. at first, this almost made me buy the nano... but... on second thought, i realized that i never listen to all that music anyway. why pay an extra 50-100 dollars for memory i'll rarely use? plus, 2 gigs go a long way. i have all my favorites in this lil thing.  -size: i'd like thinner, but... this size is good. fits in my pocket. and... i love its big screen. it's actually a lot smaller in real life.  all in all, it's sexy. great features, nice size, user friendly, superior quality. i couldn't resist buying one. i don't like that it doesn't have all the accessories that the ipods have, but... it also eliminates that many more ways to waste my money on making it "personalized." the thing itself is personalized enough. sexy. makes ipod owners jealous.

Your Support Request RequestID 	Status 	Date 	Updated 1487991 	Pending Customer Response 	10/04/2006 	10/06/2006   Your Question/Request: Email Date:09/28/2006 03:38 pm Sent to:support@iriveramerica.com From:danahpsimer@ Subject:RE  Thanks for issuing the above RMA (65809) number for an even exchange. Since I had posted my complaint on your website I called the customer service number and spoke to a technician or someone and he said that I could only normally expect 1 hour use on 3 days in a row without recharging because the unit never really turns off and power drain continues even though I powered it down. If this is true then a new one would perform the same way. True? If so then I see no need to return it and receive one with no gain in performance. Please advise if I should expect better battery life with a new one or not. I dont want to wait 3 weeks or more and be without my player for no gain! Thanks, Dana iriver America Response: (10/04/2006 04:26) Hello,  The clix does need to be charged regularly for optimal battery length.  Misty C. Your Response: (10/05/2006 10:59) This is a lame and non-responsive response Misty! It does NOT help me decide whether to return my Clix or not. I do Know that these things with batteries in them need to be recharged regularly. I am not totaly retarded as you seem to be. Please, please refer me to someone who can give a reasoned and informed response. Thanks! iriver America Response: (10/05/2006 02:51) Hello,  I assure you I am not totally retarded. As previously stated you called in and spoke to a technician and were told that you could expect the player to only last about an hour if not charging for three days. The player does need to be charged regularly to have longer battery life if using everyday.  Misty C. Your Response: (10/06/2006 10:28) Does it normally need to be recharged if it was used for one hour each day for three days after being fully charged? If so that would mean that it is designed to last 3 hours and not 25 as you advertise. iriver America Response: (10/06/2006 11:00) Hello,  Yes. You do need to recharge the unit regularly if you will be using it daily. This is normal. I hope I have successfully answered your question. Please feel free to contact Iriver Customer Support at any time for support.  Best Regards,  Misty C. Your Response: (10/06/2006 11:15) Is that answer "Yes, it is designed to last only 3 hours and not 25". What do you mean by "regularly"? Does that mean I will have to recharge it after 3 days use of 1 hour each day? and I would have the same experience with any clix you would send as a replacement?  iriver America Response: (10/06/2006 11:15) Hello,  After 3 days of use you can expect the player to have a lower battery life. The battery discharges even when not in use. It would be best to charge the player daily to get longer battery life.  Best Regards,  Misty C.  If this is the level of Iriver's customer support I don't have much hope for them being an Ipod killer. Also notice that Misty never did answer my question of whether it would be of benefit to send my Clix back for an even exchange.  I think I will.

<Title>Absolutely incredible player.
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound quality of the iRiver Clix beat my expectations by quite a large margin. And I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the 2.2 inch (320x240 pixel) display. I wasn't expecting a whole lot in the video department, but even here the Clix delivers smooth, good looking video - all things considered. While I'm not in love with WMP 11, managing multimedia content with it is pretty intuitive and simple. The player's interface is even simpler/more intuitive. With so many features and capabilities, it's easy to be intimidated by this bit of technology. But there's no reason to be. iRiver obviously invested some time (and money) ensuring ease-of-use. The entire package is very well executed. And for the price - it cannot be beat. I'd highly recommend it.

<Title>Please answer a question about this item!
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It seems I can't find out if you can actually play back the fm recordings on the player, as the 1gb version review states you have to connect it to your PC to get them, which is not good at all, If I record from the radio, I want to be able to play it back on the clix! Also is this really easy to download music? Can you download from itunes?? (I already have music and a video purchased through them, I would like to put on this) Thanks for any help!

<Title>Nice design but it doesn't work 
<Date>Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the iriver clix based on the nice design and innovative interface. However the software is riddled with problems. Downloading music from Real Rhapsody is a nightmare. The transfers are extremely slow and deleting playlists from the player doesn't work unless you reformat the whole player. The player freezes when trying to play some songs and you have to carry a paperclip around to reset it. I tried to update the firmware through iriver's support website but it crashes halfway through and says "firmware file not valid". I am returning this product and buying a Sansa or a creative Zen.

<Title>Way too many problems with this player
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my 4th portable media player and by far the worst. Yes, it plays video nicely. Yes, the sound fidelity is excellent. True, it has a nice interface and sharp display. I purchased the unit mainly because of it's small size and the fact that it'll play OGG vorbis media.      However, here is where the good news ends. First and worst is the way charging and discharging function. The unit refuses to charge unless it's very nearly out of power. Want to quick-charge the unit before heading out for a long excursion? Forget it. Next on my long list of complaints is that it only supports the "MTP" protocol to get music on and off. I was horrified when I plugged it into my Unix boxes or Mac and found that it didn't support a "mass storage" mode (where it should basically show up the same as a hard drive or flash drive). So, if you don't use Windoze you are also outta luck. The thing is totally designed around Windows Media Player.  You can still copy files to it with Winamp or Windows Explorer (although the Explorer interface isn't fully functional since the device doesn't have a real file system).    My next set of complaints center around the controls. There is no way to set how fast or slow to navigate through the media. I listen to audiobooks a lot and the lack of a high-speed cue is a huge downside. The "revolutionary" screen is much to easy to press accidentially when the "hold" slider isn't engaged. Plus it can often navigate off the song (play ing in the "background") and you end up having no idea where you are or what you are listening to. Trying to find your place after turning the player on and off is tedious, at best. One false move when the unit comes on (pressing anything other than power immediately followed by un-pause) will probably result in you losing your place. If you charge the unit, then it'll also happily lose it's place. Charging also is a forced activity. When the unit is charging it won't play. So, forget about listening to it as you wait for the battery to fill.       The reboots have also been a joy. The little Clix will, every so often, lock up and need a push of it's reset button. Well, at least they remembered one of those! They also made sure that the charging/syncing cable is propritery and delicate (little white teeth that latch on to the Clix can easily break).       All and all I'd say this. If you are a hard core Windows lover and think Microsoft Windows Media Player is a fine work of software then you will probably only hate this player for the charging issues and the lockups. If you are a Linux user or a Mac user (no it doesn't work with iTunes) then you will will often feel like smashing it in betweeen trying to find your place or wondering why it's locking up again.

<Title>I wanted to love it, but don't
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I always do my research before purchasing my MP3 players.  I read CNET and Amazon along with other sites and I had an IRiver that I was replacing that I loved so knew I couldn't go wrong with this player.  It got rave reviews.  Well, it's been a nightmare.  I do wish I had gotten a player with more storage but that's my fault.  I detest Windows Media Player.  It is not user friendly at all.  IRiver used to have an IRiver Manager that was simple to use.  WMP is the worst. It's not only frustrating, but time consuming.  There's nothing good I can really say about it.  I am actually returning my player because of the frustration and half the time the software and Clix don't read each other to make it easy to delete files and put new ones on.    Also, when pressing on the sides of the Clix, it doesn't always take and you have to practically punch it hard to get it to work or accept your demand.  I did this when adding files to the quick list.  It does sound ok and I like how small and light it is, but all the other problems don't make it worth it to keep.  I wished I loved it like it seems most people do.  I wanted to and hate to send things back, but I think I'll give IPOD a try.

<Content>With Fm tuner - recorder - and MP3 player - small robust design - intuitive interface what more can you ask for.? My only complaint at this time is that you are forced to add and delete MP3 songs via synching using Windows Media Player. This is an unecessary complication for people who do not want to be held captive to any particular vendor. Also having to charge it via the computer usb w/o the option of wall plug etc is onorous.

Battery life is excellent- travelled on 16 hour band trip- no problems. Kids love the Soduko that comes installed. The headphones it comes with are surprisingly decent.Plan on buying the cradle.

<Title>Great mp3 player when just a mp3player
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The audio quality, battery life, and ease of use are great on this player.  However, I hoped to use it in my car with the optional cradle unit + remote via the line out jack.  While it does work, I am unable to run the unit on the cars power due to it going into PC Connected mode when I plug the cradle's USB cord into my USB to Car power adaptor.  I am forced to run its batteries down and then wait for it to completely charge before it can be used again.  If the batteries are not completely worn down to the point where the unit won't turn on it will not charge in my car.  I have to plug it into my PC to charge. If you plan on just using this as a standalone unit it is excellent.  Only when used with the optional cradle + remote package does it seem to fail my expectations.

<Title>Definitely the best Media Player
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK ... let me start by saying that I don't go gaga over every other decent thing.  That said, I think iriver's clix is _the_ best media player out there. I think it's the coolest one, at the same time very intuitive, very well designed, and the best form-factor. This is the only player that beats Ipods.  Here are the pro's for this player: + LOADS of features - plays all sorts of music files, and also supports audible content now. However, doesn't support itunes format - I'll get to that in the cons.  + Has a built-in FM tuner which is of extremely high quality. My Bose home theater system could not find and play certain stations that this player can pick and play very clearly. I DIG that feature because I am an avid news listener. You can also record FM .. so those NPR programs you would want to listen to again, go ahead, record them and listen. Just be carefuul not to violate copyright laws ;-) + The player has the BEST LCD screen size-to-player size ratio. ALL other players have dinky screens - Ipods included. + If you just looked at this player, you'd wonder how to control it. Turn it on, hold it, and everything becomes clear ... the "click" controls minimize the space required for controls. This is what, frankly, won me over from Ipods. + Wonderful support from the company. Wonderful accessories - you can actually _use_ the  headphones they put in the package, rather than having to buy better ones. + The company is soon soming out with a 4GB version.  OK .. now for the cons: - OK .. iTunes are the king of content when it comes to media players. And this player cannot play m4u - the iTunes format. Maybe thee company can come up with a firmware upgrade for that sometime soon. - Not a lot of readily-available accessories - because the iPods are the kings out there. But there are accessries available .. look them up on the web. - Nano's are 0.25 inch thick; this is about 0.5 inch thick. - Only available in white.  So that's it. If you aren't fixated on the "me-too" iPods, give this a try - you'll love it ..!!

<Title>Clix is  a hit!
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little MP3 is the best one that I own.  I own 3 different ones (Creative vision m, sandisk 4gb and the Clix).  Out of all 3 it is the best by far.  I like the fact that it does pictures, videos, playlists etc..  It also has equalizers on it.  That's a nice touch.  The screen is really amazing and the pictures just don't show how great it really is.  I mean great.  It is a fingerprint magnet, so I put a cover on it.  The sound quality is fabulous!  Better than my other players and the funny thing is this one was the least expensive!!! I notice that my Sandisk and Creative have hissing sounds on certain songs.  I didn't notice it on the Clix though. It's very easy to use.  You can drag and drop.  It was the first one I owned and the easiet to learn.  The manual isn't the greatest, but the tech support was helpful.  The only thing I wish that I currently have is more space.  Two Gb is better than 1, but I with it came with either 4 or 8 gig.  I can't think of anything wrong with it.  The earphones sound great but are a little big for my ears and my ears don't think they are that comfy.  All the headphones that came with all of my MP3s are too large for me and are uncomfy.  You will love this player!

<Title>Problems galore.
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Like some others that have left reviews here, I tried to love this thing. I really did. It got great reviews in most places. Its small, has great sound, and has a nice crisp screen (and is really nifty looking). BUT. That's where it ends. Feature-wise, iRiver really didn't go all out.   Strike one: if you're an avid ogg fan, you get the short end of the stick: the clix does not support ogg tags. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to make playlists while the DAP is not hooked up to a computer. You can't just select 'Add to Quick List' (which is handy if you're away from a computer and want to make a temporary playlist, and if, of course, you're using anything that's readable through tags). The tags are what organize this DAP, not the filenames that you transfer over. That ogg tags are not supported makes using this DAP difficult if most of your library is made up of ogg.   Strike two: the fact that they don't emphasize that you absolutely, positively NEED Windows Media Player 10 or higher to get onto this DAP borders on false advertising. I mean, this thing is USELESS if you don't have Windows. It might as well be used as a paperweight. This, coupled the clix's dependence on Windows'/WMP's use of Media Transfer Protocol, is like finding an anti-usability ceiling above one's head: you have to finangle it JUST RIGHT and depend on faulty software to make it work. There is NO OTHER OPTION.  Strike three: that OTHER PEOPLE (*cough*iriverter*cough*) had to write software to convert videos to the proper format instead of the iRiver support/software team just shows me how they seem to be lacking customer support. I leave others to draw their own conclusions, but for this guy, it seems not a whole lot to ask for something so important to the success of the product.   I guess I bought this little DAP before really hearing out the negatives that people had to say. It just seemed so... nifty. With this review, I'm trying to warn people looking for functionality about what this DAP truly lacks. If you have mostly id3 tagged mp3s this thing might be for you. I can't say anything about wma, because I've stayed as far away from them as I possibly can. Just be forewarned, the fact that it supports the ogg format doesn't mean that it supports everything that comes with oggs; the fact that it is backed by Microsoft doesn't mean that its user-friendly; and be wary of the customer support. *rant over*

<Title>It Rocks!!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This cute little thing rocks. The graphic equalizer allows you to adjust the sound to your taste. The graphics are colorful and crisp. I personalized mine by putting a picture of myself, titled with my phone number just in case it is lost, in it. (Between you and I, I don't expect that anyone will really return something that's so cool.) The interface is very intuitive. The only things that gave me trouble are Windows Media Player (WMP) and the earphones. First off, I've own the iRiver 795 (absolutely, loved it) and the T30 (hated it). The 795 supported UMS, which was great because I could just create folders of music on my computer and drag and drop them onto the player via the USB port. Well, the T30 is a little bitty player, that is difficult to use and did not, like the Clix, support UMS well at all. When you drag and drop folders into them, the folders (playlists) are discarded and songs are just loaded into the player in alphabetical order. With the T30, I was so frustrated that I wouldn't take the time to learn to use WMP. The Clix, however, was so enthralling that I was not only willing to learn to use the program, but also figured it out in 30 minutes. Patience! All you have to do is drag and drop your music folders into the Clix window that opens in WMP after you attach the Clix to your computer with the USB cable, open WMP, then open the player. You will see a picture of the Clix. Create a playlist or folder via the dropdown menu within the Clix window, save the playlist. Clear the playlist from the Clix window via the dropdown menu. When you are ready to sync the playlists to the Clix,  drag all of your new playlists back to the sync window and click 'sync'. All of your playlists will sync to the Clix quickly. If you only have one playlist to sync, then there is no need to save the playlist first, unless you want to save it to WMP (recommended).   Now, for the earphones: they do not fit my small ear canals at all. Luckily I had a pair of Sonys already. To get the most out of the Clix, I've order a pair a Shure E4G earphones. Also, you might want to go to eBay an buy a protective overlay (generic) for the player interface. The interface is a fingerprint magnet. Lastly, if you own an old iRiver, use the neckstrap from it by attaching it to the Clix case. Also, there is a 4GB model available.

<Content>This is by far the best portable device I have ever owned. I have been through several iPods, a Sony, then found the iRiver.  Now you may say that there is not enough memory on this player.  Well it hold 300 songs and 2 full length movies at a time.  The sound is great and do not be afraid of the 5 frames per sec for the video.  It looks great!  Plus I run and the fact that it has no moving parts is a dream.  I would recommend this to anyone.  And heck at 300.00 less than the better iPods it is a steal.  I amvery picky about my tekkie things and this is the best ever!

<Title>Very few buttons make this player easy to use
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I, again, did my homework and decided on the iriver clix 2GB.  Instead of a lot of buttons to access the menus, you merely touch the sides of the screen to navigate.  It is that simple.  the only buttons are on/off, smart button which is programmable, a slide to lock the player so you don't inadvertently press the side of the screen, and volume.  That's it!  The only downside, which hasn't been a problem yet is the 2GB limitation. It would have been nice to be able to use a memory card, but the price would have gone up dramatically.  The versatility to load songs, data, videos and photos (including slideshows) is the main reason I bought this player.  Players just for MP3 or WMA are obsolete.  Get one like this that can meet your needs in a lot of different formats.  All in all, I have been well pleased with my purchase from Amazon so far and would recommend it to anyone who can live with 2GB of memory.

<Title>OK, I guess
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The unit itself is OK. It is small, fits anywhere, its volume buttons work even if the unit is locked, and it stands up to rough environments better than disk-based MP3 players.   Negatives are its built in battery (so no replacement when it wears down), dearth of accessories, and mostly its reliance on Windows Media Player 11 for everything (uploads, downloads, power control, etc.). Support on Linux/Amarok/libmtp is getting better, but is not perfect yet. I really wish that iRiver gave the unit UMS (disk) capability, but I doubt they ever will, either due to laziness or contract with Microsoft. Watch out if you format the unit, since that wipes out everything, some of which is not on the CD or iRiver website.  My daughter wrecked the disk in her iPod and bought another. I replaced the drive and find that I am now using the iPod more than the Clix. I'll see how I feel after a month has passed.

I gave up after 30 minutes of waiting; that is unacceptable in ANY industry!!! Hope you don't have any problems or you'll be searching the web for support sites rather than contacting iRiver.

<Title>Nice little player. Way cool
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ive had my Clix 4 months now. It froze while loading songs and I had to call Iriver for support. Although i had to wait a while for a service representitive to answer the phone, He provided the info I needed to send the unit back for repair or exchange. To my surprise the replacement unit arrived 4 days after I dropped it off at the post office. Great job Iriver. I love this little player. it sounds great and does what I need it too.

<Title>Good but bad support
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was a very good mp3 player. It is very unique and your frinds will be amazed. The only problem is that iRiver has very bad customer support. I tryed calling them and i weighted amost one hour then i gave up. Also i sent a email and i still haven't gotten a reply 3 days later. So just make sure not to break you iriver.

<Title>Great MP3 Player!!
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great MP3 player.  It is very easy to use, great looking and has good sound quality.  I purchased the accessories, which were necessary for working out (the armband which comes with a silicone case and neck strap). The screen is bright and colorful.  It is a touch screen, and there are buttons on the side to lock (which is great when you are working out) volume controls, on/off buttons are all out of the way. I do wish you could delete music without the use of your computer, but it really isn't that big a deal.  I haven't downloaded music off any websites yet, just my cd's which is very simple. Overall, it is a great produt.

<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for a fourteen year old girl for Christmas. It is everything I though it would be and she is in love with it. It is easy to use and sounds great. I let her use URGE (I pay for a certain dollar amount as part of the gift) for downloading music and with Windows Media Player 11 it is so easy just drag and drop. I would buy this product again.

<Title>Nice little player
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Clix is easy to use, has a lot of features, and looks and sounds great.  The screen is small but super-clear, and there are three brightness levels to choose from.  Moving music to and from the player is very easy with Windows Media Player 11, which most everyone has already -- no annoying iTunes to deal with.  I don't know of any Apple product that costs under $200 and comes standard with FM radio, voice recording, picture and video capability, and flash games capability.  Plus, this player sounds a lot better than most of the iPods I've listened to, with decent bass from the included earbuds.  The four-sided click-screen could stand to feel a little more sturdy, but I haven't felt concerned about breaking mine at all.  I have to use the locking switch more than I would like to, though, because it's a pretty light touch to click the screen, especially when slipping the player into its included protective sleeve.  A nice touch is the little wiping pad that's attached to the sleeve for cleaning finger smudges off the screen.  The flash games (available from the iRiver web site) are great for keeping you busy when you're tired of music, my favorites being free cell, sudoku, and blackjack -- the cartooney games are disappointingly boring and simplistic.  Pros:  Slick package, unique interface, great features, easy to use, nice sound, acceptable battery charge.  Cons:  Could be built of sturdier stuff like an iPod.  Only available with 2GB memory (about 450-500 songs) -- if that's enough for you, then it's all gravy.  If you absolutely must have every song on your player, spend two to three times as much cash on another product that may or may not include the Clix's standard features.

<Title>Clix Rocks IPOD Sucks
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my clix for about a month and it is great.  It does everything as advertised and the picture quality even in sunlight is very good.  I agree with some people on here about the fingerprints and it getting dirty easy but that is what comes with the territory on big screens.  The interface with making selections is cool but it sometimes is accidently selected when trying to hold it unless you use the lock feature.  I would highly recommend this player and just bought my son the exact one for XMAS.  The accessory pack is nice too but a little pricey for a armband and a screen protector.  The neck strap doesn't seem much use to me.

<Title>Wonderful Hardware Crippled By Weak Software
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The video function for this unit works beautifully as long as you are willing to download a freeware companion program, ireverter.  The user interface is superb, however, Clix has no good interface to podcasts. This wouldn't matter if Clix had a good interface to directory tree heirarchies. But it doesn't. Instead, Clix relies on id3 tags -- MP3 files have little descriptive fields in them called "id3 tags". They provide information like music genre, title, track number, artist, album, etc. If these are not present, as is the case for most of the podcasts I listen to, then Clix has no way of organizing these. I've had to resort to programming id3 tags in order to listen my podcasts. If I could have organized my music by directory, I could have avoided this. Instead, I'm forced to cycle through all the songs and podcasts linearly in order to get the one I'm after. Very annoying and time consuming. Once I find what I'm after Clix will remember where I left off. Sometimes. If you plug the thing in it will lose its place. If you're listening to music, switch to video, and then switch back to music, its forgotten where you left off in the music.  Also, there is no way to delete things except from a Windows interface.  There is no non-windows interfaces.

<Title>Sleek, Intuitive Design
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The design is amazingly intuitive and the sound quality is very pleasing. I didn't even need to read the instruction manual. No skipping, very durable (I've dropped it on concrete before), and any smudges that show up don't interfere with your ability to see the screen. The only problem I have had with the product is the "Quick List" playlist. However, that is most likely destined to be temporary and thus the device removes all songs from the list for the next session. Created playlists remain fine. I also have bones to pick with Windows Media Player (I sometimes need it to automatically categorize my music), but luckily, I can manually add items with "My Computer". Hopefully Iriver will design its own software to be used with the Iriver and beyond.  I hope the new design allows for the backlight to not turn on every time a button is pressed, such as the volume buttons. I'm not sure, but it probably drains battery power to an extent. This also delays functions such as "pause" and moving on to the next song until the backlight goes on. So instead of one click, two.   The recording function is excellent. Very successful in lecture room as well as discreet (easy to hide). It seems to consciously cut down on the background noice from students to just focus on the instructor or person answering/asking a question. Handles acoustics very well! When I play back the recording I feel like I'm in the classroom again. Also, sound files that are created don't take up much space.   FM Radio comes in very clear and feels as if you are listening to an mp3. The number of stations available is a bit limited, but the popular ones come in just fine.   I'm looking forward to more memory being added. There is definitely potential for the Iriver to take the ipod down.

<Title>Out of Sight MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player packs a lot for the money; very affordable at $134 dollars; ease of operation through the onscreen controls; vivid screen color; first rate sound quality; accessible menu; and storage to hold about 34 hours of music.  If there is one flaw it's when the player is in the random play mode and you recharge the battery the player takes you back to the first selection in your batch.  Beyond that it's an exceptional buy for the price.  Considering that I just purchased it a week ago the only unknown is durability.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software, nonexistant support
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I tried to load a playlist from WMP and twice the transfer failed.  On the third attempt the player locked up and was unrecoverable (even with the reset button).  I tried to contact iriver america by phone, but I was on hold until I gave up.  I sent an email and a week later received a return email telling me to fax all of the information I had already emailed and wait another 48 hours to be verified as eligible for support.  I returned the unit for a refund, and I'm waiting to get my ipod nano.  I really wanted to like this player.  The sound is good, the usage is intuitive, but the software is buggy and support is non-existant.

<Content>I am happy with this product it's a great size and navigation is fairly easy.  I have had two problems: it says that I tried to put pirated music on it when the particular item I put on the player was from a ligitmate CD I own.  My other issue is I can't seem to find a way to make the music shuffle (play randomly) which is a bit disappointing. I'm not sure if this function definitely does not exist or if I just need to spend more time figuring it out.

<Title>Great MP3 Player That Plays Nice With Others
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I originally purchased one after my daughter researched MP3 players and determined that this was the best non-iPod.  We all had iPod's, but my daughters shuffle died, so we were in the process of replacing it.  I did not know that I was, in my opinion, moving up.    I love the iRiver profile and simplicity, yet it is fully featured and has a great little color screen.  Also, unlike before, I can share my music library with everyone in the family.  I can still download podcasts from the iTunes store and they play fine, but none of the device restrictions exist.    I really like it.  Recommend it highly.

<Title>No go
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After I purchased my first MP3 Player and watched it die within a week, I decided to purchase this player. I did not turn on. No go. DOA. After consulting the manual, I decided to call customer service. After waiting 15 minutes on the phone, I decided to pack it up and return it to Walmart. Very disappointing. If you read some of the other reviews, they are right about one thing--customer service is almost nonexistent.

<Title>Nice cute little player thats more than just an mp3 player
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Iriver clix is my second Iriver product and it has lived up to my expectations on the performance point. Its the best in the flash mp3 player under 2GB though a bit expensive. The most amazing thing about clix is its output quality. The small little matchbox sized player packs enough looks and power to make anybody have a second look in this flooded mp3 player market. The battery life is good. The few issues I have seen in it, is 1) I cannot delete a folder file from the player itself 2) I cannot rename or move the files/folders which are currently on the player even from a PC, it needs to be recopied from PC. The provided USB cable is iriver proprietary and costs 20$ if you lose one. The volume buttons are + - instead of the regular - +, so bit confusing. Overall, this is a very nice player.

<Title>A Mp4 worthy of your money
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This Mp4 is one of a kind. Compare to the iPod and now Microsoft Zune, this Mp4 player has a class of its own. Some people think that 2GB isn't much, but for me personally, it is more than enough to carry whatever you need. The only drawback to this Mp4 player is the video editing process. You have to resize and convert the video before putting it in the Mp4 player; but it is easy with the many free conversion program you find for iRiver Clix, just google it. This Mp4 player can be considered a "conspicuous item" becasue many people were suprised when I showed it to them. "Wow, I got to get me one of these!" "Neat, how much is it?" etc. OVERALL, A GOOD BUY!

<Title>Fantastic player
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm extremely impressed with this. I've had my Clix for about three months now, and I've had no problems yet. Once I got the latest version of WMP (Windows Media Player) 11, syncing has been just fine, as it transfers auto and normal playlists accurately, and resizes all images to fit. I do wish WMP would convert videos to fit, but the Clix isn't much of a video player anyway. If you'd like to convert videos, or you'd rather not use WMP, there are a few other options, such as iRiverter and Media Monkey, respectively.   The sound quality is the best I've heard, and I've gone through quite a few (my latest being the iPod Video 30GB, which I happily sold to a friend for this.) Also, I'm a bit anal about screen scratches, and I have to say, whatever iRiver coated the screen on this player with is amazing. The only time this player has received any scratches was when I dropped it on a gravel road (not recommended!). There are still no scratches on it outside of that incident; very impressive. On a sidenote, the radio and microphone are both very impressive for a portable media player, and I was actually able to record my brothers choir concert with surprising accuracy. Nothing professional, of course, but it sure does well in a pinch.  Of course, the main drawback on the Clix is the mere 2GB of storage space. This works perfectly for me, as I put my favorite playlists, all of my podcasts, and whatever photos I want, and still have plenty of space left for recordings. Unless you're buying this for the video ability or you need to keep all of your music on you, you shouldn't have a problem with the Clix' storage size. While the Clix can play some video, using it as such for anything more than a movie trailer-sized file would be a mistake. If you need video or to hold all of your songs, you'd be much better off with a hard drive-based player.  I recommend this player highly, and it hasn't let me down yet. If you're in the market for a portable player and you don't need large storage size or hefty video abilities, the Clix is an otherwise loaded and well-built option.

<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this just because I didn't want to get tied to iTunes. Sound quality is great. Navigation is ok with the click buttons, but it's confusing when listening to a song to queue up a list of other songs. I'm always accidentally cancelling the current song. And podcast support is non-existent. Watching video is possible but to be honest, the screen is just too small to make it practical.  Looking back, I'd probably have been better off getting a Nano and just putting up with being forced to use iTunes which at least does what you want.

<Content>sound is nice; video is nice; software on clix is nice. what sucks is having to use windows media player to move files on and off the player -- its ease of use is nowhere near itunes.  i wasted way too much time trying to get everything running smoothly, but it's still difficult compared to ipod-itunes. battery life is much less than advertized. bare bones video conversion software used with the clix sucks, sucks, sucks -- iriver can't even provide a good quality program; you have to use this freeware which gives unacceptable results often.

<Title>Very versatile and easy to use multimedia player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Good: Incredibly simple and intuative to use. Very simple set up and works perfectly in conjunction with Windows Media Player. Plays WMA/MP3 Audio and MPEG4/QVGA/Flash video. Audio support allows you to listen to books from your local library.  iPod  cannot do this. Has every control you could want including adjustable search speeds Great quality audio Incredible quality video  The Bad: 2Gig is limiting if you want to play video.  Needs to be used in conjunction with an external drive if Video is your thing. Does bookmark quite well if you listen to audio books, but certain actions (including connecting to the PC) will wipe clear all bookmarks, meaning you have to search to find your place.  (adjustable search speed up to X60 helps with this)  Overall, it is a great product if you want to do a multitude of things and you don't want to be restricted to iPod formats.

<Content>This was the highest rated MP3 player in a popular consumer magazine.  I ordered it for my husband for Christmas and it is the best gift I've ever given him.  I haven't used it myself but I can tell you that he is NOT savy when it comes to computers; however, he has had no problems downloading music and operating it.  The large screen is definitely an asset over other players.  He says the quality of the sound is excellent.    There is an option to view the "album" cover and song list as you listen.  The 2 gb capacity is about 500 songs.
