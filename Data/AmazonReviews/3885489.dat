<Content>I wish I could give this product a negative rating. I recieved the first one in the mail it failed after I downloaded songs onto the player. Sent it back and recieved a second MP3 player that ceased right before I was going to use it at the gym.

<Content>I chose this model for the memory and the price, and liked the feature where it tells you your elasped exercise time (I'm a runner).  I'm thrilled with it.  The ear buds are great, and I love the rocker feature to search through songs & change volume.  I admit I was leary about buying a reconditioned piece, but the risk was low for the price, and the payoff is huge.

<Title>Really bad !!!
<Date>Tue May 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Unfortunally I got this product and I was very excited only $45 for 4G. But my emotion last two minutes, after I was done downloading all my songs I try to turn it on, and nothing, finally after a few times went on but the sound was really poor, and the FM radio does not work at all. I'm really disappointed with this product and I'm send it back for a refund.

<Title>super price for decent player
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The sound is great Over the ear clips on ear buds are nice  The player is disk based and bulky wich I do not mind and the $41 price was  to good to pass  This player uses a standard min USB cable so no worries if dog eats the cable ...  The Philips software is needed for the player so it will only run only on  XP or giher. You cannot use this  player at all even as USB storage without Phillips software ...

<Title>Pretty Awesome
<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a pretty good MP3 player. It's easy to put music on it with Windows Media Player and the battery lasts a long time after the initial charge. It's very sturdy too - I accidently dropped mine on a cement floor and it's totally fine! (It has locked up before but that's easily fixed by pressing the on/off button and up at the same time)  The only problems I have with it are the buttons are a little hard to press and there is no "repeat one song" option.
