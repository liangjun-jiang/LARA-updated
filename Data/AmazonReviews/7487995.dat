<Title>A Technical Marvel
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is quite simply the most amazing product Sony has come out with yet. I would give it 5 stars just for the sheer coolness factor this little gizmo offers. I got mine several weeks after it came out and i dont leave  home without it. It plays MP3 at surprisingly high quality, and nice and  loud unlike most MP3 players. It's quite expensive, so if money is an issue  I recommend waiting for a price drop, but other than that, buy the Memory  Stick, its just the coolest thing I've seen in a long time.

<Title>Trashware
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I bought the music clip version of the sony players. These products are a total waste of money. True, they have a sleek, compact design but are functionally worthless due to the multiple limitations of the software  (open MG jukebox) which must be used to download or convert files. As best  I can tell they are not really MP3 players but only play reformatted MP3  files. As a result you must clog up your hard drive with all of the  converted tracs in addition to the original MP3 files. To make matters  worse, you can only check out a song from 1 computer to one music clip  player. But wait, it gets worse. You can only check a song out to that  specific player 4 times. This is SONYs effort to protect copyrighted music  for which it has a vested interest. But the ads are misleading and the  product worthless to me. This is SONYs next Betamax. I've gone back to my  prior, somewhat chunkier player which is convenient if slightly larger

<Title>Expensive and Useless
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Sony has made a nice piece of hardware, but you can only get music onto the thing using their sites when downloading emusic. And, if the song is fairly popular, chances are, you will have to pay to download it. The real  surprise is that you do not get to keep the song, you have to check in and  out of Sony's mainframe to &quot;check in&quot; and &quot;check out&quot;  the songs, plus, they will erase your song if they decide you have had it  too long. Basically, its an MP3 player that is expensive, and you can not  even get the music you want. I bought mine, and returned it furious 3 hours  later.

<Title>MPWhat?
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The Sony MemoryStick would and could become one of the best portable MP3 players on the market...if it weren't for the fact that it isn't an MP3 player!<p>     Technically, because Sony only allows its proprietary ATRAC  music-compression system on its player, it isn't an MP3 player.  Thus, any  MP3's you might have already on your computer would need to be converted to  the ATRAC compression system first.  Unfortunately, this causes a lot of  hassles, and if you already have a huge amount of MP3's (legally, of  course) on your system, you might want to look at another of the player's  out there.<p>     However, if you are looking to digitally manage all of  your music on your computer, and you have a huge hard drive, then this is  the best player on the market for you.

<Title>I can't believe it sucks
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I recieved the Memory Stick Walkman under 5 impressions.<p>1) It played MP3s. 2) It had no copyright crap that Metallica's whining about. 3) Memory Sticks were pretty inexpensive. 4) It used normal Memory Sticks. 5) I could  use my existing media player to upload songs.<p>Boy, was I angry when I  faced the brutal truth. This thing takes like an hour to convert MP3s into  OMGs, it has MagicGate Memory Stick technology that makes no difference  except that it's more expensive (which is a lot, considering a NORMAL  Memory Stick's price), I had to use OpenMG Jukebox, which is a piece of  crap compared to Windows Media Player 7, or even RioPort. This copyright  stuff will hurt Sony badly, and I'm so ticked off, I refuse to buy Sony's  products!

<Title>Not so bad
<Date>Sun Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is a very good portable digital music player.  It is one of the  smallest ones available, has excellent sound quality and loading it is very  fast.  The rechargable battery charges quickly and lasts me about 12 hours.   The only drawback is the OpenMG software it uses, and its restriction to  Win98.<p>One of the other reviews mentions that you can only check out a  song 4 times, and makes it sound like it is 4 times ever.  Not true!  You  CAN only have 4 copies checked out at one time, but when you unload the  player it checks the copy back in.  I haven't had more than 1 copy of any  song checked out at any one time, so it isn't an issue.

<Title>Sleek style and size makes up for time consuming formatting
<Date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Lets face it, almost 95% of prospective buyers of a digital music player are in the market because they are downright cool gadgets.  With Sony's MS7 walkman you definitely get a cool gadget that would make all of your friends quite jealous.<p>ATRAC3 WHATS THE BIG DEAL?<p>As you have read in earlier reviews this &quot;walkman&quot; uses the ATRAC3 format over MP3. Technically there are many differences between the two formats but audibly they are one in the same.  The big deal with the ATRAC format is not the sound but rather the convenience issue of the player.  For those of you who simply want to be able to drag and drop your MP3s onto this player you may want to double think purchasing this model.  Though dont be fooled, the Jukebox software that comes with this player allows you to convert your MP3s into the ATRAC format (as well as your CD's) <p>CHECK IN/ CHECK OUT<p>Once converted, the jukebox software will display all of your songs originally with three musical notes next to them indicating the amount of &quot;rights&quot; that song has to be transferred. Once you select an ATRAC file that you want to send to your player you then must continue with the check out process.  Once stored on your player you now only have two notes, indicating that you only have &quot;rights&quot; to that song two more times.  The only way to get your &quot;right&quot; back is to check the song back into your hard drive.  When you think about the system it is quite ingenious and would make any Sony lawyer happy.<p>MEMORY STICKS If you are buying this player thinking that you are going to stock up on Sony MG memory sticks think again.  64MB MG MS are over $100 a piece.  If you are looking for a player that would allow you to keep separate &quot;mixs'&quot; on different medias that you can interchange in your players, look to Iomegas new Clik player. <p>SLEEK STYLE  As seen in the picture this player is very ergonmically built.  It fits well in your palm and has a very intuitive menu. A &quot;rocking&quot; scroll bar on the side of the unit allows you to scroll up and down between your checked out songs and also allows you to FF and REW.  There are also options to change display types of your song readouts and time counter playback options. The look and feel are truly state of the art and worth the price tag.<p>ACCESORIES The player comes with a very tiny (and easy to lose) cradle that recharges the units LITH battery and also is the specially designed input of the included USB cable. (The input on the cradle almost looks like an 1394 port)Also easy to lose is the adapter for the headphone jack. The headphone input is not your standard 3.5&quot; mini plug but rather a 2.5&quot;.  The included headphones are 2.5&quot; and comes with the aformentioned adapter.  Also included is a very hard to install strap to hang the player around your neck.<p>All in all this  is the most sleek and best looking player on the market. Purchasing this all comes down to looks over convenience, shes very pretty but a definite pain in the arse.

<Title>Its cool
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I love Sony. I think there inovators and leaders in the electronics industry. This product shows just that. Easy to use, attractive and a nice peice of equipment. Setting up was easy. The registration process was a little overboard. I dont think you should have to register a product just to use it. &quot;Big Brother&quot; But you gotta do what you gotta do. Nice features and decent software but the conversion time is way to long. Also whats up with them crappy [cheap] earbud head phones? When you spend[this much] you should at least get some rockin head phones to go along.  In closing worth $400.00 no.  Worth $200.00 yes.  Bottom line.

<Title>Betamax redux
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>What a useless piece of junk. Impressively cool looking, it requires you to jump through Sony's copy-protection hoops to play music that you legitimately own. It also requires special MagicGate memory sticks, which are much more expensive per megabyte than other storage media.<p>If you want an expensive toy that forces you to endlessly convert files and pay homage to a technology that will disappear in a year you should by this player.<p>Can you say Betamax?
