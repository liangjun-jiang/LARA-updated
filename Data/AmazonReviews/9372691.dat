<Title>VERY DISAPPOINTED With Smartdisk & Amazon
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>NO WHERE did it say or show that the F.M. Radio was a separate contraption that is similiar to what Walmart sells for $1.00 and that you could not use the MP3 Player without it due to the headphones being permanently connected to the radio.  Once you hook everything together and put around your neck, you look like something from Star Wars.  Also, the hold button on the MP3 Player came broken, but because I also said that I was dissatisfied with the product, Amazon made me pay for the shipping back!!!

<Title>what remains is excellent
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>True, there's no integrated radio and  the separate radio/phone set thing is worthless... but they never mention this, so I got my SmartDisk Rover  FOR FREE when I complained to my credit card co..  But having said that, what remains of the SmartDisk Rover MP3 Player is excellent.  Ease and speed of data transfer is exceptional. No software is needed on most systems. The controls are fairly intuitive, a rarity these days. The MP3 sound is better than my iRiver 799 player, which  itself is considered the standard. Finally I much prefer this single AAA battery power source to anything proprietary  (as required with Apple units). Unfortunately, or perhaps sensing the PR disaster from the radio thingy glitch, SmartDisk does NOT support the product - no user guide. Mine came with a CD of tricks for Windows - but it seems that's all in the past.

<Content>Is easy to use, fits perfectly in a pocket and the earplugs are good. Still need to check out the radio, which was important argument for buying it.
