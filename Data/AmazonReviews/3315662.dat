<Content>Love the product.  Easy to use and the radio is excellent.  We had another brand a couple of years ago that was almost impossible to use.  The USB makes so easy to down load music.

<Title>worth its low price
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would say this is an example of 'you get what you pay for'. On the plus side, 2 gigs, mp3 player, FM radio, voice recorder all for $40. On the minus side - it is very difficult to figure out how to use the voice recorder, very complicated to access voice notes, the FM radio is average and the battery life is dismally brief. I don't feel ripped off, but I would probably be happier with something that cost more.

<Title>Survived the WASHING Machine!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>WOW. I bought this for my 8 year old son who likes to listen to music and "wanted an ipod" ("No.") He left it in his jeans pocket and it went through the washing machine. I was very upset at both of us for not checking his pockets before the wash - was sure the thing was a goner! But he plugged in his headphones and powered it up and... Oh my goodness! The thing worked!!! (The headphones were not as lucky as they went though the wash as well). I am amazed. He feels very cool listening to his own music and I didn't spend $$$ for something else that may not have survived the wash.

<Title>Good value for the price
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted an MP3 player, but didn't want to spend that much since I really only wanted to use it in my car. The Coby MP-C895 is perfect for that. I love how small it is, and that it plays FM radio and records (either voice or from the radio) as well. It runs on a AAA battery and I've had the same one in there for a couple of weeks (light use) and it's still at full strength. I only have two complaints: despite there being a folder for it, I can't seem to get playlists to go on the player. I can transfer a whole playlist, and the songs will play in that order, except that they're grouped by artist and the playlist file never shows up in the player. In other words, if you have two songs by the same artist in your playlist, it will play them back to back.  My second problem is with tech support, they never responded to THREE emails, and when I finally got through on the phone, the person that I spoke to sounded barely knowledgeable and basically told me it was a problem with the player that there was a playlist folder and no way to use it.

<Title>Almost Perfect
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great value and pretty much exactly what I was looking for - at any price.  I did not care for the IPOD like screen and wanted something physically very small.  This fit the bill.  My only complaint is that when you load a single file with music rights protection you can't see or play any of the files on the system.  The only way I got around that was to tediously examine all my music files on my PC, make sure I only listed non WMA files for loading onto the MP3 player, reformat the MP3 player and then completely reload all the files.

<Title>So.................easy!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first MP3 player. I wanted something basic, no bells and whistles or camera. I have a digital camera that I'm happy with so kept looking until I found a MP3 plaer that didn't include one. It was extremely easy to figure out. I downloaded the songs I wanted for my exercise playlist. The music is clear with no distortion. I'm very pleased with it.

<Title>Perfect!!
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted something to play my music and podcasts but didn't want to shell out the cash for an iPod. Then I found this little MP3 Player. It easily connects to my computer (Mac and PC) via my USB port, I drag my music/podcasts to it, eject it, and I'm ready. When I want to catch the latest news or traffic updates I switch to the FM Player and don't miss a beat. Some people have said it doesn't allow to save files but that's a matter of changing a simple option. ;) It's worth much more than what I paid for it. I'm very happy.

<Title>Great for the price
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was looking at this or one with a micro SD (this one was also battery powered instead of having to us a USB to power it up between uses) and I'm glad I got this one.  The direct USB is huge and the 2GB gives plenty of room for files and music.  The stock headphones are horrible, but a quick swap out fixes that.  I like the buttons more on the Creative style MP3s, as these are small and in a row, which makes you have to look at them to see what you are doing.  The Creative variety let's you flick the stick to go to the next one without looking.  Again not a big deal and overall it's a great little gadget for the price.

<Content>I'm not a techno guy so if the sound didn't have the right highs/lows I'd never know.  What I do know; this little device has equal performance to that of any portable cassete or CD player I've ever owned.  FM tuner, voice recorder, flash memory - are you kidding me?  I don't have to carry CD's, a CD player, and a thumb drive when I go on buisness trips?  Nope - this little guy did it all and never left my front pocket!  This is the swiss army knife of it's trade.  Only one thing left to say - bye bye gadgets!

<Content>I bought the same model with 1 GB flash memory somewhere else. Same price!  I am not crazy about iPod and other new technology stuff but since I am a total Mac user.  I alway long for a really dirt cheap MP3 player (MAC) for my daily purpose use. This product is a great value. It plays only .MP3 and one other audio format.  I had to download a free version of SWITCH via internet and convert all my files to .mp3. It works well! Very small and use only 1 AAA battery.

<Title>The unsung hero
<Date>Fri Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When you're buying an iPod, a Zen or a Zune, it is pretty useless to write a review for it unless you are among the very first to review it because within a few weeks, some-hundred people will already have reviewed it. The review turns into more of a popularity poll, naturally. But this entry deserves a review.  I already own an 80GB iPod, but my dilemma was that with this capacity and content, its turned into more of a "warehouse" than something I could use while working out or on the move. Call it a psychological idiosyncrasy but when exercising or on the move, I prefer to have my MP3 player loaded with and playing my favorites one after the other rather than having to fiddle with it to search for what I want to listen to next every few minutes. It's all about the experience. And if the iPod is a jukebox then what I really needed was a "My Favorites folder" so to say. And so began the quest...  Obviously because I already owned an iPod, I didn't want to end up spending another two or three hundred dollars on an MP3 player; I wanted something cost effective. Getting beyond the lifestyle issues of getting a second player, the top contenders in the field were (again) another iPod of lesser capacity i.e. an iPod Nano or Shuffle, a Zune or Creative's Zen or Muvo. The Coby won as my pick because of the features and capacity for the price tag. The 1GB iPod Shuffle, which doesn't have anything besides the capability to play music, no FM or voice recorder, or even a display LCD/interface, and half the memory capacity of this, costs twice as much i.e. $80 at the time when I purchased this Coby MP-C895. The Zune and Creative Muvo also suffer from the same issue -- higher cost with less features and memory capacities. You'd be paying a substantial amount for the brand name.  Now that I've asserted I picked it because it was feature rich and had the best capacity in its class of devices, how did it fair out when I used it? It was very easy to use. I plugged it in to my PC and my Windows detected it immediately just like any plug and play USB device. (Using Windows XP Professional with SP2.) I was able to easily copy and paste my MP3 songs on to the device and they copied over without any issues, just like copying regular files on your PC. No software installs were needed, and no drivers were needed to get it up and running. In short, the startup was as smooth as silk. The one downside I did notice was that the copying process was SLOW, much slower than the iPod or of any other USB device I have ever used. But that didn't bother me because I won't be updating the songs on it like every day, may be once or twice a month, so I can live with the speed issue. The sound quality is pretty good. The access latency (time to switch between songs) is also ok, about 2-3 seconds. It comes pre-programmed with a bunch of equalizer settings (the usual -- pop, rock, dance, jazz, etc.) so you can even control your treble and bass this way. I didn't use the earphones that came with it and use a pair of Sennheiser earphones I already had, and I found the sound quality to be pretty decent. I haven't yet used the recorder or FM tuner so I cannot comment on those. The menu and settings are again very feature rich and easy to access via the device's buttons. The LCD's backlit color can even be changed and you can choose from between 6 to 8 different background colors (green, red, purple and some shades of blue). It took me all of 15 minutes to familiarize myself with its capabilities. Once I use it a little bit more, I'll find out what the battery life is (uses one AAA battery).   The conclusion? After getting and using it for some days now, I am satisfied that I made the right choice. The advice is if you are looking for a device in this class i.e. if you're shopping for an iPod Shuffle or Creative Muvo type MP3 player (and not something higher end >= 4GB with full audio and video capabilities like a Zune, iPod Classic or Creative Zen) then you may wish to consider this if you're not brand / status conscious. You won't find anything on the market (at this time, at least) with this many features and 2GB capacity for this price tag.  Dec. 3, 2007: The battery time is also fairly decent. I have used an ordinary Duracell in it (not a long-life battery) and after 5 to 6 hours of playing, it still indicates 3-quarters battery time remaining. I've also mainly used it during work outs (jogging) and it seems durable and reliable. Haven't seen any quirky behavior, performance degradation or mysterious malfunctions surface so far.

<Title>Cheap But not upto the mark
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wish I get time to upload the real photos of this mp3 player. I'll try to be brief and to the point  Pros: 1-Price is good and affordable 2-Directly plugs into the usb (no need for cable) 3-AAA batteries (no worries that the li-ion gets dead after some time) 4-Multiple colors to select for its lcd in the setup.  Cons: 1-The worst thing: Max. volume is actually very low on my sony-mdr headphone or any other 'good' headphones.  2-While playing music, i can't see the progress-bar (as i see in the product picture), i can only see this bar while recording. Text size on lcd is way too large as i compared to what i see in the product picture (and i've found no way to configure these things in the setup) 3-Headphones that come with it are pathetic and dont reflect quality at all. 4-No option to upgrade the firmware yet 5-Shiny but still dont gives an appealing look. Shape is not uniform from the back. --

<Content>I'm a student and this mp3 player keeps me studying for hours.  I recommend it if you're looking for something economical with a decent amount of memory.  It's simple, nothing fancy.  I get 15-20 hours of play per battery.  I think the sound is alright unlike the 2 star reviewer.  The headphones didn't work, but I wouldn't have used them anyway.

<Title>A Little Disappointed
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Within days of using this mp3 player, a couple of issues surfaced. My computer almost never detects it when connected. It takes several tries before the computer detects it, otherwise I can't add any music.... isn't that the whole idea of this thing? Also, the + button doesn't work well. I have to press it a few times to adjust the volume by 1 level. One minor issue is that when I add a song, it goes to the bottom of the playlist rather than in alphabetical order, as it is on my hard drive. Not a big deal, but I prefer to have the songs listed in alphabetical order.  On the plus side, it plays my mp3s & favorite radio station well. The sound quality is decent, too.  Over all, I'm disappointed... but hey, you get what you pay for... I would recommend getting something better, but do some research before buying! This was my first portable mp3 player, but considering my bad experience with it, I'm not too optimistic about the next one I'm planning to buy.

<Title>USB, READY BOOST, MP3, Works anywhre there is a USB slot.  You gotta set it up right though, so Read on...
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I needed a device that was able to simply store data... but I also wanted one that could play MP3 files while I was about.  Most people only talk about the MP3 functions, and they are like any other MP3 player.  I will tell you how to make this the ultimate data storage device and also MP3 player.  There is a menu on the device, you need to go into settings and change the USB type to MSC.... DONE!  Now plug it into USB slot and you will see it as a regular drive with all the bells and whistles you would have on a regular drive.   ***..IF YOU DON'T CHANGE IT, THEN IT ACTS LIKE A PORTABLE DEVICE WITH RESTRICTIONS..***  I use this in my car radio, it has a USB slot, and it plays music there as well.  Talk about the perfect device... music everywhere I go and it interfaces in all USB slots.  Here is a BONUS, &lt;Shhh... Whisper> I have Vista and it offered to use this drive as a "READY BOOST" drive to speed up the system.  I didn't do it, but was suprised to see it was possible since those drives have to have very fast transfers.  Now, the thing is.... I think it transfers files slowly so it might have been a fluke that windows thought it was fast enough to boost the system.  I have tried many USB drives and the only one that windows thought was fast enough, besides this one, was one that said it was a "ReadyBoost" capable drive.    **Yes, you can play music in windows media player strait from this device.  You must be in MSC mode, otherwise you gotta sinc the files and all that junk.  THIS IS PERFECT FOR MILITARY PERSONEL BECAUSE MANY OF THE COMPUTERS THEY CAN USE WILL NOT ALLOW FILES OR DATA TO BE PERMANENTLY ADDED.  NOW YOU CAN STREAM FILES RIGHT FROM THIS USB DEVICE.  Bottom Line, This is a great gadget that allows you to have music everywhere you go and also data, like pictures or text documents, or any other files.  2GB is alot of room for all this stuff.  I have used 1GB for music which was ~150-200 MP3 Files 128-320kbps (mostly 128), and still 1GB for pics and docs... its alot of space.   Or, get the 4GB model...

<Title>Did not work well for recording
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Probably not bad product for the price. But I bought it to use as a pocker recorder to easily capture ideas. The actual recording works well, but there's way too much menu navigation to get to record something. Not a procedure I would do while driving.  Also was counting that the 2GB would let me replace my current USB flash drive that I carry around. Unfortunately found that it would not allow anything other than music files. I don't mean it would not "play" a Word document, a restriction which makes sense. I mean it would not even allow me to put the Word document on the disk.
