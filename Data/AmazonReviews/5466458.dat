<Title>Stopped working on my second use
<Date>Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 worked great the first time and I was way excited about using it.  However, the second time I used it, it froze up and started flashing all sorts of colors. It hasn't worked since.  I am going to contact company to see what they can do.  If they solve the problem, I'll update this review.  However, as of now, I CANNOT recommend this product.

<Title>buyer beware - I didn't expect much, got less, never worked
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a cheap MP3 player for my daughter's birthday.  I figured she'd lose it anyway.  She was excited when she opened it, but two hours later, I'd seen enough.  Turns on, then off repeatedly when connected to the computer through the USB connection, so computer can never fully sync with the device.  Our other MP3 players work fine. COBY "customer support" is horrendous.  First, "Damien" tells me that I must charge the unit for 4 hours.  I argue with him that this thing takes a AAA battery, what's to charge!  He gets back to me, agrees that it is defective.  Then tells me they want a $6 MONEY ORDER to process a return.  Returning to Amazon.

<Title>Cheap
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Although this item is priced right, I found it to be cheap. It didn't work with my computer so be careful when buying this item. I purchased a Sansadisk MP3 player after returning this one and it is wonderful.

<Title>5 star excellent
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i read others reviews and took a chance on this item. i'm not disappointed at all. this player works just great for me, although you must follow the instructions close. the only problem i have is when my cat chewed on the usb cable and i now have to hold my mouth just right. my wife also has a coby (a higher grade) but she has no problems with hers. feel safe with this item and enjoy..

<Title>Good Produc For The Price!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is very solid for the price! Easy to download music too and easy to use. I like this model because it has better use buttons. Older models had trouble with buttons sticking. Solid choice for this price! Easy to operate and understand. Only drawback is I am a heavy user and wear them out fairly quickly but for the money I simply keep a spare on hand! Can't beat this product for the low price!

<Title>Cheap price for a cheap item
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You get what you pay for.  Battery life is very low (about one hour max. of continuous play).  With more than about 75 MP3's loaded, the player seems to get "confused" and cannot find all files.  I think it has something to do with the way the memory organizes the files into subfolders (artist and album).  If you navigate through the folders, you can find all of the loaded MP3's but if you're just wanting to turn on the player and go, you might find a big portion of your music unavailable.  For example, the first time I loaded up with MP3 music files, I added 120 files.  However when I turned on the player, it only showed that I had 70-some files.  I deleted a few files from the player and then it showed I had 80-some files???? Very strange.  I decided to test it by loading up the MP3 files into the root folder on the player using Windows Explorer.  This helped but didn't totally fix the problem. (Loaded up 120 files and now it's showing 107...) My wife purchased a Sansa M240 for about the same price and it is MUCH better.

<Title>What you save in price you make up for in battery cost
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this, this because I really didn't need an mp3 player since I listen to the radio in the morning and late afternoons but the price was right. I lie to you not, I have to put a new battery in this thing everyday if not every 1.5 days.  The cost adds up to the same as a an ipod after battery costs.  If you don't listen to your mp3 player everyday then this is the player for you.

<Title>Poor quality - stopped working.
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The quality and service are very poor.  It stopped working after use for about a week.  After working fine for a few days, it now turns off and on (reboots itself) when trying to play music files on it.  Manual suggests reloading firmware from company website, but there's no firmware there for this product.  That's poor quality AND service.  I am unlikely to buy another Coby product.
