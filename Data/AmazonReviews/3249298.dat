<Title>A great little player...

<Content>This is a great little device. It's nice and compact unlike a lot of other video players and fits pretty much anywhere. It handles music and video which is always a plus and has some nice bonus features like games and voice recorder. It also has an external speaker which is great when sharing videos or songs with friends. And even though it's tiny, the 1.8" screen is very vibrant and displays well. The only drawback is the videos need to be converted, but that is true with every player. The good news is this one doesn't take all night to convert your videos. The video conversion is pretty quick and easy to use. A great player all in all and highly recommended.

<Content>This is a great product. I bought this because I wanted to have the option of listening to the radio or watching videos. This player is really great. I would recommmend it to all. Even if little kids. The menu is easy to manuver and it also came w/ a wall charger.
