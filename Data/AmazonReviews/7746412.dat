<Title>Do not buy!

<Content>This MP3 Player did not even last me a year.  I use the MP3 player every morning to jog on the treadmill for approx. 30mins.  About a week ago the music started to skip and jump around whenever the MP3 Player moves.  This makes it impossible to listen to the music while running for obvious reasons. I tried taking the battery out and putting it back in.  Powering off and on.  Nothing is working! This player is not even 1 year old. I've never dropped it. It's never been exposed to water.  I see no reason why this product should have only lasted me 8 months.  Especially when I paid over $100 bucks for it!!  DO NOT BUY!

<Title>Difficult to use

<Content>I have had this player for 3 months now and have been able to get 3 songs on it.  I will be the first to admit that I am not the most computer savvy person out there, but I can usually muddle my way thru in order to get me devices to work.  No luck with this product.  I can only get it to transfer music if I am using Jukebox MusicMatch.  But this program jams my computer so that I cannot get an entire song to download 90% of the time.  I prefer using Rhapsody, but this player is not recognized by rhapsody.  I have 3 songs on my player (which I don't know how I got them there) after hours and hours of trying.  Would not recommend.

<Content>Got this about six months ago, mostly because of the expansion slot.  I have been using it heavily in Baghdad for three months now.  Easy to load.  Drag and drop from my PC right into the unit.  Can also drag off unit onto a PC.  Only drawback I have found is it plays the music in seeming random pattern, mixing the interally stored music with the music on the chip.  Probably need to read the instructions, but I left them on the other side of the world.

<Title>Lame

<Content>I got it for my birthday exactly one year ago and right to the date it messes up on me. The button got stuck so now it won't turn off or on anymore.  It is extremely uses to use though but I never figured out how to use the FM tuner on it. &lt;then again we have no good stations in Laredo Texas anyways so i didn't bother learning.> If it wasn't for the fact it crapped out on me I would've suggested buying it. Alas, the thing is just another cheap toy that didn't last.
