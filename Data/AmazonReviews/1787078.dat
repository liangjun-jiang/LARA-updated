<Title>Great when it works
<Date>Thu Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got an ipod as a gift in July 2003, and had some problems with the software, and getting my computer to recognize the device, etc.  I had read a user review on Amazon stating that the software was &quot;flakey&quot;, and I didn't know what that meant until I got my ipod.  When it works, it really is great, I like the design and used it everyday, but it took a fair bit of tinkering around to get it to work.  The directions weren't helpful at all.<p>A previous reviewer wrote that he couldn't run with his ipod because it froze up constantly.  I run with mine everyday and have not had this problem.<p>I had some problems with the Music Match software.  Sometimes it would duplicate songs, and I could only delete one version.  I had to restore my ipod to factory settings a few times to remove duplicate versions of songs.  Apple came out with iTunes for Windows a few months after I got my ipod, and I've found it to be easier to use.<p>My ipod died completely, even though the battery was fully charged, in December 2003.  It didn't work for a few days, then I was able to revive it.  This happened 3 times before I sent it back.  Apple customer service kind of sucks, there is no 800 number to call for support, you have to register on their web site and email your problems in.  Within a few days of emailing Apple, I received a shipping box in the mail to return my ipod.  I sent it back and received a new ipod in less than a week. <p>I'm kind of skeptical that my new ipod will last any longer than the old one, but maybe I had a dud.  With the problems I've had, I can't really recommend the ipod, but it really is great when it works.  Definitely read the other user reviews before purchasing one though.

<Title>Best there is!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Just got the 10-gig iPod last Friday (picked up at a great sale price as Apple is dropping 10-gig in favor of "mini" and "15-gig"). All I can say is awesome. I never had Apple before and was skeptical based on some of the Amazon reviews. But all my fears were erased. I have a 6 month-old Compaq at home and had no problems getting the two to sync up. Literally "plug and play". Bonus is, if your Windows PC has a newer fire-wire port, it will even charge your iPod while downloading music. I have almost 1,000 songs (75+ albums) on it right now, and using just under 4-gig. I read a lot about people having problems sync-ing their window-based PCs to iPod. Based on my experience, I can only guess they are using older PCs and insist on using USB2 or even old USB.  One tip, if you're "ripping" CDs to put on your iPod, be logged into the web. I-tunes will literally fill out all the song/track information for you (a little tid-bit I found by accident).  Also, regarding the reviews where people "e-mail" Apple and have horrible customer service stories....   check out the Apple web-site.  You can't e-mail Apple.  You must call them directly or join one of the discussion chat-groups (which I've used, and are very helpful).

<Title>Proof that there was a crash in Area 51!
<Date>Wed Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>...and they loved music. This product must have been reverse engineered...it's that good.<p>I've been listening to MP3's on portable players since the Diamond 32MB.  I'm an absolute music junkie and use these players to get me to (and keep me in) the gym everyday.  The iPod (of which I've owned 2 previous models) is hands down the best portable on the market.<p>Combine with the Apple owned iTunes site (this sounds like a commercial but...).  They work phenomenal together.<p>I have a PC.  If you do to, make sure you buy the PC version.  Also, it's much easier if your PC has a Firewire port (kind of like a USB port but wider and shorter).  If it doesn't, and you're not computer savvy, you might want to avoid iPod (as painful as that is to say).<p>Daily use is great.  The keys themselves are heat sensitive, which is cool (no pun..), but can be a pain when you get the song you want, go to put in your pants, and accidently touch a key.  Other than that, flawless.  Very intuitive buttons, very intuitive menu, and beautiful looks.<p>If you need more than 10GB of space, you're probably a target for the RIAA and will be sued any day now...  I have 700 hundred songs and use about 25% of the available storage on this unit.<p>I can't say enough good things about this thing!<br>Enjoy...

<Title>Great music, great fun, but not scratch resistant
<Date>Sat Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Received my iPod as a Christmas gift. An amazing product. Pleasantly surprised by how good it sounds. How much music it holds. How easy it is use. How good it feels in your hand or pocket. <p>My only complaint is that it scratches very easily. I strongly recommend that you buy a case for this when you buy the device. My new iPod started showing scratches by Christmas night. I you don't have a case for it, be sure sure you don't put it in a coat pocket with your car keys or a nail clipper.

<Title>Warning to all potential buyers...
<Date>Fri Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a load of crap. I got it as a christmas present.. and now it's february.. so i've only had this thing for 3 months. Well, at first it was all right and all.. but now it's officially DEAD. I have yet to send it in to be repaired and i'm not sure if i want to considering my dad paid so much for this skimpy thing that fails to deliver after only 3 months. I get tired waiting for songs to upload and furthermore, the battery life drains so fast. i started out w/ an ok battery (the battery would go down one bar after about 30 songs) to battery life of an imposter duracell bunny (less than 20 songs and it's down one bar) well great, my ipod died completely when i tried to listen to it a few days ago. it's not responding to snything. i see some ppl think it's great and it has worked out well for them but i really think this is a hit-or-miss product. Either it works for you or it dies within a few months. I have heard other stories of people's ipod dying within a few months and even though there's a one-year warranty, the person still had to pay for some repairs. So buyers beware.. make sure you know what you're getting yourself into!<br>Edit: I got a replacement ipod... had to transfer all the songs over to it... moreover, it just died again. So this stupid thing has died TWICE in less than SIX MONTHS.

<Title>ipod is OK. hoping for advances in future models
<Date>Sun Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my 10GB ipod since Sept. 2003 and I bought it for $300 and had to also buy an FM transmitter, cables for my computer (I have a PC, not Mac), a carrying case (for running, etc.) and a car charger. Thus, the price was somewhere around $375, plus I bought the extended warranty from the store because I knew these were fragile items.<br>The basic FM transmitter isn't as good as the ITRIP, but it was sufficient. The battery life in that thing stinks though.<br>I accidentally knocked my ipod off of the treadmill in its carrying case and it broke. I was pretty mad considering I used to throw my tape player all over the place and nothing ever happened. i miss tapes.<br>anyway, i believe that the ipod should come with a few more features, like a built in FM transmitter and an FM receiver for listening to the radio. i also think its a bit pricy. sometimes it freezes for no reason and sometimes the software for my PC does not synchronize well with the ipod and i have to restart. <br>i find the ipod pretty easy to use, but it is very fragile and could still use some work. i hope the future models will be better. now i cannot buy a 10GB, i have to get a 15GB, but Apple does not seem to be doing anything to their newer models to make them much better. More music is better, but there are no new added features. <br>I might try a new mp3 player in the meantime until apple gets their act together. since all these mp3 players are so new, you can't expect any of them to be perfect. i will take a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude with the ipod. not that i don't recommend it. its the only mp3 player i have ever had, so i have nothing to compare it to.

<Title>Elegant and Simple
<Date>Thu Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Although I'm a PC person, I have to appreciate Apple's commitment to quality. For a piece of equipment this advanced, it is amazingly simple to operate. The face has no moving parts; instead, the heat from your fingers activates the different buttons.<br>  In this updated model there is room for a couple hundred CDs and (supposedly) the issue regarding battery life has been resolved.<br>  Possible issues:  You must own an Apple or PC computer as this is the only way to upload your music onto the iPod.  This model only comes with a Firewire cable; a USB adaptor is extra.  Also, any songs that you keep on your iPod must be stored on your computer.  This last issue is only a problem if you are running a computer with limited harddrive space (e.g. &lt;10gb).<br>  Besides these small problems, my iPod has given me hours of pleasure.  One recommendation is the Griffin iTrip FM transmitter.  This allows you to play music from your iPod over any FM radio.  This item runs about $35 and can be purchased on Amazon.com or on Apple's website.

<Date>Fri Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod 10 Giga-Bytes. These Guys know how to do the music business! The iPod Has a VERY sleek design for your pockets and case.(I Strongly suggest the case...)With the iPod you can make the huge piles of CD's from the 80's into little AAC Files (Mp4 files). This Helped me and my father. <br>     I got My iPod after my original Mp3 player broke,(it was some wierd hard drive player the size of a brick.) and I have NEVER regreted it. Just using this program may result in: Mac Fever, buying pepsi just for the iTunes lid, thinking or dreaming about a brand new iMac or iPods. <br>     Anywho, You Should buy this! Just keep it away from any electrical devices that include: Van de graff generators, The Ball Things That Have the sparks inside it. it messes with the touch buttons.

<Title>Sweet!
<Date>Tue Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When mp3 players came out I was fairly dissapointed until I discovered the iPods. Apple makes the absolutely top of the line mp3 player on the markey. Yeah, you can go buy a mp3 player for a fraction of the cost, but you'll also get a fraction of the quality.<p>The new iPod minis are great, but I'm still using my good old 10 gig iPod and it hasn't let me down yet. The batteries last practically 4ever, and it's durable and cool looking to.<p>A note to anyone trying to decide on size: don't automatically buy the biggest iPod just because it's the biggest. Chances are you're never going to use all of the space. One of the best ways to utilize the Pod is to put all your favorite music on it and then just set it to randomly shuffle between songs. You can't do this if you have a couple of gigs of the good stuff and 38 gigs of junk...

<Title>This is very expensive  but worth it
<Date>Sat May 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this is so cool. i got one for crhistmas and loved it. i have about 529 songs on mine because i get all of my songs from my schools media room. the teacher is devoted to apple brand software, computers, acsseories, and speakers. this is very cool and the songs are cheap. theres just one problem, when listening to loud songs, you should turn it down because for a small item, this can be hered from a room away when left playing and at max voloume! and it moves alone when its loud! but it is good and it has a cool backlight so when your in the dark, the screen lights up and so do the buttons. it dsiplays the time, date, and it has a photo and video slot and you can keep your scedhual. it also has games like brick and solitare. it also has a special game where it takes all of your songs and makes a music quiz where it gives you 90 seconds of a song and a list of songs for you to pick and get right. this is the only game that you can't listen to a song while playing. the back has it's own licences number and the logo. it has an area for your settings and your ipod's identity(a.k.a your name, tis number, the amount of songs it currently contains,, and the amonut of space you have left and how much is used. pretty cool right! thanks!

<Title>A Perfect Creation for Music Lovers
<Date>Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I first saw I-POD at the MAC display in King of Prussia and I was just bowled over by its sleek design. But it was much more then the Design when I received my i-POD from Amazon. <br>The functionality, the ease to use, the sound quality everything is perfect about this little gadget. Its Got Games, its got address book, you can use it as external hard disk.. and what not. Overall a must buy for anyone who loves all his music to be with him/her.<br>Although there are a few points which you should think about, <br>1. if you are ordering a 10 GB ipod...and for Windows, it doesnt come with USB, so you will have to install a firewire port like I did (if you dont have already). Firewire port externally installed doesnt give the speed claimed.<br>2. Do buy a carrying case, the lil ipod is so sleek that it can slip out of your grip anytime.<p>so Go ahead and beleive me you will love this ...

<Title>iPod rocks on!
<Date>Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was initially skeptical when I was given an iPod as a Christmas gift. I didn't have a vast collection of MP3s, and was not sure that I would use it all that much.<p>Well, now that I have had it for almost six months, I must say, WOW! I take it to work with me everyday (in fact, I am typing this review whilst listening to some classic Beatles on my iPod). It has become an essential part of my life, and I cannot imagine life without it.<p>Combined with iTunes as a way of organising my music, and adding in the power of AAC encoded audio, it kicks butt. Buy one, or better still, buy one of its bigger brethren. The convenience, power and ease of use make it one of the coolest consumer electronic gadgets I have gotten in years.

<Content>Alright, I am in high school and work a minimum wage job, so this product is a huge chunk of my paycheck.  I was very leery at first because I did not want to waste the money on something that I will not use very much.  I have to say though; this mp3 player has changed my life!  I never go anywhere without it.  It has replaced all of my CDs to the extent that I have sold most of them.  This player out performs any other on the market and always performs flawlessly.  I am also very surprised at how often apple releases new updates on the player.  I am a windows user and I use win 98se with absolutely no problems at all.  Please do not hesitate to buy this because it is worth it.

<Title>Love Music? Can't Do Without iPod.
<Date>Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received the 10gb iPod from my pops for a graduation present and I have to say it's MORE then worth the price. The iPod is simply amazing. Just opening the box to retrieve the 'Pod' is a treat. Apple designed some sort of iPod-origami to create a square-looking box that is truly artistic and practical. Once I got to the machine inside, my life was complete. The iPod is so smooth and the features so extensive, it looked as though it should be in a James Bond film. The backlight illuminates the `Pod' so beautifully, giving the buttons a red glow while turning the viewing-screen a sharp, white color. I never wanted to turn it off. It's as though I should've placed the instrument on a mantel when through listening just to gawk at its beauty.<p>Furthermore, I could actually hear the iPod spin its compact hard drive. Upon taking it out of the box, it turned on to reveille language options and instantly hooked me into configuring the entire thing.<p>Overall the iPod is the most beautiful machine I've ever laid eyes upon. The long battery life is simply icing on the cake and the number of songs it holds is astonishing. If Apple makes computers as well as they constructed this music piece, it's no wonder people obsess over Macs.

<Content>I recently got my iPod as a 12th Birthday Present. I had wanted an MP3 Player for a long time, but we didn't have the money. So when I opened the package, I couldn't have been more suprised! I have only had this MP3 player for about 1 month, and I already have over 150 songs stored on it. No problem using music match jukebox... it's very easy once you get the hang of it. <br>The iPod is so sleek and simple. It is so beautiful, and I take it everywhere. <br>I absolutley love the scroll wheel, it makes everything so easy. It's very easy to operate, and It weighs so little. (less than 2 CDs in jewel cases!!)<br>I hope that for the prospective buyer, that you are willing to spend a few extra dollars and get this iPod. I garuntee you will not be dissapointed.

<Title>"to good to be true" I said. MAN WAS I WRONG!
<Date>Sat Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Ok lets start with the teanie,weanie,bad news:<br>1. The first problem is that it was truely made for Macs. All of the included acessories are Mac only compatible unless you have a Fire Wire card already installed on your Comp. <br>2. The second is that you need to buy a USB 2.0 wire for people who have a PC. Unfortunately if your comp is older than 2 years you probabally need to buy a USb 2.0 PCI card. Without it, your sunk. Your comp wont recognize the Ipod because of the older 1.1 USB Driver therefore no music can be transfered. But no worries its about [$$$] for the USB 2.0 Cord and [$$$] for PCI card, but trust me they will garantee a faster and swifter download of music. <br>3. Oh ya it would help to have or burn a copy of Windows Xp because of its great compatibility with installing a recognizing new devices,software,ect..<p>Now for good stuff..<br>WOW!! times 5. This Mp3 is amazing, so much to do with it besides music. You got games, scheduler, clock, alarm, great organization for music playlists and songs. Sound quality is great and dwonloading is swift and easy. Download all your CD's in 2 minutes a CD or faster.( depends on how much songs are on it.)So small and sleek looking its great for traveling and fitting anywhere. If you buy the carrying case for sport activites you can jog, hike,bike, ect.. without it falling out.<br>IF you got the cash$$$ i sugest you buy this one it goes quick so get yours now. Nothing beats it! Best on the market fro your money. So why you still reading? BUY IT!!

<Title>Absolutely Amazing
<Date>Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had never been very big on Mac products, but after deciding it was time to move up from my 32MB MP3 player, I settled on the iPod.  This device is absolutely amazing.  10GB is plenty of room for me.  I had a little trouble settting it up to run on my Windows Me operating system.  MusicMatch always said it was not connected even though Windows said it was there.  Finally after trying it on two different comptuers I took it back and exchanged it for another one only to have the same problem.  I then tried it on one of my friends computers which had WinXP.  After hooking it up there I was able to format the drive.  Brought it back to my house, no luck.  Then I found some software called ephPod 2 on the internet and it works just fine.  All the iPod software still says its not connected to my system but hey, it works.  I deffinately advise anybody thinking of purchasing an iPod to go ahead and do it.  May seem a little expenseive, but it's well worth it.

<Title>Hard to Fault ..Except  Extreme Volume Limits on Euro Model
<Date>Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Ditto what everyone says below --- hard to imagine better bang for the buck than this sensationally slick little wonder of technology. I do however, have one knock against it which I view as quite significant. It simply does not produce enough volume for my liking: and I'm not a headbanger by any means. I would strongly advise anyone considering this to try it out first. I'm referring here to the models with 2.0 software -- for some reason the earlier versions do allow the user to tinker with the upper registers. But not the newer ones, which is big disappointment. Other than that -- great machine.<p>ADDENDUM: The volume problem described above relates to all Gen 3 iPods sold in Europe (where I purchased mine) -- the US models are fine. New French "Big Brother" regulations limit the db levels produced by personal stereos and Apple decided -- for some reason -- to apply these limits to all European models. There is a thunderstorm of indignation about this issue on the iPod related chat boards. Apple has been curiously silent on the issue. So Europeans, beware!

<Content>Seriously the only problems with iPod are its price and internal battery. I have been thinking of buying it for more than a year, but can't get myself to spend so much on a mp3 player which will die in 2 yrs time.<p>If Apple had used a user replacable battery or the price was $100 less I would have bought it without a thought. I need only 3GB or atmost 5GB, but cheapest one is 10GB. <p>I am starting an ipod fund to save money for one and will use my 10 buck CD player meanwhile!
