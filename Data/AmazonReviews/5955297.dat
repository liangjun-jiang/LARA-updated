<Title>Very awesome player
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>- Obviously the most prominent feature of this MP3 player is its built-in speakers, which i was very satisfied with. Many people said the sound quality was 'tinny', but I had no problem with it whatsoever - its also very loud for a small speaker.  - Nice stylish design with the slide-out speakers, touch pad navigation and icons. Very attractive, contrasted with the rather boring iPod, therefore this is ideal for fashion-conscious people.  - Only bad points: 1) the included earphones are very strange; looks like a big glob of rubber and very hard to keep in your ear. Invest in a separate pair, 2) file navigation system not so good, compared to iPod's neat, organised style

<Title>Efficient and Practical
<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I bought this item, I already owned an iPod Video 30 GB, and a Samsung mp3 player which was XM-Radio compatible and allowed me to play and save XM songs and programs to it.  What I needed was an mp3 player that was compatible with Napster to Go, an online music service which allows you to record a large majority of the songs Napster offers to a compatible mp3 player for a low monthly price.  After researching the reviews on Amazon.com of those models, I chose this one because it did not suffer from the numerous problems some of the other brands/models had (no ni-cad battery, poor battery life, poor user interface, poor design/breaks easily).  I bought a refurbished model, but you never would have known that it was used because there was not a scratch on it.  I managed to drop it onto my floor within the first two minutes I had it, but it didn't cause any damage.  The player is built solidly, and has no external moving parts other than the power/Hold switch.  The screen of the player is smooth and colored black, kind of like those smooth black cooktops.  The player functions are controlled through the touch screen, which is incredibly sensitive and reacts to the lightest touch.  For this reason, it's good that there is a Hold/lock switch so that you can keep from inadvertently changing the settings while listening to the player.  I would also recommend buying a plastic screen protector to keep it from getting scratched.  The bonus part of it having the smooth touch screen is that there are no potentially breakable buttons, gaps to get gummed up, or switches to give out after any significant use.  There were no special frills, other than the external speaker, which works very well.  It is loud enough for others in the room to hear it, and has good clarity.  I have not heard a "tinny" sound that some other people have described.  Although it isn't the same as listening to music through a nice speaker system, it will do adequately if you don't have that available to you.  Also, you always have the option of using your headphones.  The interface on the player is easy to use, and you will quickly be able to locate all of your music on it by searching by artist, track name, album, or music genre.  You can even develop your own playlists.  My player was easily compatible with Napster, and I didn't even bother installing the Samsung interface, because I didn't plan on using it.  Songs were transferred to it through a simple drag and drop interface.  The only issues I had involved Napster's software, but this was easily cleared with the help of customer support.  The player has not had any problems.  The only negative is that there are not a lot of options available for you to choose the type of output sound you are looking for, like you would do to control your treble and bass with an equalizer.  They have five options (Normal, Vocal, Bass Boost, 3D Sound, Concert Hall), and at least one of these will probably work out okay with the kind of music that you are playing.  Also, if you choose an artist and are listening to their songs, and shut the player off, when turned back on it will revert to playing songs in alphabetical order by all artists on your player.  It doesn't remember that you were listening to that artist.  Overall, this is a nice little player if you aren't paying a fortune for it.  I think that there may be some better choices if you are looking to spend a significant amount of money.  However, for me, I got the player and an extended warranty for a very low price, and the refurbished item works better than some brand new electronics items I have purchased.  The player is compatible with several online music sources (Rhapsody, Yahoo! Music, Napster), and it consistently works without complaining.  This is a good buy!  I highly recommend it!

<Title>hard to get started, but an awesome player
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After perusing Amazon for MP3 players to buy, I decided on this refurbished 2-GB Samsung K5 for around $90.  After ordering it, it arrived in about 3 days.  I was so excited, that I began to charge it immediately. After disconnecting it from charging, I realized that to turn it back on, I had to hit the reset button on the back.  Nowhere in the QuickStart Guide did it say you had to do that, so that's one thing you need to know about this player.  We also had a very tough time trying to load the Samsung Media Player.  They say that the player comes with an installation disk, but all I got was the User Manual.   We ended up sending the player back at our expense, and they sent me a new refurbished one. The same thing happened with it, too.  My mom then called Dell to see if it was a problem with our computer.  We spent over an hour with the Dell supervisor installing the Samsung Media Studio, installing firmware to my player, and installing a Windows Media Player upgrade.  After that, I tried ripping CD's to the computer then synching the songs to the player. I found that the Samsung Media Studio was so hard to use.  I went around in circles.  I then called the Samsung Customer Care number.  They said that using the Windows Media Player is a lot easier.  I tried it and it worked beautifully.  I ripped CD's to the computer, then easily synched them to my player. Now I have music on my Samsung K-5 after a lot of problems.  I have to say that you might come across these same problems.  If so, call your computer manufacturer and they could help you.   I also want to say that I love the player even though I had a rough start.  The sound is great, even from the pull-out speakers, though the included earbuds kept falling out. I ended up buying a better pair. I really recommend this player, though the starting out process may be daunting. I haven't gotten the "up to 30 hours" of play time using the earphones, but maybe that was an exaggeration.  I get about 2-3 hours for each battery segment without using the pull-out speakers; that uses a lot more battery juice.  Using the great audio sound effects like bass boost or concert hall also uses more battery power.  It doesn't say that in the manual, either.  Using the player in "normal" operation is the best and most efficient. The touch screen is cool, though it does hold your finger oil. I solved that by using a digital camera cleaning cloth which easily removes the fingerprints. The FM radio is cool. I found that you can use the pull-out speakers with the radio, but you have to leave the earphones plugged in; they act as an atennae. Over all, I say this player is a good buy even though the starting-out process may contain some problems. It has FM radio, picture uploading capability, screen savers, and more. Once you get everything worked out in the beginning, the player is a great campanion!

<Title>A great player that could have been perfect.
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice little player with a lot of cool features but has a few flaws that if fixed would make this a nearly perfect player. For only a 2GB capacity you can stuff hundreds of songs on this player (I use WMA at 192kbps) which makes for hours and hours of listening. And transferring music files to the player is fairly quick. The FM radio feature is really nice too. Station presets let you zip through four favorites easily.  The player also has a clock and alarm which allows you to program a favorite track to wake you up. Battery life is far better than I expected.  I can go two days sitting at work listening to my music and still have a bar left on the battery life indicator. The user interface is intuitive - very easy to navigate through the menus. Audio playback is of good quality when listening using a quality set of headphones or earbuds. The earbuds that come with the player are too heavy on the bass which makes the music muddy sounding. The built-in speakers have a decent sound.  They're probably as good as speakers you would find on a laptop PC although being set so close together there might just as well have been one.  What kept this player from being perfect? It's all in the details. The OLED display lags behind the audio playback when viewing the bar graphics. And the alternative visualizations are not music reactive.  They just march to the beat of their own drummer. The external speakers could have been omitted or reduced to just one small speaker that would still have allowed for the alarm clock function.  For the size of the unit I would have preferred more memory over the speakers. While audio playback is of good quality this player exhibits a playback flaw that is just plain annoying.  When listening to albums where the end of one track carries over to the begining of another there is a pause as the player reads the track end/start markers.  A good example would be listening to Operation:Mindcrime from start to finish. What's worse is that once the next track starts the first half second of audio is cut out. Charging the unit with the USB cable takes FOREVER and you can't use the player except for synchronizing!  It would have been better if a wall adapter was included and charge times were faster. I see no way to replace the battery pack (someone correct me if I'm wrong) which means that when the batteries start to lose their ability to keep a charge the unit itself becomes trash.  That's just totally unacceptable.

<Title>A Great "Little" K5
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the K5.  I know "little" is a relative term and as far as other MP3 players go it may not be the slimmest or lightest but I think that if you can live without video, for what you do get and the versatility it is overall the best in this price range!  Very easy, user-friendly interface, I am not a computer or gadget whiz but I had this machine up and running with music and pictures in less than 1/2 hour.  The controls are so easy the user manual is almost not needed at all.  The speakers are great for a player this small and they let you still enjoy the player without being "hooked up"; the sound through the headphones is very good too!  And as far as I am concerned an FM radio is always necessary. A big added plus is the alarm, this thing is great to travel with.  Picture quality is not the best but definately adequate and the only thing I could ask for is time display. However, for what you do get and great battery life, you cannot go wrong.  Highly recommended.

<Title>The spakers are great
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just received this MP3 player for Christmas and really like it. Being a little older, I am not engrossed with my music as when I was younger. I find myself not using the headphones that much. All of the functions work well and the preveous  reviews cover these items very well. The headphones are the antenna for the FM radio so leaving these plugged in when listening to the speakers is not a big deal.  The sound with the headphones are great and the speakers are very acceptable knowing that they can not produce the sound (especially bass) of a boom box. I have used the speakers at work (on low), and at a party and working around the house. They  work great for this and I enjoy them a lot. If you won't use the speakers, then there are other models with the same or more features for less money, but I really do like the speakers. My friends and co workers are impressed.

<Title>perfect for traveling 
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am a massage/physical therapist; I work with people in their homes. I use music during the sessions and was tired of lugging around a boombox and cds. I was looking to get an ipod and speaker dock/attachment but it turned out that to get the quality of sound I wanted, I would end up with a player that is the same size as a boombox. While searching, I came across the K5 with built in speakers and decided to get it. I am very pleased! Tiny & light, great sound, easy to use, good quality construction and the Samsung software is designed much better than itunes. I got a fm trasmitter and use the K5 listen to books on my car stereo while driving. Again great sound and ease of use.
