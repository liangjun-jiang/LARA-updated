<Title>Don't buy - terrible sound quality

<Content>Basically this unit sucks. Output per channel is only 4 mW. Was going to listen to it when I ride my bike but ambient noise completely drowns out the music! It was a replacement unit sent by Nextar after my MA-201 LI battery died two months after purchase. The MA-201 puts out 10mW per channel and had much better sound. Don't buy this unit, it is a rip off!
