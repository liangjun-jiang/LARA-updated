<Title>Great but needs a little improvement

<Content>I couldn't find any (non-photo) reviews of this media player, but it appeared to be best buy relative to current media players.  I recommend it as a all around media player even though it's not perfect.   It is very useful as a music player, video player, audio and video recorder, file transfer, image preview, CF card (RAW and jpg) download, etc. I love how it folds up, providing a built-in stand and screen protection. It makes traffic and work bearable. Spend a little more to get the 80 GB!  However, there are a few issues to be worked out. 1. A firmware update is needed so that I can view the video files with the latest software out--I couldn't get ANY video files (new and older ones) to play. You have to find the OLD Dr. DivX (DivX 3, 4, or 5)! However, don't expect to be able to get the TV to play the converted DivX files with tolerable quality. But LCD is great.  2. The interface gets old quick--one must navigate thru menus by repetitively pressing buttons.  Shortcuts are needed to go straight to the main menu, and to like go straight to a song list (bypassing the CF option when there is no CF card and non-music files, and straight to song file).   3. Finding a certain song and editing the playlist on the Flashtrax is very cumbersome. I still haven't figured out how to change file order except by removing the file and returning it one at a time using a computer. Moreover, it organizes itself oldest to newest, not alphabetically like the computer. 4. A radio antenna would be help!! So would a remote. And some games would be over the top. 5. There is no "on" light.  When it is actively playing the amber light flashes, but I often accidently leave it on draining all power because I didn't realize it was on when screen is black like when it's hooked to the computer.  Customer service--very prompt and responsive.  If you keep at it with them (and Google), you will probably get any issues resolved one way or the other.  While it may not the smallest or well-known media player, it does everything a media player should do and then some!  The interface is easy to figure out, if a bit cumbersome. Once you figure out the quirks (and all media players appear to have some), you won't be sorry, especially with 40-80 GB! I find it fun and very useful.

<Content>It is a great item except it will not accept cards of more than 1G. It chokes on anything larger. I was assured by the company it would work with my 2G cards, but it does not.  While talking with technical support they revealed the unit will not work with anything larger than 1G. It will sometimes work with a 2G card, but rarely.  If you use nothing larger than a 1G card the product is great.

<Content>I really am excited about this purchase.  Even writing about it makes me smile.  I gave it only four stars because of the weight, otherwise it is easy to operate, easy to trasfer images and music.  I  also like the radio feature.  A great device to store pictures when on holiday!

<Content>A very basic tool to review & store images in the field when you don't have access to a laptop (or don't want to carry one). Downloading pictures is easy and quick. Transferring them to my desktop is a snap. Large viewing screen is a plus. I have not and don't plan to use the recording feature. I needed a compact unit to load my 4 gig cards to so I could reuse them during my shoots and it works perfectly for that reason.

<Title>I am still SMILING!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>I got this last month (November) & I am having a ball with it! One upgrade I would like to see is a "VIDEO" icon in the main menu. If this is possible, the videos can be streamed (ie. played one after the other without having to manually select & start the next one)as is done in the "MOVIE" menu.  All in all this is a great device.One regret I have is not purchasing the 80GB!  Any new upgrade on the horizon? Last one was dated 2005 (system upgrade 0070).

<Content>I picked this item up to use as a photo dump for vacationing. Really liked the ability to read RAW camera files. Picked up a cf to xd adapter so i can dump photos from my camera's xd card with the touch of the copy button. If you were to run out of tape in your camcorder you could hook it up to this and record direct to the hard drive. Not to mention the use of watching movies and listening to music when traveling. With the help of a program called clonedvd mobile i was able to transfer 20 full dvd movies to this device using up only 9 gb of space! The headphone out sounds great with a decent pair of headphones. External speaker is ok, but keep in mind it's basically a mono speaker setup. Use headphones!   I've read some concerns of hard drive failure, but with some research online i found a few step by step guides to replacing a dead 40 gb drive with up to a 120 gb regular laptop hard drive with zero modification! The unit comes with an internal mic for recording which i modded to accept an external mic to use as a field recorder. It is suprisingly decent in the recording aspect. Records from mic, a/v source, or radio. Truthfully i have found the radio pretty useless but it does have one. Lion battery is not built in so when it dies you just pop the old one out and order a new one. Try that with an ipod!   Overall it is a great product that i would definately purchase again! The only reason i didn't give it a perfect 5 stars was because of the radio feature....which i personally don't care too much for anyway.
