<Title>Best iPod with one problem
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this because love the color scheme of this iPod (Red and Black!) but I don't really want the autograph signings of "U2" on the back because then I feel like they're judging my music or even are loaning me their iPod or something (I bought it) and my favorite music is not "U2". I bought fine grade sandpaper (small grit) and gently worked their signatures off, which only took a few hours, and then after a few more hours of sanding with increasingly finer grades of sandpaper and ultra-fine steel wool and then buffing with cheesecloth for smoothing it all out, it looks almost like normal! Now I have the "bomb" looking iPod. I put one U2 song on it just for Karma, but I never listen to it. Get this now, and the sandpaper is available at Hardware stores (get the small grit kind).

<Title>Love it
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This iPOD plays back video, but in a special format (MP4); and yes, you CAN see the video on your TV, just buy the A/V cables & in video settings choose "TV OUT" option. Everything you would expect from Apple and iPOD. Can charge from the wall outlet but with an adapter sold separetly. Gets soiled very easily with the touch of your hand, but it comes with a special pouch that can help keep it clean. Defective wise...well..3 months with it and no problems yet...

<Content>Okay, so this is my first ipod, which means I may be somewhat easily impressed. Regardless, I'm VERY happy with my purchase. My only complaint would be that I don't think the battery lasts nearly as long as advertised. Other than that, it rocks!

<Title>Woke up from where I was
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great.

<Title>NEVER BETTER!!!
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the U2 5.5 generation Ipod and I've been enjoying it ever since. I've gone through 4 ipods (all great) but none quite like this.  It has a unique touch to it and a nice big, bright screen.  I have never liked an ipod this much. Works great too!  It is a fingerprint magnet, however.  Get a case. I recommend a metal or Aluminum one between $15 and $20.

<Title>What an aggravating little machine this is! iFlop is more like it
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK first of all, I've always had high regards for Apple products because they are artsy and functional. I purchased the 60GB and a very expensive Vaja case for it. I was so proud of my new ipod.  Little did I know that I am just a pawn in Apple's plot to take over the world by controling the entertainment industry.  FIRST of all, the reason I bought this was for video. Then to find out what a pain it is to convert a DVD over. I have to run Decrypter and then Videora. This takes forever. (To be fair you have to do the same for all the other players.) (And it is easier to convert tv shows from my ReplayTV DVR since no Decryptor is needed.) BUT why do I have to convert to begin with. Why couldn't they have made it more automatic? I actually bought a video from itunes just to make sure the dang thing worked to begin with. SECOND, I purchased a new computer and had to go through 12 pages of instructional garbage that I printed from the Apple website to get my files over to the new computer. CREATIVE which is superior to Apple ipod in EVERY WAY!, does this like one would expect, plug the Creative unit into the new computer and it's done. This is all part of Apple attempting to control how and what I listen to AND mostly control my library. Under itunes, you can register up to 5 computers. How dare Apple restrict how many computers I'm allowed to use with my ipod. If I want to plug my ipod into another computer to get a file, then I should be able to do it plain and simple without the Apple police out to shut me down every time. Just more fuel for the fire in my opinion. THIRD and by far my bigest complaint. WHERE IS THE CUSTOM EQ SETTING? Dear Apple I hope you are reading this, please let me select my own eq settings. All yours are terrible. The 1K frequency range is set too high so my music distorts easly. Too many years have passed by to justify your lack of this option. OH AND BY THE WAY, CREATIVE HAS A CUSTOM EQ SETTING! I know what you citizens are thinking, how can Apple NOT have this feature. Does this reviewer know what he is talking about? Well for those of you who doubt me, go to http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61567 So what does this all mean? As a matter of fact, right now I'm listening to mp3 music on my headphones at work as I type this. At the end of my headphone cord is not my ipod but my laptop computer. Plain and simply IT SOUNDS BETTER then my ipod ever did or ever will.

<Content>Who doesn't like iPod's? I got this one to replace a 4G ipod that was giving me problems. And U2 is one of my fav bands, so why not getting it. Isn't that expensive as it was a couple of years ago and I already use iTunes for my music, so its all fine. Also really good to carry files as an external hard drive. Excellent for traveling or when in the bus. A must have I would say.
