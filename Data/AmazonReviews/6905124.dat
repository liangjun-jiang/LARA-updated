<Title>Love it
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well I am totally in love with this since giving up my old vision m which I also bought and loved from amazon but it weighed me down too much and in came the sleek and tiny Zen. Only one fault I see so far the SD card I thought I would be able to integrate the memory card music with the ones on my zen but alas not the case. Maybe Creative will fix that with firmware update along with the video scale size. Vision M could play practically all my XVid videos which were mostly scaled larger than what the zen is capable of 320:240.  Outside of those 2 things it is a good contender against the ipod unfortunately marketing and popularity overshadows this incredible company and its products. A fan of Creative products forever

<Title>Man, the battery
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Mom and Dad got me this for my birthday [upgrade from my Zen Micro 6gb) I've got to say I love this thing; it has great sound, plenty of room for what I use it for, it has a great screen and a lot of extra features.  BUT it loses two stars because,  1. Even though I charged it all the way then drained it all the way when I first got it (3 times) it still won't hold a charge longer than 5 hours with the screen on 10% brightness, and no more than 7 or so with the screen off (on hold) Even though, the creative site advertises 30 hours with the screen off [on hold] (I didn't expect to get that much time, but, I did expect at LEAST 15 hours or more (with the screen off)) 2. It will occasionally freeze while Syncing with Windows Media Player (latest version) or while charging (It has happened often enough for to have learned to carry a paper clip with me to hit the reset button on the bottom)   Other than this problem, this IS a great player.

<Title>Best mp3/video player out there ! ! !
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The music sounds great and the videos look amazing, the screen size is perfect.  Even the video converter is reasonably fast.  All in all a great product and will not leave you disappointed.  It is worth it to by the screen protector and case because the piano finish does scratch easily and the screen will smudge.

<Title>Best flash player on the market, great even for large music collections
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great choice for those people who previously limited their flash players to workout duty, or only holding a small piece of their large music collection and having to change the music on it every so often. With a 16GB capacity most people can fit their entire collection on here without difficulty, and even have room for some videos.  First impressions of this player are very good. It is extremely appealing to the eye, everyone who sees it will ask about it. It is about the size of a credit card, just thicker (less than 1/2inch). The front is a very glossy black plastic that looks great until you touch it, instantly covering it with fingerprints :) The back is a rough, cheaper feeling black plastic. Overall it has a nice solid weight and feel to it, but not very heavy. This will easily fit in a pocket.  The 2.5" screen is absolutely gorgeous. Very bright with vivid colors. The viewing angle is very good, two people can easily look at the screen at the same time while watching a movie for example. The menus are all nicely animated and intuitive to navigate. The icons and text are big clear and easy to read.  One of the big perks to having so much capacity is plenty of room for videos. This was one of the first things I've tested as it was a big reason for my purchase. First of all it DOES play Amazon Unbox videos perfectly. Transferring files was very easy (just a few clicks) and very quick. The quality of the video was great as well. The max size of videos is apparently 320x240, I have not been able to get it to play anything larger than that. If the video is smaller (for example widescreen) you have the option of playing it at the correct aspect ratio, or fill the screen (stretched out). I've gotten it to play videos encoded in Xvid and WMV format. Xvid files were encoded with AutoGK, and the WMV files were encoded with Arcsoft MediaConverter. If you synchronize with Windows Media Player, you can put in *almost any* video file and it will automatically convert the file into WMV format and then transfer to the player. How long it takes to convert depends on the type of video you're encoding, how big the file is and of course the speed of your computer.  Music sounds very good on this player, but please... get rid of the stock headphones they are horrible. Using a decent pair of headphones makes a HUGE difference. The EQ options are OK, there are about a half dozen presets and a customizable EQ. The "Bass Boost" option just made it worse in my opinion, it just distorted the sound. Otherwise it is a very even and balanced sound, very similar to the Vision:M.   The FM radio has a whopping 32 presets and the reception is pretty good. Strong stations are in stereo, weaker ones come in mono. I haven't had a chance to test out the built-in mic.  I easily transferred music and playlists onto this player from Windows Media Player and MediaMonkey, as well as protected music (WMA) from Napster. Everything was very easy, usually just dragging and dropping. The speed of transfer is probably the fastest I've seen. I've used this player on XP Home and on Vista Premium 64-bit.  Regarding the SD cards. I think its only a slight inconvenience that the memory card media isn't directly integrated with the other content. Meaning if you have videos on the SD card you don't go to the "Video" menu where all the other videos are, you have to access them through the "Memory Card" menu. Once there, you browse through the file structure like normal. If you organize the content smartly on your cards you should have no problem. And really its a small price to pay for that feature. Currently SDHC cards are up to 16GB in capacity, meaning you could double the capacity and carry around 32GB worth of content in your pocket. Amazing. I tested a Kingston 512MB SD Card and a Kingston 2GB microSD card (with adapter of course) and they were recognized and played the content without difficulty.  A quick note about the firmware. Mine came with 1.10.05. When my player turns off, it really turns off. With newer firmwares when it turns off it goes into a sleep mode for a while before it finally turns all the way off. What that means is with the older firmware each time you turn it on it has to "boot" all over again, whereas with the newer firmware you get an "instant-on" at the expense of slightly reduced battery life (since it is asleep and not off). Something to consider before you decide to upgrade the firmware.

<Title>Faulty and had to send back
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this for my teenage son for Christmas. The one we received had a faulty processor or something and would not run videos properly (would skip and stall) and the videos would have poor audio.  I give 2 thumbs up to Amazon for the quick processing of the return.  The conversion time for putting the videos in Zen format was quite long too.  I replaced the returned Zen with a 30G Zune for my son (again from Amazon) and he's a happy camper showing me "See, this is how a processor SHOULD run a video!" for the ones the Zen had trouble playing.  Positives: small size, the size is much better than my bulky 30G Ipod. Is ours was defective and my son plays mostly videos with a few songs, I don't know how it'll fare for just music, but the size is a big plus.  Negatives: was how it ran my son's videos.

<Title>If you buy it you will have to deal with...
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>FIRST. The battery is the worst. Don't expect much from the battery. It last for me 1 or 2 days on my way to and back from school. It can be half when you turn it off and you turn it on the next day and it wont turn on because the battery is death. You need to constantly charge it because if you forget trust me you wont have battery the next day. I think my old played was way much better on that part. Because of this the clock will never be right and I am tired of changing the time every the time. The battery wont last for a long trip.   SECOND. The videos are very fast to transfer. But before the transfer occurs you have to convert the video to a different format and it takes FOREVERRRRRRRR to convert. Pictures and music are relatively fast. Videos are not excellent. The quality is good but the sound gets disturbed few times on different videos at the exact second of the video every the time you play it. Not on all videos but some and I don't want to re transfer it again after waiting so long for the format conversion. ANNOYING...    THIRD. The screen scratches so easily.    FORTH. The headphones it comes with are the worst and so big that hurts your ear.   FIFTH. Expensive. I made a comparison between this and the Ipod Touch and  found that the Ipod touch is so much cheaper for what it can do. The Zen is relatively expensive compared to other players.   SIX. It Freezes sometimes, not to much but it happens and you have to reset it and find a paper clip to push the button. If you cant find one then wait until you get one and by the way, once it freezes you can not turn it off so the weak battery will die.   Besides my six complaints is a good player. the battery is the worst trust me I have to say it again.

<Title>So far so good!
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just rec'd my zen last week and so far it has done all that I expected it to do. I have played music, videos and pictures on it and the sound quality (even with the cheap earphones) is great.  I didn't rate it a 5 star only because I haven't used all the functions yet and because I have not had it very long.  I did update the firmware and it worked fine.  Though, I did notice when I did it, that there are 2 versions of one of the software - one is for US and the other that is marked (Europe Only).  I am guessing that if someone downloads and tries to install both versions there may be an issue (this may be the reason for some of the zen's freezing after updating), so make sure you download & install the correct version based on your location.

<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well - the theory is great, the practice is not.  My Zen arrived "Dead on Arrival."  Creative suggested I send it back to Amazon.  The only saving grace of this entire experience was Creative's telephone support (free for 60 days) and Amazon's easy returns.  Someone explain that to my daughter on her birthday today. . .

<Title>Nice piece, but there are some issues
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player beats the crap out of ipod. It has FM radio, Microphone, SDHC card slot, plays itunes files, no need to have special software though it does have its own, and it costs less than a comparable ipod, not that there is one. I highly recommond this to everybody looking to purchase an mp3 player. There are two issues that I have come across and that is use on multiple computers, it give it a problem and it causes it to crash while plugged in. The other issue is that when I first got this it was crashing rondomly for a little while, just freeze up and I would have to reset. Not a problem unless you are driving or cannot find a staple to bend and use. It will do this freeze thing with video and music playback. Special with video playback is this stalling thing that it does, it will stop and have to be fast forwaded one second, as if it lost tracking. These issues have gone away after I stopped using multiple computers.

<Content>An excellent MP3 player.  I dropped my Zen Micro, and after looking at Creative's offerings, decided to go with the Zen.  Sound quality is excellent, ease of operation is the same as will the Zen Micro (very straightforward), and I like the big screen.  Battery life does not seem to be as long as advertised, but likely because I am not dimming the screen.  A nice MP3 player.

<Title>Great player, but has flaws...
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen 16 GB player after trying out many different players(including iPod and Zune).  I owned a Creative Zen Micro 6GB for 3 years, and it was very basic, but it did the job, until I dropped it!  Rather than send it back to Creative to get it repaired, I decided it was time to upgrade.  I read reviews about the Zen 16gb, and I was impressed with the amount of memory for the price, the ability to expand the memory(more on this later), and the different file types that it supports.  So it arrives and everything seems great, because Creative knows how to make a great player.  The players exterior does have a major flaw, the screen.  It's so sensitive to scratches that it must be made out of the cheapest plastic possible.  I have never seen a screen get so scratched up just from storing it in a pocket!  So I wish I would have purchased the screen protector(even though I think it's ludicrous to pay 10 dollars for something that Creative should have addressed in the first place), or some sort of case.  I KNOW that other makers(Apple/Microsoft) have much better screens on their mp3 players, so I don't understand why Creative went the cheapo route!  Another issue is the expandable port.  You are able to add more memory with SD cards, which are as big as 32gb, these days.  This was very exciting to me, even though the memory from the card doesn't integrate with the memory in the player.  After I bought the player, I was reading reviews of other players, and apparently one of the newer Sansa players also has a SD card slot, but it DOES integrate the card with the player's memory! Doh! Had I known this prior, I would have definitely bought a Sansa player, rather than Creative.  Creative should have addressed this problem before they released it, as well!  Other than those problems, I love my mp3 player.  It's small and light, and I like what it brings to the table, overall.

<Title>Slick Little Player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a very slick little player. It is very small and light, not much bigger than a credit card. It uses flash memory instead of a hard drive, which eliminates many problems I have had on previous players. I've only had to reset the player once. Battery life is very good. I have no idea whether it meets the battery life claims of the manufacturer, but it can be used extensively for at least two days without needing a charge. Transfer of files into the player is simple and can be accomplished using the mfr. software, Windows Media Player, or by dragging and dropping in Windows Explorer. I have tried all three and all work easily. Transfer is fast also. The quality and clarity of the screen is excellent. I have not put on any movies or other video because of a lack of interest in such usage, but photos look very good. The 16 gig capacity is good, and the SD card slot allows more storage. The only difficulty is that you must access SD card storage through the memory card menu instead of the music menu, which restricts your usage of those items somewhat. Navigation is also easy. I have read that some prefer the touch pad on the Zen Vision M, but I used it on my son's unit and hated it, even on low sensitivity. I prefer the one on this unit. I have had no problems at all with the player. My disabled son used it a great deal while his player was being repaired and he was unable to kill it. He has killed 8 iPods, 4 Dells and 1 Creative, so this is a very good durability sign. In fact,our experience with Creative is stellar. This is a very nice, high quality player at a very appealing price. I highly recommend this unit.

<Title>16gb works for me!!
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my 16gb for about a month now. I use a Toshiba laptop running Windows Vista and haven't had any problems at all. I did update the firmware as suggested by Zen. My only complaint was the battery life. What took me awhile to find out about was the battery saving feature. I play it at work on random play all day. I was getting about 11.5 hours with the screen turned on. I found out that if you put the player on hold the screen will disappear and save battery life. After that I now average 18 hours between charges which is reasonable. I think one of the main problems is the lack of a good manual which should be included in the box. This would assist in the setup of your new player. I urge Creative to invest the extra quarter in the manual which would probably eliminate many of the problems listed in all the reviews. You shouldn't have to spend hours on the internet to get it up and running. Overall I rate it as an excellent player. Use a Palm screen protector cut to size to protect the screen. Hope you enjoy your new ZEN, I do!

<Title>Great player, my second Zen
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second Zen purchase.  I use Napster To Go, and the Zen is the best player in my opinion for that service.  My first player was a Zen Micro 4GB purchased about 3 years ago.  Both have performed superbly.  The new 16GB Zen is awesome.  The screen is so clear it's scary.  I really like the player too.  It has a huge capacity, great battery life, and another plus is that it charges off the same charger as my Moto Razr phone (they both charge with mini-USB).  The only thing I don't like about it is that the screen gets fingerprints on it often, but it's nothing that can't be overcome.  Also, the battery cannot be removed, so if the battery fails later on, I guess I'd need to buy a whole new player.  So, in short, I love the new Zen.  Its the perfect player for my needs, and the 16GB capacity lets me put all my favorite tracks on there with room left over.

<Title>Nice player
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use Windows 2000, and that operating system is not supported whatsoever by this product.  You MUST HAVE XP or VISTA to make any practical use of this product!  Perhaps there is a statement to this effect somewhere in the product description, but I didn't see it and I was a bit bugged by the revelation.  I plan to install a second hard drive in my computer and load XP on it just so I can use my ZEN.  I have loaded many MP3s on my ZEN using a friend's computer and this thing works great.  The sound is much improved by getting some better earphones for it.  I bought some Creative EP-630 earphones and I think these are an excellent choice.  Considering that you can spend $300 for earphones if you want to, the EP-630s are an excellent bargain.  If you want to get a leather case for your ZEN, be sure to consider the one from PCMICROSTORE.  Amazon goofed (I think) by putting this case in the "Apparel" catagory.  All of the other ZEN accessories are listed under "electronics" and it took a little effort to find this case/accessory kit.  Check out my review of this product if you're interested.  I highly recommend it if you're a leather-case person.  Getting back to the ZEN, the functionality is virtually identical to an iPod, and there is no difference in the sound quality if you use the same data rate and earphones.  That little wheel gadget on the iPod is very nice and is the only reason I can think of to buy one instead of a ZEN.  The ZEN will not destroy the files on its host computer like an iPod will if you're not careful.  That alone is reason enough to choose just about any mp3 player over an iPod in my opinion, but most people buy whatever their TV tells them to.  The ZEN is very flexible in terms of its storage and retrieval options, and I found it very intuitive and easy to use.  The display is large and bright enough, and the buttons are spaced conveniently and are large enough for my chubby fingers.  One of those wheel things would be a big improvement, but apparently those are proprietary to Apple products.  That's too bad.  As far as I can tell so far, the ZEN is functionally equivilent to an iPod nano, sounds every bit as good, is considerably less expensive, and is more "open" in terms of available accessories and media compatibility.  If you're trying to choose between a ZEN or an iPod, that decision was an easy one for me.    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00110O5UY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6954301-3468444">PCMICROSTORE Brand Creative Lab Zen Small Wonder 4gb 8gb 16gb Premium Leather Case Cover with Video Stand and Swivel Belt Clip - Bundle with 12v Rapid Premium Car Charger and Home Travel Wall Charger</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LVIC58/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6954301-3468444">Creative EP-630 - Headphones ( in-ear ear-bud ) - black</a>

<Title>A Great MP3 player, despite a few glitches
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to wait a month before doing my review, since it often takes that long for issues to surface, and my opinions to solidify.  Just so you know, I only use my ZEN to play MP3s.  I don't store pictures on it, and have no desire to watch videos on a tiny little screen (although the image is remarkably bright and sharp, with fantastic color depth).  Having said that, this is a GREAT MP3 player!  Noise levels are incredibly low, and the EQ settings (both presets and custom) guarantee a sonic experience that will be pleasing to almost any ear.  I like bass, and this unit can certainly deliver (with the right headphones).  Here's what I like: -	Great sound! (See above) -	No moving parts.  Completely solid state player with no disc drive, which should decrease vibration susceptibility and increase unit life. -	Lot's of storage space.  I have 834 MP3 files downloaded, with almost three forths of my memory leftover. -	Reliable operation:  My unit was shipped with OS ver. 1.10, which gave me headaches.  It would sometimes hang when connected to my computer, or even when just turning the unit on.  I had to reset it several times.  But ever since I upgraded to ver. 1.20.02 several weeks ago, it has been rock solid!  I have downloaded to it, uploaded from it, and played it for hours at a time with no problems whatsoever. -	Long battery life.  I haven't tested how long it lasts, but it seems to go for hours and hours without needing a recharge. -	Connector placement:  All the connectors are on the unit's side, allowing all cables to be routed next to each other in my car (ahh, it's the simple things in life...).  Here's what I wish was better: -	User interface:  Button functions and menus took me a little while to get used to. -	Software gremlins:  Syncing album artwork to the music sometimes gets messed up.  For example, whatever "Greatest Hits" album is playing, it will show the album cover for Styx "Greatest Hits". -	Construction:  The tactile feedback from the buttons and switches makes me wonder how long they will last.  Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, since I am an engineer used to working with expensive lab equipment.  Incidentally, the "5 in 1 New Creative Zen Kit" with AC charger and car charger (also available from Amazon) is a GREAT accessory, worth every penny!

<Content>I had it for about a week.  Had to reset it 20 times.  Sending it back.  Previously I had a samsung 5GB mp3 player.  Never had this kinda problem or any problem for that matter.  I plugged in headset into the device and the screen went blank (white).  There was no volume and the function buttons stopped working.  I then attempted to reset the device, that did not work.  I had to let the device sit for about 30 min and it began working again.  Then I went to Creative's website thinking this was perhaps a software problem.  After updating the software (which the version was already current) the problem continued.  Could not find a tech support telephone number on Creative's website.  Finally I contacted Amazon and they are sending me another one.  After sleeping on it, I want a refund instead.

<Title>Best MP3 player I have owned
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Over the past 5-7 years, I have bought 3 or 4 MP3 players, with varying degrees of satisfaction. This is by far the best one I have ever owned. The software interface and button layout are extremely intuitive and easy to operate. No touchpads, but rather actual buttons that make a tactile click when you engage them. This unit is especially good for audiobook listeners like me, because you can set as many as ten bookmarks, and access them easily by programming a customizable button to open the bookmarks screen. Another real bonus for me as a 3-time grandfather is that you can also store and display videos and pictures on this unit, and they play and look great on the screen.

<Content>After going through two ipods in a span of 2 years, I got fed up with this toy and purchased a Zen. It is a powerful device and a hybrid of PDA, portable audio, and tiny DVD player. It is easy to use, has a great sound and video quality and it's just as small as an ipod. It is also itunes compatible. The only thing that prevented me from giving it a full five stars was the fact that purchased, and therfore copy-righted, songs from itunes cannot be downloaded. But I guess that is an itunes problem and not Zen's.

<Title>Freezing Issues please read for help
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As of 12/26/2007  Upgraded Firmware on website. Upgraded all software on website.  PROS:   Good display - Nicely menus - Conversion software - Cheap - Music Good Quality - Pictures seemed fine.   CONS:  Button on-off seems weak like it will fall off in a few months.  Video Problems - Freezing - Must have everything convert using the software to put into the player's format (wmv) prior to use.   Found the problem for freezing in following.  If you convert any of following formats you could get a freezing issue no matter what you do when using the device so pay attention to what I tried.   How I tested I took a standard FLASH-FLV file which after converted plays fine on every player after converted.  Formats Tried: AVI - .AVI unknown codec version - worked find perfectly played even a large video converted fine.  Xvid - Mpeg-4 codec - .AVI - seemed unsupported  MOV - Quicktime - Converts and plays fine sometimes player gets out of sync with display but plays everytime.  Iphone - Video Mpeg-4 codec - .MP4 - Converts worked perfectly even syncs voice to video perfectly  WMV V.7 - I tried it worked on it was extremely jerky on video quality looked awful and the SOUND squeaked yes! squeaked!!!  WMV Unknown version Froze hard after about 15 seconds hard lock video.   Solution find formats Mpeg-4(Iphone), MOV over other codec before allowing the zen software to convert.  Believe me, I know what I am talking about. Strange thing the conversion software converts every video into some WMV codec and yet it can't import WMV without problems every version of WMV codec I tried failed to play correctly after importing.  It also locked up on me after about 10 days of use. I was pushing back and forth between a menu. When it locked up so bad player wouldn't even shut off with buttons, simply pushed a reset button in the pinhole at the bottom got me out of the locked up.  Also other reviews are claiming that the player has a bad SD memory card  setup, I however found this not to be the case the only problem I had with SD memory card situation is that when you load the files directly from the card it doesn't convert them to players usable formats.    Also the software that came with the player had a problem judging size of files. I had 6 gigs of music videos and it said the player was full even though after converting my videos down it was less than 300 megs worth of space. I had over 3 gigs left on the player and it said it was full and conversion just ended mid stream.  Creative could eventually fix this in a patch since it isn't hardware related.

<Title>Pretty cool, but ....
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for myself for Christmas.  I was real excited to get an mp3 player and researched the heck out of them.  The Zen got excellent reviews and so I made a purchase.  The unit is really small, which is good and bad.  I like it to fit into a pocket, but the buttons are small and when paired with neoprene case, they are difficult to use.  I like to wear ear buds, but the pair that comes with the Zen hurts my ear. The menu layout is goofy on the Zen and I played with customizing the menu, but I still didn't like it.  The volume does not have its own buttons.  This is weird and I had to set up a shortcut to the volume, which I thought was weird. The bottom line is ... be prepared to spend a lot of time setting this up to your own needs (which is a great feature).  I have a young baby and did not have time to dedicate.  Also, I consider myself very computer savvy, but could not figure out the menu hiarchy of the Zen.  I sent the unit back in less than a month and opted to use Windows Media Player on my laptop (which I always have)to listen to my music. -J

<Title>Surprisingly good sound, even for classical  (if you get the right earphones)
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As I listen almost exclusively to classical music, I never took much interest in MP3 players; hardly any serious music listener would cherish the idea of compromising a refined performance by compressing it into some lossy file format and then squeezing it through a pair of diminutive earplugs. On the other hand, however, these players are tempting gadgets, and of course there are ample occasions when it is nice to be able to take a sizeable portion of your favourite music with you in such a compact form.  Compact this Creative Zen certainly is. It is slightly smaller than a bank card, be it rather thicker. Though made of plastic, it makes a sturdy impression and doesn't feel fragile at all. The design is effective and nice - no contrived minimalism here, functionality is the prime object; yet the whole thing looks clean and uncluttered. There are real buttons that you actually have to push, which I prefer much to the slick but error- (and fingerprints-)prone touchscreens. The buttons, too, make this feel like a serious little machine. They are easy to use and respond quickly. This is matched by a well-considered menu-structure. You will find your way around soon enough - no manual needed. Better still, menus are customizable. You can select from a full list of options which items you want to appear in your main menu-screen, and in which order. I must say I would have liked it if this had been taken one step further, and itemnames too would haven been customizable (so that I could, for instance, change "Artist" into "Composer").   Albums, Genres and Artists are listed alphabetically and scroll vertically. If the list is very long you can use the alphabet on the right hand side of the screen to jump straight to the correct initial. Once a music track is selected, all relevant track and album info is displayed. Titles that are too long to fit the screen float by in ticker-tape fashion, which is nice, though the movement at times is less than smooth.  So how about the sound? Frankly, it is hard to say, as the sounds reaching your ear are at least fifty percent, if not to a much greater extent, determined by your headphones. As per usual the makers of the Zen put all their efforts into a well-designed player, only to ship it off boxed with an indifferent set of earphones. They look nice, and at first impression may not even sound too bad, with their deliberately warm colouring and exaggerated bass. But in fact the sound is grainy, unfocussed, fuzzy, and lacking in detail. I found results infinitely improved once I plugged in my set of Shure SE310 phones, even before they were properly burned in. Indeed, while I had purchased the player thinking I would use it for baroque and chamber music only, I now found that listening to Mahler's Fourth was not only viable, but quite pleasant. I must add though that I need to crank up the volume to nearly its maximum in order to get a realistic orchestral sound; and bass performance is still a pretty long way of from what I get through my regular stereo set, even with the "bass boost" option turned on and after fiddling with the equalizer. I should furthermore add that the surprisingly satisfying results were reached using the MP3 format at its maximum quality bitrate. That is, the aforementioned Mahler adds up to some 135 MB, and the storage capacity of the 16GB Zen will be exhausted with a 100 to 120 works of similar dimensions. Well, still a lot more than I could ever take with my CD-walkman... Finally, I should mention one irritant I encountered in playback: there is an audible electrical "click" when the Zen switches from one file to the next, which can get very annoying in pieces that play continuously but are broken down in tracks. Obviously, this is a problem that only classical music listeners are likely to encounter.  Next to the sound, the rest of it seems to me a collection of cute but fairly irrelevant perks. I cannot imagine anyone seriously wanting to view a complete photocollection, let alone watch an entire movie, on the tiny 2.5" screen. The screen has a clear, sharp image, but despite its many millions of colours is lacking in contrast so that pictures tend to look slightly washed out or overexposed. You can load one of your own images as a wallpaper, which is nice, though many wallpapers do not work out well due to the unnecessary, semi-opaque gray bars at the top and bottom of the screen. The screen cannot be switched off during operation (why not?), but fades to a low-lit setting after a customizable number of seconds. The lighting intensity of the screen can also be adapted to your own wishes, as so much else in this player can.  The Zen comes with a CD-ROM that installs software for getting media onto your player. Though a lot can be done simply in Windows Explorer, I found that the Zen Media Explorer is a quick and easy way to transfer files and rip CDs to the player. It did a better job of it than Nero and some CD-rip freeware I tried. If, however, you need to correct errors afterwards, say in a track title, the Media Explorer can't do that and you will need a tag editor like Mediamonkey. Rather more problematic is the fact that the Zen software will only let you rip CDs to WMA-format. If you want to rip to the better quality MP3 you will have to unlock that option by getting the "Creative Audio Pack" at an additional cost of 10 dollars - it will not break the bank, but I found that pretty disgusting nonetheless.  Finally, though there is actually a possibility to display an album's cover art, it is not made easy to achieve this. The (generally poor) manual doesn't have a word on it, and while the Media Explorer includes an option for adding artwork, you have to follow an obscure route to get there, in my case only to find that it didn't work. Use Windows Media Player to rip and synchronize, however, and artwork duly appears on your Zen's screen.  In all however, a worthwhile possession, quite a gem in some ways; and soundwise I am pleasantly surprised - but only after investing in a good set of earphones.

<Title>Quite a  nice little player.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked this mp3 player up because my old iPod Nano 4GB was out of space and I needed more room.  I didn't use iTunes at all and didn't really like the new iPod Nano anyway so I decided to look at the other options out there.  After comparing my choices I decided on this Zen and it arrived today.  I was able to quickly sync up all my music using Windows Media Player 11 and it was nice to not have to install any new software to get it done (it does come with software but I chose not to install it.)  Album art is displayed nicely as well.  This player sounds great and I find the user interface simple to get around.  The FM Radio is a nice addition and I was able to receive my favorite stations in the house with a nice strong signal.  I also updated to the latest firmware without incident.  As a runner the only thing I miss from my old iPod Nano is the Stopwatch feature - I checked the Creative forums and saw that others have requested a stopwatch be added and that request has been passed on to the developers  - so we'll have to wait and see if a future firmware update adds one or not.  As others have stated the "sync/charge" cable it comes with is extremely short so plan to spend a few bucks on another option.  Also Windows Vista identifies this as having only 15 GB of space - I doubt this is specific to Creative but it might be important information for anyone that was actually planning to cram 16 GB of stuff on to it.  Overall I'm happy with the purchase and although this isn't as thin as my old iPod Nano it is going to replace it nicely.

<Title>The Zen ROCKS, all others pale in comparison...
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I first bought a Zen Vision M 30gig last year for my son for Christmas. He has absolutely LOVED it since day one. It plays nearly every format of video, something the Zune and Ipods don't, has an FM receiver, mic, multiple EQ settings, etc and the software to get everything where it needs to be is easy to use and not bloated up with unnecessary junk.   Along comes this new Zen and I bought 2 for Christmas for my daughters. The new Zen is smaller, easier to control (although the Vision M was still easy...)and does everything the previous version did! The major difference here is the drive size. The previous Zen Vision M came in 30 and 60 gigabyte versions and the new ones, due to all being strictly flash driven instead come in 2,4,8,16, and 32GB sizes. (The 32gb version just came out.) The beauty of this is you can get one that fits your budget AND you can also add in more memory with the SD card slot! For my younger daughters I only purchased the 4 GB versions, knowing IF they every filled them up I could easily add in an SD card to give more space.   These are simple to update, simple to load, sound great, video's look amazing, and if you try and put video on there that isn't the right format a window pops open and converts it for you! They are also very small with a screen that's just the right size. 2 guys I work with both sold their Zune's and bought these instead.   If you want a great MP3, Video, and picture player you can't go wrong here.

<Title>great product but
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product 16GB, awesome sound over my previous SANSA 280 (though not as loud so I crank up the volume on my receiver). Additional features over Apple's products like voice recorder and radio and a terrific screen make it a much better choice in the features department.   What I didn't like was the face is acrylic and could scratch and some issues with freezing up that seem to have resolved themselves (I now copy music and videos and create playlists through the Zen software).  The SD card is not heavily utilized feature for additional music and vids, but came in handy several times for work and such to copy files over (I only have a 2GB micro SD in an SD adapter). I take one star off because durability of the player is in question (my sansa died in one ear when it was dropped 3 feet and required me to retrofit padding around the CPU portion of the card to get sound out of the headphone) without the acrylic case, bought separately.

<Content>A great little player. The battery life is pretty good, especially if you're just listening to books or music. I watched around 6 hours of video and still had plenty of battery left to listen to some music.   I've put programs I recorded from TiVo onto it (requires the TiVo desktop software and the software that comes with the player.) I've got my music on it, which I can sync easily through Windows Media Player, but you can also use the included software to make your playlists.  I've put some Audible audio books, and the sound quality on these is great. (This did require an update to the Audible software on my desktop, despite said software telling me it was updated. Not the player's fault, though.)   The picture quality is fine, though I don't have any experience with any other players.   All in all, a great little player, and I highly recommend it.

<Title>Creative Shines Again
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been using a Creative Zen Touch now for 3 1/2 years, and absolutely love it.  The best part about it was that, even though I'm not a whiz at computers, I was able to pick it up, get it out of the box, and within minutes, start transferring music onto it.  I finally decided to get an MP3 player for my wife, who likes to listen to audiobooks a lot.  I bought her an IPOD.  Big mistake!  After an initial failed attempt at understanding the thing, it sat and sat for two weeks before I even wanted to get back to it...finally, a friend spent six hours with me trying to show me how to work it.  Ultimately, I learned roughly how it worked, but was far from satisfied, and rather frustrated by its limitations.  Suffice it to say, I returned the thing to Sam's Club and, after doing much research, settled on ordering a Creative Zen 16 G for her.  We have had it for not quite 48 hours, and already have music, audiobooks, pictures, and videos on the thing.  What a delight to hook it up and have it work so smoothly!  The software seems almost flawless, except that when you ask it to rip a CD to the computer and to the player, it only rips it to the player, and not to the computer...but this is easily solved by ripping to either/or, then transferring the ripped media to wherever you want it.  No problems other than this with the software.  It's not even a problem, but rather just a glitch that can easily be worked around.  Video conversion works seamlessly.  The radio works well, the mic recording works well.  If my Zen Touch broke down, I would buy one of these newer models for myself in a heartbeat.  Go Creative!  Unlike many reviewers of Creative products, I find the lack of a touch strip a bit hard to get used to.  But then again, we get so comfortable with what's familiar.  The overall package of the new Zen is far superior to the old Zen I have...and of course way, way superior to the IPOD.  Great going, Creative, with this solid state, versatile, sturdy little gadget!

<Content>I have had other creative players but this one by far blows them away and the best aspect is that it starts playing the minute I power it up. I will reccomend the screen protector, especillay for a screen this size. This player is easy to navigate and easy to load music, I basically do drag and drop and I'm ready to go. My last player was a Sansa E280 and it froze up a lot and I couldn't organize music the way I wanted to to, that is no longer the problem with this unit. The price is very reasonable for 16gb of Flash Memory, you can't go wrong with this player.

<Title>My week with ZEN
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'll start by saying that I have issues with things that don't work as described right out of the box.  Whenever I have to spend time and effort to bring an item to its advertised features and functions, I get concerned.  The ZEN has a strong feature set but some don't work without substantial tinkering.  A complete description of what might be available can be found in the product listing here or on the Creative site.  Below is my experience.  My first adventure started with the A/V being out of sync.  The included software (the latest and using the most current firmware for the player) resulted in a painfully slow conversion process to WMV that yielded a progressively out of sync video.  As the video ran, the sound would increasingly lag.  This led to my first workaround consisting of many hours of reading posts all over the place and downloading a half-dozen different progs.  I found one with a modest learning curve and in about six hours of experimentation, converting clips and such, that issue was put to rest: Research and related time invested, about 20 hours.  The device did not recognize sub-folders for organization/playback purposes nor existing .M3U play lists.  I could, however, create sub-folders but for personal organization, only.  I loaded my music through the mandated, included software and had to rebuild play lists within the device that already existed elsewhere.  Please note that this player keys to ID tags so, if you, like I, have ripped a lot of old vinyl albums, you'll have to spend hours building ID tags on the computer as you can't do it once the track is on the device.  Thus, if not done, album tracks will be out of sequence as the player re-sorts everything regardless of how you drop it into its storage.  Time invested in building ID tags, sorting tracks into sub-folders, creating new play lists from re-sorted sub-sub-folders, about 6 hours.  It did not act like your typical USB mass storage device.  I was not able to move files once on the ZEN.  I could delete them, only.  If I wanted to change the location, I had to delete and reload.  That proved to be an annoying inconvenience.  The files were regular MP3's and I can think of no reason why they were not allowed to migrate.  This, also, disallowed backing up the contents of the player when I had to reformat it...all gone, back to square one.  Several MP3's that I had exported to the player became corrupted.  There was nothing consistent about the files that may have contributed; seemed random.  I wasn't aware that they were corrupted until I was searching for a track that I knew was there but wouldn't play.  I had to browse all 800 or so tracks, delete, reload, rebuild play lists, etc.  There's quite a bit more that resulted in my returning the ZEN.  I had read the reviews and noted all the praise.  Where did I go wrong?  Well, I didn't read those stellar reviews well enough.  They seem to have an implied asterisk attached; works great once you jump through this hoop and that fire-ring.  Wow, how can you give something high praise when you have to spend so much time fixing it or conceding that half its functions don't work?  Perhaps it's all relative.  If so, about everything else must REALLY suck and this sucks less because of its beautiful screen and great sound quality.  I truly regretted that the function-frustration overwhelmed what could have been an ideal player.  Guess I'll wait a bit longer and hang in with my three year old 1gb MP3/4 player from god-only-knows where but has NEVER caused me a lick of trouble and the conversion software is fast and efficient enough to produce in-sync video.  Go figure.

<Content>Pro: size - small and light weight nice looking screen quality is excellent user interface is easy  Con: requires screen protector (creative doesn't give you one) short usb charge cable (impossibly short, but blackberry chargers work on it!) additional software required to rip mp3's (try mediamonkey) not intuitive to rip movies  quirky (see below)  I tried to move files from my old creative muvo player.  Once I figured out how to copy them successfully, the player would crash (lock up with black screen and no functionality, but still on).  I kept having to reset the player, again and again, to no avail.  I noticed that all my other files that I copied from compact disk did not crash the system.  When I deleted the transfered files, the player worked perfectly and continues to do so.  I'm guessing the firmware is buggy (both old and new).  There seems to be similar problems with a "white screen" that other reviewers have mentioned.  If you can't get yours to work, return it while it is still under warranty.

<Title>Compact, easy to use, good sound
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had a creative Zen M (30 GB) previous to this purchase. The Zen M hard drive finally failed after using it almost every day at work to listen to tunes. I was really impressed with the this Zen product size and durable appearance. The metal backing in stylish and protects the unit. The front nav buttons are easy to use but the menu configuration is a little cluncky. For example, you have to go back to the main menu to access different parts of the software (i.e. just from music to system setup). It would be cool if you could navigate with just a scrolling option rather than having to menu 'back' to the main page to get to where you want to go.   One small complaint is that I had this for about a week when I somehow scratched the surface of the screen. I don't know how it happened - i mean I didn't drop it or anything - so I feel the screen is succeptible to scratches. My recommendation is to buy a case with a screen protector.   Overall this is a great small mp3 player that I synch with Napster to get tons of music on it. If you can afford the 30G version go for it. I have yet to watch movies or videos but the screen resolution is good.

<Title>The Best Media Player I Have Seen
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Most of the reviews here got it right: the display quality is awesome and a 16 GB capacity goes a long way (not to mention the SD expansion capability).  Photos and Videos look great.  The software interface is beautiful and has the glass feel to it.  No need to install the included software: transfering music, photos, and videos is plug-and-play easy from Windows Media Player - just connect the device and drag-and-drop (album art is automatically transferred).  I owned a Sansa device and this one is magnitudes better in all categories.  Although I give the player 5 stars, everything around it gets about 3.  The USB cord is 3 inches long!, there is essentially no manual - you got to figure it out on your own, and any firmware upgrade may likely end in technical problems only to be resolved by obscure web-based articles that the avergage user may have trouble finding and using.  And I *really* do not like when companies bury their technical support phone number deep into an obscure help file located only on the CD.  However, if you can get through these things, the device itself is well worth the effort and you'll be very pleased.

<Content>Do NOT buy the Create Zen 16 GB MP3 player. Although it gets glowing reviews from journalists, they neglect to tell you about the tendency of this device to become useless when the firmware upgrade dies.My Zen didn't even last 30 minutes out of the package. First you install software, then update that software, then update the firmware. All seemed to go well until the Zen tried to reset itself after the firmare update.No joy. It's dead with no OS.

<Title>Powerfull MP3 player in a small package!
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First off let me say I bought this to replace a 30 gig Vision:M, I also bought a 80 gig Zune which I quickly returned and opted for a second 16gb Zen.  As of right now I own three 16gb Zens.    The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is there have been only a 2 or 3 incidents where i have had to hard reset, then resync because it messed up my playlists, that is the only issue i have had with the players and my guess is it will be fixed with a firmware upgrade at some point.  Anyhow, I was pretty excited to get a flash based player that was big enough to hold my music and photos, it loads album art instantly, which is something you can't really say about any of the hard drive players.  It's solid and well built, I opted for a screen protector and one of the rubber skins which i am very happy with.  Sound quality is really where the creative products shine, although the included headphones are nothing to get excited about.  Screen size and quality are very good, especially when you consider the player is the size of a credit card.  Battery lilfe is good, it's great if you lock it and shut off the screen.  I purchase the zen products because they sync easily with Windows Media Player, I actually like WMP so I rarely use the creative sync software.  It syncs quickly and uses a STANDARD USB cable, that's right no proprietary cable, which is again rare in any of the players on the market.  There's a lot of accessories available for the Zen's which I have found in the past to lacking for any non-ipod model, but I think we'll continue to more accessories for this little player.  Creative made a great decision adopting the flash based players early on and they are one of the very few with 16 gig+ players.

<Content>This replaced a Creative Micro Photo 8gb (micro hard drive) with which I was extremely pleased with for two years.  I bought the 4gb version of this player for may father's Christmas present, and I was so jealous I got myself the 16gb version.  This little device is incredibly versatile.  Plays mp3 with great sound (but buy better earphones), plays video on a great 2.5" screen, has an FM radio built in, microphone, and even has a slot for sd memory cards, something I haven't seen in a similar device.  I use Windows Media Player to manage songs (but need the supplied software to handle playlists).  I occasionally use a remote designed for earlier versions that connects via the headphones jack so I can keep it on a belt clip while exercising.  I wish the Creative software was better, but that's really not a problem.  It's a much better value than a similar iPod.  The only advantages iPods have over it is the abundance of accessories and easy integration with iTunes (can work around that).  I highly recommend this one, though there's already a 32gb version.  I expect in a couple of years to buy a replacement that's 64 gb or more and with bells and whistles I can only dream of (built in Bluetooth?) from Creative.  Remember, these are the guys who invented the iPod touch dial interface!

<Title>This is a fantastic product
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had it for over a month and love it.  I did upgrade the headphones (I got the sennheiser buds which are very good) so I agree with other users who have done the same.  In my case the provided ones didn't feel comfortable in my ears.  Sound is excellent   I listen to most types of music Video is excellent   I watched all three seasons of Battlestar Galactica from Unbox Features are excellent   I have really just begun playing with these but they all work as advertised.  I highly recommend this product.  I bought my daughter an iPod Nano 8gb for Christmas and I like it, too.  But I really don't like the iTunes interface which has behaved strangely on both my computers.  In the worst case it got into an endless cycle of 'restoring' the iPod . . .  In any case the player is also nice but lacks the expandable memory and has a smaller screen.  I might recommend that you hold out for the 32GB version which should be available.  But you won't be sorry you bought any one of these.

<Title>Finally....
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I used to have ZEN 8GB which had WSOD problem with the firmware 1.20.02 and I had to reset the player with a paper clip everytime I switched  it on, therefore I returned it to the store.(I did not purchase that one from Amazon, though)   However I did like ZEN's nice sound/video quality so I ordered 16GB to Amazon to try just one more time. I was indeed so afraid of WSOD when I  updated the firmware but it has been 3 days and has been working great without any problem.(no single freeze or WSOD happened for 3 days) Thank you so much Amazon! Amazon's shipment was also very prompt!  I love this small player and I carry it whenever/whereever I travel.  I strongly recommend this player and hope that those who is thinking  to purchase ZEN will get a good batch which is free from WSOD. If you happened to receive a bad batch and experienced WSOD, you can just return the defective one and try again.

<Content>Great product. Excellent size, excellent memory space, great features and is easy to use. This is my second zen, I had a 30 GB vision M and this is way better.  Only downside is the software which tends to get annoying when any files you have don't show up in the software the same way you have it labeled in your My Music. Other than that...excellent!

<Title>Worth every penny...
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm a techie.  Not really a super techie, but everything I own in the techological sense is a top brand or is one of the highest rated in its class.  When I buy something I want to make sure I'm getting the best I can for my money.  Anyway I needed to find a replacement for my iRiver H10 20 GB MP3 player that I bought 2 1/2 years ago.  It was actually the top-rated MP3 player in its class (go figure) when it came out.  Overall, it was way ahead of its time and served me great throughout its life.  For an MP3 player user, I'm pretty hardcore.  I worked on a cruise ship for 2 years and honestly used my iRiver at least 2 - 3 hours each day and took it everywhere with me.  It had its fair share of drops and eventually it was needing reset more often than it needed charged (battery life started at 16 hours, ended up at 4).  Anyway, in a perfect world I would be completely happy with a newer version of what I already had.    Unfortunately it didn't exist.  iRiver got known for making its Clix series and was focusing on much smaller MP3 players that were between 2 and 4 GB.  My old one was 20 GB.  I listen to trance music more than anything else and I honestly have at least 10 GB of trance music alone that I want to be on my player, so a bigger capacity is a must.  I also took a lot of good videos/pictures when I was on my cruise ship (in Hawaii) and wanted a device that I could use to share those with friends.  For listening on my own, I use Shure E3C headphones (which are absolutely amazing by the way).    My first choice was to get the Archos 605 WiFi player that just came out.  I figured it would solve all my problems.  I don't need to go into too much detail about what it promises but the device looked really neat.  I own a lot of DIVX movies and also thought I could just put them on the player (sized at 40 GB) and would be able to watch them whenever I wanted.  The battery life was rated at 13 hours for music and 5 hours for video.  The problem with the Archos is that it comes as a barebones sytem.  Everything extra you want it to do costs more, including watching your own movies.    I was under the impression that I could take videos on my digital camera and transfer them to my Archos media player and watch them like they were on my pc.  NOPE.  Ok so I have to convert them with the included software.  NOPE.  Nothing's included. I downloaded a sample program that converted files into any format you wanted but because it was a sample, there would be a watermark that would flash on and off the screen for the duration of your video that would only go away after you use the real program.  Couple this kind of program in with the already $300 you spent on the unit and you're on your way to making it a not-so-user-friendly machine.  Plus, when I took it to the office my first day of using it the battery barely lasted 8 hours playing music and showing minimal video.  It had some nice features and had some nice add-ons available, but overall was not worth it for me.  So I took that back to the store and was in the market for something new.  I started looking into the newest MP3 players.  That's when I saw the Creative Zen.  They had the 8 GB version of the Zen at Circuit City (where I bought the Archos), but they did not have the 16 GB version that I would want.  You can read the editor's review to find out all the actual specs, I'll just list what I like and don't like about it.  When I first picked it up I was amazed at how light-weight it was.  Another reviewer talks about how it feels like a pack of gum.  Well, he's right.  But that's actually a good thing.  It's VERY light-weight but also has a great battery life, seems really durable, and looks slick in its all black paint.  If you're working out with it in your pocket you may actually forget it's there.  If it accidentally falls out of your pocket it wont even rip the headphones out of your ear because it's too light.  So I think the weight is a good thing.    The included software makes it easy to put media on the device and it only takes about an hour or so to fully charge the battery.  Both pluses there.  At first I was disappointed that the battery life wasn't lasting as long as it said it would, which was around 20 hours or so.  I realized the screen would be dim, but still on when the music was playing and couldn't figure out how to turn it off to save battery power.  Turns out the only way (that I can figure out) is to lock the unit while it's on and that makes the screen black out but you can't even change the volume while it's locked.    Onscreen controls are real easy to figure out from the get-go and pretty self-explanatory.  It also took me a while to figure out how to get to the list of songs that were actually playing, instead of just the song that was playing.  To do that, you need to keep hitting the "enter" button when a song is playing.  First time hitting the "enter" button lets you rank the song, second time shows the album cover, third time shows all the songs in the list you are currently playing so you can pick another song without trying to find it on a random shuffle.    As far as the videos and pics are concerned, this little screen looks a whole lot better than I thought it would.  Yeah, it's small but to have all the other capabilities this device has, it's more than enough.  Oh, and with the video, it also doesn't play your DIVX movies or digital camera movies right out of the box.  However, this handy little thing comes with FREE SOFTWARE that will convert it for you. Any file, any size, converts for free.  Oh what a relief it is!  Sound quality is phenomenal and it comes with some preset equalizer settings which I also enjoy since I do have a large variety of music playing on the player.  Oh, and the Archos DID NOT have any preset equalizer settings.  I don't listen to the radio or use it for voice messages so I can't give any feedback for those yet.    It doesn't go without its faults though.  There are only a few gripes I have about it.  The main one is the need to put it in "lock" mode to save the battery power since you have no access to anything while it's in that mode.  Another gripe is the power cord that comes with it.  For starters, the cord is about 4 inches long and the device can only be charged through a USB port. So to charge it out of a wall you'd need to buy some kind of converter.  Charging is quick though, but that cord is so tiny.  Also, while the device is charging I can't figure out how to still be playing music.  That's about all the negatives I have about it.  I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend this unit to anyone.  I paid $250 for it and it's worth every penny.  Overall, I'd give it a 9.7 out of 10.  Hope this helps some of you.

<Title>Well rounded but not without its issues
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great aesthetics and interface: This is a very attractive player, both externally and on screen.  The form factor is brilliant - they have made very good use of the tiny volume that the player occupies.  The button interface is not in any way advanced, but with buttons you know what you are getting and they'll probably keep working for a while, so I'm quite happy with them.  I'm usually very picky about input lag, and there is a bit, but it doesn't interfere with operation at all.  They could have done with a dedicated volume control, or a 'return to now-playing' button, but the customizable button is great.  I've set it to chose a random album and this is fantastic for my drive to work: plug into cassette adapter, power on, push 1 button and it starts playing a random album (push again for a different album).    Sound Quality is not exceptional: First up, there is a known problem with wma playback - pops, crackles - but apparently Creative are working on it.  Sound quality overall I am not particularly impressed with.  Without EQ on the bass is overstated through my Sennheiser CX300s.  With the EQ on sound quality drops noticably compared to unfiltered.  I need more time but I believe I can detect some distortion as well.  My 5yo iRiver HP120 produces much better playback.  Having said that, it is not terrible, and I have kept the player (my iRiver still goes fine, otherwise maybe I would have returned it).    Battery life is no where near 25hrs: As mentioned elsewhere, the player doesn't totally power down when you ask it to.  For a couple of hours it remains in limbo - screen off, amp down (but not off - I can still hear hiss and some cpu activity noise), and computer mostly idle I'd assume... and battery still draining.  I've frequently noticed that the battery meter has decreased between uses.  This is quite frustrating and I hope there is a firmware fix for this being developed.  I've probably got 10-14 hours listening time out of a single charge (a guess), listening 1-2 hours at a time, whereas I feel if I'd listened constantly I would have got 20ish hours (judging by how slow the battery goes down while listening).    Other comments: The firmware upgrade is buggy.  It doesn't work with WMP11 installed as far as I can tell.  I had to downgrade to WMP10 which is ridiculous, but given that WMP is not one of my favourite apps I'm not too gutted about it.  Could well be WMP's fault in any case.  I haven't tried video on this yet, but the sample vids look good on the screen.  I haven't used the SD slot either but can see that SD cards would sit flush with the outside of the player, which is good, just don't buy one in day-glow-orange!  I haven't had it crash on me once during use (1 month), although it did die several times when trying to upgrade the firmware  Overall this is a good player, great size/design, reasonable but not fantastic sound, and decent battery life (with potential for much better).  I liked the small size, big storage capacity, and not having to worry about a spinning disc when I'm walking/driving/dropping my bag.  It delivers and I am happy with it, and there isn't another similar player out there that I wish I'd bought instead.

<Title>Not really impressed
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first mp3 player, and it was not as easy to use as I had hoped, but I did figure it out after a while - took more work than I thought it would. Also, it froze up on me while I was trying to rip cd's. I spent hours reading help pages, and finally just gave up. After a couple days I tried it again and then it worked fine. It died (black screen, completely unresponsive to me pressing buttons, no response when the reset button was pushed) on me one other time too - I think this happens when the battery runs too low. I plug it in for a couple days and then it turns on fine. The battery doesn't last anywhere close to what Creative claims - maybe half of what they say.   The volume could go louder. I read that other people also found this to be true, but after they purchased quality headphones (I priced what they recommended, well over $150). My $70 headphones have wonderful sound quality, but the volume isn't there.  The USB cord they send is about 3 inches long, which makes it completely useless with my desktop, unless I want to hang my Zen from it, which I don't think would be good for it. So I had to spend another $20 on a decent length cord.  The screen looks great, crisp and clear. Sound quality is excellent (not that I have alot of experience with what different mp3's sound like).  From the research that I did, the price at Amazon for this mps is very competative, and I have confidence in the products they sell. Shipping was prompt.

<Title>Nice Nano alternative for the price
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I meant to give this four stars but messed up and Amazon won't let me change it.  I recently lost my 4GB Nano and was frankly not too distressed.  I was very frustrated with iTunes(kept deleting my e-music files and losing tracks I ripped from CD's) and the capacity was no longer sufficient.  Also, tuning in to the FM broadcasts of TV audio at the gym required a separate device.  In looking for an mp3 with as much flash capacity as possible and FM capability I settled on the Zen.  The biggest Nano is 8GB and the 16GB iPod touch is twice the price.    The Zen is a nice package with a great price.  It's light, looks good, has good sound, capacity, expandability, FM, and video capability.  I downloaded a video from Amazon Unbox with zero problems.    It's not a perfect device for sure.  The unit is slower to start from standby than my Nano.  It has also crashed a few times requiring a reset through the small hole in the side of the unit.  The one time my Nano crashed I had to let the battery die so I could restart it.    I do not care at all for the included software, but have found Windows Vista Media Player to be a very capable and friendly interface.  I am thrilled I no longer have to deal with iTunes.  In short, the Zen is not as slick a device as the Nano, but there is really nothing in Apple's line up that gives you the features and capacity for anywhere near the price.

<Title>Very buggy and not intuitive
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had Creative flash mp3 players for years and found them to be very reliable and simple to use.  I wanted more capacity so I bought this one.  I was very disappointed in this mp3 player and returned it after a week or so.  It was very buggy--always just shutting off for no apparent reason and requiring me to reset it.  Also, I found the whole interface to be annoying and difficult to use.  It is especially annoying that one can't just adjust the volume--you have to scroll through a bunch of menus.  Bottom line: it just never worked right, and when it did it was buggy and/or confusing to use.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The reason I bought this one has two folds - 1. It plays Audible. I am an Audible user, my iPod went out of battery; I hate iPod becomes useless when the battery is exhausted, so I intended to try ZEN with MP4. Unfortunately, ZEN is buggy. 2. It has 16GB of built-in storage. But, you can't use it as a portable storage, because you have to have ZEN's software installed on the PC you want to copy data. The only solution is to use its SD card slot. BUT, SD card slot is very buggy - after I installed the Audible audio books on built-in memory, I can't listen to MP3 music that's installed in SD card. This is really strange, I'll see if I can get help from Creative. I can listen to MP3 music before I installed Audible books. My guess is the power is not enough to drive both MP3 and Audible or a lot of other stuffs at the same time. That I give 3 stars is because it still can play Audible, which is my primary usage of this device. Of course, I might use its video features sometime when I find applications. Worse is - I don't think this ZEN works with Microsoft Media Player 11. I had to uninstalled MMP 11, and went back to version 10 in order to use ZEN; otherwise, XP won't recognize this device. I strongly suggest Creative improve this into a better situation - you don't need Microsoft Media Player to use Audible or other features. You indeed should let a bare XP/2000 or other OS recognize this device without Microsoft Media Player. You can add MMP function after your device is recognized by XP or other similar OS. I think Creative is not doing a good job in this issue. I just saw a person "Steve" left a review as below - "I've had Creative flash mp3 players for years and found them to be very reliable and simple to use. I wanted more capacity so I bought this one. I was very disappointed in this mp3 player and returned it after a week or so. It was very buggy--always just shutting off for no apparent reason and requiring me to reset it."  I agree. This ZEN MP4 shuts me many times; also, when I tried to play MP3 on the SD card after I installed the Audible books, it always crashed and I had to reset it. I also have a ZEN Nano Plus 1GB, which is much more stable than this one although its Radio function is really much weaker - the autoscan scans less stations.  I really think Creative should develop ZEN/MP4's os without using Microsoft Media Player in the first place. ZEN Nano Plus has already had this capability, why does ZEN/MP4 not use the same idea???? You can add the Microsoft Media Player after you have basic functions built if you really need Microsoft's software, isn't it? I think Creative's ZEN/MP4 designers are really neither clever nor professional.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this about a month ago because I wanted a higher capacity player that was flash based, that didn't need a lot of additional software, and that used a regular mini-USB connection.  At 16GB, I have close to 1,300 songs and about 4 hours of video on it.  I've still got almost 10GB left available.  Plenty of room!  the screen is the same size as the iPod, pictures look great, short videos look great.  The sound and album art are the features I use most (FM is nice too though).  I have not had any problems at all with it.  It came with the latest firmware so I haven't had to update that.  Based on my experiences with it, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, easy to use, high capacity flash player!

<Title>Cell phone charger (Motorola) is compatible: I'm in Love!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This thing rocks! I spent months reading reviews and finding the perfect device.  This comes very close.  It won out over the Cowon D2, and Sansa View.  The Archos Wifi, iRiver, and iPoo-don't-Touch won't expand w/ SD cards, so are eliminated (says the apple-phobe.) Battery life also sucked.  The Cowon D2 was a sure winner at first, but what sold me about the Zen was the ability to read m3u's and make playlists. Navigating 16 gigs of music will be nearly impossible without this.  In addition superior bookmarking capabilities and the ability to navigate 2-hour long audiobooks sold me on the Zen. It was hard to turn down Cowon's OGG-FLAC-APE capabilities, it's WMA voice recording, and it's TV-out port.  They both have amazing sound quality.  The Sansa View had the advantage of durability, integration of SD mini card files into regular interface, and great customer service from Sandisk.  I had an e280 before and the interface, which is virtually the same, is very basic; only allowing you to choose by Album, Artist, Genre and so on.  The sound was good, not "amazing," and I could USUALLY here audiobooks over subway noise.  Reviews say video watching stinks. No bookmarking for audiobooks--they told me 5 years ago they were working on this!  Boooooooooo, Sandisk.  Here is a rundown of the pros and cons. Hope they're helpful:  Creative Zen PROS *Bookmarks *price for 16gb version   32Gb EXCITING but expensive. *Playlist support *Large touch-like screen (no touch) *Blind control with buttons *Audible compatible *Organizer w/ Outlook sync *Interface clean and easy *25 hours audio battery time *Can use as USB drive - with software  CONS *First generation -- Just  not  together yet -- Lots of hangs and resets -- must be a power user or geek -- get the extra Warranty. *SD card files not integrated into menus - not a problem with 32gb version. Also can simply store only video on SD card. *No TV Out *records in wav format - 0.7Gb/Hour - 1.4Gb/2-hour class - will need space in main memory for this *No power adapter included - $30--or see Motorola notes below *No radio recording *Radio won't play while navigating other menus *No folder navigation on player *No renaming or tagging files in player - forget sorting through your unlistened downloads with this player. *No adding Contacts or Calendar items with player *No text file note reading or note taking.

Question: I haven't tried bookmarking from the SD card yet.  Someone PLEASE tell me it works??  Finally, I had a nice surprise when my Zen arrived: it is compatible with my Motorola cell phone AC power adapter!  I have the Razr V3m but I think all Motorola's use the same.  It is 5.0v and I looked around on the Web to make sure the Zen takes 5.0v as well.  Indeed they do.  Try this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EA1PUK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6954301-3468444">Superior C. Car / Wall Charger for Motorola KRZR Q RAZR SLVR</a>   Bonus: the USB mini cord that comes with the Zen is compatible with the cell phone too!  I found shareware syncing software for my phone here http://global.mobileaction.com/ and now I can sync contacts and calendars with Outlook for both my cell phone and my Zen.  Ha Ha! (Also see Motorola's Website.)  I love mine so much I have named her Izzy.  Her black shiny finish matches perfectly with my new HP Pavillion Notebook, which I named Isabella. (Bella means beautiful in Italian.)  UPDATE: Most mini USB AC adapters and cables (make sure it's mini) should work.  I have seen a review or two of some generics that don't though.  The Motorola adapters work great.  **Also, MediaMonkey is the best syncing software for ANY player.  The tagging features are simply awesome, and it saves the Zen's customizations and settings for when you need to reset and format. Oh me, oh my!

<Title>Charge first
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just received my zen 16 from Amazon today.  Amazon had by far the best price, though I am sure the price will keep coming down. The speed of delivery was amazing.  I only ordered day before yesterday.  This is my 3rd Creative Zen player so I am a bit wiser.  First, I don't forget and try to start loading music from my library before I charge the little jewel up.  It is dutifully charging as I type.  I agree that it is unnecessary to download the Creative software that comes with the player. If you are new to mp3 players, the Creative software is probably a good idea for you.  From a previous disaster, I don't recommend casually trying to update the firmware unless you have a compelling reason to do so.  Previous firmware versions were incompatible with Windows Media Player 11, which is installed on millions of PCs.  It was possible to quickly freeze up the player.  Go to the Creative forums before you try it and see what kinds of results folks are having.  I also agree that the USB cable that comes with the 16 is a joke.  If your USB port on your computer is near the top of a desktop tower, it will have to hang in front of it.  Unbelievable.  Fortunately for me, it is the same size on the end that attaches to the player as my old Zen V Plus.  That one came with a longer cord that I can still use.  What was Creative thinking on that one??  The 16 is bigger than my Zen V, which doesn't enhance it's portability, but it does have that big screen, and it has twice the memory of my Plus. I need the space, don't know if I need the big screen.  At least it will still fit in my pocket.  I upgraded to better headphones on my last player, so I don't have to use the stock set, which people say are inferior.  I hope I got a non-faulty player here.  I won't know till the battery is charged.  If anything is wrong I will be writing here again.  Creative does let some bad units get out to the stores which are then DOA for their new owners.  But if you get a good one, they rock.

<Title>Another great one from Creative
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second MP3 player I've purchased from Creative, I have such a great experience with the V Plus that when it was time to upgrade I chose to stay with the same brand. I've only had it now for a couple of months, and because I'm not so techie I haven't gotten around to playing with all the bells and whistles. I will admit it was a bit intimidating when I got it so many differnt buttons so many differnt features than the V Plus.  My first complaint is because it is still fairly new that there aren't many accessories available for it, I'm still trying to find a cord to use to play it in the car seeing as though the cord from my V Plus does not fit.  My second complaint is there is no feature to actually turn off the backlight, so its on all the time you can only control the brightness.  Thirdly, is that the album art doesn't come up when you select a song, you have to basically click around to make it come up.  Howeve, overall I really love it, it stores all my music with lots of space to expand including the slot card, I have no regrets....

<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After much searching I landed on this as my mp3 player. I have a couple of other options for listening to mp3's while mobile but they all have complications. I like this one. It has an easy menu to navigate, it has a screen big enough and bright enough to read, it is drop and drag loading, it isn't proprietary to one computer or another.   Easy to use, compact, good sound, what else do you need? More space? Well I find that 16gb is more than enough for me. That is a lot of music and spanish lessons.

<Title>firmare disaster
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Alright, so i read all the reviews and wanted to believe all the good things about this player.  It turns out that it was all true.  The video and sound are great and file transfers on mp3s were fast.  The problem happened when i tried to update the firmware.  Thats when the player just died on me.  i reset it and the interface got all messed up and the player would just freeze if i tried to do anything else.  So, good player up until you try to upgrade firmware.  These players come defective and i wouldn't trust them right now.  Software wasn't good either.

<Title>All around good performance
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>All in all the ZEN is a great alternative to an  ipod. If you're like me you'll never fill that 80GB worth of space and so why should you pay for it? With the ZEN I got exactly what I wanted, my music library in my pocket.   The following are what I personally found great and not so great.  Pros: - 16GB worth of space (thats about 4160 mp3 songs) - a vibrant screen that looks great with videos - the ability to import any short video or pictures (providing you convert them first) - you can take any picture and make it your wallpaper - a great price (especially from amazon)  Cons: - creating playlists on the ZEN is a disaster, much easier building it on the program bundled with it. - video and audio playback can sometimes get out of sync and you'll have to pause the video to let it correct itself - when connecting the player to the computer things can get a little crazy as both the player and Windows Media Player try to sync each other up, you can get quite a few doubles of songs in your library. Make sure you tell the media player to not start syncing without your consent  So with that I highly recommend this mp3 player as it has a slick design and works like a charm, plus it's a great mp3 player that doesn't have the apple logo on it!

<Title>Love this Player!
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just bought this player. This was my first personal player since I had one of the earlier Sony Walkmans in the 80's.   After a couple of days of playing with it, I must say the only thing I'm disappointed about is the 2 inch USB cable that comes with it. I mean it's barely long enough to allow the player to lay flat. I have to get another cord for it because my port is in the back of my laptop and it's really difficult and inconvenient to dock the player back there. I think for this expensive of a player they could have included a longer cord. The headphones are very cheesy too - they won't stay in the ear at all. I'll be buying some new headphones to go with this player.   Other than that I like all the features. There are more things I wish it could have (we always want more don't we?) but I've loaded an audio book, several videos, a few albums, some podcasts, some photos and played with the organizer (added stuff to the calendar and task list).  The radio has 32 presets and auto-finds all the local FM stations for you.   I've been listening to it around the house, and plan to use it for exercise. It's really a very nice player and I look forward to getting many years of use out of it.

<Title>Well designed player in a nice small package.
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen because I wanted to upgrade to a flash based mp3 rather than the hard drive ones. They allow you to have a smaller player with no moving parts. The Zen appealed to me because it was the only flash player that was available above the 8Gb limit found today on most players in the market. And I definetly needed more memory than that. And it's the only one with an expandable SD card slot which is cool, but note that the card files will be on their own separate folder.  Now this player is definetly not designed to be an iPod killer, because the video drivers are not as efficient as on a classic iPod, but if you're one of those persons that doesn't need a lot of performance, and just needs to carry all his basic music/photos/videos with him, then this is the player for you.  The design of the player is very neat, just the size of a credit card. The thinness is awesome, but for video watching the player is comfortable, just not THAT comfortable since you need to grab it from the edges, but for me this was a minor issue. If you need to hold something with your palm rather than fingers you may not like that.  The thing that is great is that this player has no need for proprietor software or hardware. It's compatible with Windows Media Player, or the included Zen Media Browser (which I recommend more because it stores your files smarter and more organized in your folders). And it also reads any single type of video/audio file, except secure aac audio/video files, and few video files. But nothing a divx decoder can't fix (for video). But still, this will not play your paid "secure" iTunes purchases.  The software of the Zen is very easy to use, and it's bright screen lets you see it under any kind of light conditions. And it's cool how it lets you use your own pictures as your wallpapers. It also has a podcast application included (Zencast Organizer) which will let you watch any kind of podcast (just save the URL on your "subscription" list). When you watch your podcasts, the videos will transfer kinda fast, and the audio/video fidelity is very good. Now the one thing you will notice is that your own downloaded videos on .wmv format will have sometimes an audio lag. My own videos had that issue where the audio was 2sec. behind the video so be carefull with that, but the podcasts (no matter the length) had no problem with that.  One of the few downsides of the player is just the battery life, it claims to last >20hrs for the 16Gb version, but the most I've gotten is 16hrs for music, and 4hrs for video. Also the screen and buttons section gets dirty very easily with the oil in your hands, so you need to clean it often. I wish they had given it a plastic/matte finish like on the first generation Zune. But otherwise those were just the only 2 issues I had.  So final conclusion: I do recommend this player to those basic not so demanding audiophiles out there. You'll like it on both its easy software and the lack of proprietorship accessories. For those hardcore athletes or Mac/iTunes people this may not be the right item for you. But for the rest, you'll like it a lot.  And also... as with any other player out there, the AC charger does NOT come included, I know that blows but we need to cope with it. But on the good side, you can use ANY kind of USB AC charger out there. I've used from cheap $2 ones to the $25 Creative ones, and they all work the same, and take the same time to charge. So don't worry about that. AC charging takes around 2.5hrs to fully charge, and 30min for an 80% charge.

<Title>Stopped working after less than a week
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was a great mp3 player out of the box, but after less than a week of having it, it stopped working.  I was no longer able to reset it or recharge it.  I bought this mp3 player specifically for an upcoming trip.  I called Amazon to see if they could expedite shipment of a replacement so that I would still have the Zen to use on my trip, but they would not do this.  This is very poor customer service in my opinion.  In short, this is a really cool mp3 player when it is working.  Just keep in mind that you're rolling the dice here with the reliability of this product, and don't expect  above average customer service from Amazon either.

<Title>Not as good as I had hoped...
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Zen to replace a Zen Micro that died.  The first thing that happened was upon installation I downloaded the firmware upgrade which killed the player.  Had to reset the entire thing--twice. Software was difficult to use.  Had multiple copies of the same song that it wouldn't let me delete.  Controls weren't intuitive--I am pretty tech savvy and couldn't figure out how to adjust the volume.  I ended up returning it--too much work.  I got an 80g ipod classic a few days ago.  So far so good...

<Title>Satisfied Infidel
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am a previous IPOD user, and changed over to the Zen based on good reviews of others. I am not disappointed. This player is everything the Ipod Mini was, and a lot more. I am not bound by the proprietary conditions of Apple's products anymore, and can buy music from many other sites, as well as add a variety of file types to this player. The Zen also gives me an FM tuner and a voice recording function. I will never go back to Apple.  Getting started with the Zen took some getting used to, and the tech support is only via email, which made getting answers a bit frustrating. Thankfully, since purchase, this player has performed flawlessly.

<Title>Creative and Folders
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The player is fine, well made and functions as advertised.  I have a single complaint, one that rules it out for my use: one cannot organize music into folders and have those show up as folders that can be opened in a search mode.  The iAudio units do this perfectly but it seems not possible to overcome ID3 tags with Creative.  When scrolling, I would like to see, for example, folders labelled 'Broadway', 'Folk', 'Opera', 'Books', etc. and then open the selected folder to choose an item.  If this is possible with Creative then it takes more steps and requires more patience than I'm willing to expend especially given the ease with which this is accomplished by iAudio.  I returned the Creative Zen 16gb and will replace it with the iAudio 7 player: smaller screen but, from my perspective, much better options for organizing contents.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6954301-3468444">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a>

<Content>The creative zen is an amazing product, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.   pros: Great video quality 16 gig (the one I bought) is the perfect amount for storing a bunch of video, audio files etc.  The player is fast and responsive Great look Excellent sound. Quick booting and shut down.  cons: Video transfer is quite slow Battery drains faster than I would like, the screen should go black when you are listening to music but it stays on, though dimmed.  I wish the buttons had small bumps on them so that I could differentiate them without looking. As it is, I can usually navigate without looking but it could have been a bit easier.

<Title>Bad Quality,bad design, bad support
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The first one I received had a bad bookmark function, crucial to me since it was primarily to be used for books.  It would set the bookmark, but the bookmark would clear after about an hour or so.  Hardly useful.  Customer support did not speak english, and was of no use.  Exchanged it, and the replacement just kept freezing, then wouldn't turn on at all.  Also, it is too easy to hit the select button when you are trying to toggle,  (select button iS inside the toggle).  This kept happening to me after I would attempt to fast forward to my spot in the book after the bookmark cleared.  Very very irritating.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!

<Title>The Zen is a solid piece of gear.
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm really happy with the purchase of my Zen. It's the third Creative product I've bought and I'm glad to have stuck with the company. I find the buttons on it to be easy to find and I like how the performs much better than any other device with touch sensitive controls. Although touch sensitive controls are much slicker, I find myself annoyed by the sudden increases in volume or some other button fiasco while trying to reach into your pocket maneuvering past your phone, keys, etc... I've had the unit lock up on me a couple of times but once the reset button was used it came right back to life. I'm not sure what the cause was, no I have not installed any firmware updates. The audio on the unit is great. I use it both with a pair of Ultimate Ears noise isolating buds and a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort II head phones. The quality from both is exceptional.   The screen for the unit is very bright and the colors are fantastic. I have not yet watched any videos and will have to do some experimenting this week. Pictures look great on it tho. The one draw back that I'd like mention is in relation to the SD expansion capability. It's very convenient and reliable. But the unit does not allow you to move files from the internal HDD and the removable media. A minor minus in a gadget that is over all great!! I'm glad I bought it. The Zen looks great and is definitely very slick, with or with out a skin. I do have a skin on it just to ensure anything co-located with it in my pocket doesn't damage it's finish. So far so good. If your doing research on the unit and not some folks are peeved a little with the fact that there is no hole in the silicone skins to access the reset button, I didn't find it to be a big deal. The skin flips off and back on with minimal drama. Just make sure you have a tiny safety pin stashed somewhere to reset the unit.

<Title>Zen is great.  Can't install software.
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the 16 GB Creative Zen in late December using the Amazon Prime service.  Even though it was supposed to arrive in 2 days, it took 6 days to get to me.  I have been enjoying the Zen.  I've loaded some of my Tivo'd shows on the Zen and watch them while travelling.  It's great being able to watch CSI, The Celebrity Apprentice, or Criminal Minds while everyone else on the plane is watching The Jane Austin Book Club.  The picture is good and the battery has not run out on me yet.  The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to move forward or backward in a video.  I can do it while listening to music, so I'm hoping this is possible with video.    I tried loading the software that came with the Creative Zen on my Windows XP Professional PC, but cannot get it to load.  There is a CTX Installer error having something to do with my PC registry.  Unfortunately, customer support cannot help me with this and have told me I'm on my own.  I'm using Windows Media Player to sync my Zen with my music and videos.  Overall it's a great player and a good alternative to an iPod.  I like the cheaper price, the included FM radio, and the ability to load my Tivo videos.

<Content>It is a pretty smooth device, but the syncing needs a LOT of improvement.  I had to install the firmware update x2, but syncing took an easy dozen times--then it did not sync my playlists created on either MediaMonkey or ITunes.  Had to resync using Windows Media Player.

<Title>Way better than ipod --- and AMAZON IS AWESOME!
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this player! I did not want an ipod. I wanted to just play mp3 that i owned with no drm on them or restrictions. I LOVE how it syncs up with Windows Media Player. This is so cool -- I can rip all my songs from my CD's directly into Media Player easily and it makes it easy to get the album art and track listings. And pictures in my media library are there as well --- then i just plug in the usb of the zen and it syncs them right up. PLAYLISTS and ALBUM ART -- are in there and come across. I was worried this was a feature that only ipod had. This ZEN is awesome and such a low price! Yes the usb cable is very short and I did not like the ear phones --- but this player rocks! plus i was worried that the volume would not go up enough to listen to some music loud and use speakers --- BUT you can easily shut the volume limiting off. So the fears i had about buying one --- have ALL been resolved. This thing has a large screen and is great. It is a good idea to get a screen protecter. and do not buy this from anyone else --- AMAZON is the greatest --- if you have any problems at all --- THEY WILL HELP YOU LIKE NO OTHER!!!! You will be amazed at how such a big company really acts like they care about your piddly small order. THEY ROCK!!!!!!!!

<Title>6th is a charm
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Creative Zen is my 6th MP3 player.  The first 4 died for various reasons.   The last one, Creative Zen Vision:M, still works.  I replaced it because, while I like it, I have some complaints (too heavy, confusing interface, short battery life, etc.).  What I liked best about it was that it worked with Rhapsody, played videos, and it could take a beating and continue to work.  The subscription service through Rhapsody is a thing of beauty, I don't know why anyone would use a Zune or an IPod and not have that feature.  I bought the Zen 16GB flash player to address the few complaints I had with my Vision:M.  My first player came DOA.  Amazon overnighted a free replacement (I am an Amazon customer for life).  Here are my Pros and Cons on the Creative Zen 16GB.  Pros * Works well with playforsure subscription service * Works with Amazon Unbox * Great sound  * Videos look/sound good * Very light and compact * Improved interface from Vision:M * Can delete items on the player * Good trouble-shooting tools (for firmware, reboot issues) * SD slot * Plugs in directly to a USB 2.0 cable (no goofy adapter needed) * Works with Vista  Cons * buggy:  The first thing a new buyer should do is load the new firmware.  I didn't, so I was able to enjoy loading all my music and videos twice.  Fortunately there are good trouble shooting tools * Creative Tech support:  Good luck finding a number to call * Headphones are only OK * Not Bluetooth enabled * Doesn't come in Green (don't ask) * Can't record direct to MP3  Overall a great little device that I'm using all the time

<Title>Nothing creative about this Creative Zen
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>QUICK REVIEW (longer review further down):  - Good design; you won't realize how slick this player is until it's in your hand - Good user interface with the on screen menus and tactile buttons - Navigation is very quick and easy - Flash storage means better reliability over hard drive based players and there aren't many 16gb+ flash players - Best 2.5" screen gives outstanding image quality on photos/videos  - SDcard expansion slot for more media content (see details below) - Limited accessories - Improved sound quality over iPod is just a hype? (see details below) - divX, Xvid video codec transcoding is a non-feature (see details below) - Firmware does not give user much control over music organization on player (see details below)  If you already have a device that works and meets your storage requirements, there is no need to purchase this device as an upgrade unless your player is just really really old. The Creative Zen's strongest attributes are its 16gb flash based storage and its size/aesthetics.    EXTENDED REVIEW:   I had my eye on this player for a while now and I finally bought it a week ago. My music collection is currently 12Gb so most of the flash players available are too small. If I go with a hard drive based player, its either iPod or Zune, not exactly a great selection. With the 16GB Zen, I have the capacity I need and also the SD slot. The idea was to use the 15Gb available storage for music and use the SD slot for videos since I could never store all my videos on a single device. This is a great simple mp3 player but I wouldn't recommend it to people who are not somewhat computer savvy or are extremely particulate about their music organization. However, all the nuisances I had with this player can be fixed with firmware updates.  Overall build quality of the device seems pretty good. The buttons seem kind of small. If you use the clear plastic case /w key ring (the best case for it in my opinion), the small buttons might be hard to press but I had no problems.  The Main Menu looks good but it doesn't cycle through once you get to the end of the list. I find this odd when every sub-menu in the device lets you do this. (By cycle through, I mean when you get to the bottom of a menu, you keep scrolling and start back up top again continuously.) A bit irritating if you have lots of menu selections to scroll through and you know it can be done faster.  The screen is the most advanced on such a small device. You can seem an incredible difference between 96,000 colors on an iPod and the millions of colors on the Zen. You can customize the background. Screen scratches easily like any other player.  SD card slot accepts SDHD so you can potentially have another 16gb of swappable storage. Some users may complain that media on the SD card doesn't integrate seamlessly with the rest of the Zen library. In order for this to be done, a completely original software must be developed. If I have some voice recordings, songs, music videos, movies, and tv shows all stored in the same folder on my SD card, what will determine where these files will go when they integrate into my Zen internal memory? I don't want to be browsing regular music on my Zen and have a voice recording stored on my SD card show up in the same menu. The current ID3v2 tagging can't determine where to place these audio files. Correct me if I'm wrong, but since there currently is no way to tag more identification to the files, Zen shouldn't be faulted for this lack of integration.  Besides, the Zen firmware doesn't even fully recognize the tag information, or it doesn't utilize it. Lets say I have a double-album in my library, an album with 2 discs. I can tag the files as being part of disc 1 or disc 2. In other players, the player will recognize the tag and sort the tracks in that album accordingly: disc1 tracks first and then disc2 and so on. The Zen will display track1 of disc1 first, then track1 of disc2, then track2 of disc1, then track2 of disc2 and so on ... losing the original order. Also, the Zen firmware isn't able to recognize prefixes like "the" or "a" in artist names and ignore them when sorting. An artist like "The Beatles" will be placed under "T" rather than "B". The special ignore "the" prefixes feature is found on many competing players. Again, not a big issue but can be annoying if you want your music to organized perfectly.  Then there is the Zen syncing. The ability to sync your library to your device is good for two reasons. First, if you are lazy or unfamiliar with a computer, syncing will do all the thinking for you and you will have music on your player. Secondly, syncing means that your device will always match your computer library. If you make any change to your library (add/del music, change tags etc), these changes should be reflected on your player after syncing.  The included Creative Sync Manager software does not seem to detect all the music in my computer, which is all saved in the same folder and are all of mp3 format. I try to sync the files it does detect but the program freezes during the syncing. Alternative syncing methods can be used: Windows Media Player, MediaMonkey, work but I still can't be 100% sure of the syncing accuracy.  The Zen is a true drag-and-drop player. This is good since you can manage your music on any computer. I am not sure how Zen recognizes album art but transferring my music using drag and drop did not transfer album art. I had some files where the art was embedded into the file tag and with others, the image was stored as a folder.jpg for that album. Both did not show up on the player. Again, not a big deal since your music is still there, just without the album art. But if you want things to be perfect, drag and drop is not the best option. (If you choose to install Zen Media Explorer, you can add music in a drag-and-drop like interface and this does recognize album art embedded into the file)  I guess I am no audiophile since I can't tell much of a difference in sound quality between the Zen and the notoriously poor sound quality iPod. I used these some #30 dollar earphones from Sony to do my testing with mp3s ripped from CDs at 320kbps and I couldn't hear the difference even though I wanted to. Maybe if you own a pair of Shures and you can tell the difference. However, a typical user shouldn't buy the Zen or choose not to buy and iPod because they fear poor sound quality.  And then there is the advertised Xvid, DivX... transcoding support. What this all means is that the converter software that comes with the player can convert these formats into a format that the player can play. This means that the Zen is just like any other player that doesn't natively support these formats. Just like any other player, you need to first convert the video and this can be done faster and better with free software on the internet.  I've identified a lot of so-called problems with the Zen but they are mostly firmware issues which means we can expect fixes with updates. I only mentioned these because they usually don't make it into most reviews and they can only be discovered after actually using the device for a while. As I said before, this player looks great and functions great. It fills that gap between 8Gb flash players and 30Gb+ hard drive players. It's better then the SanDisk Sansa 16gb and better/cheaper then iTouch 16Gb.  BTW, your new Zen should come with the current firmware already installed.
