<Content>so when i bough this ipod nano. i called in to mack sure it is what im getting like there was a case pichtured in it and im like wow this is a great deal for the price the rep said that it would be coming with a case so i bought it and when it came i opened it and it had marks on the sceen and everything. it did not come with the case that was saposed to come with it i call them and i said whats the deal with the case and they were like it does not come with the case and i said why is it pichtured then there like to sell more so im like so ur cheating people to buy it thinkgin its going to come with a case. so i told them i want a case since it was in the photos. so they eneded up sending me a i pod case that doesnot even fit my ipod nano. they said they had shiped it and when i got it it was shiped a week later so they are just scammers trying to get your money so make sure you call them and make sure everything pichtured comes with it!

<Title>iPod Nano, first generation
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a shuffle and got an Nano for my children.  This product was refurbished and an older generation but this is what I wanted as my children are younger.  I didn't want to spend too much money on something that would likely be dropped dozens of times or even lost.  Love the iPod, easy to use, easy to sync.  Wish I had gotten one capable of playing videos but won't send it back because of that.  Product was shipped on time and arrived in stated condition.  No complaints.

<Title>I-pod is good
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Whats good about the I-pod nano is that its so small. You can fit it in your pocket with a slide. (unlike the big one witch you need a case for) I have been doing some research and i have found the i-pod nano is the best 1gb (2gb or 4gb) mp3 player. The mini has no color,the others are very expensive and arn't that portable as the nano. This is a great MP3 player to carry around. I recomend you buy it.

<Title>I love my nano!!!!!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for a birthday gift and it may be the best gift that I have even received.  It is incredibly easy to use and the sound is AMAZING!!! iTunes has been pretty simple to set up and purchasing songs is a little too easy...its hard to not get too carried away.  I am so excited that I found singles that I couldn't find on Napster.  The only sad thing is that I have a lot of purchased Napster tracks that I couldn't automatically transfer into iTunes.  I will try to burn them onto CDs and then import them into iTunes.  I definitely recommend the Nano for any music lover.

<Content>Just got my mine in the mail from Amazon.com, plugged it in for a battery charge, loaded all of my favorite songs at the same time. And now, I am listening to each one of them. The quality of the sound is very clear and loud if you wish it that way. It's got a shuffle functionality which works perfectly if you go to the gym and don't want to listen to only one album. The little device is so light too. I mean. 5 stars is well deserved for it. Lastly, the 14 hours of battery is true. :) Enjoy!

<Title>good mp3 player
<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>overall i found the 1gb ipod nano pretty good for everyday use. i can plug it into the car, or listen to it while at the gym. sound quality is above average. it has some simple games included too. since the i pods are popular by far, theres so many accesories available and to choose from. the downside is that the nano scratches so easily, so i had to cover it with a film and rubber casing. playing the games likes to drain the batteries because of the constantly lit screen. the other thing down the road is wondering how long the internal battery will last. i've heard apple customer service is very good from friends, so that's a plus. when i compared it to other players of this memory capacity and features, i found that the nano overall dominates, other than its nonreplaceable battery.

<Title>good and bad
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(to save some time read this) Pros - small, portable. - clear screen. - stylish. - automatic sync. using Itune. - include other programs(games,photo/slideshow,notepad.etc) - lock  Cons - deliget - too expensive( so as other accessories). - only Itune compatible. - only 1 GB ( comparing to 2,4,30,& 60 GB) - fingerprints are visible after using it. - unable to delete music from nano whitout using a computer. - a few bugs need to be fixed (the screen gets stuck sometimes).  (to get more info read this) i like ipod nanos, its easy 2 use, it looks cool, just like a mini version of a pocket pc.but the bad thing about it, is that it cost wayyy to much comparing to other mp3 makers. the only way to copy music to nano is using itune( and a couple of other 3rd party programs). itune rename the file name to 4 letter which makes everything more comfusing.i recommend getting a 2 or 4 GB nano because 1 GB is not big enough(around 240 songs).i also recommend getting something that protects the nano, fingerprints get on very easly. overall, i  think this is a good product.

<Title>Wading through the hype
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Nano is a good product, and a good value depending on what you're looking for in a music player.   First, the bad. Yes, it scratches and smudges easily. Even moderate handling is likely to leave your beautiful gadget hopelessly marred. That's a fact. I bought a case right away and still have some minor scratches on the surface. If you buy a Nano, buy a case (gel or otherwise) on the same trip--it will save you some trouble down the road. Second, the software needs a little tweaking. While most of the time, it works fine, I did experience a glitch here and there that mysteriously returns me to the main menu. It's not damning, but it can be annoying. Hopefully, Apple will fix this soon. Third, if you're dikkering, as I was between a Shuffle and a Nano, know that the Nano is a bit more delicate. I bought this for working out, and I do worry that I'll have to cash in my Applecare warranty more with this than I ever did with my shuffle. It has a screen, it's smaller, and it's more delicate.  Now, the good. First, it's gorgeous--flat out, a beautiful design. You will marvel at the screen and the impossible thinness. I also own a mini, and as lovely as that is, this is even prettier. Second, again, if you're dikkering between a Shuffle and a Nano, the battery life is quite good. I got about 11 hours on a single charge, and considering the bright color screen, this is great. Additionally, it holds a charge well between uses. Very little power seems to eke out. Third, you can use playlists. If you're like me, and have different playlists for different moods, the Nano is superior to the Shuffle in this respect. Finally, the screen. It's quite nice. I expected to not use it much, but find myself glancing at it constantly for the time of day and song titles (album art is a bonus).   So here's my recommendation: if you don't need your whole collection with you or are considering a shuffle, the Nano is also a great choice. Yes, the screen and front can get marred, but if you invest in a case, you'll be fine. The sound quality is great (better than my Mini) and the form factor is good for workouts or car trips. You really can't go wrong unless you need a higher-capacity player. Great product, overall.

<Title>The actual thing is great
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new iPod is, without a doubt, a perfect Mp3 Player; especially the feature of scrolling the lists up and down with simply moving the tip of your finger around the wheel. But there is one thing, not about this actual iPod, but about the reviews that Amazon and other sources give to such things. It's when they say, like, "Memory holds UP TO (example) 240 SONGS". IS "SONG" A NEW UNIT OF MEASURING THE SPACE? I'm used to using bytes, kilobytes, etc. It is not only technically incorrect to estimate the number of songs that the memory can hold (a single song can be 2, 4, 7, 10, (...) megabytes big, depending on its length and format), but it also pisses me off whenever I hear or read something like that.

<Title>Just plain awesome
<Date>Wed Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After avoiding purchasing an MP3 player for some time now, I finally gave in and settled for an iPod.  The Apple 1 GB iPod Nano is the very first Apple product I have ever bought and put to use, and I have been more than satisfied with it since I got it.  The sleek design of the Nano sealed the deal for me; with an incredibly thin body and frame that slides right into your pocket.  I was initially fearful of it's fragility, but after everything I've put my Nano through, I must say that it is quite durable.  The 1 GB can hold up to 240 songs, which is more than enough for me personally, and isn't a bad deal at all for Apple's asking price.  If there's any shortcomings, it's that the selection dial can be too touch sensitive, and that it would be nice if the battery life were longer than the 12-14 hours of life, but those are only minor gripes at best for what you get here.  All in all, if you are looking to get your first iPod, the 1GB Nano is a perfect place to start.

<Content>My Apple iPod came in what appeared to be it's original box, witht the headphones, usb cable, booklet and software all wrapped up and sealed. The only gripe I have about this purchase is that there is a small scratch on the screen, so when I'm scrolling or playing games or viewing photos on the iPod, it is a little annoying. The product itself works great, the battery is very long-lasting, and the sound for the headphones is very nice. I just wish I knew about the scratch before I purchased it.

<Title>Just Buy It- It's worth it
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Considering the price, I was hesitant about buying th Nano. But Now that I have the ipod nano, its worth it.   Don't believe the lies that ipod nanos scratch easily and is not durable. Only morons scratch their ipods. It's been 3 months and I have not scratched my nano. I have dropped it several times and I have lied on it while I was sleeping (thousands of times). Buy a nice silicon, aluminum, or leather case and you're be fine. A good case will absorb the shock of dropping. Leave the plastic sticker on and your screen will be protected from scratches and other things.   When you first take the ipod out of the box, be careful. First and foremost, get a case and everything will be swell.   Ipod provide spectacular sounds and multiple useful features (games, calendar, stop watch, contacts, notes, clock: worldwide, shuffle, photos, and etc.). I really enjoy the "on-the-go" playlist option. The "on-the go" playlist allows you to make a playlist on the ipod.   The things I hate about the ipod are the short battery life and the headphones. The good thing is that these things can be easily fixed. Buy a car charger and home charger on ebay and a cheap high performing sony headphones at walmart and everything is good.   The ipod is enjoyable and itunes is really user-friendly.

<Content>I was hesitant about the nano after a VERY bad experience with the shuffle. I have had it now for about a month, and I dont see how I lived without it. It's size is amazing! It can fit in my pocket comfortably. The display is amazing it shows the albulm cover and you can also shuffle songs on the ipod nano. Uploading photos to the already user friendly iTunes, is a snap. If you have outlook express you can also upload your calendar to your ipod. With other features like games,  and a clock (just to name a few). The nano gives off great sound. The photo's look great on the ipod, I didnt expect such great quality. If you order from apple.com you can get a message engraved free, thats the only thing I wish amazon would offer. Anyways, GREAT BUY!

<Date>Thu Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Nano as an anniversary gift from my husband. He had it delivered to me at work. I usually leave the electronic stuff for him to figure out but this time I was too anxious to get it working. So I read the simple instructions, installed the software, plugged it into my computer and it was good to go!  I had seen it online before and I knew that it was going to be small, but I couldn't believe how tiny and cute that it was and the engraving on the back was such a nice touch.  I also love the photo album feature, its great to be able to show off all those personal pictures that don't usually make it off your digital camera.  One suggestion is to go out and buy a cover for it immediately and keep the plastic film that it came with on it until you do because the back does scratch really easily.

<Content>I have been wanting an MP3 player since they came on the market.  I wanted to wait a while to see if they would come down in price.  Finally, last month I got an email ad about the ipod nano.  I was very pleased with the price, so I bought one. "Wow," I have been blown away. I did not know how wonderful it could be having one.  I walk for exercise, and using a CD player was no fun at all, with all the skipping, you know what I mean. I am so impressed with the ipod Nano. The sound clarity is unbelievable.  I wasn't sure the sound quality would be there,  but it is way better than any CD player I have used. I can't compare it with any other MP3 since it is my first,  however I love it so much,  I plan on getting one for my son.  Best investment I've made all year. Folks you will not be disappointed. How can so much power be inside such a little device? I love it.

Why wouldn't you keep it in a case, there's so many different designs and colors out there. It's hard to resist buying a cover or case. The music quality is AWESOME. It holds 240 songs and can hold photos, too. I'm seriously thinking about updating to a Video iPod, because you get more out of it. This one is just music, excite your life with video too. If you're not a video person though this iPod is perfect for you. GO APPLE!!!

<Content>I gave this iPod only 1 star because besides the fact they are built nicely and that they are "classy and popular", they are misleading. Don't get your hopes up if you have many songs you plan on loading onto it. I cannot even get half the number of songs it advertises for (240) on mine. I do not recommend it if you plan on loading more than sixty songs onto your iPod, which most people do. Avoid the 1 GB iPod Nano and avoid hours of frustration if this applies to you.

<Content>I NEVER thought I would ever be writing a review for an ipod, but here I am.  I have done my research for mp3 players and though I found what I was looking for, only to be dispointed again and again UNTIL I bought an ipod!!     Although I do listen to a small amount of music I was looking for a mp3 player to listen to audio books.  I am in awe of this little thing.   I have gone though a Sandisk (is not EVEN book friendly!) and a Samsung (load 3 cds from the same book, it plays track1 track1 track1 , track2 track2 track2 and so on, so you have to ff 2 times what a mess)    Not with this ipod. I have 6 discs of one book on it right now and it will play the first one all the way through and then start with the next cd (what a concept!?) Feel like listening to music for a while? IT BOOKMARKS! Want to shuffle your music but dont want to hear your book, right well it knows the difference and does not shuffle the books! Wow smart and cute!   I had to do a small amount of trial and error to get around in itunes but it was pretty easy.  I was suprised with the amount it will hold too.  I had heard that ipods dont hold as much as other players but right now I have 7 full cds on there and I have not even used up 200mb! I have to admit it is kinda fun to use too.  All I heard about ipods (the bad stuff) I thought the last thing I would like is an ipod but I LOVE IT! I dont just fork over affection for devices easily either! If you are looking for an mp3 player that does it all BUY AN IPOD! TRUST ME! I started looking at the price and with all the others I had (not that much less, but not worth the pain at ALL!) and wish I would have bought this one FIRST!  Update:  Well my LCD has a line in it and has made it useless!  Apple does not cover the LCD screens even when the outside screen is NOT cracked.  I am now looking for another MP3 player and I am not going to pay Apples big bucks for something that only lasted less then a year!  I was told that it MUST have been from abuse.. It was working fine when I had it in my pocket while taking a walk I even paused it a couple of times to talk to my neighbors but when I took it out of my pocket to turn it off as I was walking up my drive way it looked funny, yet the glass part was NOT damaged AT ALL!!!! I would rather give my money to a company who does not make shotty products and then blame it on the customers!

<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.   Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This is the new 1 GB version of the iPod Nano.  Apple released the 1 GB version, to have an entry-level nano priced at only $150.  You get all the features of the 2 & 4 GB models, but simply less storage for songs.  If having less songs to carry around is ok with you, save some money with this player.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.   Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Content>i have done my reserch on mp3 i have also seen many "copycats" i saw something the other day called a tripod it said it was like 3 times as good as ipod nano for less i think it was a scam but it look just like one but a tad bit different. anyways nothing can stack up to and ipod maybe if they had one with a screen, i seen all of them and the dont got a cool screen like the others that why ipod cost alot,, (even though i am frustrated with the price) you can get 240 songs which is good for me because i dont have many songs. and it is 14 hours, that like more music then anybody needs for a day. so you can chrage it when ever..altough i heard cases of the batter dieing and you would have to get a brand new one so be aware of that..(get that insurance) and if you dont want ur screen runied id get a case i perfer cases from belkin..or you can get a skin clear is the best so you dont hide the beauty of your ipod. this is my post ----me----

<Title>Beating boredom during self-abuse
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must be the last person in the world to acquire an iPod. I mean, at 57, do I resemble the rhythmic human silhouettes gyrating to iTunes on the billboards? Be that as it may, however, I found myself laboring on the crosstrainer at the Y bored to death having to stare at either the cartoons on the wall-mounted TV or the wobbling flesh of the person running on the treadmill in front of me. (Contrary to popular myth, there seem to be few beautiful hardbodies at the gym, my bod included. And, those few present are dressed in shapelessly disreputable togs. Where's a lightly sweat-sheened Demi Moore in a thong and mini-tank top?) So, as an alternative source of mind fodder, an iPod nano seemed just the ticket.  Excitedly ripping open the box delivering the nano (1 GB, black finish), my first thought was what men dread to hear, "But, it's so small!" I must be careful not to drop it, or I might lose it down the grill of the central air floor vent. Accompanying the iPod were the de rigueur headphones and dock connector cable, plus a cheap, plastic thingy that apparently serves as a dock adaptor and a useless soft vinyl (?) sleeve - useless because it covers up the screen and click wheel controller, though you can use it to stuff the headphone into. There's also a Quick Start guide that can best be described as minimalist. Luckily, the installation disk, which effortlessly installs iTunes and iPod software onto your computer of choice - PC (Windows XP Home) AND Mac (OS X) in my case (I'm eminently flexible) - includes an extensive "iPod nano Features Guide" accessible through Adobe Acrobat Reader. Registering the serial number of the device on the Apple website presents the only challenge as it's engraved in impossibly tiny characters on the back of the casing; I needed a magnifying glass.  The click wheel controls are intuitive and easy to use. Touching any part of the wheel turns on the gadget and lights up the color screen, after which there are four relevant control points located at 12:00, 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 on the wheel: Menu, Next/Fast Forward, Play/Pause, and Previous/Rewind respectively. In case the user has Chubby Fingers Syndrome, "play" is also activated by poking the wheel's center button. Volume control and menu scrolling is cleverly accomplished by running one's digit in a circular motion around the wheel's circumference.   Tether the nano to your computer and an iPod icon will appear in the "Source" pane of the iTunes window, to which icon you can drag individual songs or playlists. Once loaded, the music can be selected (with that twirly finger motion) by playlist, artist, album, song title, genre, or composer.  But how, you ask, does the contraption perform? Ok, ok, so it's not Sensurround Sound. It does to near perfection what it's supposed to do - provide a great sounding, portable music archive to the sweaty masses that even the most intellectually challenged can navigate. The greatest peril is perhaps getting tangled up in the headphone cord.   For the iPod to withstand my exhausted collapse off the exerciser at the gym, I thought it prudent to buy a snappy sport armband to which the skin-protected nano attaches. That was an extra expense, but worth it. Boy, will I look cool as I hit the floor!  Today, as I listened to my toy for the first time, I was able to ignore my immediate surroundings to the beat of Cher's "If I Could Turn Back Time" and focus on the physical pain of my self-inflicted ordeal. Of course, I still keep an eye open for Demi.  Postscript: If you're looking for a set of portable speakers for your iPod, consider the mm50 by Logitech. See my 3/7/07 5-star review entitled "Bodacious."

<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is amazing.  It is tiny.  I found it easy to use once Apple tech explained it.  Up until then, it was driving me nuts.  The manual was  minimal and incorrect in some ways (at least for a PC user).  For example, iTunes did not work as described.    The serial number is so small I could barely read it for registering and the language switched to Japanese when I started it.  That was confusing!!!  I am going to buy one of those "missing manual" books.  Also, I do not like the ear phones and am using 30 year old one from a cassette player.  I will buy good, folding ones.  The sound is amazingly good, it is tiny, it is easy to use once you figure it out and it will be nice for long plane trips.  I just wish Apple provided a real manual and bigger serial numbers!!!

<Title>Giant Rip Off
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I attemted to purchase a brand new 1G black iPod as a Christmas gift; but what I received was an iPod that was scratched up and loaded with someone else's music. It wasn't even refurbished properly.  More issues came when I tried to return this item.  The customer service begrudgingly refunded my purchase (despite strict "all sales final policy") because they acknowledged that it wasn't what I ordered.  However, they charged me shipping for this item (there and back) that I never recovered.   Oh, and did I mention that I was charged over $160 (before tax and shipping) for a 1G nano when you can go to Apple's site and get a 2G nano for $130.  Amazon, if you care about the products you sell and your customer base, you should remove this third-party reseller from your list. The company that sold me this product should be removed from Amazon's website.

<Title>takes the OCD out of enjoying my music!
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>if you're like me, than you've prob compiled more than a lifetime's worth of music on your computer and can't figure out how to listen to it all.  i find myself with too many options when i scroll through my 1000 song mini and i cannot get my brain around 10,000 songs even though i own 1000 compact discs which easily would fill one up.  having this little thing has made my life so much easier because i take what i want with me in a small compact player that still has all the nice parts of the bigger ones.  if you're contemplating getting one for the same reason i highly suggest it.    although carrying 60 days of non-stop music is cool, it seems overkill to bring on a weekend out or for a run if that makes sense.  so yeah, splurge, its cheap when you consider what you're getting which is an excuse to rock out at all times.        also, all the other reviews are right about the nano scratching really easily.  for some reason they have put a solid piece of glossy clear (not colored white or black) plastic over the entire front of the player so any fingerprints show up right away even on the white version(and god forbid you each fish and chips and touch the thing right?).  so, i'd say a cover is a must to prevent that if you're picky about nics and scratches.  that's why i'm only giving it 4 stars.  apple still finds new ways, aside from the deminishing battery thing we've all accepted even though we shouldn't, to make us want to replace them sooner rather than later.  otherwise of course, the nano rocks.

<Title>Apple has another winner
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the iPod Nano about a week or so ago, and have been using it periodically since then.    First things first: 1GB is a good size if you're only going to use this at the gym, in the car, or for when you're out for a walk.  However, if you have any notions of storing your entire music collection on a portable MP3 player, do yourself a favor and go for an iPod with more storage.    That out of the way, the Nano is one of the most attractive pieces of audio equipment I've ever seen.  Other brands try to compete (Creative, SanDisc, etc) but they pale in comparison to the iPod, which combines intuitive menus, sleek looks, and good value.    Here's a breakdown of how I've evaulated the 1 GB iPod Nano:   Sound Quality: 4/5   MP3s, try as they might, do not have quite the same sound quality as CDs.  Will you notice a difference?  Probably not, especially if you're out and about with ambient noise surrounding you, and playing the music through the cute, but average earbuds.  Many iPod owners upgrade the earbuds first, opting for a different design, or something that's more comfortable with a better dynamic range.  Still, out of the box, these sound pretty decent, provided you're using a decent quality MP3 recording.    Battery Life: 3/5  You get plenty of play time (the manual says something like 14 hours) on one charge.  I haven't tested that fully, but I know that the battery lasts long enough for my workouts, and for walking around.  Also, Apple will tell you that their battery may need replacement, an expense that might cost between $40-$80.  Cheaper options are available, for the DIY type.    Features: 4/5   For an MP3 player, this thing is packed with pretty nice features.  The only thing missing would be an FM radio receiver, which other brands (Samsung) offer.  Yes, you can purchase an accessory that will tune in radio stations, but they are overpriced.  Still, you'll have the ability to use the Nano as a portable file storage device (think flash drive), and also store pictures (though the screen is pretty tiny).  You can also sync the iPod with your Outlook Calendar, and store your Contacts.        Portability: 5/5   I can't think of anyone who would have a problem bringing this little unit with them anywhere they want.  If anything, it's TOO small, and might get lost in deep pockets.  All in all, for portable music playing at a good price, I think the Nano is pretty tough to beat.

<Title>Great little player!!
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3-type player, and it rocks! Holding more than 200 songs, it weighs 1.5 ounces and is as small as you'll want it to get (if it got any smaller, it'd be breakable!). But the Ipod nano is sturdy and sleek.  Pros-      Size- Fits in any pocket. Half the size of a cell phone.   Screen- 1.5 inch LCD screen sounds small, but is very colorful and fills up the Ipod.    Click Wheel- innovative and very easy to get used to.   Extras- stopwatch, games(solitare, music quiz, brick and parachute), photo capability, and much more. You can even rate songs by star rating.    Sound- don't let size fool you-it packs a punch! You can adjust the sound to bass booster, vocals booster, bass reducer, ect..  Cons-     Scratches- I am soooo lucky I kept the screen protector on. Do the same. Buy some kind of case or holder for the whole thing. Makes life scratchless and fragile.   Setup- It takes a bit to get Itunes going, coming from a person  who isn't a technician.    Battery life- you will need to charge it in much less than 14 hours listening time. They don't include the variables of lighting, scrolling, volume, browsing, ect...  Overall- great music player, very worth it for 140 bucks. Very recommended.

<Title>Ipod Nano is a quality product and couldnt ask for more for the price.
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have recently purchased a 1gb ipod nano. First of all this is a awesome product. Apple knows what they're doing with mp3 players. If you're looking at some other brand of mp3 players, think twice. With the ipods you know what you're getting. It is a great product and is very simple to use.    It is very compact, holds over 200 songs, color screen, click wheel is great, clear LCD screen, and has many features. You can store your photos and your favorite songs in this great package. It is great if your looking to get away from those space consuming cd's because you can store the same amount of songs in this tiny package as you would in about 17 cds. It even has some games if you're interested in that sort of thing.   A couple of things that you should purchase immediately after getting your ipod is a  full body protector, which is a plastic cover that goes over the front and back of the ipod to prevent scratches. You can find those at local retail stores and it is definitely worth the money. You should also get a case. Try to avoid silicone cases because they will scratch. If you want something that will not show the scratches as much buy the white version. The color plays no role in what you're getting so choose which ever you prefer.   I gave it 5 stars because it is an excellent product and is worth every cent of what you pay.

<Title>Neat little gadget.
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a first-time Ipod buyer/user and I found this 1GB Nano pretty neat. The pros (notably its size and its sound quality) outweigh the cons, I think, so it's something to HIGHLY consider when you're searching for a new MP3 player.  Pros: - Yeah, it's amazingly small. Its face is about the size of a cell phone but a fraction of the width. What I'm trying to say is it fits almost anywhere. - I like the design. Both its USB port thing and headphone connection are on the bottom of the player. Most cases that come with a lanyard sets the Nano upside down so having the headphone jack on the bottom is pretty nifty. - For such a small gadget, the full-color display screen is great, especially since the player can also carry... - ...pictures. You can also make it carry your Contacts Lists and Calendar by synchronizing it with Microsoft Outlook. - Other MP3 players' menu can be a bit cluttered. The same thing goes for the Nano, but only if you let it (you can customize what you can see or hide in its main menu).  Cons: - Okay, it's small... but it's almost too small to the point where it seems like it's too fragile. A case (preferably a hard-case, which is sold separately) is MANDATORY if you want it to survive its first year. Anyway, the case also guards it from scratches and dust, both of which seem to love the player. - I had trouble uploading photos to the Nano (you need to have Itunes to transfer stuff to it). Although I've found a way to do so, having it work the way it's instructed in the manual would've been great. - Apple needs to rethink their non-user-replaceable batteries. Once the battery exceeds its charge/recharge life, you need to send it to Apple to have it replaced... for $60.  The last item is why I gave this product only 4 stars. One can save money from it (do the calculation) and it protects the environment in a way, but just the thought of having to send it back to the company and waiting for them to send it back is just a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, it's a neat little gadget, a nice music player that does much more. Next to my wallet, cell phone, and keys, it's one of those things I carry around with me all the time whenever I'm not home.

My sister has a 30G iPod and I didn't want something that big (or expensive!). I got my 1G iPod nano from Walmart, which had it at the reasonable price of $147, I believe. I love this slimness and the quality of playback, along with how it fits easily into my hand. It's practically weightless, which is nice when going for a walk. I used to take my Discman with me, but this outshines that by far!   The only drawbacks are two: 1) it doesn't hold a charge for very long (maybe 4-5 hours) and 2) it doesn't hold 240 songs... mine is maxed out right now at 171, which is probably because some of my songs are longer than three minutes.  I am going on a trip abroad soon and the two drawbacks are tempting me not to take it. But I figure, with years of using a Discman, I think an iPod will be just fine.

It is limited to 1GB, but it is all I need. I listen to my podcasts and keep up with information I never had time to before. I bought this refurbished for half the price, it couldn't be better.

<Title>Big improvement over the Shuffle!
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My 1 gig iPod shuffle died.  The 60 gig iPod Photo I use continues to plug away, but I need something smaller and lighter so I can have my tunes when I'm active - like doing yardwork or at the gym.  So I decided to replace my 1 gig Shuffle with the 1 gig Nano.  It's almost the same weight, the Nano is thinner yet a little wider, so it fits in the pocket nicely and is only slightly more expensive than the 1 gig Shuffle.  And the Nano, like all iPods, shuffle songs too.    The Nano even has a great color screen!  So now when I'm out and I hear a song from my music collection that I'm not familiar with or I forgot who did it, I can pop it out of my pocket and check the color screen.  I couldn't do this with the Shuffle.  I strongly recommend getting a cover or "skin" for the Nano because it's easy to scratch it.

Sure it's an ipod, I guess you all want to be cool (FYI not all MP3 players are ipods, that is just ignorant). If you want something that has terrible battery life, horrible durability, is WAY overpriced and so trendy that everyone has to have one just because it says Ipod, here you go. But I would reccomend a zen mirco or one of samsung's players before this junk.  STAY AWAY!

<Title>Great starter MP3 player (last year's model)
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my daughter so she would have one device with which she could listen to all her songs, instead of carrying aound (and damaging) her favorite CD's.  She has a bad habit of losing or misplacing things, so we didn't want to spend a lot of money initially.  Our family has been through other MP3 players (Rio's, Compaq's) and never liked having to have separate software and connecting wires/batteries for each, and weren't particularly happy with the other ones anyway.  The Apple software is a little different than the others, but the more you play with it, the easier it gets.  The unit itself sounds great, is compact enough to stick in a pocket, charges and syncs songs from the same cable, and it fairly easy to add/remove songs (and showing you how much space you have left on the unit is wonderful). However, there's no way you can get as many of today's songs on a unit as Apple says you can (older songs clocked out at about 3 minutes).

<Title>It's alright... I guess...
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's an iPod. So by default, it's a pretty cool item to own.   It's easy to use and easy to learn all the controls and menus and whatnot, but I don't like that, with all clickwheel iPods, you have to look to make sure you're hitting the right button because it's so flat and smooth.  Another annoyance is that within an hour of owning my iPod (I purchased it mid-September), the whole metal backside was all scratched up, especially on the corners. If only my case had arrived at my house when my iPod did...  One other thing that really bugged me is that iTunes was really really weird. At my dad's house, it was fine even though I had to install my own iTunes (my brother also had an iPod that he used that computer for). However, at my mom's house, I have yet to figure out how to use her iTunes when she has all thirty bajillion of her songs in the library, and I only want the songs from mine. iTunes is definitely something that needs work.  All in all, my iPod is one of my favorite electronic toys! I love waking up to it (I own an iHome clock/alarm/radio) and I love listening to it in my free time. It's a pretty amazing little piece of plastic.

I would have liked to have gotten a larger memory version, but for only 1GB and the price, this little player holds a lot of songs.  It is easy to use, and it is very durable.  I have about 192 songs on my iPod currently and I still have room for a few more.  Its a little more exprensive than other MP3 players, but this is worth the money, hands down.  I would definately purchase another one.

<Title>James Bond's MP3 player
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Smaller than I had any reason to beileve, when you open the box and find this little sliver of technology it looks like a gadget Q hands to James Bond: a very sexy little nicknack, and it performs beautifully. So far, after taking my Nano on a transAtlantic vacation and back, I've not had a problem with battery life -- it recharged fine when I plugged the USB connector into the back of an antiquated PC, which did not have iTunes -- and the 1GB capacity fitted my needs perfectly. Be sure to rip your CDs in ACC format, which compresses them down considerably, and you'll end up with 250-270 songs or 16 to 17 hours of audio material and quality is decent. I did consider paying twice the price for 4GB, but that only led to insanity: why not pay another $100 or so for 20GB, or $400 for 60GB? I tell you why: I did not want to spend $400 on a Walkman, and I had no desire to carry every single piece of my music collection around with me. I am more selective with my listening. That is why I prefer the Nano to a Shuffle; I like to pick and choose. The only other thing I can add is shop around for your choice of protective case -- some are hideously over-priced, some are completely useless. I settled on a Tuffwrap Accent for $20 at Target, which looks very cool and has so far done the trick in keeping my little Bond gadget pristine.  Why did I pick this over Samsung or cheaper 1GB MP3 players? Convenience and compatibility. I am a Mac user and did not want yet another operating system cluttering up my desktop alongside iTunes and all my other iGadgets. Nothing to do with being cool or trendy.

<Title>Overpriced...or so I thought
<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, so I don't do much music listening anywhere but my car, so I decided that I just wanted something big enough to hold two or three hundred songs, and thats it. My choices were the 1 gb ipod, or a psp. I liked the idea of having a web browsing feature with the psp, and the fact that I could play games was a plus too, so I decided to shell out the extra 100 bucks and just get the psp. BIG MISTAKE. What I'd find was that I couldn't web browse or hold any music on the psp until I bought a 1 gb memory card. There goes another 100 bucks. In all honesty, it would have been better to just buy the ipod with the 1gb feature built in. When all was said and done, I spent well over 300 dollars on the psp for memory card, usb port and ear buds. I could have gotten the 60gb! So, the moral of this story is; if you think the ipod is overpriced, consider your other options carefully. More ofter than not, you'll find that if music is your main priority, ipod is the way to go. 150 bucks is a steal.

<Content>Please be aware. People are complaining about their ears aching. Well, that's because u're damaging your ears. When u're rollerblading, running/jogging, or on a bike, u usually crank up the volume 10 times higher because the wind is blowing against u or away from you. People don't realize that u're damaging your ears especially with the earplugs. It's best to use ear phones that surround your outer ears instead of earplugs that aime the device directly in your inner ear.

You have to go back to the beginning of the chapter again to pick up any vital information you may have missed.  That can take almost 1/2 hours if you were close to the end of the chapter.

<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I walk daily. I always carried a bulky "portable" CD player so I could really enjoy my walk with music. That got old FAST, but I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg of an iPod. I found the Nano and was instantly curious. I saw the 1 GB (up to 240 4 minute songs or so) and new it would be just what I needed, so I bought one.   I loaded it up with about 153 songs and charged it up. It was all set in about 3 hours after I hooked it up and so I had to test it out!  My first outing with it had me floored. You can pick an EQ setting that suits your tastes and enjoy, which is awesome. The only real negative thing I can say is the included ear bud earphones are OK, but a bit uncomfortable. I love the fact that you can put it on shuffle play and lock it so volume, or anything else stays as it should. The size and weight are absolutely incredible. It fits in my pocket, and I never notice it's there.  It has a few games built in, but they tend to drain the battery charge. The best way to prolong the charge is to set it up, and let it play.  This is my first MP3 player, and I love it

<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a software problem the minute I plugged the nano into my computer.  It took me about 4 hours to find out that this is a common problem with the nano.  Apple tech support told me how to solve it by downloading updated software from their website.  Just make sure and download it with Antivirus and Antispyware off first.  Haven't had a problem with it since.

<Content>I received the iPod quickly which was a plus. But it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs. I had friends who have the same iPod try to fix it and it never worked. I sent it back and requested a refund. It has been a month and a half and I have YET to get my $120 back.

<Title>iPod Nano 1 GB - great buy for the price
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had some bit of troublt with MP3 players in the past.  I started out with a 128 MB mp3 player which ran on AAA batteries.  It broke in 2 months. then it was a black Creative Zen Micro - stay away nothing but trouble.  Then I went out and baught my Black 1 GB iPod Nano.  In this I learned that the iPod's were everything but overrated. I loved it, though it was a little small in capacity for my growing music collection.  Pros: Flash Memory: Flash memory is amazing it is like the RAM in a computer but it holds the information when it is off.  This "Flash Memory" won't erase songs with a jolt (like the hard drive players) and it gives smoother playback.  SMALL: This item amazed me by it's size.  It is tiny. Perfect for jogging, though its almost too small; when i first got it I forgot it was in my pocket and almost jumped in a river.  I just shows its lightweight.  iTunes: iTunes is great.  It is easy to sync.  I really don't know what people are talking about when they say sync-ing is hard.  Its as simple as loading your sonds into the library and buying songs and then selecting all of the one's you want by holding down "ctrl" or "shift" then dragging to the sidebar where your iPod is listed.  Cons: Scratches: I have given up on the constant battle against scratches, it is inevitable.  So I have given up with my case and determined that I'm fine with scratches.  Capacity: I did not realize when I bought this that 1 GB is as small as it is.  I need more.  Final analasis: 4.7/5  I think I may buy the 2nd Gen. Nano 8GB.  NOTE: When buying anything with capacity (especially MP3 Players and Hard drives) get it with a capacity that is more than you need.  The sizes aren't exact, and the companies round up.  The 1 GB iPod is actually .90 of a GB.

<Title>Do more research on other brands
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like this Nano, but not nearly as much as I thought I would. After months and months of saying I would NEVER give in to the iPod craze, I finally bought this Nano about 6 months ago when it went on sale. At first I loved it. But I have listened to it a lot, and it seems that the buttons and the click-wheel have started to slow down or something. Also, iTunes has really slowed down and messed up my computer. I recommend researching other brands of mp3 players before you give into this iPod frenzy that has swept the nation. What you get isn't really worth what you paid for. But if you're not going to use it as much as I do, and you have a Mac that can handle iTunes better than a regular PC, then you're probably going to be happier with your purchase than I am.

<Title>Unbelievably easy, small, amazing!!
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Never having been an Apple person, I got moved to buy the Nano after buying a Shuffle for my niece's birthday.  This thing is amazing.  It is so much easier (not to mention exponentially smaller) than my prior MP3 player--which will now be relegated to use as an external hard drive for my PC.  I love it!!  Don't tell my husband, but I'm sure I'll think the 1GB isn't enough space and generously offer this one to him very soon so that I can get the 2 GB, no probably the 4 GB one.

<Date>Tue Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the iPod Nano about 4 months ago and have been very pleased with it. If you have the money, I definately recommend the Nano. I also strongly recommend getting the 2-year replacement plan with it for two reasons...  1. The battery will typically only hold a charge for 12-18 months. It costs something like $80 to replace the battery. Paying the additional $25 is worth it in the long run.(I have a sister that works at BestBuy who advised me of this)  2. My nano quit working after about 3 months. Because I had the replacement plan, I was able to have it replaced for free. I have heard that Nanos will often times do this, so its better to be on the safe side, especially when spending that amount of money.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 1 GB nano recently, after having used an iRiver MP3 player that only held 28 songs for years.  I figured it was time to upgrade and since I had heard so many good things about iPod's, I bought one.  The first couple of times I used it was only about 1/2 hour each time, and it worked great.  I was very happy with the purchase.  However, I took it on a trip after that and the battery didn't even last 5 hours.    Yesterday I turned it on and and I couldn't access my music.  I would hit Menu and Music, and then the apple logo would come up and nothing.  I could only listen to my music by putting it on Shuffle mode.  If I wanted to buy an iPod shuffle, I wouldn't have spent so much money on this nano.  Pros:  Sound quality is great.  Easy to use when it does work correctly.  Cons:  iTunes is not the easiest application to use. Player does not work on a consistent basis. Poor battery life.  I'm going to have to return this player and am disappointed it didn't work correctly.

<Title>What a great little Apple product!
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are not a lot bad things that you can say about the Apple Ipod Nano 1 Gig model.  It is an amazing little piece of equipment that has a nice bright color screen, is so small that you forget you have it, and is very easy to use even for some body that has never used an MP3 player before buying the Nano. In addition, this model stores enough songs for me (about 500, 2 to 4 minute songs) to be happy with until the next time that I get switch song via the very easy to use Itunes software that Apple also produces.  Of course, you can use every Ipod as a portable storage unit just as you could a flash drive which is handy.  The sound quality of the unit is very good and one of my favorite features is being able to make play lists on the go without a computer.  Since I have owned this unit I have perfectly happy with it and this is some one that traded down from a 4G, 30 gig video Ipod and have an XM radio Pioneer Inno.  If you are you going to work out you want to buy a workout sleeve to put around one of your arms and probably some upgrade headphones that are easier to have in your ears for an extended period of time.  But other than that the Apple Ipod is a 5 star and then some plus product.

<Title>An awesome product
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my iPod Nano. I had a cheapy MP3 player from Wal-Mart that lasted a total of 7 months. I didn't like that one because it was only a shuffle, you couldn't listen to the songs you wanted, and the battery life sucked. I knew I needed another one, because after not having to deal with CDs for a couple of months, I didn't want to go back. I knew that iPod is the popular choice, I didn't even know about all the awesome features it comes with, so I saved some money and bought one. I was amazed at what the little thing does. Even though you see pictures of it held up next to packs of gum and stuff, you still don't know just how little and cute it is until you're holding one straight from the box for the first time.  The only reason this did not get 5 stars, is because the battery life isn't quite what I expected. It lasts about 8 hours, not 12. Which, if you're switching from a cheapy MP3 player, is pretty good. And you don't need to keep buying batteries, because it hooks directly to your computer for charging. I like that because when it needs to be charged, I can just hook it up and listen to some music while browsing the internet. Very handy. I would totally suggest buying one. Unlike what some people say, it isn't made out of cheapy plastic. If theirs is, mine isn't. Mine is made out of a very durable glass type material. I have dropped the thing numerous times, and it's still running. It's definitely worth the money.

<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm really enjoying my Nano. I bought it to replace an old and well-used mPio that I used for running. Although I've had to invest in several different attachment methods (skins, clips, armbands, necklace) to find the best system for me, I'm very pleased with the result. Prior to purchase I struggled with memory/price variables and am happy with the 1-gig memory I ultimately bought. It is more than adequate to hold 8-CDs of language instruction, plus several albums of my favorite music. Nano/iTunes hardware/software is easier to use, once I figured out the menu logic, than that of the mPio. My only complaint is that there seems to be no way to store all of my music in the iTunes Library and NOT have it update when I recharge. Since my Nano is only 1-gig, it can't hold my entire library of music at one time and iTunes wants to randomly choose what to install. I want control of what is installed without having to store it elsewhere on my computer.

<Content>I am extremely happy with my Nano purchase. This is my first experience with this type of product and I don't have anything to compare it to, but overall I feel it was well worth the price. It's compact, lightweight and easy to use, although I do wish a paper manuel was included as I had to download that off the internet. The itunes software is fairly easy to comprehend once you know the basics. The battery, when fully charged does not last as long as I expected, but for my use it is acceptable. All in all, I LOVE my NANO..

<Title>The hype is right
<Date>Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a shuffle 512MB which was fine. But after awhile I needed to identify the music and spoken word selections I was listening to. The Nano Black filled the bill. Personally, I don't think the earphones Apple supplies with their iPods is the greatest. So I use a headphone, both the open type and the cover-the-ear type for better sound quality and comfort.  What can one say about the Nano that isn't already known? You know what they look like - you've seen folks on subways, busses, street, office, school fiddling intermidably with them. It is small, light, and slick. The so called 'click' wheel works well, although, since I read manuals only as a last resort, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to get to the next song or change the volume (you do both by rotating your thumb around the circle - hint hint).   Great sound from it, though, assuming you have good earphones. One doesn't seem to be able to crank up the volume beyond a safe listening level. I think there was a lawsuit about that - someone claimed his hearing had been hurt by an iPod playing too loud (what's wrong with his thumb?) - so Apple may have changed the software to limit the volume. I'm sure you wouldn't want to ruin your hearing at age fourteen, anyhow, would you?  Compared to the shuffle, the connector on the bottom allows many accessories to be used with the Nano. Radio, Bose speaker, microphone, etc. Geek it out to the hilt.  Of course, Apple is planning a replacement soon, Heh, Heh, Heh... You didn't think this Nano was obsolescence proof, did you?  But it's a device lots of people enjoy, so if you don't sit on it after stuffing it in your back pocket, it should give you a suitable ration of enjoyment for a while.  Recommended.

<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Everything about the Nano is nice, except for its stratospheric price.  Yeah it's sexy, sleek, cool, and oh by the way, it also plays music. The slick click wheel is still there and the color LCD looks great. The photo album feature is useless however; don't expect to carry around pics to show people because the screen is too small for that.  Once you get past the cool factor, it's really just a lithium ion battery powering some Samsung flash memory, an LCD, etc in a metal/plastic housing. So is it worth it? The $/MB is just too high at $150/GB. The 4GB is a better value at $62/GB but this all depends on how much music you have.  Also nice is the plethora of accessories for the IPODs. Some of the home mini stereo systems that charge and play the IPOD are pretty sweet and of course, also pricy.
