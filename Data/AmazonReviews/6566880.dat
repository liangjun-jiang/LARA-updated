<Title>A Disaster!

<Content>1. Packaging is enough to discourage anyone without lots of strength and a sharp knife.  2. Comes with a useless short strap attached.  I guess it's for your thumb.  There is a longer strap, but the "instructions" say nothing about how to attach it.  3. The software installed all right, but it is impossible to paste a file (in my<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MF0QLG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-0101037-3306520">2GB Hydra MP3 Player Pink</a> case, a WMA file, which is supposed to be supported), into the player.  The instructions tell you to "open the drive" in Windows Explorer, which I did.  They then tell you to "right-click on the Removable Disk window and click Paste in the menu.  Paste is not available, rendering the product absolutely useless.  And what, if anything, does "splash resistant" mean?  If you could find a strap that functioned, could you wear it in the shower?  Well, moot point, since the thing is useless and headed back to the store!
