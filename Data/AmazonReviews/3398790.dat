<Title>BARELY OKAY FOR A YOUNG PERSON
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 9 yr old. After several attempts of trying to download music using the included driver/software I realized I DIDN'T have to use it since I was on XP...though I didn't see any paperwork alluding to this.  The software kept freezing up, but my computer recognized the MP3 player drive and I was able to just copy the songs onto the unit.   The quality of sound isn't bad, though, for the price I paid.  Doesn't have a lot of extra features, but it works and is exciting for my 9 year old. The only issue I have now is the built-in battery which doesn't seem to charge; it charged initially but not after it drained for the first time. I've had some pretty good luck recently getting ahold of the company, they only give an email address, and according to them they said it sounds like I have faulty unit.

<Title>My humble review for this MP3 player...
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I impulsively bought this MP3 player at my local CVS since I was able to use my CVS card, and get a discount.  However, the old adage of `you get what you pay' for certainly applies here.  As the other reviewer stated, this is great for a 9 year old, or someone who can't afford a more expensive MP3 player, but after reading his helpful review, I didn't experience quite the same problems as he.  However, what I didn't like about the overall product is:  1] the sparse instructions.  The cd that comes with the package is obviously smaller than your average cd and this is because? No explanation.  2]  how do you download music so you can start enjoying your new player right away? Got me, and I read the directions several times in the hopes of possibly finding something that I had missed.  3]  after doing a Google search to learn how to down load music, I discovered that I didn't need the cd that came with it at all. All I had to do was upgrade my Windows media player, and save songs that are in the mp3 format.  When you hit the sync button, after the player is plugged into the pc using the USB port, it recognizes the device and I was able to drop and drag a few songs over.   4]  Playback quality isn't bad but the ear buds phones that come with it? Oh my goodness, they have to be `the' worst ear buds I've ever had the misfortune of using. They're made of this rock hard material that doesn't conform to my ear, and after an hour or so of stuffing them in, I had enough.  Apparently so did the buds because they would fall out quite often.    Again, lucky me - my player's battery seems to be charging okay, and so far I haven't had a problem with that; I just wish the good people at Craig had taken more time to think through the directions and the quality of the ear buds.

<Title>It's not terrible...
<Date>Tue May 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is... okay... I guess.  I bought it about six months ago at the CVS I work at because it was on sale on Black Friday for $30.  I definitely got what I paid for.  Pros:  Good Sound Quality Flash Memory is very durable Good size-  nice and compact so it can fit in your pocket.  Cons:  Only held about 110 songs Can't make playlists Not a very intuitive interface  Problems I've had: -No easy way to scroll through music- you have to use next song button to go one at a time. -The Headphone jack was screwed up... I had to have the headphones plugged in exactly halfway in order to hear through both ears, when pushed in all the way, you could only hear in one.  This means that the jack falls out a lot, and sometimes the sound crackles because of that. -The Screen broke within a week.  It is now sort of loose inside. -The software I got was not compatible with Windows XP, or even with my old Windows 98, even though it said it was.  I had to transfer files myself as if it was a flash drive, and not an mp3 player. -My sister's player did not even ship with the right USB cable.  It was too big to fit into the slot, so she had to use mine. -Hers no longer turns on.  She listened to it maybe twice.  Overall, I only recommend buying this if you're on a tight budget.  You get what you pay for.  I'm buying an iPod in a few weeks because I need something that's better.  So that's my two cents.  Hope it helps.

<Title>EXCELLENT player with GREAT sound!
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me first say I got this 'Craig' MP3 player at 'CVS' on sale for just under twenty bucks (phenomenal deal)!  I already have a 'Creative Zen' player, and i've got to say this 'Craig' player looks and sounds just as quality (use better 3rd party headphones instead of the very mediocre 'ear buds' that came with it).  I run 'Windows XP', and didn't even need to install the driver software for this great little player (it's LITERALLY 'plug & play' with 'XP'!).  I just burn the CD tracks to my PC, then choose 'send to' the respective USB slot.  Each song takes literally a few seconds to transfer to the 'Craig'.  My only beef is that I wasn't able to get the Craig to 'recognize' the 'Napster' files I sent to it.  Maybe I missed something, or does 'Napster' not allow transfer to MP3 players?  In any case, most of the music I want to hear is on CD, so this will work well for me.  I also wish to mention the built in graphic equalizer on the display is very cool.  It's neat to see the many bars jump up and down to the music, and the track time display is nice too.  It's amazing how 'Craig' was able to get all this information nicely packed onto such a tiny screen!  All in all, a very good MP3 player, and a steal if you can find them real cheap on sale.

<Title>Cheap, in every since of the word
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this last year at my CVS on sale for about 20 bucks.  At the time, I had an ipod and didn't really mess with the Craig.  I recently picked it up again and I've put songs on it but can not get it to switch between songs.  I've contacted Craig but have not heard back yet.
