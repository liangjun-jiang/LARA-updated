<Title>Got What I Wanted
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like the zen.  This is my first mp3 player and I probably took way too long searching and reviewing my options.  I have only had to reset it once, I believe that was the first night I got it and I think it was my fault.  I dont really have any complaints, I like that fact that it has a SD card slot.  4gb is plenty of space for me.  It is small and sexy.  The chicks dig its credit card size.  Some of my roomates have bought one after they saw and played with mine.  It is very easy to use and I have not even loaded the software onto my computer.  I just use Windows Media and click and drag.  Sometimes I feel the buttons are cheap but to get over that I just listen to music and think about the price I payed for it and it was a steal...$89.

<Title>it doesn't auto advance folders!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>okay so i've had this for a day so far, and more or less i like it except for one very important fact for me!!!...  the unit doesn't auto advance music albums? what gives? i actually own a vision W as well and that one works just fine, auto advances music albums no problems and you manually advance them as well. well on the little zen apparently they got rid of that feature. now while that may not be a huge issue for some people it is a HUGE issue for me. say you have only a few songs from a given artist, well the player stops after it has played those songs. it should just auto advance to the next available album but it doesn't. other then that very annoying fact it works jus like the vision w does in terms of the navigation of the player.  oh and for me when i installed the software on my system it took forever to install versus the software i installed for the vision w. the little zen also, seemed to have installed useless software as well. just put it manual mode when installing the software.  to summarize, if you're like me and need the auto advance feature for music albums then don't get this.  for me i think i'll be going back to sony.

<Title>Don't even try it.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After Zen spend 2 hours constantly uploading more and more software onto my desktop, it wouldn't even let me transfer a single itunes song to it. Sure, it says it's possible, but after days and days of trying to convert this and uploading that, I just gave up. A BIG waste of money.

<Title>Very quality product for the money spent
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen (4GB) is a very quality personal media player. I trust in Creative products having owned a Creative Zen Micro for more than 2 years and I love it. Creative did a great job making the Zen, it is pretty small and light, and exactly the size of a credit/debit card. I feared that the buttons or the actual player would be too small for my big hands but it hasn't been an issue. It looks nice on the outside, and looks attractive. At first it felt cheap and breakable, but after holding it for awhile it felt better and I feel safe putting it in my pocket. The screen is amazing, the colors/sharpness make images look incredible and sharp. It's like a mini HD screen, seriously. The UI is very nice and many options and customization options are present. The buttons depress with a click and I never have to press any button more than once to make it work. The shortcut button is nice. The included software is very simple and it gets the job done well although it has bugged out a few times by not locating the data on the player. The sound quality is good, can't really compare it to anything though and the bass boost and equalizer are nice additions. Battery life is good from what I've seen so far. Haven't used the SD slot yet. Nice radio. Included earbuds suck. I personally think that no other player exists of this quality for this price and I'm glad I didn't decide to buy an overpriced Ipod Nano.

<Title>Not bad for the price
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had this player for about a month and had to return it because; when i resumed playing certain video files, the audio and video would not be synched. also it tended to lock up a lot, randomly and had to search around for a paper clip or something small enough to insert into the reset button. (not good on a 40 minute subway ride to work with no paper clip). other than that this is a pretty good mp3 player for the price. just be aware that it's no zune or ipod touch.

<Title>Top Quality MP3 Player - Great Value
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have finally upgraded from my Zen microphoto to this, and what a difference!! I have successfully put all 1700 songs straight across using the easy Creative music software. Album art can now be displayed on the fab TFT screen - excellent resolution and clarity for that, and all the graphics you want to display. My 2GB SD card slotted straight in and this allows me to view movies, pics and other music from that too. Very durable, light and capable - but a player case/protector/skin is a good investment. Sound quality is excellent, and it plays MP3, AAC, WMA and DivX. The FM radio is very good, and it now stores your favourite stations. All in all, a very capable player, and the Amazon price is VERY competitive. Highly recommended.

<Title>Couldn't Get Protected WMA files working
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I couldn't get this product working with Protected WMA files. I interacted with online support for about 2 weeks via email (live support only 9AM-6PM central M-F, right when I'm working). Some of the steps: Upgraded FW, upgrade Windows Media Player 10 with updates, upgraded to Windows Media Player 11, reformatted, and reset to name a few. Protected files always get a playback error at the end of the song and eventually hang. I returned the unit to Creative and they sent me a new one, it had the same issue. I'm returning to Amazon for a refund and look for a more reliable player. By the way, the songs playback on the PC, my wife & son's MP3 players, so I don't think the files (or transfer mechanism) are the issue.  Too bad, nice form factor and screen seemed to have decent resolution.

<Title>Zen vs Nano G3
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have an iPod Nano Gen 3 and I like it a lot, but needed to get another MP3 player because the wife wanted one too, so I decided to try the Zen.  The iPod is great because it interfaces with so many accessories (I have a nice little desktop stereo that allows you to control the iPod through the stereo remote, and a I have a little FM transmitter so I can play my mp3s on the road via the car radio) I also found the iPod way more stylish then the Zen.  However, the iPod was more expensive, and all the Apple accessories are way overpriced.  Enter the Zen.  It is slightly bigger, but I like the bigger display better.  I also find it better for a runner because the volume control is not easily bumped (the touch wheel on the iPod is terrible when running).    The stock Zen earbuds are way better than the iPods.  Also, once you upgrade the firmware, it is much more windows friendly than the iPod/iTunes alternative (which still gives me multiple errors every time I sync, even after following all of Apple's tips).  The Zen firmware still has issues, but it has gotten more stable, and I hope they will continue to improve it.  One area that could use some work is album art.  It's a shame with all that display area, the album cover is so tiny.  They even have several views to show during music playback, but none of them do justice to the album art.  The iPod coverflow is great in this regard.  Another area that could use some work is the customization of the background.  With all those great photos they include, it's a shame not to be able to set an image like that as your background.  Note however, that you can not customize the background at all on the iPod, so Creative is already ahead in this area, I particularly like the purple background on the Zen display.  There are also functional bugs that need fixing, but Creative will sell a lot more of these things if they tap the full potential of that beautiful display.  Overall I like both the iPod and the Zen each for different reasons and I would give them each 4 stars.  The iPod has the edge when it comes to interfacing with accessories, and in the style department.  The Zen has the edge with it's nicer display and ear-buds, better controls, and lower price tag.

<Title>Best player for the money available
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player rocks! Audio and Video you expect, the quality of both is outstanding. The voice recorder is a great feature not available on most units this inexpensive. It is one of my favorite secondary features. I can stop for a moment, record a fleeting thought, and go right back to my entertainment. The interface is clear, concise and idiot proof. I didn't even have to read the quick start guide. I bought the 4 gig unit, and already prefer it to a friend's 80 gig Ipod. Which is what I thought I was going to buy before I started researching what was out there. Do your homework, and you will probably buy one of these yourself.  I did crash it the first day. Ordered a replacement before  I saw the reset hole-push it with a pin, and it reinstalls it's op system, and comes right back up. (Amazon sent the replacement before I could cancel the shipment-What customer service!)

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this player for a little over a month now, and so far the experience has been good. However, having just replaced my IPod Mini with this player, my opinions may not be the most dependable when compared to other more enthusiastic electronics consumers. For my purposes, this player is perfect. The sound quality is great, and I find that the volume controls are much louder than the Ipod mini. The video has beautiful resolution and so far my videos have played just fine without any glitches. The cons: this player really IS a magnet for fingerprints and I have had it freeze up on me a few times while importing songs from my computer. However, this has been rare and the reset has fixed it. It is extremely lightweight, and it is easy to incorporate media directly from windows media player. For a while, I was quite upset that the battery didn't seem to last very long, but if you adjust the brightness of the screen to low when it is not in use and/or put the player on hold when you're just listening to music, I find that the battery life is much longer. Great alternative to Ipod in my opinion!

<Title>pretty good media player for the price
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After shopping around a bit, I finally settled for this player and am glad I did... you're pretty much not going to beat it for the price.   Pros: crisp and clear display, long lasting battery, expandable/removable memory (thanks to the SD card slot), crisp sound, small and thin but not *too* small and thin, sturdy (already dropped it quite a few times and it has held up well), attractive, the firmware is logical and easy to navigate  Cons: recent updates have caused this player to (evidently) no longer be compatible with Linux, the video converter is buggy (not too much of an issue as I prefer to manually convert my videos anyways and the converter changes everything to wma - I prefer xvid), the coating on the screen is rather soft and I have just been lucky in the fact I haven't gotten any scratches on it

<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had my zen for a few months now.I've owned a lot of mp3 players and also video/mp3 players.  Pros scratch resistance is great quick start up screen quality is above average considering price menu system is easy to figure out expandable memory exceptional audio/mp3 quality  Cons  no removeable battery and doesnt work with itunes  Reason I like it most: I use amazon Unbox video with my zen and it works great with unbox. Very easy for even a beginner to get new shows or whatever you like from amazon. I gave up on itunes long ago, so it doesnt matter if the zen cant be used with itunes, however, a lot of people still think itunes is good and they will have to buy an iPod  Full disclosure: You can check my reviews, I used to buy iPods but awhile ago I realized two things. 1. They are way overpriced and have limited functionality and 2. you have to deal with itunes. I have moved on and am very happy now. I dont hate apple or apple products, just have found better players to buy.

<Title>Very satisfied.
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player off of a third party retailer on amazon.  I recieved it 3 days after ordering, and paid about $90 for it, which was very reasonable in my opinion.  This player is everything it is cracked up to be and more.   Pros : Very clear, bright screen. I have mine on 20% brightness and it is just fine Easy installation of software Flawless conversion of non-supported video formats. Expandable with an SD card, which are cheap as dirt nowadays. Music quality is excellent. Video playback is stunning, for such a small screen. Can use content from iTunes (it even has a button on its management software that says "Get music from itunes") Back will not scratch easily as it is hard plastic. YOU CAN DELETE STUFF FROM THE PLAYER WITHOUT CONNECTING IT TO THE SOFTWARE!!!!!!  I love this feature, because the software used to put music on the player organizes the music by author name, so I got a few extra and unwanted songs from my computer by accident.  I was elated to find out that I could just delete them from the player, rather than having to hook it up, find the song, and delete it. Radio is crystal clear and automatically scans for stations that are coming in well, then sets them as your presets, with the push of one button. Price.  Try to find another player that has 4 GB plus expandability, video capacity, a great screen, and a good interface for under 100 dollars brand new. Menu configurability.  You have the ability to configure the main menu, to a degree.  Things that are normally submenus can be placed directly on the main menu, and you can choose to hide things on the main menu that you do not wish to use a lot, such as the recorder.  Neutral (These things neither add nor detract from the overall user experience) Menu system could be better, and is somewhat comparable to the ipod system, where there is a main menu set and then sub menus, sub-sub menus, etc. It is easy to get back to the main menu with a few pushes of the back button.  Configurability is a nice touch.  Also, it is easy to create playlists, and navigation is a breeze, as you can sort by album, artist, or just go to all songs, press the right arrow once to go to the alphabetical movement mode (pressing down goes from beginning of A to beginning of B, etc.)So this is almost a pro, but not quite. Recorder doesn't have the greatest quality, but you can easily tell what you were saying i when you play it back, and i didn't buy this for the recorder anyway.  It is basically just an added bonus for me.  Cons: Earphone jack placement is terrible, for me at least.  It is in the upper right hand corner, where I like to put my hand to hold it, and it is right in the way of the way I would prefer to hold it. Media software is a bit annoying in that media from other sources is displayed under the artists name in a folder, which can lead to confusion when you open the folder and see the album name, and the name is the same album that is under seven different artists as well.  This is only awkward if you have albums with a medly of artists, however.  Conclusion:  The amount of bang for your buck you get out of this player is incomparable to any other I have seen.  I would say that if you have your heart set on an ipod, you are going to be looking for flaws in this player, and small things are going to bother you.  However, as someone who has used ipods and found itunes to be irritating at times, and found ipods to be highly overrated, this is the player for you.  If you have your heart set onn an ipod, drop the extra 50 bucks on a nono, third gen.  But you'll be missing out on a lot.

<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was always in between buying ipod nano or this product. I also made an extensive research about mp3 players. finally my decision narrowed by observations on finding something that can help me to play video files. Creative plays the most extensive video files.In addition here is a radio. moreover here is the voice recorder whic is completely useful for me and good quality.The control panel for me functionns very well.I read some reviews that people thought that this control panel made it seem cheap. For me it is vise versa. I did not like even ipod touch. because inorder to operate or change the songs you need to see the screen. whit creATIVE i can memorize and change or operate the player whle it is in my pocket withour seeing its screen. it is cheaper than ipod nano and moreover it has more specifications than that. Ok here is the sound quality, it is just great. if you are so sensitive to sound quality my advice buy a good head phone. its original heasd phones are good. i tried sony headphones which costs $9.99 quality dropped but it is because of the headphones. Just relax and enjoy. here is a negative part I WISH IT COULD RUN BY BATTERIES SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE A COMPUTER  WITH A USB.

<Title>Choose Wisely
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After much research, here's how I categorized the features of a mp3 player to find a potential match. Just check which of these are important to you and compare against specs and ratings for the players at the top of the list  *AUDIO* -- Sound quality: max. bitrate, EQ functions, sound effects (surround, studio, movie etc) earphone quality -- Navigation: Access by title, artist, genre, year, highest rated or playlist -- Formats: Support for multiple formats like mp3, WMA, AAC, DRM support -- Ability to Rate songs -- Playlist support incl. On-The-Go playlists -- Shuffle: Random, intelligent (same year, same genre etc) -- Software: Drag & Drop ability, reliance on custom software (e.g. iTunes), ease of use, DRM restrictions, ease of buying or downloading, ease of conversion from other formats  -- Audiobooks: Ability to return to bookmark and support for popular formats like Audible.com   *PHOTOS & VIDEO* -- Has/Has Not: In other words - do you need support for photos or not? -- Screen: size, colors, display -- Software: Drag & Drop or custom conversion software & ease of conversion -- Orientation switch: support for landscape and portrait layout switching  *FUNCTIONS* -- Clock + Alarm: Has or has not. -- Organizer: Outlook support? -- Contacts: Syncing with Outlook etc -- Voice Recorder: Ability to record sound. Quality and max. bitrate supported. -- FM Radio: Digital tuner & ability to record from FM -- Line-In recording: Support for recording from any source (cassette player, turn-table) as long as you can plug into line-in.  *FINALLY* -- Storage: Capacity in GB. Flash or HDD based -- Battery life: How long on one charge? USB charging or DC adaptor? Standard USB port or custom port? -- Colors & Aesthetics: Does it look good to you? -- Form factor: Size, proportions, thinness (fitness for purpose - like gym, office, car etc) -- Accessories: Availability & cost -- Build Quality: I highly recommend walking into a store to hold one in your hands -- Tactile feel: Are the buttons right for you? -- Reviews & ratings  The Creative Zen met my considerations on this list. But I also own a Sony Walkman NWZ-A816 which excels at some other considerations like sound quality, form factor etc. Happy hunting!

<Content>I got this mp3 for my anniversary and I absolutely love it.  It shows the song you are listening to and the artist and shows a pic of the album cover.  Great features and I love that I can add more music using an SD card, although I can't imagine needing more than 4 gig unless I suddenly become a DJ.  I have loaded over 1300 songs on this bad boy and still have over a gig of space left.  Other owners of this player have had the problem that the screen freezes up, saying it is shutting down.  I had that when I first turned it on but I went ahead and let the battery run down so it would shut off, charged it back up, and it has been perfect ever since.  I love it.  Oh , and by the way, if you need a great FM transmitter for your car go for the Monster Radio Play 300.  Incredible!

<Title>Another satisfied Creative Labs customer
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Zen for about a month and love it! It's even motivated me to run the stairs every day at lunch. First off I've had two other Creative Labs MP3 players (MUVOs) so I'm familiar with the product name. Before I even received my Zen I bought a screen protector, skin, armband, AC and car charger package from a third party vendor for a great price. I also got a cassette adaptor for playing music in the car (the FM transmitter sucks). When I got my Zen I put on a pair of latex gloves, wiped the screen and put the "protection" on. It looks great. The software is very easy to use but I used it AND Windows Media Player to download music. First I had to clean up my music and video files on my computer. After that- piece of cake. I found a free program online where I can download YouTube videos and put them on my Zen in two simple steps. This probably is no big secret to you cognizanti, but it's great to know I can watch those stupid farting videos over and over wherever I am with my Zen. The earbuds are marginal so I got a better pair. Both audio and video qualities are EXCELLENT!!! Battery life is very good. I've had to reset my player once due to my own fault. Otherwise my Creative Zen has performed superbly. Even better value now that the price is cheaper than when I bought it. Oh well -

<Title>Love it - Great value
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned this Zen 4GB about 3 weeks and am very satisfied with it. It's about 2/3 the price of the same capacity Ipod and has additional features:  - Bigger screen - FM radio - SD Card slot  I've loaded 2 full-length movies onto a 2GB SD card as well as several YouTube music videos using AVI format. Haven't needed to use the Creative Software and they play very nice right from the card and still have 1GB left on a 2GB SD Card. I've watched movies on miniature LCDs before (a Palm Treo,  Ipod Nano, ...) and this slightly larger screen on the Zen makes a substantial difference in viewing.  While you're still only watching movies on a 2.5" screen, it's larger & better than other small-form devices.   I've used the FM radio at work a few times too.  There are 32 slots to preset FM stations. It scans and auto-sets them, and allows for manual tuning. You can type in the Station Call letters or give each preset slot a name using the keyboard tool on the player. The headphone cable acts as part of the antenna so if you use the radio without it jacked in the player gives you a message.  When I bought this I initially wasn't lured by the SD slot but have come to find it's actually pretty useful once you try it.  I have movies and photos on there and keep the player memory just for the MP3s.  You can save photos (from the card or the player memory) as Wallpaper and that will become the background image for all player functions.    I keep all my music in high-capacity MP3 format (320kbps) on my computer so can't speak to usage with Windows Media player or WMA format files, but other reviews mention it works well. I use Media Monkey as my PC music manager - it recognizes the Zen, let's you maintain most Zen features (except playlists) but most importantly for me MediaMonkey allows dynamic, on the fly downsizing of my MP3s from 320kbps down to 160kbps during the file transfers. It's customizable down to any bitsize format you want, but I prefer 160 when saving music to the Zen player.  I've got 760 tracks down there now and still  have a little room left (300mb).   The Zen allows customizing the menus, so, for example, I removed Voice Recorder from the main menus, added Random Play All as a main menu option, and have reordered the menus for my own preferences.   In short, it's all sort of little things that make this a sweet device.  My wife also really loves the larger format text and screen size just when playing back music - she uses the smaller Zen V but is hinting she wants an upgrade.  I have had to hit reset a couple times but have had no problem doing that - all computers need to get rebooted sometimes. I also have to hit reset on my son's Ipod Nano much more frequently. I haven't had to reset when just playing back tunes though - it seems it's when trying something such as function changes;  going from one thing to another. It's been very infrequent - not enough to rate a real con on the player in my opinion.  As also suggested in other comments here, after plugging the unit in and letting it charge up - before adding any tunes - I downloaded the latest firmware. This caused some initial issues as I couldn't boot the new update and got into a format/reload/reboot menu on the player. I think this may have had something to do with the way I ran the update - I chose an option to update all software at once including the PC drivers, Creative music software and the firmware during the setup.  I'm wondering if just doing the firmware first would have made that a cleaner experience.  I got a fresh copy of the firmware and re-ran that installation - all by itself this time - and it then booted up fine.   One last thing. There's a bug with Album Art where an Album Name is "Greatest Hits" or other common name. The art for all "Greatest Hits" albums is shared among all artists, using the art of the most recently installed Greatest Hits artist's album.  I confirmed this in the Creative user forums. So for example, you end up with art from Neil Young's Greatest Hits album when playing back Stevie Ray Vaughn's Greatest Hits. You either have to live with it for now or do as someone in the forum suggested (and I have done) and add in something to each artist's album named Greatest Hits, so, I added Neil Young onto the front of his Greatest Hits album.   Even with these few dings, I give the Zen 5 stars overall and prefer my player to my son's IPod (those have quirks, cons and dings too).

<Title>Sweet Little MP3 
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this product for about a month, and I love it.   Pros:   Its sleek, compact and beautiful. It does do everything it claims. The sound quality is great, the display screen is beautiful. The menus are easy to figure out, and the software easy to use. The firmware update is included in the setup, so you don't have to search online for it.   Cons: It did freeze up on me once when playing video. I only call this a con because of the mild heart attack it gave me when it happened. But a paper clip solved the problem and it hasn't happened since. The system reset itself and I lost no music, photos, or video. The player even started my video back where I was watching when it froze up.  I would recommend this player because it gives alot of bang for the buck.

<Title>Hidden problems.
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was delivered to me on a Friday and the following Friday night my neighbor and professional "geek" got it working. Upon opening it, I connected it to my computer, a laptop with xP and WMP 11, and immediately Windows Explore saw it as one of the drives and I used Windows Explore to drag and drop some music files. I was listening to it and reading the instructions that said to first install their software. I installed the software. That's when everything went south. No longer would it show up as a drive on my computer. I couldn't use Explore anymore and Creative's ZEN Media Explorer did not have the ability to move files or folders around within the player like you would expect with any USB mass storage device like a USB flash drive. I uninstalled their software. I could use WMP 11. It still wouldn't work with Explore. I took it to work and another computer with xP and WMP 11 accepted it, found the drivers, and worked with Explore. Another computer with xP and WMP 10 found the drivers. The ZEN showed up as a drive in Explore but the files could not be manipulated. Another computer did something else. A string of e-mails with Creative did not avail any solution. Customer service at Creative was, howerever, very responsive. If I wrote a help request before bed, an answer was waiting in the morning. The last advice was going to get me to mess with my computer's registry. Enter my neighbor. He goes into the control panel and finds the Zen under Portable Devices. He right clicks and uninstalls it. He unplugs the Zen and replugs it. This time the computer says that it found new hardware and then it went to find and install a driver. Success! It again works with Explore. I reinstalled the Zen software and it the computer said to connect the player to finalize installation. Now I'm back to the last Friday. The software messed it up but it contains the video converter. It seemed necessary. So I went back into the control panel and uninstalled the player and unplugged it and replugged it and Explore worked even with the Zen software. I experimented with the Zen software again and it made the player disappear as a drive in Explore. I repeated the uninstall / install process again and nothing has broken for four days. This sucker could be a lot more flexible. It requires Windows xP or Vista with WMP 10 or 11.   The radio works pretty well. It is sensitive enough to get most stations in stereo. The display is 320 by 240. It's very pretty. The Zen software runs all the time and so if you right click a picture (or other media), you have a choice to send it to the Zen. It automatically reduces the picture to 640 x 480 with some additional compression. Why not 320 x 240? But if i use Canon's Zoom Browser to reduce the photo to 320 x 240 resolution, and then try to send it to the  Zen from Zoom Browser, it can't find the Zen as a drive. I need to send the photo to a folder and then send it to the Zen from the folder. It should show up like a USB flash drive. The sound is good, but it could use more drive for less efficient headphones. It is probably typical. You can't browse the music in a "folder mode". That is, you can find music by playlists, artist, album, or genre but not by the way you organized the folders inside the player. The battery is not user replaceable like a Sansa E200 series player. If you are lucky, it will go dead inside the warrantee or last until you break the player anyway. The four way navigation button does not work well on my player. If I press around the center of the > button which should change the track or radio station, it activates the ^ button which changes the volume. I need to press the > button in the lower right corner to keep it from doing this. Don't want to charge it from a computer and think the Creative charger is to many $$ and should have come supplied with the Zen? You can find those 5 volt USB chargers all over the place. If you have a cell phone that charges through the mini USB port then you can use that. If you don't really need the 2.5" display and you don't mind the proprietary connector, the Sansa E200 with user replaceable battery and a metal back is probably a better, more friendly bet. Whatever you buy, even a $25 player, a good set of headphones will improve any player.

<Title>It's a Brick and a small Brick at that
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nice display.  Worked well until I tried to transfer a few mp3 files to the player.  Then in the process of the transfer it locked up and for the past few hours has been displaying 'Shutting down..."   It hasn't and even the reset button hasn't helped.  I'll leave it until the battery is drained and try again.  But I don't have much hope.  This one's a loser.  I usually like Creative players.  Can't recommend this one on my experience.  This one's going back.

<Title>Instructions suck
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-3649011-1477462">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a>  I spent a lot of time looking for an MP3 player and finally chose this one. However, I 've got at least three gripes:Poor instructions, the  mediocre headphones and the lack of a case.  I've had this 5 days  but I am still trying to figure out how to use it properly! Granted there is an online (rudimentary)help manual and the player did come with a quick start guide, but I don't think that's enough if you really want to get the best out of this player.  Why do manufacturers continue to provide scanty instructions? They spend millions on persuading us to buy stuff but not how to use them. All that will happen is that since I don't know how to use this properly , I'll end up using only the very basic functions, feel aggrieved about the money I spent and then vow to never buy a Zen product again!  As for the sound, I know other reviewers have been raving about the  quality but I feel I haven't had the chance to see what this baby can really do with the supplied head phones. They don't fit my ears properly and what I can hear doesn't seem to me that much better than the throwaway headphones snagged from a recent long haul flight. So now I will have to buy a seperate headset.  My advice to anyone buying this or any other product is try and read the instructions  before you buy if you can and make sure you are aware of the quality of any included accessories.

<Title>I'm loving this device more each day!
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had been researching for months before deciding on the Creative ZEN. My first player was a Sandisk Sansa e140. For a 1st player it was okay, but my main gripe was that it had no resume feature or bookmarks, amongst other defects. Anyway, it was okay for a beginner device.  About three months ago I decided it was time for a change, since I knew Sandisk, I bought a Sansa e260 4gig: it was nice, but, still no bookmark and the thing was just not built right, seemed like it would break in two weeks...I returned it and after one month of looking at reviews on dedicated gadget websites and Youtube video reviews and looking and trying mp3 players at stores, I finally decided and ordered the Creative ZEN.  Half a year ago,I subscribed to a "Rhapsody to Go" subscription for my son(at 14.99 a month),  and I was looking for an mp3 player that would be compatible, the ZEN was not on Rhapsody's "Accepted Players" list.  Still...I decided on the Creative ZEN  I receive my Creative 4GB ZEN 3 days after ordering...Amazon quick! I looked at the packaging, not too impressive. Charged it up and after a couple of hours (with half a charge because I couldn't wait anymore) I began to experiment.  You can operate all functions practically without reading the manual, it has a very intuitive interface.  I was very pleased with the look and feel of the player.It has a nice weight to it, light enough for a shirt pocket, yet still has the weight of a quality product.   The screen gets smudged up quickly, but it's a non issue. I love the interface and how the pictures and videos look. The volume is loud enough, it may not be the most top quality sound, but it's an MP3 player the size of a credit card...what would you expect?  I was very happy for the first two days using my new toy...I loaded, photos, videos...I had a family video and a short Hendrix concert video. No problem, excellent playback. I even charged it using my Razor V3 cell phone charger! Cool!  Anyway, last night I go in the Rhapsody site and plug in my ZEN and find that it shows on the system...hmmmmmmmmmmmm! I click on authorize device...BINGO!  Device is authorized! I have loaded this thing with tons of stuff from "Rhapsody to GO"...up to this point I had second thoughts about this player, but the fact that it works with Rhapsody to GO was the biggest selling point for me... Rhapsody needs to update their site and show that this device is Rhapsody to Go compatible.  PROS:  1) you can set 10 bookmarks  2) Beautiful interface menu display 3) Good sound quality 4) Small and slim (pocket friendly) 5) Resume feature 6) Many options including selection of a "personal shortcut key" 7) Easy to operate and to load files to 8) Lots of features at a very reasonable price 9) Works with Rhapsody to Go...also has free Zencasts and other goodies     from their website. 10) It uses a regular USB connection (not propietary), so you can plug into a razor V3 charge (for example) and if you lose your USB connector, you don't need to panic because you can buy one of these anywhere for just a few dollars. 11) SD slot (does not integrate fully, but works for me...I put in my card from my Panasonic FZ7 camera and was able to see the pics I took, cool enough for me. Besides, 4GIG is enough for me, I don't need to carry my entire music library with me. (not yet) 12) Records off the air very well 13) FM radio reception sounds great 14) Videos and picures look vibrant adn very colorful 15) You can view playlists by album covers if you want 16) Digital and Analog clock 17) Many more features I still haven't even discovered yet  CONS:  1) Sound quality could be improved (a firmware upgrade would do it) 2) No carrying pouch included 3) Doesn't make coffee  4) Does not work as a can opener 5) Cannot be used as a fax machine  I will update later on, after giving this baby a full tryout. So far, I'm lovin' it!  If you read the whole thing...I guess you should be considering to buy this gadget.  Biggest bang for the buck I could find anyway!

<Title>Screen died
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I enjoyed it for a while (a lot), then a month after I bought it the screen went dead: just shows up white. Ok, well sometimes things break. I RMA'd it and they sent me a new one the next week, yay. Only this one has the same problem half of the time. So now half of the time its just a 4GB ipod shuffle. Sending it back again...

<Title>Faulty Players
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my first, yes first and when I plugged in my earphones it shut off and would not turn back on. I returned it, got a second, it froze so I reset it, it would not turn on! I was so frustrated with the ZEN. It sounded great, pics looked awesome, it was a sweet mp3 player but I only had the first one for a week, and the second one for a day! Do not buy this player until Creative fixes the bugs, Im not the only one that has had this happen.

<Title>AWESOME!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i got the 4gb Zen cause it was so cheap, but i loved it so much, i just sold it to get either a 8 or 16 gb model! yes, i used to have the Zen Vision M, which was a great player, but Creative has come a long way and it really shows in this player. the sound quality is just as good or even better than the ZVM, but the size of the screen remains the same, while significantly slimming down the entire player to credit card size and giving you the addition of the SD/SDHC card function really gives you your moneys worth! i was able to fit 6 family guy episodes, 1 episode of House and around 240 songs onto a 2gb SD card and eventhough the card function is kept separate, it works great! you get two libraries here! amazing! a tiny, light and very sleek looking player that packs a mean punch, a lovely screen, great audio, lots of options, great battery life, bright, and very easy to use. and like other reviewers here, i agree that the buttons are a bit small and they should have made them light up like the ZVM, but those details are very minor and the pros definately outweigh the cons here.

<Title>Does not have video out!
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great little MP3 player and FM radio.  It does everything that it says it does.  Unfortunately, it doesn't say that it is missing video out capabilities.  That means you are totally stuck watching videos on the 2.5 in screen.  I bought the Zen because Itunes and NBC were squabbling over pricing and Itunes no longer carries shows like "Heroes".  I like to download these shows to my IPOD and play them through my TV.  Works very nice - DVD quality, wide screen, etc..    So, I decided to buy the ZEN 4 gb on Amazon so that I could download Heroes via Unbox.  I even went out and spent another $20 on a video out cable before realizing that the ZEN did not have video out capabilities . . . had to google the heck out of it, before I discovered that.  I spent a bit of time trying to figure out why it wouldn't work first.  I still give it 3 stars because it is a great little MP3 player and the FM works very good too.  I also like the fact that it will synch to Outlook, but I haven't tried that yet.  But, if you want a player that will play videos out to you TV, look elsewhere.
