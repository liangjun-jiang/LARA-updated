<Title>Poor Design
<Date>Thu Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have had a really hard time using the Philips HDD100. It is not very intuitive and has been hard to use. The button placement, menus, etc., seem to all be in the wrong places. Maybe on the next go-round, they'll get it right.

<Title>Time, Thought and Tune Nightmare
<Date>Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this product to be able to meander through New York city streets in aural splendor.  When this hunk of gunk reached my door, I chose to ignore that its program discs came empty.  No biggie, I could download the requisite files from Phillip' web site.  If only I had hailed to the harbinger of defective design I could have averted the crises that followed on my trip to New York.  All I could get out of this machine on the road was five to six songs played, before its monitor and play froze.  If only the machine remained cool it wouldn't have been such a big deal.  Unfortunately, when the machine freezes there is no reset button.  It just leaves the LCD display on and gets hotter and hotter until the battery runs out. <p>Not only does the machine not play more than a few songs before freezing, it doesn't let you manipulate the songs as it should.  I couldn't figure out how the adjust the equalizer settings.   <p>Finally, the buttons on the machine are so hard to press.  It looks nice, kinda, its a good price, kinda, but if doesn't work, why would you get this?  Now that the Ipod has record components as plug ins, don't waste your time.  <p>Peace, armen.

<Title>Dont be misguided by the bad review!
<Date>Mon Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I just purchased this player the other day...the look caught my eye and I just had to have it. So I bought it and took it home and then everything worked out. The player did freeze up every few songs so I looked in the manual for a while. It turns out that this player doesnt support any secure WMAs, so that addresses the problem that guy had of the player freezing. Other then that, this player has been great! The design is pretty good and the software is easy to use. Just dont load in any secure WMAs.<p>Btw...there is a reset button...hold the volume up, up, and left buttons for 4 seconds...

<Title>Review of a review
<Date>Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I Have the HD100 and please to not listen to the reviewer who states there is no reset button. If they had taken the time to read the instructions they would know which keys need to be pressed to reset. Also the buttons are not at all hard to press i have no idea what this reviewer is talking about.<p>its only fault is that it should have had an AM/FM radio.

<Title>Philips vs. I Pod
<Date>Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>In my opinion, the Philips HDD100 is comparable to the I Pod in weight, size, capacity, and options, and it is more affordable.  Scrolling is fast and easy, creating playlists is a breeze and the sound quality is amazing.  The headphones that come with the unit leave much to be desired.  The cord is way too short, making it impossible to place the HDD100 on the table in front of you and be able to listen to it at the same time.  The remote control that also comes with it is very handy.  It extends the length of the cord and makes navigation a lot easier.<br>It would be great if the backlight stayed on longer, it stays on for about 30 seconds at the most.  It comes in black, which is nice, but the high gloss magnesium sides get all smudged from fingerprints.  Overall, though, it is a great machine, capable of holding approximately 3,000 songs.  I have about 575 songs on mine right now, and it only takes up about 3% of the hard drive.  If you want the I Pod, but can't afford it, the Philips HD100 is the more affordable option and does the same thing.

<Title>Impressive unknown MP3 jukebox
<Date>Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After much thought between getting the Philips or the IPOD, I went with the Philips and have been very impressed. Once the new firmware is upgraded, the player is virtually problem free. The only fault of this product is Philips obviously does not know how to market this product very well. It is unheard of by many and not in many stores. It would have been new to have come with a belt-case like that of the IPOD instead of a bag. I would have also liked to have some type of song rating built into the player. The menu animation affects are unneeded. If I wanted just a player, the IPOD would have been slightly better (I want the wheel), but if you want to record also, this is the way to go. Up to 192 kbps MP3 line in/optical in/ mic recording, can't go wrong. The only major problem I had, was I can not figure out how to quickly fastforward into a song yet, if its possible.
