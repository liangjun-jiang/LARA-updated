<Title>1 star but if I could I'll put 5 negative stars!!!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll need some self contro to stay polite, to write this review. I bought mine in november, but after one months the device refuse to work anymore, for no reason there was no way to switch it on anymore. During this first month, I won't say that was the perfect MP3 juke box... It bugged at least twice a week, in a way that sometimes I don't know why but I have till the battery was flat to restart it! But for that I was lucky cause the autonomy is far from the constructor datas, the most I was abble to use it was suring maybe 6 sometimes 7 hours... Otherwise I was slow to load the menu play a song or just respond to single command, the sound  wasn't really great, very flat even with the personalized equalizer... Oh I forget to mention the picture, I was only able once to load picture on it, and then never again, I try everything even restore all the factory parameter and delete all my music there was no way!!! So I was happy to contract the extra warranty, best buy give me a new one, my first surprise was that I didn't find the radio on the menu there wasn't any way to turn the radio on, but I didn't really care about the radio... So my new one was just like the old one, same battery autonomy, same weak and flat sound, same bug, but at least it worked for more than a months this time!!! Now it just died again, for no reason??? I'm glad to read other review like this one it means that's not my karma fault!! Just Philips... I came to best buy again, they proposed me to change it, but there was NO WAY!!! So I choose another brand, I hope that ipod will works better, and plus the new one is thinner, so I'll see!

<Title>Pathetic Product, Atrocious Customer Service
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will never - ever - buy anything from Philips again.  This purchase was a Christmas present for my son.  Within a few days of opening it and following all the instructions to the letter, the screen fried, making the unit unusable.  I contacted customer service, and a very helpful agent gave me a support tag number and shipping information.  It was all a ploy.  Philips took their sweet time sending out a replacement unit, and when they did, they gave us an expected delivery date that has long since passed with absolutely no concern about the status of the delivery.  Their attitude is, "hey, we shipped it to you."  Philips' Customer Service is, in a word, shallow.  They cannot tell you who they used to ship replacements, and that department doesn't much care.  Instead, they have to put in a request for a tracking number which can take an additional three business days.  We have already spoken with the vendor.  As soon as this thing ever gets here - if it does - it's going back for a refund and we'll buy a different MP3 player from a company that can at least pretend it knows what it's doing.

<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went to bestbuy to get an ipod but ended up buying "Philips HDD6330 30 GB MP3 Player". I am impressed by its performance. I was little skeptical while buying, as this being a new product from Philips. I got the 2 warranty which costed me another $30 and I am glad i got the warranty after looking at the reviews here. But quite frankly i didnt hv any problems till now. The product looks great!! its nice that they hv a inbuilt voice recorder which records pretty well. i would recommand this for the price. the only drawback is, it doesn't have that many accessories as an ipod.

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Fri Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Picked this up at the local best buy, and of like most of you i was skeptical about the new unit, however i really was impressed with how it operated.. ESPECIALLY processor wise, very quick interface. I've had it for three weeks now and it hasn't given me one issue yet. Always boots up and plays..  And by the way, this was a replacement for my samsung YH-820 that died within 6 months, that was the worst unit ever for many other reasons. I never purchase warranty plans, but you require it on these things..

<Title>Philips' customer care  SUCKS!!!!
<Date>Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sorry but there was no better way to put it.  First of all, I bought this product on Tuesday after coming across it on AOL gifts. I lost my IRiver 40 gb (or it is somewhere in my house) so I decided to buy something different just in case I find it. I'd sell it on Ebay and move on. Anyhow, I went to BestBuy and purchased this product Tuesday evening. It is now Saturday, FOUR DAYS later and I have finally got this thing to work. Now , I am not new to mp3's. I have been using them before they became popular. However, I must say, Philips has the WORST Instruction Manual, description of requirements, and customer service.  First issue- After installing the software, the player would not work. It was being recogognized by my computer but not by the installed software,WMP10 and the Device Manager. Between Tuesday and Wed, I called the  support team  EIGHT times. They couldn't figure out the issue.They had the basic by the book responses. If I could reach into the phone I'd slap them . I held out hope though. I then realized by my own pc's  help, that I needed a high speed USB.  A 2.0 USB, for those who don't have one. We have two pc's and  the one that I loaded the software on is the one that I use  and contains all of my info. It had everything but the  hi speed usb. I loaded the software on the second pc, an hp media center h660 series and it worked perfectly fine. Problem is, how am I supposed to get my songs if it is on the other computer??  So I call the clueless people, cut the crap with the  tag number they like to give you out and gave them the reference number from the previous calls. Now I asked if the problem could be the usb. They couldn't say yes or no. I would have to ask my pc's maker. They don't know.   Great.  Dummies.  THEY SHOULD HAVE HAS ON THE REQUIREMENT LIST- WINDOWS XP SERVICE PACK 1 with IE 6 512MB RAM more than 300 mhz. USB2.0 HI SPEED  Had I known this, I woul dnot have wasted a day. So now Thursday, I go over to Radio Shack and purchased a PCI card. This is a USB 2.0  port that I must now physically install into my pc. Of course, for (...), the pci card is being recognized but it's drivers wont install. So, render it useless. I also purchased a Router to connect my two pc's and just transfer files. (..), and also useless. I do not have DSL and I only have one Ethernet cord. "Go by another one", you say. For what? I don't have DSL and I don't intend on dragging my basement pc to my room in order to transfer files onto this dumb non computer friendly device.  So, after many hours of frustration , I finally managed to get somewhere. I abandoned my other pc and used the HP . Now how did I get my songs? I spent two hours saving them on memory cards from my camcorder and digital camera(Now I wish I had sprung for the 512mb). 2 memory cards, 2 and a half hours, transfering 800 files.   Finally the songs are loaded , they go onto my device. Now for the pictures...where the hell are they? Oh they say they are there but I don't see them.  So guess what? I call the monkeys(no that's not fair, they(monkeys) would have figured this one out)-scratch that, I called those people that call themselves customer support and  told the woman I am not seeing my pics. So she asked me if I used Windows Explorer to transfer the pics. Now if it says use WMP10, then why the hell and how the hell can I use Windows Explorer. Then she tells me to do a device repair. There goes my 600 and some odd songs and some valid time in my life. Did it all over again to factory settings and no pictures.  Well, I Thank GOD that I know how to read. I went to their support site and found the cause of the issue.   If your pictures are not showing, the great possibility is that your philips plug -in is not installed . I checked my add/remove programs (go to control panel) and low and behold it was missing. So after reinstalling the second cd and 5 mins later, the plug -in pops up as it should. I rebooted and tried transferring pics again and now all is well.   Couldn't the rep tell me this in the first place? No. Because they do not know what the hell they are doing.  Ok. so now things are working well but by the sound of the other horror stories, who knows how long that will last. Lucky for me I paid that extra cash and bought the 2 yr warranty through Best Buy. The only reason that I did not give up hope is because it is so cute and has more to offer than the silly IPOD that everyone and their mother thinks is the greatest thing on the earth.  One thing I wish it would have is a carrying case that is attachable to the hip for running or   just period. I mean the concept of the product is good but it was not well executed.  The guy that I'm dating kept doubting it after reading these reviews and told me I was looking at Fashion before function. Sort of true, that is why i kept it. Aside from the smudging, I think it is fierce. Niceely built, sleek and cute, so I held out hope. I don't understand how people complain about the contollers, seeing as they are touch pad but I guess I am doomed to find out.  (...) After all of that trouble , I want some of my money back. I'm also taking the Router and PCI slot back to Radioshack. That's a good hundred dollars right there almost wasted. Almost.

<Title>What the heck???
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really really wanted to write a good review about this product.  But unforunately I can't.  I received this item as a Valentine's Day gift. (cool right)?  Wrong!!! When I received it it worked fine for a day than all of a sudden the device was not being recognized by my pc.  I thought well let me contact support and they can help me.  After a long chat on the web they had me download a patch to make the pc recongize the player again.  That went fine.  Then the player freezed up a few times.  Again I thought hey it's new technology so it's bound to have some bugs.  Well I downloaded 1500 songs into my player and I thought it was the coolest thing since high def tv's I was so happy with it that I went out and brought another one for my partner.  That's when things started to get ugly.  I went to download some pics and surprise they were not showing up in my player.  After venting some I went to the philips web sight to trouble shoot.  I tried everything they said on the website and still no pictures.  It shows that they are there but when you go to view them they are not there.  After six hours lots of cussing and a headache I decided to give up for the night and call cs in the morning.  Well I called cs and what did they do NOTHING, NATTA.  The first thing that they had me do was repair my player.  That means that you completely delete everything in your player.  Now I knew it wouldn't work because neither player was able to load pics.  But I decided to try it.  Well guess what now I have an empty mp3 player that still doesn't load pics.  Then they got really brillant and wanted me to uninstall my windows media player, meaning I would lose the songs stored in the library.  Now we are talking about 2000 songs, they will be in the pc but you have to go through all the trouble of adding them back to your library.  I asked them well what if that doesn't work?  The answer was to try another pc.  Are you kidding me?  I just brought this laptop about two months ago and your telling me it's the pc's problem.  Please!  So now I have two players that aren't working properly.  The only other thing they said I could do was set up a repair and wait till god only knows how long to get them back.  Why should you have to send a product in for repairs that you have only had for a few weeks?  It is taking all my control not to take the thing outside and run it over with my car.  If it wasn't so expensive I probably would do that because I am that mad.  This product does have some cool features like the voice record and fm tuner.  But be warned if you buy it.  I really wish I would have seen the reviews but hey it was gift.  So I had no way of knowing how big of a headache it would be.  If I spend nearly $300 for something I expect it work properly.  The music sounds good the touch pad is sometimes too sensitive, than other times it doesn't want to work.  They had some great ideals when designing this product but when it comes down to it is it really worth it?  I say no but that's just my opinion.  I am returning this thing tomorrow and I'm thinking about just going with the ipod.  I'm so mad I might just get the money back.  I hope this is helpful.  My advice is be careful it may or maynot work properly for you.

<Title>Philips is not a worthy mp3 maker
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>"Absolutly dreadful", as Simon would say...my mp3 somehow managed to turn my computer upsidedown and nothing will work. Not only that but the player itself refuses to work while trying to download my first CD on the day I purchased it, it just froze and now all it wants is to be hooked to the computer and its been that way for hours. I am returning it back to Best Buy where I got it.  A complete waste of time and money. Not even a single day of it worth while.

<Title>I like it when it's working.
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's really unstable and unreliable from my experience with it. When I first got it, I really liked it. It was rather easy to use and the sound quality was more than I could ask for. Didn't use the head buds it came with, I prefer large bulky headphones. :D I got it as a Christmas Present from my parents, specifically for I trip I was taking to work on a project. I would be needing it because I was making makeshift desks and my computer was no longer an adequate Mp3 player anymore. Not exactly portable. This would be my first portable mp3 player.  I was a little suspicious of the touch...button---light things at first, but they grew on me because it could brush on the floor and it wouldn't be effected. I could care less about fancy interfaces or how it looks, just as long as it works. I wanted it for one thing and one thing only, to use it as an mp3 player. And for a time, it was good. It worked, with a small complaint about how long it took to transfer files. But that was no biggie, at the time I only had 2,000 songs. It only took a few hours...  But then one day I pause and get up to go to the bathroom and come back to find that it was frozen...the screen was on and the hardrive was dead. For a while there, I was panicking. Then I went to the ridiculously-over-the-top FAQ and found out how to reset it. I thought my problems were over, I was liking it a little less though, but heck, it was a minor bug and I thought that would be the end of it.  How very wrong I was.   After that I had no problems for a while. It was working and I was very happy with it. It was somewhat reliable, although I couldn't figure out how to do the playlists. (I was liking having the one it came with) And I didn't want to use Windows media player, the program is a little on the evil side. It worked just fine with dragging the files via Windows Explorer.  One day, I turn it on, and the list of songs is empty. There's nothing....I panic. I plug it into the computer and discover that all the songs are still there, mysteriously though they do not show up on the device. I do what I've done before, I get rid of all the songs and start again. I finally give in and see if "syncing" is any faster. It was fast at first, then it slowed down, then it stopped completely, then (biG surprise :O) The program crashes. Thanks a lot WMP. T_T  My collection has grown...a bit since then, too. So now I'm stuck with an empty unreliable buggy mp3 player. Looks like my computer is currently my main jukebox.  Overall nice concept. I don't care for fancified things, I like it when they work, but this machine is unfortunately style over substance.  They should have worked out the very apparent bugs before releasing it. They were in such a hurry to release the Windows answer to the Ipod, which in itself sounds like something worrisome.  I give it two stars. Easy to use and rather nice...when its working. Usually it isn't.

<Title>Frusterating, buy something else
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player since November and I am now putting it on craigslist so that I can buy a real mp3 player. I seem to have some of the same issues others have had.....the player is great when it works, but I have frequent problems.  It constantly freezes.  Sometimes after freezing, it won't recognize any of my songs (playlist shows zero songs).  Connect it to the computer and look via Windows Explorer....yep, they are there, but the player will not recognize them.  One time when re-syncing with Windows Media Player, either WMP or the device deleted a whole directory of my songs on my PC (luckily I back up my files to an external hard drive, so I was ok).  I figured that I could live with this player given some bugs...but it crashes so frequently now that it is too frusterating to use.  Oh...and don't even try calling their customer care.  First off, it does not even seem like they know their products.  Their only remedy is to delete all files from the device and re-sync.  And like other people have said about their customer care, they don't seem overly concerned that you are having problems and seem like they just want to get you off the phone.  Bottom line.....get something else!

<Title>Nice toy...
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well my brother has this nice and cool looking Jukebox player.  It has 30gb which holds up to 15,000 songs! :o  It doesn't have a click wheel but it does have this line/track looking thing which I think is kind of better then the click wheel.  It looks better and it's less hand movement :)  I also give it 2 thumbs up because all of the buttons light up :o! The buttons are kind of like censors....  The only downside to this nice looking toy is that its kind of difficult to add album art and pictures onto it.  Also if you purchase this product I highly reccomend you to purchase another set of headphones/earphones so you can prevent ear damage...  This Jukebox player also comes with a case! so you wont have to purchase a $30 case that will end up ripping....  It is also very VERY easy to transfer music to it :)

<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I actually went from a Dell jukebox 20GB to this thing. gotta say, it was pretty weak. I loaded it up full from the 2nd day on and maybe this was the problem but I'm not sure why it glitched out on me all the time.  I had to buy a 1gb player as a backup to my commute!  in any case, you can't edit songs on the player itself, playlists are annoying to edit - but I did love the playlist on the fly function - and the software is like the commodore 64.  brutal.  I had this thing less than 6 mos and sold it for cheap.  never buy this.  never.

<Content>I love this player. 30 GB holds tons of music. The HDD6330/17 easy to use, sounds great, and is rugged enough for joggers. The touch screen does just that, responds to your touch, like the iPhone. In fact it looks just like the iPhone, same black, sleek, look. I am so glad I didn't get the iPod. My friend's iPod, when the battery died, lost all the data including ALL that music. iPods are known for their crappy battery problem is all I can say. This player will NOT let you down.

It is the only word i can use describe every part of Philips 9and im not talking about just the product either- the customer service is TERRIBLE) Sure, it looks nice, and HEY- it even works great, until about 6 months, then it will crash on you. And even worse, their customer service does not care about you, they dont even act like they do. I have gone so far as to complain to the BBB and my Attorney General because this has happened TWICE within a span of slightly over a year- AND they wont give me a refund AND also claim that it is my fault. Do NOT get a philips- otherwise you will have problem after problem with it.

I've had this MP3 player for less than four months, and the battery has already began to die on me!  After looking at reviews on Amazon, I found out it's a common problem, and the main reason to avoid this device.  One year warranty, you say?  Don't count on it!  Philips Customer/Technical help is both unapologetic and rude.  They've sent me in circles many times.  Giving me false "reference numbers" and worst of all, false hope that my MP3 player will every function normally.  Remember; you get what you paid for.  Sure, the Philips Go Gear is much cheaper than most other MP3 players, but the quality and service that goes along with it is terrible.  Think about it before investing your hard-earned money on a substandard music player.
