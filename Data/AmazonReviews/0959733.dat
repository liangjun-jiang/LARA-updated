<Content>But now its gone bad!! Iriver support is not responding. I can't down load the updater to my H10,it won't reformat, and emails are getting me nowhere. Worst yet I miss my music. Like a relationship gone bad, it was great while it lasted, but the end was really sour.

<Title>I have never HATED a device as much as this one!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am actually on my 3rd H10 having had to receive 2 RMA numbers from iRiver.     The number of issues I have w/ this thing is difficult to even tally up.  Generally I wouldn't bother writing a reveiw; however, this morning I find myself having to wipe the piece of cr*p clean for the 30th time and re-syncing several thousand songs once again.  I'm not even going to bother.  I'm just going to go buy a new mp3 player and be done w/ it.  If you buy one of these things after reading this then I can only assume you are a masochist.

<Title>Great first player. Experienced no problems.
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While I wasn't ecstatic about receiving an iRiver (I wanted an Ipod), once I started using it I really loved it. It works well with Windows media player, I didn't have to download any software and moving around the menu is extremely easy. I didn't have the charging and battery problems everyone else had, but maybe that's because I read the manual. You don't have to connect to the computer to charge it; you need only connect the mp3 side of the usb cable to your player and THEN connect the ac adapter to player/wall. The only thing I needed to do to my player was update the firmware, which was easy if you can follow directions. Songs aren't always played in order (kind of annoying), but not so much that it ruined my experience with the player. SMART and AFFORDABLE BUY!

<Title>Hands down the best player available
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Without a doubt the best player out there. I was blown away by the build quality and attention to detail, iriver really put a lot of work into this. You will wish your cell phone/PDA could even come close to this quality. Took it out of the box, pluged it into usb port and opened explorer (just like a drive letter!), draged mp3s to it, done within 5 min of opening the box. No need to use Windows Medeia Player. A really cool feature lets you record from the FM radio to. By the way the display resolution is 128 x 128 so you can optimize photos (not in the manual or web site). If you are deciding between Ipod and the H10, there is no comparison other than GB, this unit makes the Ipod look like a cheap kids toy.

<Title>REVISED
<Date>Sat Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing it's way better than any other mp3 player I've used. Here are the specs: FEATURES  * Plays up to 150 hours of digital music* * 5GB of internal storage** * Vivid color display * Ultra-intuitive interface with convenient touch strip * Displays your digital photos * Slim, lightweight design * PlaysForSure enabled to play more of your music * Rechargeable, removable battery lasts up to 12hrs. * Built-in FM tuner and FM recorder * Integrated voice recorder * Ultra-fast USB 2.0 transfers * Supports MP3, WMA, JPEG and TXT files * Enhanced 3D audio (supports SRS WOW  PACKED WITH  * iriver earphones * Carrying case with belt clip * USB 2.0 interface cable * Installation CD * AC adapter  PC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  * Windows XP (Service Pack 1 or higher) * CD-ROM Drive * USB Port  It has a great navigation system almost as good as the iPods click wheel.(but that thing is really hard to match) It's features rival that of it's opponents and tops them all. The 3 players I checked out were the iPod mini, the creative zen micro, and of course the H10. I didn't think the Mini was worth $250 when it can't use Napster has no microphone or radio. The Zen micro was my 2nd choice because it has a radio and mic plus it looks way cool with the blue LED in the back and the colors but that is more of a gimmic than a plus and the touch pad doesn't work that well. Then I saw this by accident actually. I downloaded Napster onto my comp and was looking at it's special offers to see what would work with it. I was going to get the zen micro then I finally checked this thing out and I was captured. Since the iRiver H230 looked ugly I never cared abought them but this thing is beautiful and it looks professional. The color screen is a little to small but it looksamazing compared to most LCD screens like the iPod so when you turn it the image isn't negative. It's simplistic button layout is a definate plus which makes it so you don't have to take much time to get used to it. Also it has volume control on the side unlike the zen and iPod. The sorage is fine with me because I don't need my entire music collection with me at all times. However you can't directly link your H10 to a digital camera. Plus it has a few minor bugs. Hopefully iriver will make a firmware update.(mud slinging lol must be a fanboy of iriver) I wish the price was $250 so it could compete with the iPod mini and zen micro easily. But when you make an investment like this you know it's going to work and it does. It also comes with a great iskin which protects it from any fall. This thing is small though I was suprised when I opened it up. Supposedly it weighs less than the iPod mini and it's a photo player!!!  what I said up there ^ is an out of the box reviewwhich you shouldn't trust after only a week of having this machine it is a pain in the @ss. iRiver should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a premature item with all its bugs. this thing doesn't like a lot of computers and has problems with freezing but worst of all it can't play albums in track order. this is terrible for people like me who listen to bands like green day and linkin park who use transitions in their songs but even then there are pauses inbetween songs. If I bought a camera I'd expect it to work without having to wait a long time for it to be fixed. iRiver has terrible american support which is unacceptable even if they are based in korea. I can't give this thing anything higher than a 3 because it's faults are too big. this had a lot going for it but iRiver being as smart as they are released it way too early

<Title>Disappointment
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered the H10 and have now sent it back.  I have had problems similar to those many others listed.  The radio worked great and picked up even distant stations well.  The user interface and size are fantastic.  However, when I loaded music with WMP10, it would not work.  This includes MP3s and WMAs ripped from my own CDs as well as Napster to Go.  I uninstalled and reinstalled WMP10 and got the latest download from Microsoft.  Using this and USB 2.0 on both a Falcon Northwest Pentium 4 3.06 MHz (XP Home) and a Sony Vaio laptop (XP Professional), I had the same problems with both computers and had to conclude that the device was not functional.  The names of the songs jumbled such that artist names were linked to songs of different artists.  The menu and directories were all goofed up.  Many songs loaded but wouldn't play.  Some would play a few times and then everything would jumble up.  Tech support from iRiver was virtually nonexistent.  I sent it back and ordered a Zen Micro today.  I'm hoping I'll have more success.  Overall, the H10 is a very nice device conceptually but it might be better to wait for a later model with more stable technology if you want to order this player.

<Title>The product does not work - Zero support from IRiver
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this product about 2 weeks ago.  In spite of hours spent on researching tips from the Misticriver forum and trying all sorts of different ways, the product has not worked correctly.  The playlists do not work, the lists by artists and album is corrupted.  The tech support, which is open only during business hours, has at least 45 minute wait.  They clearly do not have answers to the problems with playlists, etc.  My inquiries via email have been unanswered.  It is clear that the product was prematurely launched to coincide with the Napster to Go campaign.  It is a nice paperweight, if you can afford to spend over $250 for a paperweight!

<Title>No problems here... and Napster to go
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have other iRiver products so when I decided I wanted to go with Napster To Go (monthly subscription service that lets you "rent" tracks for compatible players), I knew I would go with iRiver.  The H10 is an elegant little machine -- very nice to look at and solidly built. The interface on the player isn't all that great, occasionally confusing, but it works.  I have had no problems getting music onto the player. It works well with the Napster software. I play albums -- in track order -- by creating playlists in Napster and transfering those playlists onto the player. It's a snap.  And the sound is wonderful. I've been using some pretty good Sony headphones so far and have been satisfied with the sound quality. I have some Shure phones coming soon and expect it to sound even better.  Bottom line. For me the player has been almost flawless.

<Content>I was given the iriver H10 as a gift.  Upon opening the box, two inserts read,"STOP, before returning this product........."  That should have been my first clue that something was wrong.  The second insert recommended that I contact iriver via e-mail if I had a problem.  I did contact them, over a week ago, still no response!  The product is terrible!  It copied my whole MY documents file.  I tried to delete it, it wouldn't allow me to do so.  Now, when I return the product for a FULL refund, I have to make sure the salesperson can delete my files in the H10.  Also, EVERY time I tried to download files, it froze my computer!  Absolutely the worst!  Don't buy it.

<Title>Great product, although not perfect
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When this mp3 player was first announced and I started to see it all over the net, I was excited. I am a long time iRiver enthusiast (also an anti iPod) and their first micro hard drive mp3 player looked great, with a color screen, and of course tons of other features that iRiver always includes. (By the way, this is where Apple falls short - they dish out the same thing over and over, saying it's a "new generation" iPod with nothing different except the front design. The iPod never has extra features except games, it has terrible battery life, and plus it looks rather uninteresting to me, though not overly ugly.)  Unfortunately for me, when I ordered this iRiver H10 from Amazon (just two weeks ago it cost $271 now it costs 280, I have no clue as to why) they sent the wrong product! I had to return it and order from Newegg. In any case, the red version of this player looks simply amazing. Great sleek design, beautiful color screen, and the red metallic color tops it off. It's a lot lighter than I expected, you have to feel it in your hand for this fact to hit you. The button layout is bot intuitive and comfoprtable.  When I turned this player on my amazement didn't cease. The color screen had better resolution than my color cell phone! The touch pad worked a lot better and easier than Zen Micro's touch pad. I proceeded to plug it into my computer to start downloading music into it. I had no problems with syncing with Windows Media Player, only a slight learning curve. I certainly didn't experience any freezing or crashing problems that many other people mentioned. It might be that they had defective products or their computers are somehow incompatible, though I can't imagine why. After I got some songs into it I listened to the sound quality. Amazing sound. There are thirty or so different preset EQ modes, including an SRS WOW that you can customize, and another Custom EQ. The default EQ is nothing compared to SRS.  So far no problems. The only thing that annoyed me about this player is that it arranges songs in alphabetical order, even if there are numbers in front of them. Let's say you copy a cd into your computer and sync it into the H10. When you rip from cds using WMP, then it automatically puts track numbers into the music files. For example: 01 Foreward 02 Don't Stay 03 Somewhere I Belong etc  When you download it into the player, the numbers are gone and you see the songs arranged in alphabetical order, even when you browse song titles in albums. This can be remedied by changing the titles of the songs like this: 01 songtitle to 01 - songtitle  put a space, a dash, and then another space in between the number and title. Then, go to properties for that song and do the same thing in "Summary" where you input the title, artist, album, etc. Doing this with all the songs should put them in the original album's order. I just found this extremely annoying to do with hundreds of songs, and iRiver should fix this bug.  In any case, I found this player to be out of the ordinary, with great quality sound, beautiful design, and a handful of extra features like text and photo viewing.  And by the way, I know how annoying iRiver support is, with unresponsive service and the like. iRiver orginates from Korea, and the service is a lot better there, along with product quality, and I heard they have no bugs over there. So maybe it's just over here in the US that the problems are occuring.

<Title>iRiver H10 tries, but flunks. Wait for updated drivers
<Date>Wed Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love iriver products, and was blown away with the sound on this player, but I had UNRESOLVABLE problems with the player and Windows Media 10. I downloaded the "fix" from the iRiver site, but I just couldn't get it to work without re-running the "fix" over and over again. Finally, I returned the player to Best Buy, severely disappointed.  They need to create a new version of iRiver Music Manager as an ALTERNATIVE so one can just drag and drop the songs from your hard drive to the player. The Windows Media 10 is incomprehensible to use; and the connectivity "For Sure" is not sure at all! Furthermore, the documentation doesn't explain HOW to get photos on the player. WM 10 placed them on the file system, but the only way to see them was to use the file "browser" on the H10. Another problem was that the playlists were all "out" of sequenced from the alphabetical order I created on WM10. (This was when I COULD get the WM10 to recognize it). After awhile, I couldn't get WM10 to connect to the H10 at all.  Calls to the tech support line yielded busy signals for 2 days. My email to customer service has yet to be answered.  This has soured me from purchasing iRiver products for some time. Too bad for them.....

<Title>Worst MP3 Player I Have Ever Owned!
<Date>Thu Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Over the last couple years, I have owned a variety of music players. Here is a brief timeline: Rio (64MB) -> Mini Disc (Sony 74 mins) -> iPod (1st Generation 5GB) -> iFP-390T (iRiver 256MB) -> H10 (iRiver 5GB - Present) -> iFP-899 (iRiver 1GB - Present). The H10 is by far the worst player I have ever owned. Here is a list of frustrations that I have experienced during the short time I have owned it:  -Short battery life. I have only made it to about 6-7 hours. Much shorter than the 12 hours listed by the manufacturer.  -Frequent crashes. Much like the only operating system it works with, my H10 has crashed on multiple occasions. So far I have found that the only way to reset the player is to remove the battery. This is made more frustrating when you have the protective skin on, as you have to completely remove it first.  -Slow song changes. It's not very scientific, but it feels like it takes about a second or so to skip to the next song. It makes me think that the buffer is very small. I could be wrong, but believe that the iPod buffers about 20 minutes.  -Poor functionality I. In the morning I like to listen to the radio and switch to music during commercials. With the H10, you have to back out through quite a few screens to get to the radio from the music function.  -Poor functionality II. There does not seem to be any way to create multiple, on-the-fly playlists. You can create one quick playlist and that is it. Has iRiver never seen an iPod?  -Inaccurate battery indicator. This is related to the battery life issue, but is a different problem. On multiple occasions, the indicator has read 100% full for 4 hours, then when I shut it down and turn it back on, it reads 50% full. It will work for about another 2 hours, then completely shutdown due to insufficient battery power.   The H10 has a few other things working against it, but I have listed the ones that bug me on a daily basis. Hopefully, a firmware update will come out soon that will fix some things, but the short battery life is really annoying. Maybe it's so you have to buy additional batteries from them, I don't know.  There is a happy ending to all of this, although it does not involve the H10, but does include iRiver. I missed my iFP-390T and hated the H10 so much that I went out and bought the iRiver iFP-899. The 899 is, without a doubt, the best player I have ever owned (sorry 390T). I'll probably write a review for it, or maybe the 799, which is pretty similar. I love iRiver, but I wish they would put as much care into their hard drive players as they do with their flash players. If you need tons of space and no FM radio, go get an iPod. If you need tons of space and as well as FM radio, go get an iPod mini and use the extra money to buy a good mini radio. The H10 is too little, too late to compete with what is out there. Nothing is innovative about it, and it is more expensive that similar items. Even the Napster To Go service, which only looks good on paper, can't make the H10 worth the price of admission.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been looking for a new replacement MP3 player for my Ipod 3G 30 Gig.  I was thinking about Ipos Shuffle, Ipod Mini, or Zen Micro (or Zen Micro Color).  Then by accident, I stumpled upon Irivier H10.  It is very small, stylish, and easy to operate.  It's got FM radio, voice/FM recording, color screen (to view pics), and other standard MP3 functions.  It's only $30 more than Mini, but has so much more to offer.  The sound quality is great (but not w/ the included earpiece) and there are 40 sound presets (including your own setting).  In the package, you will also receive a transparent plastic skin.  It fits the player perfectly and easy to remove if you choose to.  This usually goes for $8+ for ipod, and you get it free.  Sure, you can't view those pics on TV like Ipod Photo, but who cares?  What's the chance of you carrying a cable w/ you at all times?  The battery life is around 12 hours per charge and it is replaceble as well.  That means you can buy an extra battery for your long trip to extend the battery life or change it when the battery dies in a year or so.  It is a true Ipod Mini killer and I've used 2 Ipods, Sony MP3 player, and a Samsung MP3 players.  Strongly recommended!  Edit 1:  *After I went to Apple Store yesterday and played around with Ipod Photo, I'm even more impressed with H10 color screen. On Ipod Photo, you have to view the screen directly (right in front of the screen) in order to see the photo clearly.  Otherwise, the photo/lcd will look dim. But, Ipod Photo has faster photo browsing speed.  As I said before, viewing photo on mp3 isn't a priority for me and I'm very happy as is right now.  *I haven't have much problem/bug with this machine yet as others have described here.  The only thing that I've experienced is that once I connect the player to my PC, I can't see the "remove this external drive icon" in the taskbar after a while.  So, I simply unplug the connection cable/usb.  Luckily nothing has happened yet.  *Many people asked me about the skin, well, it is just the Ipod skin you buy in Apple store but fits much nicer on the player.  I can't stress how nice it fits on H10.  For my Ipod, I litterally have to force it onto my ipod (because it sticks to the player so much that the friction is making it hard to do). And yes, it will attracks dirt just like other skins. If you worry about the look of it, don't use it.  If you want a good protection for the player on the go, this is a good choice.

<Content>Do not buy this player as its sound quality is nowhere near to the Creative Zen Micro , Only good thing about this player is Good FM reception , It gives distored sound with EQ settings .I have tried with studio series sony headphones also , whereas with full volume and EQ settings Zen micro gives very ultimate sound. But if someone wants fancy look and facility to store the JPG files can go for this player.

<Title>the perfect mp3 player
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is more of a zen micro killer than an iPod killer...or perhaps its both. It seems to be based on the latest chipset from portalplayer and uses almost all of the features ( unlike apple). I have a iPod 40g for my collection but wanted something to try napster to go. Well, I found it. I am kind of in awe of this mp3 player. It seems to be a lot like the iPod in intelligent filing system and ease of use AND it looks pretty good too. Of course I love the color screen and fm. This puts the creative product to shame. The iPod is in a class by itself-- its the "in" player and might always be. However, if there ever was a true challenger its the h10. I am really happy to own an iPod AND an h10.  BOTTOM LINE: This is as close to an iPod to date as far as looks and feel, and has a ton more features. I doubt it will really hurt the iPod mystique, but it is far superior to any creative zen or dell dj products which look cheap and seem to be inferior in quality ( build). It blows most players out of the water. This is the perfect player for people who like iPods like myself, but want to try napster as well too. It's just a great mp3 player and I can't really express just how nice this thing feels in the hand and operates so nicely. It's more like a pda than a player in some regards. ( very advanced filing system, menus) I really think this is going to sell like hotcakes once they start circulating...and the most bashing will come from creative ( they also make dj) because they can see how much better the iriver product is.  The firmware fix is on iriver.com website now. iriver fixed the bugs that all the bashers said would never be fixed lol. What a bunch of losers on these review boards!

<Title>research this player before committing
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: great build, feels nice and solid;  - the touch pad is excellent very precise movement: tapping the top and bottom of the strip or simply holding it down allows excellent precision and accuracy.  - great feedback with the buttons (you don't have to wonder if you pressed a button when it's in your pocket). - sound quality is excellent volume from 0 - 40. around 20 is already loud enough for me. - color screen; big pictures will appear blurry, but it's expected with a small screen - very intuitive controls. the back button always brings you back to the last screen no matter what the last screen is. example: while in the picture browser i wanted to change the song click FF then click back and i'm back in the picture browser. - excellent shuffle mode algorithm: you will not hear the same song twice as it the player takes the played songs out of the algorithm - MTP = drag and drop if you prefer it more than windows media player. there is no propietary software (but drag and drop is slower than syncing with WMP. it's still not UMS) - excellent FM tuner - battery life is excellent, it actually gets about 12 hours as advertised - removable battery - comes with a iskin like case (but the case attracts a lot of dust)  CONS - IRIVER hurried to release this product; thus, the software isn't complete. there are A LOT OF BUGS. Hopefully, these bugs will be fixed soon with a firmware upgrade. here's some of the bugs 1. some might encounter problems with syncing with wmp i/o error 2. albums on player plays in alphabetical instead of by track number 3. the clock on the player might not work 4. the back light turns on and off randomly in some units. there are some more bugs... visit www.misticriver.net   - you can rate songs on the player but it doesn't integrate with windows media. so a rating of 5 on a song does not update your library on windows media. the player just put the 5 stars first and 1 star last in a list. - for some, this might be a con but not for me - once the backlight is off the screen is pitch black, you can't see anything. press any button turns the backlight on then proceed with function. so if you want the player to FF you got to press it twice. - file browing is slow in browser mode (not the music browser but the file browser the music browser by artist, title.... is nice and fast) - horrible tech support. expect long wait time. (called around 4:30 ish, never answered...finally at about 5:05 got a voice mail saying their hours are from XXXX to 5:00pm)  conclusion. i'm giving a 3 star because at $280 there are simply too many bugs with the player right now; with time IRIVER will release upgrades to fix these issues because it's their new flagship model. the functions and features of the player beats any player out there within the same price range. be patient with this player, it will be an excellent product if IRiver fix all the bugs.  for more research info goto www.misticriver.net click on forums then the H series   it's an excellent forum for support and faqs.   EDIT: regarding "tommygman" i'm glad your player works perfectly. and no i did not simply read something negative. I have a H10 myself and i'm waiting patiently for an upgrade. furthermore, i can tell you that the Korean version of H10 (UMS) which came out a month before the us version (MTP) already had 2 firmware upgrades while they're on FW1.10 the us is still on FW1.00 IRiver has a list of bug fixes which you can find at misticriver.net

<Title>Me likee iRiver....
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll just start by saying, I've had an iRiver mp3 player since April, and except for some stupid things done on my part, it's worked perfectly, and the little 190T of mine has even survived a five-foot drop on a hard stone floor, and has an excellent equalizer, and just adjusting the bass and treble gives it spectacular sound. Judging by others' reviews, I assume the H10 is no exception. As soon as I amass the necessary funds, I intend to buy this, and rock out! The removable battery was iRiver's smartest move in my opinion, and that will give it the serious edge over the iPod. Creative's mp3 players are fairly good, but a friend of mine has one, and the bass is nowhere near as powerful as from my little 190T. The sound overall from the Creative Nomad was diminuitive compared to the 190T.    People who like excellent sound, compact packages, convenient controls, and the complement of a removable rechargeable battery will not regret this mp3 player at all (and yes, firmware upgrades are a must for ANY mp3 player, and iRiver is sure as heck no exception.), and will find a good deal of use from it. Peace out. Chaos in.  I have a few other questions: can this player be used as a backup hard drive? I know that the 20 and 40 GB models can be used that way, but can the 5 gig H10 be as well?  Does the .TXT support mean one can read MS Word documents? That alone would have me drooling a veritable Columbia River. I like to edit my stories on the road, and being able to read over my stories to catch my mistakes would be a definite bonus. That's my bit. But do try and think outside the iPod. This one's a definite up-and-comer.

<Title>Small, Feature Filled, Awesome new player
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all I have to say that my new iRiver h10 has NONE of the so called "bugs" mentioned in an earlier review. I'd love to know how many people actually had these and if that reviewer just read something negative on a bulliten board and felt compelled to bash as if every player had a defect lol. I've been through this player and the manual and everything worked-- and I did check out the site mentioned about the h10 bugs too to make sure mine didnt have any!. Well, my H10 works like a charm and iRiver site mentions that any firmware updates will be posted as needed. 'Nuf said. Back to reality-If you have windows xp and want to use napster to go, it was tailor made for that but of course its great for any mp3's or wavs too. Instead of wondering what it has, let's just say it has just about everything and at a great price. The bonus is that this is a super high quality player that looks simply amazing. I consider this an iPod plus, the plus being fm, recording, removeable battery etc. Its a pleasure to hold and look , and with windows media player 10 its a joy with this music system they worked out ( with microsoft)that Im using. This thing is simply the best mp3 player available. The only con is that it doesnt use iTunes. Its going to be a huge success for iRiver- there is no doubt about it. Ive been using mp3 players since before there were any hard drive models. Its unreal to have one this small with all the features and such an intense menu system with color .jpg viewing  of photos thrown in too. I have it right here and love it already. Mine is grey and very sleek. The design looks 10 times better in real life. Im prone to be pro iPod but have to admit this is really really close in the iPod style department and way ahead in features. Conclusion: The H10 just came out. It's going to be a huge hit and because of this there will be a lot of negatives tossed about by competitors. The fact is that mine works perfectly, sounds better than the creative and rio players Ive had in the past, and importantly looks amazing compared to the competition. Highly recommend.

<Title>Coolest Player for the Money
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I absolutely love this thing. Design is hot and it has the perfect small form factor and frankly I dont know how they got it all in such a small package. I got through the options/features as there are a lot of them and its this is killer plus. I've never had so much fun figuring out a player. I haven't noticed any bugs in my lounge dark grey H10 . IMPORTANT NOTE: The picture here doesn't do it justice. The amazon.com picture is distorted. It has the player tilted which as any photograhper knows causes bad distortion. In real life this will take your breath away. Basics: Super lightweight color screen for photos. A  slim  0.6 inches thick weighing only 3.4 ounces!!!! Amazing touch strip control and removeable rechargeable battery with 12-hour + ( my home test) battery life. Great  voice recorder and a digital FM tuner with FM recorder. The best thing about it is how small it is. Its going to surprise you. But, its not too small. Cool small is more like it. If you don't fall in love with this I will be surprised. Features are important and it sounds great. Looks are important and it looks great. Price is important and its priced low for the features it has. There are a few mini players around now but none with the features this has that look this good. I guess that's what got me interested in the first place. Good luck with whatever you choose. Im a happy camper with my h10!   More info-" PlaysForSure-verified with Windows Media Player 10 with  for Auto Sync for music, photos and playlists. You can choose from a growing number of PlaysForSure download and subscription stores, -- comes with earphones, carrying case with belt clip, USB 2.0 cable, AC adapter, and installation CD-ROM. "

<Title>Awesome Player!  Be sure to upgrade the firmware.
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is hands down best in class...  Comes with great sounding Sennheiser earbuds (must have upgrade if you buy other players). Move over Ipod Mini, Creative Micro and Rio Carbon!  Uh, I forgot they don't have color screen to view photos.  :)  It's obvous that some earlier reviewers are slinging mud...  Hey Bill Gates showed Iriver player at CES 2005, OK!  Got it?  Iriver ROCKs!    Ipod was too well "fem" look for my taste.  Had Rio Carbon but it had terrible sound quality (PCMag was right and good riddance).  Have Creative Muvo and thought it sounded great (of course had to spend another $25 for Sennheiser earbuds as Creative's stock earbuds was TERRIBLE) until of course I got this awesome player!  Best part is that I was among the first 1000 people who got it on Superbowl Sunday for only $180 shipped from Napster including 12 months subcription!  So go get this player as great deal even at $280!    Update -  Hard drive failed on the unit I had.  Called tech support and had to wait 30 min plus but the tech support guy was wonderful and issued RMA on the spot.  Now that's service!

<Title>Great Mp3 Player worth the money!
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing it's way better than any other mp3 player I've used. Here are the specs: FEATURES  * Plays up to 150 hours of digital music* * 5GB of internal storage** * Vivid color display * Ultra-intuitive interface with convenient touch strip * Displays your digital photos * Slim, lightweight design * PlaysForSure enabled to play more of your music * Rechargeable, removable battery lasts up to 12hrs. * Built-in FM tuner and FM recorder * Integrated voice recorder * Ultra-fast USB 2.0 transfers * Supports MP3, WMA, JPEG and TXT files * Enhanced 3D audio (supports SRS WOW  PACKED WITH  * iriver earphones * Carrying case with belt clip * USB 2.0 interface cable * Installation CD * AC adapter  PC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  * Windows XP (Service Pack 1 or higher) * CD-ROM Drive * USB Port  It has a great navigation system almost as good as the iPods click wheel.(but that thing is really hard to match) It's features rival that of it's opponents and tops them all. The 3 players I checked out were the iPod mini, the creative zen micro, and of course the H10. I didn't think the Mini was worth $250 when it can't use Napster has no microphone or radio. The Zen micro was my 2nd choice because it has a radio and mic plus it looks way cool with the blue LED in the back and the colors but that is more of a gimmic than a plus and the touch pad doesn't work that well. Then I saw this by accident actually. I downloaded Napster onto my comp and was looking at it's special offers to see what would work with it. I was going to get the zen micro then I finally checked this thing out and I was captured. Since the iRiver H230 looked ugly I never cared abought them but this thing is beautiful and it looks professional. The color screen is a little to small but it looksamazing compared to most LCD screens like the iPod so when you turn it the image isn't negative. It's simplistic button layout is a definate plus which makes it so you don't have to take much time to get used to it. Also it has volume control on the side unlike the zen and iPod. The sorage is fine with me because I don't need my entire music collection with me at all times.  However you can't directly link your H10 to a digital camera. Plus it has a few minor bugs. Hopefully iriver will make a firmware update.(mud slinging lol must be a fanboy of iriver)  I wish the price was $250 so it could compete with the iPod mini and zen micro easily. But when you make an investment like this you know it's going to work and it does. It also comes with a great iskin which protects it from any fall. This thing is small though I was suprised when I opened it up. Supposedly it weighs less than the iPod mini and it's a photo player!!!   iRiver has set a new standard for photo viewing mp3 players and micro harddrive players at the same time.

<Title>very nice but not perfect
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>pros: nice look, good feeling in hand due to metalic body       slim and light weight        color screen is bright and clear       easy to navigate ( after you get music or photos in to it)       Fm radio is terrific       sound is good, i am still testing the 30 EQ setting       btw MX 400 is a nice earbud  cons: i am using windows xp sp2, wmp 10 , but it still takes        me several hours to figure out how to sync playlist and        photo, since normally i just drag and drop music to mp3       players. I dont know windows media player can creat a    playlist of photos beofore. Also the gel case from the box seems useless, it doesn't provide anything to protect the beautiful screen, Maybe I need to get a cell phone screen sticker.   All in all, h10 is the best 5 g player of its kind( if you say ipod is the best it is also ok, ipod is ipod, who cares)
