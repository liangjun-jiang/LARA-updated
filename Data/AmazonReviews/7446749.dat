<Title>REVISED: If you're not an iTunes kinda person...
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>... then this might intrigue you greatly.  The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.  Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.  The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.  At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.  Then what?  What compels you to choose one over the other?  It has to be the UI and user experience.  The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.  The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.  So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.  It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.  The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.  Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.  Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.  This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.  I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.  However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.  What device would I recommend?  Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.  Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  **** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.  I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).  Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.  Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred

<Title>upcoming market killer
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this new product from creative i feel will be sure to take over the market. First lets name thr competitors. The rio carbon 5 gb. and the ipod mini 4 gb. Lets go on to compare them. the  ipod mini is a so called legend but i dont think so cause first of all it only has 4 gig compared to the carbon and the mini which have 5 thats 25% more. then the carbon and the creative mini have a voice recorder and the creative mini has a fm radio and a recorder. The ipod mini has a touch pad which the creative mini also has. The carbon does not have this but has an auto dj that chooses your favorite songs and your least favorites. the ipod mini does not have this but the creative one does. Like the adress book and such in the ipod mini not to fear the creative one has those too.the carbon does't. Both minis also feature backlit buttons. But the creative mini also has a cool light on the edge of player. carbon doesn't. Plus the ipod mini cant play wma the others can. Plus on the creative mini the touch pad is not  circle and has no buttons on it. Now lets name what all have. Creative has fm radio and recorder,voicerecorder, adress book and such, backlit buttons, touch pad, auto dj, 10 colors. the rio carbon has 5 gb , voice recorder, auto dj, extremely small.The ipod mini has 4 gb, no fm, no voice rrecorder, adressbook and such, .

<Title>Come on Zip
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Zip it seems that you critisize the previous guy of being a creative employee because he likes it. On that basis it would seem that you are an Apple employee, next time do not open your mouth. As for me i think that this product is far better than the apple ipod mini although for it to take down the mini it must have a crack team of marketers to get the word out, other wise it will likely go unnoticed. For all those un biased about products you should find this a much better product than the ipod mini on many fronts.  NEW: It seems that amazon in an attempt to make a few more bucks has jacked the price up from the 250$ that it used to be to 280$. Dont buy here go to creatives web site and buy from them its cheaper and you wont get screwed by amazon. I still love this product and intend to buy it after a few reviews come out from respectable magazines like PCmag or someone like that but until then screw you amazon i hate you and you need to drop the price back down so this thing can compete with the ipod mini.   Even more NEW: Good job amazon you droped the price back down. Who's a good boy, thats right. goood boy.

<Title>Zip it!
<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my first Creative player, the Zen Xtra 60GB for 5 months now and I must say that I am incredibly happy with it.  I don't think that "Zip" is actually an Apple employee but worse yet a Mac geek (see book, "Cult of Mac").  The most ridiculous argument made by these types is with regard to the sound quality.  The ipod and ipod mini do most certainly have worse sound quality than just about any of their competitors.  Not only have I tested this myself, but anyone can read professional reviews and ratings for these players, where the apple inferiority in sound quality is always noted).  I just read a consumer reports roundup (either nov or oct 2004) of HD digital audio players and the ipod and ipod mini were each the WORST of their respective categories in sound quality.    I don't own it myself, but have a friend who does and can tell you that the Iriver ihp series absolutely blows away the ipod in many aspects, including sound quality.     As for this "imitator" label, lets all remember that apple was not even the second company to come out with this type of device (hard drive based digital audio player).  Creative was indeed the first with the Nomad. I owned an Archos jukebox well before the ipod was released (that model even has better sound quality than the ipod).  The ipod certainly was the smallest when it came out and continues to have a great interface but others have caught up.  Apple is actually the imitator in this regard although this is not well known becuase apple has the greater geek fanbase and marketing muscle to help obscure things.  Most people are not even aware that competing products exist.  What is apalling though, is that the advertising and the apple fanboy base have gone so far as to claim that the ipod has better sound quality.  I'm not just expressing my opinion, standards for measurement of sound quality exist and Apple's ipod's and ipod mini's do not compare favorably against the competition in this regard (do some research on Google, even on your mac).  Creative is the standard in computer audio hardware (the core elements of a digital audio player) and this helps them produce players with great sound.    No, I do not own a Zen micro and have never written a review for anything before owning the very item.  I was forced to do so here after noticing the utter insanity of Zip's comments.  If you want to just load up your player with Justin Timberlake, Creed or Brittney songs off of ITunes, perhaps the ipod is your best bet, just quit lecturing others.  Also, the backlit screen will reduce the battery life for any player, and the zen touch's battery life still kills that of the ipod (if you actually did own one).    Please, zip it good!

<Title>Good functions, but way too ugly
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.  But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  Creative should hire some real industrial designers.

Pros: +5 GB Seagate drive +Great sound quality (all of Creative's players) +Synchs with Outlook +Looks cool +Removable battery  Cons: -Requires software to transfer music -No tactile buttons, all touch sensitive.   And to the fool zip, iRiver was out before the iPod, so your point is moot.

<Title>Interesting design
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I really like this "curved" design, and the electric blue glow is cool (can't wait to play with it under the sheets with my girlfriend). Have to remark to Gadgester about "Creative should hire some real industrial designers." that  J.Ive's worked on toilets and wash basins before iPod, which probably explains the white of the original iPod and the metallic colors of the mini, they all remind me of public toilets. The beltclip on Mini is really useless (unless you have small private parts and need to show your Mini off to impress the girls - "look see girls, I spent wads of money girls, do you like me now?) The curved shape of Micro plus its smaller size will make it easy to slip anywhere, Mini was uncomfortable in my pocket, all those sharp edges sticking in me. Good to see Microsoft and Creative team up with this product so that it will work on any PC running Windows. Think I'll leave iPods for the people who spend money to look cool, and get myself a Zen Micro as I value my music quality above what my friends think of me.

<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm writing this review because I'm been loocking forward to the iPod competition... but it is constantly letting me down. Why does creative incorporated FM radio and not ogg sopport first?, being this a digital music player... I think the are just trying to battle  the iPod with the same features, not really trying to make a better player. There are far too few ogg players out there, and most of them are not good or too expensive...

<Title>Lotta Bang for the Buck
<Date>Sat Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I could type all day about the knitpicky waa waa of iPods and Zen players, but what it boils down to is simple, really.  The new series of Zen players are well worth the coin; they're functional; they look good; they sound fantastic, and they cost less than an iPod.  Bottom line.  But hey - buy an iPod if you want - Steve Jobs is the laughing all the way to the bank.   For the record, it was Creative that invented the portable music player, but it was Apple that created something unique with the concept and put marketing muscle behind it.  If you want to be specific, you could say that the iPod is actually an expensive knockoff of the of the older circa 1999 players - yes 1999!  Was there an iPod back then?  Nope.

<Content>I am totally hot to buy this, based on the specs as outlined on Amazon's site. However, one thing I'd like to know before I buy - will Bose and other 3rd party vendors offer products to complement the new Zen system as offered for the Ipod? I'd like the flexibility afforded by the speaker docking station, and right now it seems as if Bose is offering such an option only to the Apple consumer.  Thoughts???

<Title>I'll never buy an iPod!
<Date>Wed Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First I'd like to make a clarification of Timothy Stoehr's review. He states, "One thing that's cool about the IPod mini is that it doesn't carry a disk drive but rather a CF card. No spinning mechanical hard drive. Much more reliable." Hey smart guy, they're not called "microdrives" for nothing. It's true that CF cards are used in iPod minis but they are CF Type II, which means that they are in fact hard drives and they DO have moving parts. Don't believe me? Go here: http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/micro/soltns.htm  3600 RPM, 12ms avg. seek time  All microdrive players have moving parts, and all microdrive players utilize CF Type II.  I don't own a Zen Micro yet but I am waiting for reviews to come out. I don't know about you guys, but I refuse to buy an Apple iPod. I refuse to buy into the Apple image and support a company that still won't use the right-click on a mouse! Pathetic. I walk around and see all these people with white earbuds and I just shake my head.... If the Zen Micro were just 0.2 inches thinner I think I would be sold for sure.

<Title>Buy the Zen Micro and support the Ipod killer!
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hi, I'm a music technophile hailing from the tiny island of Singapore, the country that is offering the world the Zen Micro. Like many people, I have been sold on the idea of getting a hard-disk based portable MP3 player since mid-2004 and have been hunting around for a good one for the past 5 months.  When the mini-Ipod came out in Asia to buy in July 2004, I was pretty much interested in getting one. However, the high price for 4GB (S$458.00=US$275.00) and seriously, not too exciting colours, stopped me buying it immediately.  My attention turned to the then-competing product, the Creative MuVo2 4GB. Retailing at S$398.00 (US$240.00), the gadget looked pretty attractive, but I was still hedging for something better, as it was still larger than the mini and looked a bit plasticky.  So when I saw the Zen Micro on pre-launch in October 2004, and the blurb by the CEO of Creative Technologies in the local papers on its features and functions, I was very intrigued. The next 4 weeks was spent trawling the internet reading reviews on the pros and cons of the Ipod Mini vs. the Zen Micro. Very interesting.  Now, I'm pretty convinced that I shall get the Zen Micro, if only to march to the beat of a different drummer. Hearing friends extol the virtues of the Ipod and dissing everything else without empirical evidence just helped me make my mind up even more.   I'm sure that audio quality wise the ZM will beat the IM hands down. I don't know about the rest of the functions, but I am willing to place my faith in the hands of the underdog.  As for those writing about whether accessories companies (Bose, are you listening?) will support the ZM, I think that the market must be there first before these companies will create the supporting accessories. I for one would love to be able to plug the ZM into a good home stereo, either at my home or at my friend's place. Oh, and bluetooth capabilities would just be too cool.  So, all you people out there who's had enough of the hype of the Ipod Mini marketing machine, here's your chance to tell Apple who's really boss!

<Title>Cynical Reply
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Wow this player would be so great if it were only an Apple iPod. If it looked like an iPod, had less features like an iPod, only worked with an iMac and iTunes and were actually made by Apple and not Creative then I would love it.   I do so wish it had MIDI support however, because all my favorite songs are in MIDI. It would be really awesome also if it had something usefull like a text based role playing game instead of having a calendar and contacts.  Obviously I'm being facetious, but that's kinda the vibe I got off all the negative comments. There was no good argument against a device that for the same price has higher compatibility, better sound quality, more functionality, a removable battery and a radio and voice recorder thrown in just for giggles.   My only major complaint at this time is that I preordered this device on Oct. 17th and it still has not shipped, apparently due the overwhelming amount of orders placed for it.   I do wish that there were some hands on reviews out there (CNET has it, but has not posted their review yet) and I wish it came with the wired remote. I still plan to purchase that seperately but it would have been nice to have it included. If anyone has found any real hands-on review please let me know.   If you are a Windows user and do not use iTunes AND size matters (I had a 20 GB unit but it just big enough to be a problem when snowboarding and skateboarding) then this is the best option I've seen.

<Title>Very happy with the Zen Micro player
<Date>Tue Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Zen Micro is a great little player.  I have had the silver Zen Micro for almost 5 days.  Its a big step up from the flash player I was using before.  Its a nice small package and great design.  Its a little wider than the I-Pod and feels slightly heavier.  The case is very solid, and the front face is seamless.  Sound quality is excellent, although I did replace the earbuds with the Sony Ex71SL earbuds, which are really, really good and much more comfortable.  Navigation and controls work very well.  I still think the I-POD scroll wheel works a little better than the straight line slide control on the Zen, but the difference is not that great.  The volume was very easy to adjust, even during work-outs.  It took a little time to figure out how to create a playlist from the music library, but its easy once I figured out the sequence, and the menu lets you select songs by genre, artist or song name.  The Zen Micro also allows you to create and save on the fly playlists, or you can create them with the Media Source sfotware.  Its great that there are so many ways to download music vs. being tied to i-Tunes as with the i-POD.  The included software makes it very easy to transfer files to the player, and I was able to use either Windows Explorer, the Creative Media software or Musicmatch to transfer files (I was not able to synch with Napster).  I did find that about 4 to 6 out of the 200 songs I downloaded did not transfer for some reason when I used either the Creative Media Source software or MusicMatch.  So far the battery life is less than 12 hours, but the early editions of the Micro shipped with two batteries. It could be that by turning the backlight off or adjusting the controls less frequently the battery life will be much longer.   Overall this is a fantastic player so far.  I'm very impressed with the quality for something that was just launched last week.

<Title>Exceeds the Ipod
<Date>Wed Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I compared the Zen Micro to the Ipod. It's plain out better than the Ipod in these areas:  - battery life and convenience - sound quality!!! - extra features (fm, voice recorder)  It's relatively the same in "user-friendlyness". For all those people debating about the better design, they are both well made and look nice ... it's up to personal preference. Just let each customer make up their own mind about the aesthetics. Don't get me wrong, the Ipod is a good player, but there's too much hype and overall, I believe the Zen Micro is better. Better sound, battery and more features, what more can you ask for?

<Date>Fri Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After researching mp3 players ad nauseum, I decided to buy the Zen Micro, and I'm glad I did. I have a flash player for the gym but wanted something with more storage for everyday listening. My music library is a little over 35 gig but I felt I didn't need that kind of capacity in an mp3 player. What drew me to the Zen Micro was the replaceable battery, the FM Tuner, the optional clip, and the ability to create playlists on the fly, not to mention that it has more storage than the iPod mini. I looked at the Rio Carbon, but it didn't have an FM tuner or playlists on the fly. I looked at the Archos Gmini XS200, but the battery is not replaceable and the initial software is reported to be clunky. So far, I have been very pleased with the Zen Micro. The touch pad seems to be a point of debate with everyone, and I agree it takes a little practice, unless you have a laptop with a touchpad in which case it is second nature. I was concerned that the touchpad would be so frustrating that I wouldn't enjoy the player, but that's not the case. The sound is excellent, the player is tiny, the software is easy to use, and the thin neon blue strip of lighting definitely adds to the cool factor. I am using Windows Media for syncing and haven't had any problems yet. This is definitely going to be an iPod mini assassin.

<Content>Like many other ppl, I was deciding between this player and the Ipod mini.  I chose this for the following reasons:  -1 gig extra -FM Tuner -Voice Recorder -Detacheable Battery -EXTRA FREE battery($40 value) -NON proprietary music file format(plays WMA, which is smaller than mp3 and quite popular, doesn't work w/ ipod :(  Have had it for a week now.  Took less than a minute to install.  Very intuitive interface.  The control takes a little getting used to but it's definitely manageable and oh for ppl worried 'bout the "touch sensitive" controls, there's a "lock" button, works great.   I highly recommend it.

<Title>Good player but  very poor construction
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had, which ended up rendering it useless (out of warranty).    However, while it worked, I was quite pleased with the player and the included software.  Everything was intutive and ran smoothly (except for an occational freeze with the player which never became frequent enough to be a major burden).  I also liked the fact that this player wasn't bound by iTunes or file format restrictions.  My only other complaint was that occasionally the touchpad made moving small increments like up one track or down one track somewhat difficult (just give me buttons, I know they aren't sexy but they're easy and work well).    I am giving the product 2 stars because, while I liked it, Creative has known about the headphones flaw for a long time and has not improved the build (being that this is STILL a problem with these players).  For the amount of money that a player like this costs, it should work for at least year!

<Content>This MP3 player is packed with features but all that means nothing if it doesn't work.  My headphone jack began to fail after just 3 months of ownership and wouldn't work without contant jiggling.  The hard drive failed just outside the warranty period.  I deposited the device in the trash and purchased a Sandisk Sansa player.  It's much nicer, slimmer, has no hard drives to fail and contains all the features you would need.

<Content>As many other reviews have agreed, I liked mine until it broke - in two ways.  Same headphone problem as others, but that was nothing compared to the total meltdown it then experienced.  Now I can't even turn it on, and I've only owned it 11 months.  I liked the space, features, setup, etc. but that makes me all the more sad that it's hopelessly broken.  Try another brand, because if you buy this one you will just end up buying the other brand in a few months anyway.

Yeah ight, for a major defect that was THEIR problem and if you weren't under warrent then too bad?!?! Not only that but the software wouldn't let me well do anything. I had to go install a new media center just to sync music. This would have been the Ipod killer if it didn't have crap service and hardware problems. Don't waste your money on Creative.

<Title>Good until...
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Zen Micro about a year ago.  I loved it because it had great features at a great price.  The music is pretty good and it holds a lot.  The radio is good once you get it to tune.  The way it is designed is great and the voice recording is useful.  A few weeks ago though, my problems with it started.  If you charge the battery when it is half-way, it makes the battery last a LOT less.  It started dieing very soon.  I tried to charge it, but when you take out the battery and turn it on it goes to a recovery screen.  You can't get out of it easily.  It is helpful but never delete the firmware. It says you can reload it onto the player through a USB plug, but you can't easily at least.  Since it was more than 60 days old, they wouldn't let me talk to them over the phone.  Also, it was more than a year ago so they wouldn't even help me by e-mail.  They left me with a small "knoledge database" that didn't help at all.  They did say though that for $12.99 you could get a 30 minute session with a "Creative tutor."  I took a search to finally find the phone number.  Finally I got in contact with a person and told him my problem.  He told me that I could send it in and get it repaired for $60 to $100 plus $12.99 for shipping back and whatever I pay for shipping to get there.  Disgusted, I decided not to pay, and just got a new player.  So I am here to tell you that while the Zen Micro might be good, the service is absolutely terrible.  Even Apple which I heard doesn't have great service has better service than Creative.  [...]

<Title>Not that great...
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought one of these for my daughter and within a month the thing would freeze up. She sent it back for repairs and left the battery in. They fixed it and sent it back without the battery and told her it would cost $40 dollars for a new battery.  I was mad and wrote the head of their public relations department a letter and Creative called me the next morning and had a battery overnighted to my daughter. (hint: go to the public relations for fastest results). Then it happened again and they would send a new one (didn't have to call their PR after the first one). This happend 3 more times till my daughter quit using her sony sport headphones.  Then after about 3 months the headphone jack started having problems, so she brought it to me and I fixed it. And it has worked fine since then. The same thing happened to my video zen:m using the sony headphones. Evidently there something with sony headphones and creatives MP3 players. Now my daughter has a ipod nano and seems really happy with it.

<Title>Programs not clear
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had the unit only a day, and figured out how to load the mp3s after an hour or so of loading program and reading the manual. Although pretty much Windows drag and drop, there is some setup to do beforehand, so don't rush things and read the pdf manual. The paper manual has instructions for installing the drivers and playing the files. You'll have to go online or read the pdf manual to really work this thing.  I think I am pretty satisfied with the quality and oompf of the player itself, but Creative's "MediaSource Organzier" interface (along with the simpler "Media Explorer" and their capabilities--or not--caused many wasted hours here on Day Two. The Explorer offers a task list to easily rip audio CD to the device, with a box to check whether you wanted to also rip the mp3s to the Music Library on the C drive. I didn't want to waste my precious space on C drive, so unchecked the option. Later when I wanted to burn an MP3 CD (rather than an audio CD), I found could do this only with access to the harddrive's version of the Music Library. When I finally figured that out (and I reripped the album I was interested in),  then the mp3 burn list would import the tracks only in alphabetical order. I tried via a custom playlist and bringing over a clearly numbered Album, and they tracks jumped to the burnlist in alphabetical order. Through the forums on Creative's website, I discovered that is the only option. No way to have the mp3s be "tracked" on an mp3 CD burn. And that's it. Phooey.  And for some reason, I could not after the fact move my many ripped albums of mp3s from the Zen player to the c drive's Music Library. If this had been explained beforehand or at all somewhere, I would have saved hours of time. But their manuals and tutorials make it all seem so easy..select tracks, place them in order with my named playlist, click a few buttons...and presto, it's stalled or a mess with no means to figure what happened.  I eventually worked around the whole thing using other programs, and now have a cd that will play my tracks in order on a CD player. Now I'm just going to make straight copies of it. Too many hours where a few sentences in the manual would have helped.

<Title>Cool!
<Date>Wed Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received today an IPOD mini and a Zen micro, so had a great opportunity to compare them side by side.  The verdict?  Both are well built and beautiful gadgets but the Zen Micro is way cooler... The way its lights glow and pulsate during charging is especially mesmerizing.  I am totally in love with it.  To top it off, the sound quality of the Zen Micro is clearly the better of the two.   Some additional features on the Zen Micro that I particularly like -has an option to automatically normalize the sound volume of all my MP3 tracks, so I don't have to constantly adjust the volume when changing tracks.  This is so convenient as I have some tracks that play too loud and others that play too soft.  -built in FM radio with automatic preset -LONG battery life!  Highly recommended.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player at an Affordable Price
<Date>Fri Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own. This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems. Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance. To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it? You ask, yup. That's it. I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features. Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro. My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.  Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it. Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  Not everything in this world is 100% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such. I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available. Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).  That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!

<Title>Serious iPod Mini competitor
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I would give this 4.75 stars if possible, but 5 was too much.  Overall, however, this is most likely going to be the next big iPod killer.   The pros for this product are many.  First, it has a removable battery.  The batteries are rechargeable, and it doesn't take a multitude of people to change the battery.  The back slides off of it, and there is a place for the battery.  Plain and simple, but much better than the iPod mini's battery, which has had records of bad battery life and expensive removals.    For another thing, another reivewer commented on the touch-screen buttons and how they are bad.  This is not necessarily true, however.  The older iPod 20/40 GB models also had touch screens, yet nobody complained.  Touch screens are not always completely sensitive to everything, as the person makes it sound.  When you touch the buttons it responds, and while sometimes it may respond to other items, its not very often.    Personally, I think that the Zen Micro looks nicer than the iPod mini.  The thickness was somewhat annoying, but its only something minor.  The Zen Micro has 10 different colors, and all look very sharp.  iPod mini's colors are limited, and the Micro's colors aren't only brighter, but the buttons light up nicely for a good touch.  I never liked the iPod's touch wheel, as it was used for too many things.  Volume, song scrolling, playlist selection, etc were all too much.  Many times I held the middle button down to get a song to a playlist, yet it instead misread the usage and played multiple songs. Little things such as this led me to the iPod's death in my heart.  The 5 GB storage is also nice.  It holds a good 1500+ more songs (as advertised), but is not too much.  I've had two iPod Mini's (one stolen, one just broken), and on each i was running out of storage space within a month or two.  Yes, you can delete songs from it, but it is not something they come out and tell you.  I could not even find it in the user's manual.  The Zen Micro is also much easier to use with Windows.  The format that everything is set up in was mostly designed for Windows users, as opposed to the masses of people with Windows and Apple-designed iPods.  Again, minor, but the small things make all the difference.   Creative Labs' Zen Micro is a great little mp3 player, and it could lead to the downfall of iPod Mini's.  Probably not, but I'll be hoping.

<Title>Zen Micro - New User:   Pluses and Minuses
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Owned 2 about 2 weeks. Bought at Fry's 1st wanted IPod mini but FM tuner, better sound specs, extra storage, free user changeable battery and better projected battery life convinced me to buy Zen. Wanted them to take to gym FM tuner was big plus bk the gym has tv's with assigned fm frequencies, nice to listen to/watch tv while on treadmill.  Turned out to be a dud.  FM reception, at least within the gym for frequencies assigned to TVs is marginal to unlistenable.  Better headphones help, but do not resolve this problem. Also, turns out deep in PDF manual (that you don't see till after you buy) says you shouldn't use these while jogging, it could damage the unit.  When we went to Fry's a Creativerep was there,we told him why we wanted these instead of the IPods, to listen to the fm for TV's while jogging and also asked if armband carriers were available for them.  He said the armbands were included in the box, and that the FM's were great and that was a good idea.  When we emailed Creative their response was:  Maybe he misunderstood you, and yeah, "other headphonse might help the fm reception, no apology, no suggestion as to where to get the armbands, no suggestions as to which "other" headphones.  Also, the touchscreens are kinda tricky and everytime you pick one up you change the station or restatrt the song. Pluses, so far no operations issues, at least for us, sound good and they do at least HAVE an FM tuner, software is good, and I"m getting better with the touchscreen. (also I found an armband carrier, got it at the Apple store, aftermarket model for IPod Mini)

<Title>Zen Micro Problems
<Date>Wed Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Everything was brilliant....playing media was fine, syncing was fine... (as there was about 2-3 hours of battery life in it when it came) However since I charged the battery up with the mains adapter provided (about an hour ago) it's been downhill from there! It worked fine to start with and then it started locking up. Now the PC won't even see it.  I've tried the Disk Cleanup and Reboot options on the special startup menu a couple of times (when you hold down power button in the on position when you reconnect the battery) but am still not having any luck. I don't want to format it or mess around with reflashing the firmware (even if there was a newer version!) if I can avoid it as at least I've got a couple of songs on it. The special start up menu says Creative Zen Micro v0.0.56 and the information says version 1.00.05.  I got the special edition version which came with the two batteries, the first battery I tried had enough juice in it for a 2-3 hours of play. Funny that I never saw Jimmy G's message until I started having problems with it.   Really sad and disappointed, it's great aside from this lockup bug, don't know whether it's the software on the PC or the Micro itself. Guess I'll have to wait and see if any updates come out.

<Title>It's turned into a love/hate thing.......review update
<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out. Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work. So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. Then last week, my player just quit working, period. After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home. Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer service, they said I should send it in for repairs.  I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them. They obviously have quality and reliability problems. They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.  My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once! Yes, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try. My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  I threw it away.  Those are minor complaints though.  I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.  Amazing.

<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I love this player. The sound is just fantastic. It is small and light.  My other player is a Zen Xtra - the menus are similar and it took no time at all to find my way around the Micro.  No problem between the player and my computer, not a single lockup.  There are loads of options in the menus to customize.  I like the equalizer.  The touchpad was easy to get used to.  I saw some people saying that the touchpad is too sensitive, but you can ajust that. I haven't needed to. I do use the hold button because I slip the player in my pocket.  I'm very happy with the battery life - though I've not timed it, I used the player for a few days before noticing it was on the last bar.  Not a single problem with it, I love it.

<Title>Not Recommended (POS)
<Date>Sat Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First review I gave it 4 stars  Second review of this thing after using it for a while 2 stars.   I grant good sound quality, and it looks nice.  BUT  It is not a well made unit.  First failure for me came after about 9 months of light use. It just stopped playing. Turns out the hard drive froze up. I did some drilling, and it seemed to be a common problem with the Seagate harddrive Creative was using (on the early models?) A LOT of people had it.  Now the on/off switch doesnt work.  The only way to use it is to yank the battery to turn it off, and plug it into the charging adapter or dock port to turn it on. Tech support wants $25 each time it looks at it, even if its still within the one year warranty. So Im up to $300 for a shoddy player which will no doubt fail again.  Take these reviews to heart, dear reader. You will see that bad ones are quite common. Save yourself time, money, and aggrevation.  Get something else.  Noel

<Content>Creative came out with a good Item but with a bad warranty which says that it doesn't believe in their product enough to warranty it for a full year.    After 6 months of normal use my Zen didn't work.  I contacted Creative and they said that I was out of the warranty period which is 90 days for this product.  They said that they will repair it for an additional cost of $25.00 + Shipping.   so Again READ THE WARRANTY WHEN BUYING.  For the price I paid I could have gotten an IPOD.

<Title>Zen Micro is the worst piece of junk I've owned!!
<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>WARNING!!!!!Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage!!!!It's hard to believe Creative had the nerve to release this buggy piece of garbage.  The Zen Micro was recommended for its superior audio quality over the Ipod.  However, I could not put up with it's dismal performance.  I had to retire it and get an Ipod.  The software was slow, cumbersome, and crashed CONSTANTLY when I would try to upload songs.  With Itunes you can change songs using a batch method, but with Creative's software, you have to go through EVERY mp3 one at a time!  That's a lot of songs on a 5GB player!  What takes seconds with Itunes, takes hours and hours and hours with Creative.    The Micro would keep rebooting, and was very slow between songs.  Touch sensitivity was annoying, especially compared to the Ipod.  I tried updating to the new software, but that made the Zen Micro perform even worse! After rebooting, it "rebuilds" the library, which takes a couple of minutes. When it finally reboots, it takes so long to play a song you select, oftentimes you press play twice to make sure it registered, which of course pauses the mp3.  Very frustrating. Designwise, The Micro is far from "micro", especially compared to the 5GB Ipod.  The Zen Micro shouldn't even be considered to be in the same catagory as the Ipod.  If you're considering getting one, go with an 8-Track instead.  You'll be happier.

<Title>nice mp3 player...when it works
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this thing for christmas 05 and it started crashing around june (about 5 months later).  It was a bunch of things that messed it up.  It seemed to work fine but I couldn't hear anything from my headphones.  I had to wiggle the head phone thing for it to work and it sometimes only worked when i had force on it at a certain angle.  Another problem was then when I try to charge it..it just lights up and it wouldn't charge for some reason. After noticing that I unpluged it, and the light wouldn't go out.  So I took out the battery and put it back in and it would automaticly start itself up and would freeze at the greeting "Creative" screen.  It would do that for a couple days, works for a couple days, then stop...going on and off and deciding when it would and would not work.  It's very frustrating.  Other then all the bad stuff, there are some great features that it has.  built in FM radio, microphone, calender, adjust EQ settings, phone book, and date/time (which was always wrong no matter how many times I set it) you can adjust the sensitivity of the touch pad. and there are many different play modes (repeat, normal ect..) the blue lights and screen are bright and very noticable in the dark.   Overall...this is a good product...when it works.  and when it crashes for while...it is VERY frustrating to try to get it to work.

<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product has really really really pissed me off.  I got it in about October and it worked great until about March.  All of a sudden the sound would be really horrible and I had to mess around with the headphone jack a little and hold it there so it would sound right.  (Very, very inconvenient even when it wasn't that bad.)  It just kept getting worse and worse.  I love music, so I just kind of dealt with it and had to always keep one hand fidgeting around with the headphone jack just to get some decent sound every once in a while.  Within the past month, about 5 time it has just not turned on at all.  What pissed me off the most is it decided to completely stop working about 2 hours into my 11 hour flight to Tokyo, and I still had a return flight to make about 10 days later.  Going through and tagging most of my mp3's was a real pain too and 5GB isn't nearly enough space.  I've had to delete songs many times just to get new ones on.  I really don't want to keep having to get the same product for my birthday every year because the one from the previous year has already stopped working.  Look into other mp3 players before purchasing this one.

<Title>Don't Do It!!!!!!!!
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is amazing - when it works. Which for me, was two months and why it gets two stars. I originally gave it one, but when it does work it really is awesome, absolutely no complaints. Mine froze and died two months after I opened the package. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it fixed because it was a gift from an ex who I was no longer in contact with by the time it broke. After it froze I frantically scoured the web trying to find a way to reset it. That didn't work. I changed the batteries, etc etc it was just dead. I thought about buying another one until I read all the reviews with similar complaints. I am not an Apple person, but since that is all there seems to be I finally gave in last night and bought one and so far I love it. I initially resisted because of the software (I thought I hated iTunes) but I am getting used to it and liking it! So this is probably not what you want to hear, but this is my advice - skip this and buy yourself an ipod just like everyone else. There is a reason it is so popular!!

<Title>disappointed

<Content>A year later and I wish I had the money for an ipod. I have been having the audiojack issue for a long time and don't even take my player with me anywhere anymore. What's the point of having an mp3 player you can't walk around with? Ridiculous.

<Title>Great Features, But Huge Flaws
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This music player was decent: Nice look, controls, and sound. There are many nice features including decent software and using it as a data drive. There are really good things about this unit; however, the faults are just too great; thus, superseding the great features.  However, the reaction to your key pushes, and file search are way too slow. The software is pretty nice, but the bad thing is that it likes to rename your files for you even when you didn't ask it too. That gets very annoying. For example, I just want the file to be named as is, with no tags, but the Zen software will add tags no matter what, even if it has to put in the word "unknown". It also has these strange crashes that makes it hard to have it recover. The worst part about this product is that the earphone jack gets damaged in a few weeks or months -- unprovoked!  It was so frustrating to think my headphones where damaged, but I switched it up and found out that it was the Zen. Then I read online, and what do you know -- it's consensus, the product is faulty because many other people have experienced the same problem. Some people even found some fixes, and I've tried them, but to no avail. But then again, why do I have to fix a fairly new product?   If you're going to have a fault when it comes to a music player, you DON'T want it to be a physical issue that renders the player useless!  I'd give it at least three stars as I was quite satisfied with it, but the physical fault with the headphone jack is just too much of negligence to overlook.

<Title>The MP3 Player for the Rest of Us
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Creative Zen Micro is no iPod killer. It is the iPod for the rest of us. Where Apple's product is stylish and fun to use, it has that unfortunate Apple characteristic of locking users into buying their music strictly from Apple. iTunes is a fine online music store, but there are many others and some (MSN and Musicmatch for example) are as deep in selection and easy to use. And the Creative Zen Micro gives us a player every bit as intuitive and stylish as the Apple product and the benefit of FM radio, Outlook synchronization and the use of every online music store other than iTunes.   Everyone knows that the Micro comes in an array of colors. Mine is silver. I like the blue glow and the shiny white case that compliment the silver face. Personally I think the black model looks best, but I didn't buy the unit for the color. I've seen a number of reviews of the Micro from people having trouble with the vertical touch pad. After two adjustments, I had no issues with that controller at all. It is more intuitive than running your finger in a circle. The touch pad and menus it opens are user adjustable. I was having trouble getting the Micro cursor to stop where I wanted when scrolling though the menu lists. I adjusted the touchpad sensitivity setting to low but that didn't help. I adjusted it to high and the problem was solved. It may seem counterintuitive to select high sensitivity to better control the touchpad. If you're having touchpad issues, try the high setting and see for yourself.  The Micro comes in with good quality ear buds, a hard shell case that accepts adapters to help it serve as a belt clip or a desk stand. There is also a carrying pouch, a USB 2.0 cord, universal AC adapter, and the removable, rechargeable battery. Other accessories are available from Creative. I am not a big fan of ear buds, but these are pretty good and the cord doubles as the FM radio antenna. I selected Auto Search and the Micro found strong signals for all of its 32 presets. I live in an area with lots of FM radio, so performance in other areas may vary.   Volume on the Micro is controlled by the touchpad, not a separate button. Some folks prefer a separate wheel for volume. It is more important to me that the volume reaches acceptable levels and is EQ adjustable. Both are true on the Micro. There are a number of EQ presets and a limited ability to customize adjustments.   You can create playlists on the fly which is a great feature of the Micro missing in many other MP3 players. It is also possible to create playlists on your computer using either the included Creative software or Windows Mediaplayer 10. I like the interface in WMP 10 better than the Creative software and the Micro syncs with WMP 10 flawlessly.  The Micro has a microphone for recording voice notes. Speak normally into this mic or you will get distorted sound. At normal speaking volumes, the quality was fine. You might be tempted to shout to such a tiny device, but don't.   Creative says the battery will play for 12 hours. Early buyers of the Micro are receiving an extra battery in the package, which is a great bonus. I charged the extra battery and keep it in the pouch to be handy when needed. I've not run a battery test where I drain the unit dry, but I probably won't get 12 hours anyway, because I set the backlight for bit longer than the default. I was pleased to learn that the Micro charges either from the AC adapter or via the USB cable when it is plugged in for syncing. That is a nice touch.  My unit is full with just over 1000 songs, far short of the 2500 claimed for the 5GB drive. This is my fault. The 2500 claim is based on using only WMA format songs recorded at 64kbps. I have a mix of WMA and MP3 files and I usually encode at a much higher rate. This is another reason the Zen Micro is the player for me. The original iPod and other devices are just too big. I don't have anywhere near 10,000 songs to carry around. I am pleased for those folks who do, but drives that big would be a waste of space for me. The 5GB units provide just enough room for me to carry around my digital collection. As the number of songs I own grows, I can always compress them to fit better on the Micro or become more selective about which tunes get synched.   Creative has a winner in the Zen Micro. I really believe this is the music player for the rest of us and, with some marketing behind it, it can do for the other online music stores what the iPod did for its brother iTunes. Thank goodness for choice.

<Title>Owned it less than an hour
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The touch pad sucks, and sinks this product COMPLETELY. I am an enthusiastic owner of a 30 gig Zen Extra, and I WANTED to like this product. Ordered one through Amazon/Office Depot, and it arrived in 48 hours. I set aside an entire afternoon to play with it. Accidentally set the language first to German, then Japanese trying to select english. Trying to do initial setup with this thing is a NIGHTMARE due to the touch pad. I stopped after getting into english. How in the hell do they expect me to operate this thing on my hip while I am mowing the lawn or working out, or in my car, where I have to do it without looking? Thanks a lot Creative, you really screwed this up.

<Title>Down With IPOD!
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I hate Apples, and i bought a crappy mp3 last year cause i didnt want an ipod.  Man was that dumb, i could have just bought one of creatives mp3s and listened to good music.    I hate ipods, they are evil ugly stupid devices that cost a fortune, and are actually not that cool.  Those things are like ten pounds.  And the minis, are only like and inch smaller.  So i said, screw apples, and ipods.  Then looking at pcmagazine the other day, i saw the most beautiful mp3 player i have ever seen.  The zen micre 5 gb mp3 player.  It is so cool.  Does everything an ipod can plus more.  :  It has radio.  It glowsin the dark with that line that goes all around it.  It has an extra battery that lasts 12 hours, unlike stupid lame ipods.  It has more than one color, and theres a black one, whichis awesome.  It carries a two and a half thousand 2500 songs!  ( and Who the hell has 10,000 songs to listen to???)  If i had ten thousand songs, at a dollar a song, id just buy a huge cd player and keep it in my personal jet all day, while on my way to my secret school in Antarctica.  But reallyl, i dont even have a thousand songs, so why pay a fortune for crap you dont need if this is better, smarter, and cheaper, and cooler!?!?!?   I dont know, but i do know is that ipods are evil and ugly and expensive.

<Title>Nearly Perfect ... 
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased a Creative Zen Micro at a local retailer recently and it easily deserves a five star rating.  The sound quality is excellent (much better than several iPods I've listened to), the battery life has been impressive and the (mostly) intuitive interface has been fairly easy to master.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, my experience with the Creative software and the connections to my computers was pretty positive.  The software loaded quickly on both my work (HP laptop, docked in port replicator) and home (Dell laptop) computers and within a few minutes I was loading songs.  Surprisingly, the Zen was also recognized by Musicmatch, my primary program for managing music files, so I was able to load songs directly onto it from Musicmatch as well. I'm now at a little over 1,000 songs, the unit is nearly full, and I've got enough music to last me for months.    The only criticism of the Zen Micro - and it is a small one that I'm sure will be improved upon soon enough by Creative once the technology permits it - is that 5G is a little on the small side. 5G isn't quite enough room for someone with a fairly extensive music collection, although it should be plenty for lots of people. I'm sure in another year or so, when Creative offers a Zen Micro with a 10G hard drive, I'll be tempted to upgrade and find a new home for my 5G version.    For now, however, it has been an extremely impressive purchase.

<Title>Not Audible Ready with update now that it is
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Update:  As of 2005 sometime this player became Audible compatible as I'm sure someone else has already stated. Be aware that the Photo version of this player is still not compatible. I ordered the player and have had it for over a year and really like it. The sound is better than that on my friends' iPods and now that Napster has ironed out the bugs in their software, it's a great player for the subscription services. I use this all of the time and would give it at least four stars at this point. I only wish it had a slightly larger hard drive and I miss the digital clock screen that some other Creative players have.  Previous review: Okay, I don't even have mine yet but will be returning it as soon as it arrives (okay, technically Santa will be making the return even if she doesn't know it yet) as it is NOT AudibleReady. I don't know why they are offering the price discount for this player. I just didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake.   Someone on Creative's website claims to have a method for converting the files several times to something that the player can play but I don't want to bother with that since there are other players that are AudibleReady. Audible isn't much help in resolving this as their customer support just refers you to their list of AudibleReady devices and the Zen Xtra is on it (you must download extra software to make it compatible).

<Title>Beware before you buy it if you are runners!!!!
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got mine in the mail today, very excited about it.  I did a lot of research before I bought this unit, but I don't know how I missed this one.  I just found out on the website that they don't recommend you to run with this unit since you can damage the HD.  That is actually my main purpose of buying something small, so I can run with it.  Now I am stuck with this unit.  IPOD, on the other hand, has skip protection for both regular IPOD and mini IPOD.  They advertised that you can jog with it with no fear.  Don't take me wrong, after doing a lot of research about it, Zen Micro has a lot more features than any others in the market.  But if I can't jog with it, why do I need a small player for?  Another thing, I accidently chose the wrong language since the touch pad is extremely sensitive.  Now I am stuck with Japanese language.  The manual says I have to hold the menu/back botton to change the language.  I got the menu to come up, but it's in japanese, so I don't know which menu would let me change the language.  So, I reloaded my firmware according to the tech support, but there is no firmware available to download on the website yet.  They will e-mail it to me, so far I haven't got it yet.  It hasn't been a great experience for me yet so far.

<Title>Less Than What I Expected
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had a Zen 20 GB player for a couple of years and have no complaints with it. I thought a smaller lighter player might be a bit nicer. The sound quality is excellent.   I use my player through a cassette adaptor in the car alot, and I noticed that the volume on the micro had to be turned up louder than the old Zen Player in order to obtain a good linear volume control on the car stereo. This sucked the battery down in about 3-4 hours.   The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. However, the touch pad was not well designed. It's much too sensitive, even on the lowest setting. The real problem is the distance your thumb has to travel on the pad to move just one line is so short, that it sometime seems impossible to hit the function or album you want to select. Very frustrating when you keep going up and down, hoping to land on the selection you want eventually. And by all means, don't tap the pad by accident, you'll be looking at a menu you don't want at the moment too!   Overall, I was disapointed with it, and sold it after 1 week. I gave it 3 stars, based solely on the sound quality. I'll stick with the thumb wheel on the old Zen.   If you want a Hard Drive Player, get a Zen Xtra 30GB player for about the same money. If you want it for workouts or jogging, then get a 1 GB Flash Drive player.

<Title>This thing rocks!
<Date>Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.  That was before the Zen Micro came along.  I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  It's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.  Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.  I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.  This appears to prevent the lockup issue.  The battery life doesn't appear to be anywhere close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.  The extra Gb is just a bonus.  The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.  If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.

<Content>I received this MP3 player as a gift last July, and I didn't start using it until last winter. However, within the past few months a significant problem has occured with the headphone jack and the sound quality is terrible now. Apparently this is a widespread problem with this player, and all you have to do is Google "headphone jack Creative Zen Micro" and find the Creative discussion board to read hundreds of complaints about this one problem. To make matters worse, their customer service is practically non-responsive. Do the smart thing and purchase a different MP3 player.

<Title>worst of the worst 
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wouldn't recommend the zen micro to anyone, even my worst enemy. I had read some of the negative reviews before purchasing the unit, but discounted all of the critisms upon reading many positive statements written here on this website.  However, I have now owned the zen micro for about a year, and just about every problem highlighted by other reviewers has come true.   Here is a partial list: 1) Hardly ever boots up cleanly 2) Stops in the middle of a track for a few minutes, then miraculously starts up again. This happens about every 15 minutes 3) Battery life (even at low volume is at most 3 hours)  Here's the thing: For the first month or so, everything worked great, then it went downhill from there. I have downloaded new firmware several times, I'm constantly rebooting the unit to try and get it to work, and sometimes it won't boot up at all. Basically it's a time consuming and never ending struggle. In addition, Creative have not been helpful in trying to resolve all the issues. Sure it sounds great, when it works, but do you really want all the hassle? I don't...I'm getting an ipod.

<Title>From a kid's perspective
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased a green zen micro with my babysitting money in September 2005.I had done my research and was either going to purchase this or an Ipod mini. I made a mistake by purchasing the zen micro.  At first it was great. The sound quality was good as well as the headphones. Then after a while the sound quality got poorer and the headphones broke. After 3 or 4 months the headphone jack got messed up and you have to keep adjusting the headphones to get any sound at all. One time I dropped the player off of the counter and thought I broke it but my dad figured out how to fix it. What you do is you take out the battery and thump the back of the player a couple times and then put the battery back in and try to turn it back on. If it doesnt work the first time then keep trying and eventually it will. Here are the pros and cons  Pros-  good accessories- wall charger FM radio  Playlist function Voice recorder   5 GB storage-plenty for my collection   Cons- bad headphone jack poor sound quality after a few months battery life not as long as they say  Overall I would say go with another player because this one doesnt last very long. I will probably end up buying an Ipod nano because from the reviews I have read the problems I have had with the zen micro don't seem to happen to Ipods.

<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first got this as an xmas gift, as i was looking for a step up from what i had originally, which was a very small 30 song player. I wasnt completley sure of the Zen, but, after owning it for many months, this is definitley the right choice of a mp3 player. Its worked perfectly, the only fault that has happened for me, is that i broke the USB cable. Pros: 1. Same price as an Ipod Nano, but, more than double the space 2. Great construction 3. FM Radio and Voice Recorder 4. Plenty of Space for Music 5. Rechargeable 6. Excellent firmware with player, Itunes compatible  Cons: 1. Battery life is shortened if backlight is left on 2. Some people have had problems with the headphone jack, So far i havent. 3. Out of Package Battery can only be recharged through Computer connection. Creative does sell a hookup with the player and a wall outlet, as well as car outlets sepratley. 4. All of your friends with Ipods will be jealous that you got a better player for less.

<Title>Too fragile for a portable device
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like the features of my Zen micro. But the product is VERY fragile. I won't buy another Creative product in the future because of my bad experience with this product.  First, let me say that I bought the Zen Micro because I wanted a full-featured MP3 player, but I didn't want to pay for the "coolness" factor of the Ipod.  I liked that the Micro had a replaceable battery, and an FM radio (although the radio doesn't pull in a good signal most of the time).  But I am on my 4th replacement Zen Micro. The first time was because of the loose headphone jack problem. The second was because my 2 yr old son got hold of it and dropped it 12 inches onto a hardwood floor. The third time is because I dropped it about 2 feet onto a hard carpet floor while taking it out of my pocket. It not like I was throwing it around. It's a portable device; it's gonna get dropped! Creative should make these more sturdy!  Hopefully I can keep my 4th Micro without breaking for a while.  If you insist on buying the Zen Micro, here are my suggestions.  BE SURE YOU BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM THE STORE when you buy this product. The BestBuy 2 year warranty was worth the 50 bucks it cost me.  Keep the player in the case provided, It's bulky, and makes it hard to keep in a pocket, but will provide a level of protection.  DON'T use the belt clip. The clip essentially slides into the case but does not latch or lock or anything. The clip comes loose VERY easily from the case and will cause you to drop your player.  To prevent the headphone jack from breaking, I rolled a strip of paper into a tube, and slipped it around the space between the jack and the case. This prevented the headphone jack from moving and breaking the solder connections. Creative may have fixed the headphone jack soldering on new models, but I'm not taking the chance.  Buyer Beware!

<Content>Unlike those who've experienced technical problems with jacks and being fragile, my zen micro has flown off the tread mill more than once...in fact, I'm needing to replace the belt clip, which did break....the player did not.  It took me a bit to figure out the menus, and I don't love the way (I think) that the playlists have to be created on the computer and synced...so I suppose the software could be easier.  I personally use the record feature with the built in mic, so I can get a song idea from my head into a digital format very quickly - like we used to do with hand held tape recorders..but this is so much better.   I haven't used or had an ipod, so I can't compare, but I sure wouldn't like to have to use itunes....and this has been a great little player for me for about a year!  Just wish accessories were cheaper and replacement parts easier to find!

<Title>Zen micro - poorly designed
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player has a decent audio quality, but it has a lot of fatal flaws: 1)	Its headset socket is extremely poorly designed. It does not go through the PCB, so the factory soldering cannot keep it in place. I have re-soldered it once already and within 2-3 months it is back to the same problem. 2)	The radio is useless. I live in the Chicago metropolitan area and I cannot get any of the radio stations I normally listen to. Even in the gym where their transmitters are close enough I the FM tuner does not pick up the signal. 3)	It is extremely slow when booting up and navigating is slow. 4)	The keypad is a pain too, even though the sensitivity could be adjusted. I would not recommend this player to anyone.

<Content>I love my Zen Micro.   The sound quality is great and it gets a great signal on FM radio.  My favorite thing about it is the fact that I can add and delete songs individually or as a group using Windows Explorer.  I don't even bother with the software that came with it.  I just drag and drop the songs I want to add.

<Title>Love this player
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I've had mine for about 7 months now and still love it. I really like it's small size so I normally carry it in a cheap cell-phone holder on my belt. No real problems with battery life at this stage (and I shouldn't have either). The face plate control was a little fiddly, but no interface is going to be perfect so you just get on with it.   I REALLY like the fact it has a radio, it was a big selling point to me as I listen to a lot of talk-radio during the day. I was leary of the iPod because of it's battery changing problem (you have to send it back to Apple). Don't know if it is the same deal with the Zen Micro, but I hope not. Only gripe is I have to charge it via the USB cable, there is no seperate power adapter (that I can see). I tried to charge it with a lap-top that did not have the Zen software installed, and it did not charge! Even when I left it overnight. I don't understand why it didn't charge. Having the software installed shouldn't make a difference...   For my birthday I ditched the little white ear-buds that came with it and splurged on a set of Shure E2c noise insulating ear buds. Man what a difference! They are not noise-cancelling, but work like an ear-plug, blocking out external noise.  [...] Highly recommended.  There are plenty of in-depth, technical reviews out there already, so I will not bother repeating them here. Two thumbs up!

<Title>Creative Products:  Truly poor technical quality
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After several attempts to own a functional Zen Micro, I give up.  It should not be this hard; iPod, here I come.  My first Zen Micro broke within three months of opening the box.  I returned it (a small but manageable hassle).  I received an entirely new one about two weeks later, no charge.  Two months later, had power management issues with the new one; Creative recommeded an upgrade to the firmware.  OK, fine.  Three months later, the thing completely crashes -- no music, no connectivity to my PC, nothing but a permanent splash screen.  I tried the restore mode, but none of the restore functions were working.  The thing was dead dead dead.  I called Creative to see what they could do.  For $25, they could tell me what I already knew:  it wasn't working and needed to be fixed.  Then, they made it clear that they would be charging me for whatever it took to fix it.  All this despite the fact that THEY sent me this lemon and it was less than a year (read: still within warranty) since I had received it.  Great customer service, eh?  Bad product + bad customer service = doomed company.  Don't buy a Creative Product.

<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player, this is my second Mp3 player, first one being the Creative Nomad2. Firmware upgrade is a MUST for Zen micro. It was very tough to 'create' cons for this player.   Con: I am sort of jealous that 'click wheel' belongs to Ipod, the touch pad of Zen Micro is very good, but since its a vertical bar pad, as your thumb reaches the end, you have to lift the thumb for further browing. so much work! but this is an excuse only for extremely lazy guys like me.  Pro:  1.Good Battery life 2.Good Music Quality 2.Drag-and-drop feature doesnt require any 'seamless integration with a software' 3.Compatible to Subscription music(i use Yahoo unlimited)  Other: with Flash-based players catching up to 5Gb capacity, this might soon vanish.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ok, I have had my Creative Zen Micro for about 1 year. It is definitely far and away then the Ipod. First of all, its not an Ipod like everyone has, its something different. No ITUNES to use, Mediasource and Explorer are so simple to use(drag and drop). Battery life is great, I get at least 9+ hours on a charge. Holdability and colors are nice! Next, USB 2.0 kills Firewire point blank! Transferring data is quick and easy. You can also use the player as a Removable HARD DRIVE!! That isn't true on the Ipod. Lastly the FM radio, recording off of the radio, and outlook sync is cool. Other reviewers don't seem to be careful with their player! Also sensitive can be controlled in the system settings!  Apple is far behind this player in most respects. All they really have is  a marketing campaign! What person that uses an Ipod has a Mac computer. I would say 1 in 20 or ever more! Get a windows based player for a windows system!    Keys: -Price I got mine on sale at the time for $179! -No Apple to deal with Itunes -Removable Battery -Great Layout, Menus, Buttons -Customer Service- Easy to connect to creative on the phone. Very helpful. Getting a hold of Apple is like pulling teeth. -Plays Many formats mp3, wav, etc and great software too! -Firmware updates are easy  Downfall: -Earbuds are not great. I Recommend a pair of Sennheiser headphones highly. -Need to buy a skin or case if using heavily -Creative Doesn't market their products Thanks!

<Title>It was pretty Iffy.
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am 14, and I recieved a Zen Mirco for christmas of 2005. I was thrilled to own it, and even more thrilled to have matching speakers. I quickly uplaoded dozens and dozens of songs, just jamming to my music. I enjoyed being able to shuffle my music. My mom knew how badly I wanted an mp3 player with a touchpad. The Zen is a thousand times better then an iPod, if you ask me. I was in love, but about a week later, when we went out to watch the fireworks for New years, I had a hard drive failure. I wasn't able to turn it back on. Devestated, I sent it back. It look a little longer then they said it would, but I was thrilled when i finally got it back 1 1/2 monthes later.  I still had a problem, though. My Zen would not shut down. I chould charge it completely, turn it on, immeadiatly shut it back down, and it would say "shutting down" for hours, until it finally ran out of batteries. There was no way to turn it off without removing the battery. Soon enough, my dad realized why Iw as taking the battery out, re-did the ahrddrive and firmware, and now, it takes a few seconds to turn it off, that's it.  I highly reccommend this item, but be prepared. There could be a time when it needs to be sent away and fixed. If you are willing to work with a problem, this item is for you. I still love my zen, and I bring it with my everywhere.  Being able to create playlists is totally awesome. I have a playlsit devoted to just gentle music to relax me before bed, and I have another list with vibrant, loud music to dance to. You can create doezens of playlists, for any type of music you are craving at that moment.  The fact that it's all in alphabetical order and is catogorized bo genre, album, song title, and/or artist makes it even better.

<Title>Great Player!!!
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had mine for a couple of days.  I bought it without the firmware and documentation.  I had to download the firmware and try to figure out how to get the music on the player using Creative Media and after a few hours went back to using Windows Media.  I wanted my gentle music on one playlist and the other music on another and to randomly play each.  You have to have some kind of knowledge on how to do this, although once you figure it out it's not that hard to do.  If you have your music on your computer and just want to download it and play it randomly, you can do that with little or no knowledge.  It takes some playing around with the unit to figure out how to do playlists etc.  My advice is to not buy it without the firmware and documentation no matter what kind of bargain you think your getting. The unit has great sound and plays "play for sure" songs.  If you download music from Wal Mart or any other "play for sure" site this is the player for you.

<Title>A good buy with a few glitches. 
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I must say I love my mp3 player. It really is great. this zen is one of the best alternatives to the ipod. It has everything you'd ever need to just listen to music. Also, it is compatible with the subscription survices such as napster-to-go and rhapsody. Over-all its one of the best mp3 players on the market. But, it does have glitches which seem to fairly common. sometimes the player will just freeze up, some problems where your computer will simply stop reading it, and it also has a tendency to duplicate songs in the playlist because of licenses but it can be fixed by reformatting. (which erases everything) Overall it is a great mp3 player with a few minor glitches. I would still take it over most of the competitors.

PRO very quiet, does not lock down, ultra fast customer service by email (I had a problem and they solved it with a firmware upgrade within 5 hours) world radio, Alarm function, really cute and really small  CONS You have to install software on your computer, the software is not very good and you can't just plug it into any computer.  You have to get used to the touchpad (it has 3 different sensibility stages)

<Date>Tue Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Sound quality is superb and the interface is comparable to the simplicity of the mini ipod.  With extra 1GB, FM radio and built-in mic, extra accesories (pouch bag, battery charger, and USB cable, and belt clip) make it superior in value.  The minuses are the battery life, which does not seem to live to the claim made by Creative, by a longshot.  I got lucky because my unit was a limted edition, which came w/ two batteries.  The FM signal reach is only good for strong signals.  The headphones' sound quality is above average but the earpiece is a bit too large.  All in all, it is a gret device.

<Title>Better than an IPod!
<Date>Sat Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen Micro for a week now and I'm incredibly pleased.  I looked at quite a few players and it came down to this or an ipod mini.  I finally chose the Zen because it just seemed like more bang for my buck.  With the Zen you get an extra 1GB of memory for music or removable storage, FM radio, radio/voice recording, organizer features, removable battery, and some nice small touches like alarm clock with autoplay.  Aesthetics: 4.5/5  I would have preferred a single color for both the body and faceplate (silver in my case) but that's just a small quibble.  Overall it's small and just plain cool looking.  Furthermore it's already survived a fall to a hard surface.  So I'll conditionally call it sturdy as well.  Accessories: 4.5/5  Came with an extra battery and belt clip.  It also comes with a stand that I have not used. I would prefer a case that covered the faceplate but the belt-clip is fine and there are 3rd party cases that will fit.  USB connector and power cord are included as is a fairly useless drawstring cloth bag.  Functionality 5/5  MP3 player with partionable hard drive for file storage. The FM tuner is excellent.  Recording radio or via microphone is easy and useful.  I haven't fully explored the organizer features yet but I imagine the ability to sync addresses and appointments with Outlook will come in handy.  Battery life is spec'ed as 12 hrs; I'm getting around 8 hrs of MP3 play.   Sound Quality 5/5  The sound quality on both mp3 playback and radio play is fantastic and better than the ipod.  Ease of Use 4/5  The Zen Micro is ultimately very easy to use but I'm taking an extra half point off here because of poor documentation.  The printed booklet provides only minimal information and the PDF instruction book is not much better.     The touch pad takes a little bit of practice and is not for the arthritic but ultimately is easy to use. Touchpad has adjustable sensitivity and can be turned off to avoid accidental activation.  Navigation is fairly intuitive but the player would benefit from a "home" button to get you out of nested menus a little faster.       A note on installation:  When I initially connected it to my laptop, the Zen micro froze.  It turns out it is finicky about which USB port it syncs with and I've noted that others have had similar problems with USB connectivity ports/cords.  Other than this single incident, I have not had technical problems with it.  Also note that there is a firmware upgrade available on the Creative site.    Overall, I'm incredibly happy with this device and recommend it to others interested in a mini player with more than just mp3 playback.

<Title>for my first mp3 player i really like it
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have never had an mp3 and everywhere i look i see an ipod or something similar.  I have read many reviews here and in magazines and what not and talked my wife into getting me the zen micro for the holidays.  My original reasoning was for the battery life as i have heard bad things about the products without a removable battery and also i wanted to have a FM radio as i like to listen to that on my morning commute.   So now after using it for 2 weeks I have to say i love it, but i gave it a 4 and not a 5 because i think it needs improvement.  I think the improvement it needs is with the FM tuner for some reason mine doesn't seem to work everywhere.  It only works in 1 room in my house but to be honest I have no need for the fm tuner when i have this thing with me.  As i previous stated i listened to the fm radio on my morning commute but when you have over 100 of your favorite cds(with plenty of room to spare) in the palm of your hands why bother with the radio.  At first i admit i didn't know how to use the touchpad and i even switched it to some kind of asian language but I was able to figure out how to get it back to english and then it took me about 2 more uses to get it down pat and now i consider myself a pro at it so I think if someone took the time they would figure it out and be shocked as i am that there are so many compalints about it.     Also, I have to say that the battery lasts me 4 days of my commute which is about 2 1/2 hours a day which comes to about 10-11 hours, they advertise 12, to be honest i got an extra battery with my zen micro so this is not an issue for me.    I think the software is also very easy to use too. It has help right in front of you if u need it and answers pretty much any question u have. I know i needed it when i first started but again i was able to figure out everything i needed.   Now about my complaint, overall i don't think of it as such an issue to deter someone from buying it but i would have liked for the radio to work better.  My cell phone has an fm radio and it definitely works better than this one, but then again i can't listen to almost all my cds from my cell phone, until that comes out i will be proud to have this.

<Title>My first mp3...
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Zen Micro is my first mp3, and I am quite pleased.  Even the packaging gave the impression that this gizmo was top-notch.  So, without further ado:  ***Pros...The presentation is very cool.  I still smile whenever the neon outline comes on.  *The sound is excellent, now that I've rcvd my Sony EX51LP ear buds, (Amazon, $25.49 w/ free shipping).  *The re-chargeable, re-placeable battery is definately the way to go.  *The thing is so tiny and light, I don't even bother with the belt clip.  I just put in in a pocket, and always hit the lock.  *I do some pretty rough hiking with it, and it never skips.  It's only "glitched" on me while tracking once or twice, and I'm not sure that that wasn't the fault of the download.  But damn, this thing sounds good.  ***Reservations...So far, the battery life is nowhere near 12 hours. (maybe seven?)  But, I did get two batteries.  *The touch pad absolutely requires a deft touch, and I do mean deft.  Folks with ham hands should definately keep looking.  *The printed manual is not a manual at all, and the virtual manual is sketchy at best.  I'm still trying to figure out how to do some basic player functions, and can't find them listed anywhere in the "manual".  *I don't care for the music management software.  I already have my cds recorded to hard drive with Roxio, and there's a great deal of confusion in the transfer of files to the Micro.  I may have only two or three cuts per album from several albums in a single folder titled under the artists name.  But the player won't download them as folders.  It downloads them as all of the individual albums, meaning that many albums on the player only have the two or three cuts.  Also, I have quite a few jazz compilations.  The player lists each individual artist, from each cut of each compilation.  This makes the "artist" category on the player totally unwieldy.  And almost none of the albums are listed under genre, making that category useless.  Now, all of this may just be my inexperience, but it's not all as easy as the p.r. says it is.   All in all, though, I am very satisfied with the Zen Micro.

<Title>Had Potential
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The following describes my horrible experience with the Zen Micro and may not necessarily be indicative of all.  The Zen Micro's battery life is advertised to last up to 12 hours, but I was only getting 7.5 after installing the latest firmware upgrade and properly conditioning the batteries. For testing purposes I used 128kbps MP3 files, volume level 8, no EQ setting, no backlighting, and the headphones that came with the product. Given these non-demanding settings, the battery performance was truly disappointing.   I really wanted to give it another chance so I got a new replacement within a few days. My second Zen Micro completely locked up as soon as the USB cable was plugged in. Since I hadn't return my original unit yet, I was able to try the other known working cable but got the same results. I was not even able to upgrade the firmware, let alone transfer music, because of the lockup problem.    I really wanted to like this MP3 player (great style, sound, build quality, features) but two defective products in a row is totally unacceptable. I should have been more suspicious about Creative products since my Muvo TX FM player was buggy as well (i.e. player would immediately shut down when powering on).    REVIEW UPDATE I recently got the Rio Carbon and am much happier. I was able to get 19.5 hours of power immediately after the initial charge and can get 21 hours at times. Although the battery isn't replaceable, it should last two years and much better players would be out by then anyway. Thinking back, even if I hadn't experienced all the technical problems, the Zen Micro wasn't really suitable to my needs in the first place. The Zen's interface isn't tactile friendly at all and can be inconvenient to use during exercising or driving. For example, it's impossible to skip tracks or adjust the volume by simply reaching into my pocket (or the car's center console) feeling for the appropriate flat button to push. It's not even recommended to jog with it anyway. I guess I was initially attracted to the Zen due to its sleek design and coolness factor, but good usability is more important.
