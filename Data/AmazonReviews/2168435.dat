<Title>I love this thing! It does everything it claims to do
<Date>Wed Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing! It does everything it claims to do, except for the limited viewing angles it perfect. I have a canon digital rebel all I have to is pop in the CF card and dump all my pics and keep shooting. This process doesn't even take 5mins, and that's a 512mb card.  	 The video is amazing, it's flawless, I haven't noticed any jerkiness in the playback. The software is pretty slow but I use another freeware program to convert video.   Excellent Sound quality, it has a customizable EQ and Bass boost, what else do you expect from a company that makes high end sound cards? The navigation is SOOOOOO easy and fun to use. Battery life is great as well. This has to be the best thing Creative has ever produced.

<Title>A very feature rich media machine
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the new iPod video when it first came out, without the benefit of being able to preview it. After buying software upgrades, I spent quite a few hours trying to convert my movies into the proper format, then the proper size, only to realize that my images were now too small to see. I returned it. I was going to give up when I saw a link that led me to the new Creative Zen Vision. It was pretty new too, with no real reviews. I figured I would give it a shot.  First impression is that it has twice the screen size of the iPod. It's the options within the Vision is what sets this apart. While Apple has sold us the puzzle, one expensive piece at a time, Creative Vision has given us the whole picture. This is a VERY feature rich media machine! It has an external memory slot! Can you possibly believe that the #1 competitor doesn't have this? I have 2 other iPods and now I wonder why I ever bought them!   Those 2 features alone are what sold me, but then it does much more. It has an external speaker (so you are not completely lost if the headphones are mutilated by car door). It has a built in microphone (you can record directly to the hard drive without having to buy anything else). It has a built in FM radio. It has Video/Audio Out so you can port your media to another computer or television (how about carrying a bunch your DVD quality presentations/movies in your pocket, plug them in, and you're up and running)! Finally, it even has a basic Organizer with Calendar, Tasks, and Contacts.  The low points; Yes, the view straight on is not the best. But I usually don't hold the screen that way, just a few degrees down is fine (the picture doesn't distort, and I don't get any reflections). I would like the Power Connector to be readily available. It's under the same rubber flap as the A/V Connector, which is to say that any time you leave the power connected; you have to expose the AV connection to the elements too. A simple tethered plug would be better. Next, the Compact Flash slot is outdated. A simpler, and smaller, Secure Digital slot would be better, especially as most PDA's, phones, and Digital Camera's tend to go that way now. Creative does sell an adapter, but it's another piece of the puzzle to buy.  This thing could easily be 5 out of 5, with just a little more tweaking.

<Title>What a shame: Photo lovers beware!
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this from Amazon last week. It's really a beautifully built device with one enormous flaw. The screen is a disaster. I ignored the advice of some previous reviewers who warned about the viewing angle issue with the screen. Boy were they right! If you are buying this device primarily to view photos then steer elsewhere (see my recommendation below).  First this is a nicely designed device. It has such a solid feel, with a slim form factor, a tightly engineered, elegant interface and button set. It feels great in the hand. Creative's engineers should be congratulated.  Except for that screen.  It's simply unusable. Sure it's big, and dense with pixels and color. On paper it seems incredible. But it's not incredible to look at. Just as previous viewers said, at best when you view pictures you must hold this thing at an ridiculously restrictive angle, and with one eye closed or the image will distort and shimmer badly. Essentially incredibly narrow viewing angle and the binocular nature of human eyes will be enough to create shimmering with this frustrating screen. I showed it to my wife and she agrees.   Video playback suffered a similar effect though not as dramatic.  One other smaller issue was that you can't zoom photos so if you want to preview to look for blurring and such you can't use this device.  What a shame. I really almost considered keeping it because it's just such a nicely designed piece.   Anyway I sent mine back and with some reluctance ordered the Epson P-2000.   The Epson arrived a few days ago. The screen is wonderful. Everything the Vision should have been. Clear, sharp and easily viewed from a much wider angle. No shimmering at all. Same size, same dimensions (640x480) but has a zoom feature that works very well.  The Epson doesn't have the same tight build and the device is a considerably bigger in size, with a slightly cheaper, plastic body. Slightly bigger hard drive. Also has an SD/MMC card slot in addition to the CF slot. Essentially the same functions as the Vision but no FM radio. I didn't buy the Vision for the radio.  That said I'm really happy with the way pictures appear on the Epson and will certainly keep it but still miss the build quality of the Vision.

<Title>Barely Better Than The Previous Version
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had my Creative Zen Vision for all of about 3 hours.  Having previously owned a 20GB Creative Zen Portable Media Center and being completely unsatisfied with it I was really hoping that Creative had gone the extra mile and learned from their past effort.  Well, 3 hours into things I discovered they did a few things right but one thing horribly wrong.  The screen quality is just plain awful.  If people are finding a decent angle at which to hold their's then that's great, I couldn't find one at all.  You'll spend more time fidgeting, trying to find an optimum angle than you'll ever spend actually enjoying a movie on the thing.  It's simply a cheap lousy screen.    The rest of the unit is fine.  The construction is solid, the interface very easy to use (though the included software isn't all that great), and even the sound is pretty good - but let's face it, we buy these things to watch movies on and if they can't handle that then what good are they?

<Title>Great product - read the manual
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I started looking at items like this one because I wanted a device I could use to store my photos while traveling without lugging a notebook computer around.  When I picked this one, I think I made a great choice.  Mainly, in this review, I want to address some misconceptions found in other reviews.  First, the screen:  The viewing angle is not an issue at all.  I was amazed to see what is said in some of the reviews.  It is a one-person device, but I can move my head several inches in any direction without problems.  The screen is amazingly sharp and clear, and easily visible even in bright sunlight.  Second, you CAN use this as a removable drive.  You simple set that up under the extras menu, make sure you have navigated to the removable drive screen on the Vision, and then plug it into a computer.  It will come up as a removable drive under My Computer.  It works fine.  All I had to do to find out about this was read the manual.  It also works fine to store my photos.  It's easy, fast, and SMALL, being about the size of a deck of cards.  The 30 gigs is enough space for even a pretty long trip, and I take a LOT of photos with a 7 MP camera.  I had no trouble transferring my movies to this, either.  I have a very large collection of DVDs, and I wanted to be able to watch them while traveling.  I am using a program called Magic DVD Ripper to convert them, and it is easy.  It does take about an hour for my computer to do the conversion.  The battery is removable, so you can, if you like, carry a second one.  Try that with an Ipod.  All in all, I haven't found much of anything to complain about.

<Title>nice but buggy
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved my Zen Vision for Christmas and initially I was quite impressed.  The screen, although it has restricted viewing angles, is impecible.  The viewing angle wasn't as much of a problem for me as many people made it sound, it's actually quite easy to find a comfortable angle.  The sound quality is far better than an ipod, although I don't like the equalizers so I just shut them off.  The product is smaller than I imagined even though I knew the dimensions, which was quite a nice surprise.  My problems with the device lie more in the video playback.  Even though it claims to support many formats you are very resticted, I have yet to find settings to encode divx or xvid so that playback on the device has properly synchronised audio and it only supports wmv up to 320x240 with a constant bitrate which still looks beautiful on hte devices screen but if desplayed on a TV is inadiquate. I have yet to experiment with mpg or mpg2.  The firmware is VERY buggy, I have experienced several "freezes" during video playback where the device simply stops responding and the battery has to be removed, if this happens the device then needs bout 2 hours to "rebuild" next time you turn it on.  Creative claims this will be fixed in the next firmware update.    So overall I enjoy the product, it's fantastic as an audio player and does wonderful with wmv video playback, just watch out with your other formats as they have caused nothing but problems for me, and if you check the support boards at creative's site, tons of others.

<Title>so far so good
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since I bought this Creative Media Player I have nothing bad to say about it. First of all the sound quality is wonderful. Sounds just as good as my stereo, maybe even better. The removable battery is cool and so easy to replace, plus placing songs in this thing is so easy. And you don't even need to load the software into your computer. All that you need in a media player. But the software that does come with it is cool. You can rip an entire cd right into it without having to go into your computer. Plus you can lower the compression rating all the way down to 48 kbs. Works great with Napster and Rhapsody...no problems.....well just one....battery lasts about 4-6 hrs on a full charge...otherwise it's great...even plays movies too...still haven't figured that one out yet...I'm just a novice so when I do you better believe I'm gonna put a movie in this thing. One other thing...there's an a/v jack so you can plug it right into your tv or vcr...which is so cool I'm speechless. Can't wait for the new model which will hopefully have more GB's. 30 is just a little small for me. Highly recommended. Screw the ipod...get this instead...why pay 99 cents per song.

<Title>Get This Forget IPod
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you are looking for a great PVP (portable video player) with great sound you need to get the vision.  The Zen Vision is outstanding.  Way better then the Ipod.  I have had three Ipods in my time since they have come out.  The first Ipod was buggy and the battery always died for no reason.  Even when I was not listening to music.  The second Ipod i got was the third generation and didnt ahve video yet.  Still the battery died out and I had to send it in to get a replacement.  From what I know they still ahve not resolved the issue of people having to send in Ipods to get them fixed when the battery doesnt work right.  The Zen Vision does not have this problem for the battery pack is removable.  Also it has loads of features, screen is as large as the Ipod itself.  Its great for Videos.  I don't see why people are having so much trouble with the importing of video files.  I have had some problems with some files but mostly everything is going smoothly.  Everything does not have to be converted but if you want to conserve space then you should.   The FM radio is awesome.  It is clear and I have no problems with it so far. Firmware has been updated so some people who complain about some of the features may have their questions answered and complaints resolved by now.   The screen is not bad.  Yes there is some glare but its not like I am going to be watching the movie from ten different angles.  its meant to be in your hands while you watch it.  If you want people to see it..Plug it into your TV.  People complain about the view but what kinda view would you get from Ipods tiny screen ?    I love this device its very nice an well worth the price Creative has listed.  This price on Amazon for the Black version is too steep.

<Title>Zen Vision is very Creative!
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The creative zen vision has great features. Personally i think its a great product. I recommend fully. However there are a few things that may bug a few that did not bug me, here are some.  1)Viewing angle isnt as terrible as people say, but it is true that you have to tilt very slightly to the right to make the color right. But this didnt bother me.  2)Doesn't work under linux or mac. But it will once linux+mac support MTP. (microsoft transfer protocol).  3)It gets a bit choppy during playback of high resolution videos.  4)no album art.  5)its a big clunky. meaning that it is definetly not a one handed device. Not as portable, but what do you expect its a 3.7 inch screen.  But the pros are obvious -high resolution screen -cf slot -30gb hdd (about 28gb actual size .) -sleek magnesium case  And come on guys, the screen issue isnt that bad!!! Unless your reviewing movies for hours at the studio, in that case you would have a 40inch screen, not 3.7 .. its a portable player .. not a portable home theater.  Hope my review was helpful!

<Title>Probably the best portable media player  out now and for a while!
<Date>Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, let me start by saying that I am a picky guy.  I send stuff back all the time if something is not what I expected or how it was advertised.  I am keeping the Zen Vision.  I am glad that I decided to ignore the "crappy screen" comments.  I did a lot of comparion shopping before deciding on the Zen Vision.  Creative is a solid company and I have never been disappointed with their support in the past.   FIRST IMPRESSIONS The screen is excellent.  It's bright, vibrant and a joy to look at.  It IS true that if you slant the thing off to the right more than a few inches or to the left a little more, the screen is more difficult to see.  IMHO you have to be trying to find the angle that doesn't work.  Normal viewing is NO PROBLEM AT ALL.  Have not had a real problem with the small-ish navigation keys, although I have hit the &lt;OK> (Enter) center button occasioanlly while navigating. Big fingers, small buttons,  natural enemies.  PROS The sound is great (what else would you expect from Creative?).  Menus are intuitive.  PC software does what you need quite easily. USB 2.0 transfer is blazing fast.  Included soft case (bag) is thoughtful. Included AV cables are great.  CONS Connecting AV cables disables screen.  Good in most cases, but when I tried to play through CD system using headphone jack and did not have enough audio level.  When I then used the AV cables the screen blanked and I could not see what I was doing.  Maybe I am missing something?  So far after 1 week, I have not found anything else I did not like and do not expect to.  Everyone I have showed it to thinks it is VERY cool and better than any iPod out now.  SUMMARY If you are in the market for a portable media player with video I can't imagine finding a better player, especially considering the price.  Enjoy!

<Title>Good product for the price
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:    A lot of features such as Video Playback, MP3, Organizer, Alarm Clock, Voice Recorder, FM Tuner.  Using their software is basically like opening up explorer in Windows.  Resolution and sound quality are nice.  Having buttons instead of a touch pad allows for more precise control.  Removable battery pack is nice.  There is an additional extended battery pack available for purchase.  Has a speaker so you can blast ghetto music in a fancy restaurant if you'd like.  Can take a CompactFlash card to transfer data.  Many other fun features.        Cons:  OMG is it HUGE!!!  I honestly wasn't expecting it to be THAT big.  I thought "hm... maybe a little bit bigger than the Zen Vision M...?"  This thing is almost the exact same size as my Nintendo DS!  I just can't get over how HUGE it is.  It's a bit of a turn off for those who might want to use it to exercise and walk around with.  Think super old school Walkman but significantly heavier! When the delivery guy dropped it off, I was shocked that the box was so HUGE!!  I thought they had sent me the wrong item!  And then I opened it...!!!  I was almost repulsed by how prehistoric it looked!  More cons...  The thing LAGS.  It definitely doesn't operate nearly as fast as the iPod when switching menus.  I guess that's because of all the things it offers.  It does get to be a little bit tedious and frustrating.    Even more cons...  Lack of accessories.  I guess I probably won't need a toughskin or protector for this thing, because if I drop it, it'll damage whatever it lands on, purely by its size.    Overall, as far as the functions of this player are concerned, I'm happy with it.  However, I'm still trying to get over the ridiculous size of the thing.  Do I dare bring it out in public?  What would my friends say?  Would people stare?!  I highly suspect that they will laugh.      Oh well...  I guess I was really only going to use it to play music in the car.  I must remember to hide it in the glove box before I let any passengers in the car.

<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player does all that it says.  But everyone's worst nightmare is getting a bad one out of the box, which happened to me.  I called Creative support and the helped me confirm the hard drive was defective.  Then I told Amazon and in 5 minutes had a prepaid return label and a new player within the week.  That is great in anyone's book.  Still getting used to the player, but it works great!

<Title>great for the plane
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this 1 year now. It's great for air trips. I watch a movie, then put on songs. I have about 10 movies, 80 pictures and 400 songs loaded. The batery lasts about 4 hours for video or 2 hours of video and 5 hours of music. I use DVDshrink (freeware) and CloneDVDmobile to copy movies to the viewer. It does occasionally lock up but if you remove the batery and reconnect it the veiwer always restarts. The fast forward and rewind are difficult, you don't see where you are while rewinding. Because the viewer has regular TV resolution the picture when plugged into a regular TV is amazing. This is a great way to carry several hours of movies and music and a great way to watch and listen to them.
