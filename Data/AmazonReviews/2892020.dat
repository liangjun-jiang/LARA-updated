<Content>So I needed to purchase a flash drive because several computers on my campus no longer had the 3.5 disks.  During my search, I came across this little player and I was surprised by it because of the quality and the low cost of it.  With the player I was able to store a lot of my Powerpoint presentations and schoolwork on it. I did not have to worry about space nor the chance of the computer not having a disk drive.   And now to the main feature of the player: the MP3s.  The player handles MP3s wonderfully.  It has good sound quality plus I can store my music in different folders to sort everything out.  What I also liked was that I could record from the FM radio. When I had to go to my morning classes and I was listening to something hilarious on the morning radio, I could just record from the radio and listen to it later.  To me, it is way better than a flash drive because the ability to play MP3s and the other features and the price when compared to other similar products.  
<Overall>5
