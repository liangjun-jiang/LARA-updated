<Title>Small and Light - But Non-Standard USB Connector
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the fact that this unit is so lightweight. I am glad that it comes with an easily programmed FM tuner so that I can listen to local content as well as my MP3s. I also am pleased with the Lanyard that comes with the MP6610FM. It has the earbud headphones built in so you don't have to worry about another cable dangling.  I use this when biking and once it's on, I don't even notice that something is around my neck. For this, it has been perfect.  My one complaint is that the unit uses a proprietary connector for the USB. I was expecting a simple USB-B connector (of which I have a number of cables). However, this one is different. I fear that if I lose it, I will not only be unable to put different music on the unit, but the device will no longer be usable because the MP6610FM recharges its battery through this USB port.

<Title>Audivox MP6610FM 1GB - solid performer
<Date>Wed Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the money and for it's size, this is a good value. I use it primarily hooked up to my car radio and I can listen either to music or to the spoken word. I was impressed with the sound quality, too.

<Content>I am very pleased, compatible with windows vista, (was worried) and as far as battery usage, I walk on my treadmill for 40 mins and I usually don't have a bar missing from the battery for atleast 3 uses, not to mention the battery has 3 bars.  Very lightweight and user friendly.  Will buy another for my boyfriend.

<Title>Very good MP3 player, easy to use and superb value.
<Date>Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this for a couple of weeks now, and it has been great.  Very easy to use, just plug it in and drag and drop music files into it. Deleting songs off of it is just as easy.  Did not need to install anything.  Very bright display, and easy to use menu system.  Pretty sturdy too. The very first day I had it I dropped it onto the pavement while walking to the bus. I picked it up, and it was still playing just fine, not even a scratch on it.  The only Con that comes to mind is that it takes a while to charge. And while it's charging you cannot listen to music. But I knew that before buying it, and for me thats not a big deal. So 5 stars.

<Title>so far so good.
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Certainly worth the money. Nifty little radio and intuitive menu layout. The battery could last a little longer though. It doesn't seem to be replaceable either (you charge it with a USB cable). I wish it came with a clip so you could put it on your sleve or something. The headphones are the same funky stupid ones that come with all cheaper MP3 players and they're just short enough that you can't put the player in your pocket while standing. What, do I just hold the thing while I jog?   But yeah, good deal, especially if you already have some decent headphones.

<Title>Great simple, starter player
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this a few months ago for my 11 year old son for his birthday. He loves it! I like it so much, I am thinking about going back and buying one for my self.  The sound is good, it is very easy to use.  Also, since it was purchased for a kid, if it gets stolen or lost it isn't as big an investment as an Ipod. The only down side is that you have to charge it using the computer, which isn't a huge deal since we have the computer on a lot, but if we were traveling or something that would be a disadvantage.  Other than that, it is great!

<Title>FIRST MP3
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The screen is very nice and easy to view, even in bright sunlight. I was able to load songs with no trouble, and sound quality is pretty good. Only negative is that you must use a USB hookup to charge it.

<Title>Awesome Sound
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I quite like this product. I use it during my walks every day and cleaning the house. I love the head phones - they don't hurt because the weight is on the back of my neck rather than in my ears. My only issue is the battery doesn't last long enough but the sound is awesome. Nice job Audiovox with at great price.

<Title>BEWARE DON'T BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER.
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know if laughing or crying. I received this item, unwrapped it, charged the battery, loaded some songs and tried it. It was like 6 pm. That night I tried it and it worked. Next day I took it to the gym and used it for 40 minutes. I didn't hit it on anything or something like that. Then, suddenly, the image on the screen mirrored. It mirrored! all the words and graphics were flipped and looked as if you were looking at them from behind.  One minute later all the image blurred. I couldn't read anything in the screen, but it still played music. I noticed it had a reset button on the back, I pressed it. It went back to normal... for a minute! Then the image blurred again and PUFF! it turned off. I got home, tried to charge the battery again, the image on the little screen was in a blur again. I disconnected it from the power: the screen didn't have any image and it didn't played any music. End of story, it worked in my hands for less than 24 hours!!! And the radio? well, I didn't have time to try it! This is definitely the worst item I have ever bought on amazon. Simply, don't buy it !!!!!!

<Title>JUNK, JUNK , JUNK
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is junk. It advertises all these features and it probably has them, if you can find one that will work more than twice. I bought one and it worked twice and wouldn't come back on. I called the seller they gave me a RMA number and I returned it. I thought that maybe I just got a bad player so I asked for an exchange, which I got with no problem. I did have to pay six dollars shipping for the return though. A couple of weeks later got a new player. It worked a whopping two times before it quit. I knew it would be six more dollars shipping so I threw it in the trash...which is where every one of these players by Audiovox belongs as far as I am concerned. The only reason I gave it one star is because I don't think I can give it a zero. Know this product is a zero in my opinion. It is just terrible.

<Content>I really enjoy this mp3 player and the radio. The only thing that is not very convenient is that the battery dies fast, so i have to charge it every day. It sounds great. The shipping and delivery was fast.

<Content>Ok, I'm going to start off with the GOOD things first...excellent amount of space for the price...radio on it...etc. Bad things...it stops working like 4 months into using it. Yeah, so this is my SECOND mp3 player this year...I'm actually thinking about getting a good ole' fashion disk player to save myself the money.   Simply put, you get what you pay for.

<Title>BUYER BEWARE    
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this item for daughters birthday.  Quit working in less then 40 days.  Sent back to audiovox for repair or replacement under 90 day warantee.  Recieved confirmation they recieved it.  2 1/2 months and nothing.  Do not recommend buying due to unreliability of product and company.    approx.1 month later now and several calls to the company.  No results in getting it back.  Company making all sorts of excuses to why they haven't done anything with it (lost it. Send it to the wrong place for repair. Busy time so be patient[if they are that busy reparing their products then that tells me they sell a lot of junk].  Etc.)  Will never buy anything from Audiovox again.  I take back the 2 stars I gave it and rate it and the company at 0 stars  Now January 14, 2008.  Audiovox won't answer their phone anymore.  All I have got for 2 months is a busy signal on their 800 number. Still don't have it back and don't except to.  Now I have a feeling I know where the used ones come from they sell.  If you read this review "buyer beware".  Even seller can't get them to give an answer to why.

<Content>make sure to plug the usb in then plug it to the mp3 player and the downloads and charging will be fine.  the player has a very nice display, easy to read. the volume buttons on the back are nice and it shows on the display with a graphic as you raise or lower the volume. sound quality is good.  this is definitely worth the money. would buy again.
