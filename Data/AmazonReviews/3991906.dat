<Title>The best in class
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is without a doubt the best portable media player.  I have had others without the clamshell design where the screens got scratched.  And with kids doing most of the watching and handling this will happen about 100% of the time.  With the Tavi the picture and the sound quality are fantastic.  The kids have sat spellbound for a 3 hr car trip watching a movie in the backseats.  The downloading of the movies into the Tavi is straightforward and easy with the preloaded software.  The Tavi is the best in class.

<Title>Nice but too much work
<Date>Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Biggest disappointment was that it did not organize the music downloaded to Tavi.  It was insane to have to scroll through 500 songs to find what I wanted because most did not show the artist and I had to scroll through the title list.  In addition, half the songs wouldn't play.  To make any changes to the files on Tavi, I found it quicker to go through my computer.  Few other disappoinments: speakers were not as loud as I had hoped, Tavi software would not update, battery did not last as long as claimed. I did like the radio, slide show feature was neat. Pictures came out beautiful on it.

<Content>Beautiful device.  Hardware is the best of its kind; I dare you to name a portable device that outputs component video + optical sound. Great screen and sound.  Software gets updated very frequently. This shows the deligence of the customer support team. It's all free too so it only gets better every day.  If you are a tech person who really understands the technology behind this, you'll love it.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound from the music is very nice, however my $90 RCA Lyra also has great sound for music.  According to the instructions, video is drag and drop. None of the video formats I have, from converted movies to AVI to simple avi movies taken with a family camera work. No wmv, no video is recognized by the device.  The myTAVI desktop is confusing, I have no idea what it is trying to do, but whatever it is, nothing is going from or to my TAVI from the myTAVI desktop. I have uninstalled it because it makes no sense.  If you are looking for a company that supports it's devices, forget it. The have a cryptic FAQ that does not handle the questions, a discussion thread that is no help and they have not responded to three days worth of email.  I am very impressed by the potential for this device, but very disappointed in the reality.  Save your money until they get it right, or go out of business.

<Title>One of the best PMPs on the market
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I already own 4 different PMPs.  This one is my favorite.  It's compact size makes it convienient to carry around.  The picture quality is excellent.  The speaker is loud enough to use all the time even with the radio.  I've used the text reader to read .txt files with no problem.  The only problem I've had is with the charger ... it burns hot & part of the case melted, so it no longer  works .... the support staff leaves alot to be desired.  The good news is  that this can be recharged through the USB port which is a far more attractive alternative for me.  The only improvement I'd make is to have a larger drive.

<Title>Tavi...Hope it doesn't quit working.
<Date>Sat Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Tavi for my son last Christmas.  He enjoyed using it for a few months then all of a sudden all we have is a white screen. We tried to get help on line..no luck.  Called the company support service...no returned call.Unable to talk to a person must leave a phone number for call back.  Decided to take it to the long beach company store.  Nice building but the door was locked.  A lady who worked in the buiding said they hadn't seen anyone there for a year.  Now here is a company that doesnt seem to exist.  I would like to send it back to get it fixed but it's like" Wheres Waldo".  Do I send it to the Long Beach address and hope someone shows up within the year.?  Very Strange.  The Tavi is an expensive mistake.  I should have bought an ipod.
