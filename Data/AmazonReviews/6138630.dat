<Title>Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best.

<Title>Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player:  - Incredibly small, thin, and very light. - Well designed, fit on your palm, pocket, or pencil case. - High resolution colour screen, shows albumart, photos, and games in colors. - Superb sound. - Click wheel; easy navigation as the original iPod. - New features:   > World Clock   > Stopwatch   > Screen Lock - now with iTunes 5, it's easy to sync AddressBook, Calendar, etc between Ms Outlook and iPod nano. - with flash memory, the nano is 100% skip free; a true sport companion. - headphone jack at the bottom, making it easier to read the screen (without rotating it first) when we take the nano out from our jeans pocket.  Although it comes with lots of advantages, yet:  - 4 GB is the maximum capacity possible. - USB connection only. - No charger adapter, you should use the USB connection to recharge the battery. It means the computer or laptop should be around you. Make sure you bring your laptop on your vacation. - Only two colors available, black or white. No more pink, blue, green, etc.  Accessories that you may like: - The lanyard. With this earphone, you can wear your iPod nano as necklace. No more tangle and you can change the music right away without reaching your pocket. - The silicon case. This silicon case comes in colors and will change the look of your iPod nano. It will also protect your iPod from scratches and prevents it from sliding on a tilted table or slipped out of your pocket when you're sitting.   Overall this is a really great product! Before deciding to buy this MP3 player, make sure you have USB 2.0 on you computer or laptop. Some people had bought this nano and having USB 1 connection on their PC, making the song transfer a painful and time consuming process. It will takes hours to fill up your iPod nano with USB 1. Therefore, the existance of USB 2.0 on your PC is crucial. Also, if you are frequent traveller, it is a good idea to buy another accessory for recharging the battery og your iPod without connecting it to PC. Otherwise, you will have to bring your laptop with you or look for PCs on your vacation to recharge your nano.

<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>Awesome device!
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing rocks! I received it as a present and really love it. This is my first iPod of any kind, so here goes.  The Good: 1) Size & Design - Need I say more? It is very small and looks stunning. Apple have done it again!  2) Easy-to-use Software - You use iTunes to organize your files and import them to the player. It can also be automatically synchronized to add or delete files to your player as needed. 3) Good Sound Quality - The quality from the earphones is wonderful. Bass, mids, treble: all there!  The Bad: 1) Picture Import - Pictures can only be imported by folder, so if you want to put just ONE picture into the device, you have to create a separate folder for it and then import that. 2) Scratches - Nanos, especially the black ones, get scratched VERY easily. Note this before you put it to use and perhaps purchase the necessary bag/film/other protector to keep it looking new. 3) Battery Replacements - I'm actually not sure about this, but this thing looks like it's solidly closed. Will there be a way to change the internal battery when it expires? I don't know.  This is a super player! You will love it! Buy it! :)

<Title>I'm glad I slept on the iPod mini
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After being an ipod owner for the last two years, I was in the market for a second iPod. I slept on the iPod mini and I'm glad because now there's the iPod mini. I love it. I was worried that it'd be a total drag to set up but it was perfectly compatible with all my previous iTunes stuff. I didn't have to even load the included CD all I did was downlaod the latest verisons of the iPod updater and I made sure that I had the latest upgrade of iTunes.  The nano works with all my previous cables for my 3rd generation iPod. So after I removed it from the package I plugged it in my previous iPod's AC adapter. The one draw back is the nano does not include an AC adapter but you can still charge it with the usb cable. I was able to get a full charge in about an hour with the AC adapter. With that said, I highly reccomend this amazing mp3 player. It exceeded my expectations. The ease of use, the design, everything is wonderful. Now you may think...why spend money on an mp3 player that only holds 500 songs? Well, how many people do you know that have time to listen to 5000 songs everyday? I can manage my playlists. I control what's being fed into my iPod and I like that. This is a great 2nd iPod for current iPod owners and a treat to first time buyers.

<Title>A good product, as old as it is.
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's probably been about 2 years since a review was writting for this iPod, but hey; I'm bored, and it's 3:35 AM. Anyway, I originally bought this thing a couple of years ago. It's still functioning properly and I've never had that many problems with it, and you can't imagine how many times this thing's been beaten around! The battery life has been pretty exceptional, though I can tell it has been getting a lot worse for the couple of years I've had it. I really thought I would have to replace the battery, but that was unnecessery.   To this day, I have been using this iPod with no problems (other than some click wheel problems, but that was easily fixed), and if you don't want to spend so much on the newer ones, this one's for you. I honestly can't compare this Nano with the other two generations, but all I know is that this one is durable, reliable, and easy to use. I may be getting the latest generation of the Nano by tomorrow (Dec. 17, 2007. The new nano with video capabilites) and I'll see if I can do a quick comparison between the two when I get it. I'll post the comparison on the Nano: Black product.

<Title>Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges is very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This 2-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 500 songs. For $50 more, you can buy the 4-gigabyte, which olds approximately 1000 songs. If you think the higher capacity could be useful to you, the $50, for an extra 2-gigabytes is a good value. However, if you're on a budget, or are not so concerned with capacity, this 2-gigabyte model will get the job done. 500 songs is a lot of music, so you will rarely find yourself in a situation, where you need more than that.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Color - White is the traditional iPod color.  This white iPod Nano will match your iMac, iBook, or other Apple products.  Furthermore, the white is less likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  It is a good idea to protect your iPod Nano, if you're concerned about its appearance.  The chrome finish, on the back, is particularly prone to scratches.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies.  I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>You've gotta hold it to believe it
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 90% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. So for the storage reason alone, I can't chuck my 20GB model just yet. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.   ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $100, you can upgrade to a Photo that has ten times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is-it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.   Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their demure size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 2-4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>best balance of usability and portability among all iPods
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my 4gb black iPod nano yesterday.  I got one because my 4G 20gb iPod was having intermittent dropouts when used with a tape-deck adapter or certain pairs of non-Apple earphones.  A few websites surmise that it's a problem with gold-plated jacks.  I'm happy to report that no such dropouts occur with the nano, even after purposely twisting and wiggling the jack.    My first day with the iPod nano has been an awesome experience.  When not in use, I walked around the whole day with it in my pocket and forgot it was there most of the time.  The screen is very bright and easy to read.  The click wheel is more sensitive than the one on my 4G iPod, but I got used to it.  Amazingly, it continued to work even when a thick clear plastic film separated the wheel from my finger.  I guess I should qualify that I'm really not sure whether the wheel is more sensitve or the GUI is just more responsive.  Synching on iPod nano over USB 2.0 seems just as fast as my 4G over Firewire 400.  For those worried about the durability of the tiny nano, please read the Ars Technica review.  They threw one out of a moving car then ran over it with the car, and it still played.

<Title>What else would you expect from Apple?
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Forgive me for coming off like an Apple fanboy, but to be honest after buying my first iBook there was no way I could go back to the PC world and the same can be said for the iPod.   As an owner of a 15GB, 512MB Shuffle, and previous mini owner I can honestly say that I like iPods, and when the nano was introduced it was hard for me not to get one. After taking it home and opening up the box (always a little more fun with Apple's more dressed up packaging) I couldn't believe my eyes. This black 2GB nano was TINY. I was a little skeptical about the size at first because it might be too small, but even as a 5'9" person with normal sized hands it was still easy to use.  The color screen is just an added bonus. I never saw the point of having a color screen for a music player but after using this  it's hard to go back to the black and white. Although the screen is small, the photos and album art look nice and vibrant thanks to the surprisingly high resolution screen.  One major reason the iPod has sold so well is because of its seamless integration with iTunes and there is no surprise here. Just plug it into the USB 2 and it's pretty much set up.  So to sum things up here's what I thought about the nano:  Positives - Looks fabulous, especially the black - Has the 30 pin dock connector like the full size iPods, meaning that it is compatible with practically all the accesories out there, which is a lot -Click wheel, although smaller, is still easy to use - The sound on iPods are underrated compared to other music players, and the nano sounds just fine especially with the right set of headphones  Negatives (although only a couple, to me they are HUGE) - Battery life, although considered average at 14 hours, could've been a LOT better considering it's a flash player. But then again not all flash players have a color screen - Apple should've known by now, but the material they use for the face of the iPod is just too fragile. Yes it makes it sleek and what-not but this thing just scuffs up too easily and considering how I payed a lot of money (especially that i'm a college student) I don't want this thing to be scratched from light use. - This is in conjunction with the previous gripe, but it's nice to see that Apple is making their own case (nano tubes), but they should've had these available the same day as the nano, because right now there are a lot of users that are already disappointed with the durability of the face of the nano.

<Content>The minute I saw it, I had to have it.  Once it arrived, I was not disappointed, far from it: it is smaller and more elegant in reality than it appears in photos.  And it sounds good, and the screen is very, very sharp.  Finally, it works with standard iPod accessories, like my Griffin Technologies Tune Juice.  If you travel extensively, the larger hard drive based iPod is probably better, but if you stay close to home, and can rotate the music on your iPod Nano, this is the ideal option.  The flash memory based Nano is quieter, and has better battery life.

<Content>I've received 2GB iPod nano today.  I tried to upload 290 songs to my iPod nano using iTunes 5 in Windows environment. It took more than twenty five minutes to sync all songs. I don't know why. I used latest notebook from Samsung (same as Dell's ODM model). Also browsing speed is some kind of bulky. I'd like to use Firewire to transfer songs, but iPod nano doesn't support Firewire data transfer. I've read other reviews that transfer speed is far more better than mine. What's wrong with my iPod nano? :-(

<Title>Everything awesome except for cheap scratchable plastic face
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sure, it looks and works wonderful. But putting this thing into a pocket scratches the finish. The plastic is softer than a CD. They (APPLE) want you to buy colorful cases (thirtybucks) to protect it. why would I put a pink plastic case over a nice shiny black ipod nano? Well the thing does scratch easily but I refuse to that much for a set of ugly cases. So just expect scratches with even cotton pockets on your levis. Now for the good part. The thing is really small and so high tech that it could have come off the starship enterprise. The thing works great and the music sounds great. The screen is brighter than the regular ipod photo (I have the 30gig model). So other than the cheap plastic front, the rest of it is really awesome.
