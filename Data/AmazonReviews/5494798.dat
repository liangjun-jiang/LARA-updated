<Title>This is NOT what is pictured

<Content>The item pictured is the 6000 series and this item model reads "MOH 500e" - There is a HUGE difference between the 2 models.   VERY DECEIVING Amazon.

<Title>Works well

<Content>I have two of the OHP6000 units in production and they have been working reliably and running without interruption for over two years.  I am about to buy another for a third MOH source.  My only criticism is that I wish they were stackable.   The music it comes with is very appropriate for professional business use, which means nothing edgy or "out there".  You can reprogram or expand the program by inserting an SD flash chip.
