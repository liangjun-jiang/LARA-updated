<Content>This is an ok product, especially for the low price. However, it is very complicated to the find files, menus, etc. that you are looking for. Basically you either have to spend 30 minutes trying to navigate your way through the complicated menus, or scroll through lists of hundreds of songs to find what you want. I would most likely spend an extra few dollars to get a better player.   
<Overall>3
