<Title>Dont See What The Problem Is
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think people are just too hard on the reviews.    If you ask me, I think this is a GREAT deal. It's small, light weight, has a lcd screen, scrolling capabilities, and the sound is GREAT.   People are just stupid when it comes to writing crap. I got mine from wal-mart.  I think it's a GREAT deal.  Now, i'm sure there is much better ones out there.. but for the price this will do me just fine.    I haven't had a problem with it, and the transferring speeds DO NOT take a minute.  I loaded 300 songs in less than 10 minutes.  how fast do you want it? honestly?  The storage capacity is great too, i think they are stretching the 1000 songs u can put on, but even still you can put over 700 on it easily. and you dont need more. If you are looking for that, then u may as well get a ipod as they are made for storage.  It tells you ON THE BOX to use windows media player to sync your songs.. that is what i used and i didn't have a single problem minus one or two songs couldn't convert. but i EASILY fixed that by downloading it again.    The battery life lasts for about 5-6 hours, depending on what your features you have turned on.  for example... if you have the LCD screen on all the time then obviously it is going to drain the battery faster. they say it could last 10 hours, i dont see that, but maybe, if you have the sound turned low, no lcd.. then.... maaaaybe...  Features on this are good, has a bass boost, 5 equalizer presets, the LCD screen is a great feature. And it has a mic built in which works great, if you need to record something than this would work great for it. the mic will pick up even the quiet sounds.  sometimes a bit too much. There is a couple other features that you can look into by reading.  All in all, the product i think is great, i almost wnat to give it a 5 out of 5, but again, im sure there is better ones out there.. but just not at this price.

<Title>i think it's a great deal
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought it as a factory-refurbished one for only 85 dollars. Overall this mp3 player is great, especially its sound quality.  The sound quality is amazing comparing to my friend's mp3 player.  Also exterior design is nice.  The speed of uploading songs from your computer to the player is average, and it depends how fast and healthy your computer is.  If your computer has too many spywares, surely the tranfer will take a long time.  The earphone comes with the mp3 player is very unique, and the sound quality of the player is only good with the standard earphone.

<Title>Don't Let People Fool You
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this model of MP3 player for just over 6 months.  I found it easy to use and the manual is very clear on what to do if it ever freezes up.  Mine did freeze up, but only once and when I followed the simple instructions, it 'unfroze' and I was able to turn the unit off instead of having to wait for the battery to die.     Personally, I think the sound quality issue has more to do with what headphones or earbuds you used.  I am a music major and I need to have excellent sound reproduction when I am listening to my classical music.  To use a splitter so my friend could hear, I bought some different earbuds, but the sound was extremely muffled and quiet.  Once I put the Philips earbuds in, I was amazed at the sound, even when another set of earbuds was plugged in.  I don't have to use more than 1/3 of the volume capabilities to listen to music on a bus full of noisy music students.   MusicMatch is a program that you get when you buy this product to transfer your music from CD's to the GoGear.  It too is easy to use and transfering does not take that long.    Overall it has many great features, such as the equalizer settings, FM tuner, and sleep modes, a fair amount of storage, and a decent battery life if used properly. I would recommend this product to anyone asking for a decent and easy to use MP3 player that is not overpriced or overhyped.

<Title>A really poor effort
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Although this mp3 is o.k, it has several major flaws, such as it's constant freezing and not playing certain tracks.I bought this with my Chrimstmas money i got from relatives ect, but, within the first month, it broke and had to be repaired for 6 months!I no they do this from time to time, but that is just ridiculus!The download software is O.k to put on your computer, but recently when i ahev used to software, it has frozen up and will not put any tracks on for me!Also, it never deletes my music library when i ask it too. It just stays there.Overall, not a very good effort from the people i would of expected to do quite well in this feild.The reason why i have given this a four star beacuase  it did eventualy unfreeze, but still a poor effort.

<Title>Piece of junk
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this mp3 player about a year ago and I've been somewhat satisfied with its performance, even though it as a very bad designed interface to load songs to the player, it is incredibly slow (USB 1.1) and I had to reinstall the firmware at least two times becuse of data corruption. I can live with that. The problem came last week when I got a flickering of death. The screen just flickers all the time. The player doesn't respond to any command, it is not recognized by the computer, no way to reinstall firmware... nothing. It just died, and of course is out of warranty. I called Philips support (horrible by the way) and they said that they would repair the player only if it was under warranty. I explained to the guy that it was out of warranty but I was willing to pay for the repair. He said... "no, we only repair electronics that are under warranty. Take the player to an electronic repair shop, they might be able to help". Well, there are no electronic repair shops in this area with the knowledge to repair this thing, so basically I am stuck with a $150 (what I paid originally) paperweight. Thank you Philips!. I won't buy from you again!!.

<Title>JUNK!!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the second mp3 player that I've had from philips.  The first one never worked and this one died after 5 months of use.  When you get the "flickering of death" nothing in the manual works.  My last philips product EVER!!!!

<Title>Lasted a year and a half
<Date>Mon Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I saved my money up for this Philips mp3 player.  When I got it I loved it.  I got it in June 2005, it just recently stopped working in January 2007.  It only worked for a year and a half.  I was very disappointed with this mp3.  I will never get this very mp3 again.
