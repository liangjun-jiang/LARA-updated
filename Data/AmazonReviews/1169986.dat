<Content>This is much smaller than I had expected for all the features it has and fits in the pocket like a zippo. The white ear buds are much higher quality than the ones supplied with the MP3 only players. The FM radio seems to be more sensitive to weaker stations tan on previous MP3 only models. The menu is easier to navigate with the joystick style button than the pushbuttons on the MP3 players. The music and video and data files can be imported into a maximum of 99 file folders through the mini-USB cable with drag and drop. The utilities on the mini-CD easily converts video files to a compatible .MTV format which seems to double the file size from .MPG (260Mb  1 hour tv show becomes over 550Mb). The file then plays with vivid color on the tiny screen.  For the same price as a low grade MP3 player with less memory, this gadget packs a lot of fun and utility in a small package. It comes in an attractive gift box and ships very quickly.  The manual is not so brilliant, but this player is easy to use.
