<Title>Great deal
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>A Zune is worth a thousand pictures!

<Content>This is a great item, bought my wife the ipod she wanted, and I got this same time. Both are great, do not let anybody tell you otherwise<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>. If you can get this for less money, than why get the ipod? (plus the screen is great, a definate plus over the ipod)I had considered the itouch since I was looking for best bang for the buck with the best screen. I am so glad I did not get the itouch! A friend has the itouch, and it is great until you realize that you are constantly looking at it through you finger prints (that sucks).I will update if necessary.
