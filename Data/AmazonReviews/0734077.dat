<Content>so when i bough this ipod nano. i called in to mack sure it is what im getting like there was a case pichtured in it and im like wow this is a great deal for the price the rep said that it would be coming with a case so i bought it and when it came i opened it and it had marks on the sceen and everything. it did not come with the case that was saposed to come with it i call them and i said whats the deal with the case and they were like it does not come with the case and i said why is it pichtured then there like to sell more so im like so ur cheating people to buy it thinkgin its going to come with a case. so i told them i want a case since it was in the photos. so they eneded up sending me a i pod case that doesnot even fit my ipod nano. they said they had shiped it and when i got it it was shiped a week later so they are just scammers trying to get your money so make sure you call them and make sure everything pichtured comes with it!

<Title>iPod Nano, first generation
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a shuffle and got an Nano for my children.  This product was refurbished and an older generation but this is what I wanted as my children are younger.  I didn't want to spend too much money on something that would likely be dropped dozens of times or even lost.  Love the iPod, easy to use, easy to sync.  Wish I had gotten one capable of playing videos but won't send it back because of that.  Product was shipped on time and arrived in stated condition.  No complaints.

<Title>I-pod is good
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Whats good about the I-pod nano is that its so small. You can fit it in your pocket with a slide. (unlike the big one witch you need a case for) I have been doing some research and i have found the i-pod nano is the best 1gb (2gb or 4gb) mp3 player. The mini has no color,the others are very expensive and arn't that portable as the nano. This is a great MP3 player to carry around. I recomend you buy it.

<Title>I love my nano!!!!!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for a birthday gift and it may be the best gift that I have even received.  It is incredibly easy to use and the sound is AMAZING!!! iTunes has been pretty simple to set up and purchasing songs is a little too easy...its hard to not get too carried away.  I am so excited that I found singles that I couldn't find on Napster.  The only sad thing is that I have a lot of purchased Napster tracks that I couldn't automatically transfer into iTunes.  I will try to burn them onto CDs and then import them into iTunes.  I definitely recommend the Nano for any music lover.

<Content>The iPod with just one GB so what about the size, what I have read on the reviews seems that the nano is awesome and I got one the other day on apple and I got an engraving and I put (I have a rich uncle who loves me) so I think instead of shopping HERE for a iPod nano go to apple to get an engraving!

<Title>Simply AWESOME...Super CHEVERE... Wow!
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got my mine in the mail from Amazon.com, plugged it in for a battery charge, loaded all of my favorite songs at the same time. And now, I am listening to each one of them. The quality of the sound is very clear and loud if you wish it that way. It's got a shuffle functionality which works perfectly if you go to the gym and don't want to listen to only one album. The little device is so light too. I mean. 5 stars is well deserved for it. Lastly, the 14 hours of battery is true. :) Enjoy!

<Title>senior nano ipod
<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As a senior citizen I may be the oldest person to have purchased this Ipod. I love it for walking and listen to workout and dance music as I walk. It's easy to download the music from my Imac. And its so easy to use. All I can say is "cool"

<Title>good mp3 player
<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>overall i found the 1gb ipod nano pretty good for everyday use. i can plug it into the car, or listen to it while at the gym. sound quality is above average. it has some simple games included too. since the i pods are popular by far, theres so many accesories available and to choose from. the downside is that the nano scratches so easily, so i had to cover it with a film and rubber casing. playing the games likes to drain the batteries because of the constantly lit screen. the other thing down the road is wondering how long the internal battery will last. i've heard apple customer service is very good from friends, so that's a plus. when i compared it to other players of this memory capacity and features, i found that the nano overall dominates, other than its nonreplaceable battery.

<Title>good and bad
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(to save some time read this) Pros - small, portable. - clear screen. - stylish. - automatic sync. using Itune. - include other programs(games,photo/slideshow,notepad.etc) - lock  Cons - deliget - too expensive( so as other accessories). - only Itune compatible. - only 1 GB ( comparing to 2,4,30,& 60 GB) - fingerprints are visible after using it. - unable to delete music from nano whitout using a computer. - a few bugs need to be fixed (the screen gets stuck sometimes).  (to get more info read this) i like ipod nanos, its easy 2 use, it looks cool, just like a mini version of a pocket pc.but the bad thing about it, is that it cost wayyy to much comparing to other mp3 makers. the only way to copy music to nano is using itune( and a couple of other 3rd party programs). itune rename the file name to 4 letter which makes everything more comfusing.i recommend getting a 2 or 4 GB nano because 1 GB is not big enough(around 240 songs).i also recommend getting something that protects the nano, fingerprints get on very easly. overall, i  think this is a good product.

<Title>Wading through the hype
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Nano is a good product, and a good value depending on what you're looking for in a music player.   First, the bad. Yes, it scratches and smudges easily. Even moderate handling is likely to leave your beautiful gadget hopelessly marred. That's a fact. I bought a case right away and still have some minor scratches on the surface. If you buy a Nano, buy a case (gel or otherwise) on the same trip--it will save you some trouble down the road. Second, the software needs a little tweaking. While most of the time, it works fine, I did experience a glitch here and there that mysteriously returns me to the main menu. It's not damning, but it can be annoying. Hopefully, Apple will fix this soon. Third, if you're dikkering, as I was between a Shuffle and a Nano, know that the Nano is a bit more delicate. I bought this for working out, and I do worry that I'll have to cash in my Applecare warranty more with this than I ever did with my shuffle. It has a screen, it's smaller, and it's more delicate.  Now, the good. First, it's gorgeous--flat out, a beautiful design. You will marvel at the screen and the impossible thinness. I also own a mini, and as lovely as that is, this is even prettier. Second, again, if you're dikkering between a Shuffle and a Nano, the battery life is quite good. I got about 11 hours on a single charge, and considering the bright color screen, this is great. Additionally, it holds a charge well between uses. Very little power seems to eke out. Third, you can use playlists. If you're like me, and have different playlists for different moods, the Nano is superior to the Shuffle in this respect. Finally, the screen. It's quite nice. I expected to not use it much, but find myself glancing at it constantly for the time of day and song titles (album art is a bonus).   So here's my recommendation: if you don't need your whole collection with you or are considering a shuffle, the Nano is also a great choice. Yes, the screen and front can get marred, but if you invest in a case, you'll be fine. The sound quality is great (better than my Mini) and the form factor is good for workouts or car trips. You really can't go wrong unless you need a higher-capacity player. Great product, overall.

<Title>The actual thing is great
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new iPod is, without a doubt, a perfect Mp3 Player; especially the feature of scrolling the lists up and down with simply moving the tip of your finger around the wheel. But there is one thing, not about this actual iPod, but about the reviews that Amazon and other sources give to such things. It's when they say, like, "Memory holds UP TO (example) 240 SONGS". IS "SONG" A NEW UNIT OF MEASURING THE SPACE? I'm used to using bytes, kilobytes, etc. It is not only technically incorrect to estimate the number of songs that the memory can hold (a single song can be 2, 4, 7, 10, (...) megabytes big, depending on its length and format), but it also pisses me off whenever I hear or read something like that.
