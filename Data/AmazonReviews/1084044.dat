<Content>So the other day I decided to breakdown and purchase an MP3 player.  My first choice was to look at the ipods and see what they had to offer.  I liked the ipod shuffle because of its size, but it was lacking.  What is great about the Sansa m240 is that it has the same memory, BUT it has a display, FM tuner, and a voice recorder.  These were not the main features that caught my attention though.  The nice thing about the Sansa m240 is that it takes a AAA battery that lasts about 17-18 hours, and doesn't need the fruity itunes format.  I have a ton of MP3's on my PC and I don't want to spend my time converting them in any way.  All one needs to do is plug in the usb port and drag the tracks you want.  Simple as that.  It's a small player and is lightweight.  I'm glad they were sold out of the 1gb ipod shuffles because I'm not a big fan of Apple products.  Apple is like the metric system in the computer world, it's simple to convert but everyone else is standard.

<Content>I got tired of using my son's old mp3 player and I broke down and bought my own.  I love it, it holds plenty of songs, its easy to use and it has an FM tuner on it.  I can take it to the gym and listen in to whatever they have on tv (using the FM tuner) or play my own playlist.  I love it.

<Content>I have had 3 Sandisk mp3 players, 2 of them were this model.  Ouch! Nothing but problems.  couldn't save my place in a book, and when turned on couldn't hear the sound until turned off and on again.  Don't get this, I messed up trying again on it.  Big mistake.  2 out of 3 bad, is too big a risk.

<Content>I've had the M240 for 2 years now and I have loved it since Day 1! Great sound, good battery life, and light as a feather. Sadly the cheap earbuds broke on the first day but I was going to replace them with a Sony headset anyway. I've never used the awkward playlist feature but otherwise it's been really great. Now I'm looking for a higher capacity model (e.g. SanDisk e260) for myself and one for my wife.
