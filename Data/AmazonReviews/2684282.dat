<Title>Had it over a year-still LOVE it!
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player because I wanted something tiny, without an internal battery to fail, and inexpensive in March 2005.  I still have it, and have used it about 20-40 hours per week, almost every week since I've had it, and it is still going strong.  I love it, the AAA battery lasts about 15-20 hours, and its easy to keep spares on hand-instead of having to worry about recharging the whole unit. I have a PC, and changing around files is a breeze. The rubber case it came with clips easily to waistband, belt, neckline, wherever you want it to go, and then you can forget about it-its not huge and bulky like certain other players (ahem, IPOD).   I highly recommend it. Over the last 15 months, it's been every where with me-art studio (had a near miss with paint, one day) working out, locked in the car in a hot texas summer, and dropped too many times to count, and it both works and looks as good as the day it arrived.

<Title>Creative Labs does not offer customer support
<Date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Purchased this MP3 player in April 2005.  Worked great for twelve months - then I had a problem - it was stuck in FM mode, and I could not turn it off (unless I pulled out the batteries each time).  Went to the Creative Labs web site for support - nothing there to help my situation - then I sent an email - and they told me that they WOULD NOT ASSIST ME, and then refered me back to the web site.  They also gave me a phone number to call - but that IT WOULD COST ME [...] EVERY 30 MINUTES OF "SUPPORT" THAT THEY PROVIDE!!!!   So now my MP3 player is no longer functional, and I need to buy a new one.  If you value customer service - STAY AWAY FROM CREATIVE LAB PRODUCTS

<Title>Great Mp3 Player
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had this Mp3 player for 1-2 years before I got my Ipod Nano. I never found anything wrong with it, and for the price I still think it is more worth the value than an ipod. I always reccomend the Creative over the ipod to friends on a limited budget. Here are a few pros and cons that I have noticed.  Pros:  1. This thing is TINY. Easily fits in your pocket, but just big enough to feel it (so you know its still there).  2. Very durable (Especially with the case).  3. Good Sound, never had a problem with scratchy noises or anything.  4. Voice recording is really cool, saves as a WAV file that you can upload on your computer.  5. FM/AM radio has very good reception.  6. The software that comes with it is awesome. Click and drag ripping similar to itunes, but better in that you can convert WAV and other audio formats into Mp3s (Very helpful).  7. Great battery life (better than my iPod's)   Cons: 1. Small screen (but this isn't really a problem considering how small the whole thing is).  2. No playlists, you have to scroll through every single song to find the one you want. I found this a little tedious, but it wasn't that bad because you can go through each song in like 1/2 a second (although that is a problem when you have a couple hundred songs).   Those are the only two cons that I can think of. Oh, and my headphones were magnetic for some reason, I don't know if anyone else's are like that, but thats kindof cool. Overall, I think the pros definetly outweigh the cons, and I would say for the great price, its one of the best out there.

<Title>Cheap, highly functional MP3 player.
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The FM receiver is extremely insensitive.  You practically have to climb the transmitter mast and skewer the thing on the antenna in order to get it to receive a decent signal.  Other than that, it's great.  Battery life is about 2 weeks or so playing MP3s at reasonable volume for 4 hours a day.  Sound quality is better than expected for something packaged in a tiny block of molded plastic.  You will probably want better headphones than the ones that come with it, but the included ones are good for working out with, since you really won't care if you get them sweaty.  Of course, it would be better with more storage.  It is extremely lightweight.  Having owned a number of personal stereo type devices over the years, this is the only one that I consistently use.  The reason is that the size and weight make it convenient to be wired for sound nearly anywhere at any time.  I can easily stick it in any pocket while wearing the earphones, and forget that it is there.  (Aside from the fact that it is playing music in my ears.)

<Title>I liked it until it died
<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really liked this MP3 player when I first got it, except for the color. It was darker in person that it showed on the computer. Besides that, the MP3 player worked great. It was my first one I had gotten and it was easy enough to use since I mostly used it for workouts and just let it play in order. The first problem I had early on was that it would get stuck after 1 certain song I had on it. At first I thought it was just the song because I would power it off then power on and it would work fine on the next song. I probably had it about a year to a year and a half before one day it just stopped working. At first I thought it was the battery because it kept powering off, but when I put new batteries in it, it wouldn't turn on.   It might have been that it could have been easily fixed, but I just would rather go buy a new one instead of dealing with the hassle of fixing it for the price it cost.

<Title>This is a nice small MP3 player for the price
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this as a gift for my daughter a couple years back and she still uses it to listen to music.  It navigates through the songs and playlists easily.  If you don't have a ton of music to store and you only need your favorites for walks, workouts, biking, etc, this is a great value for the money.

<Content>...the sound quality when recording voice through the built-in mike is quite mediocre.  I had hoped for recording quality like the iRiver units (which is excellent.)  I'm returning mine, as this was an important feature for me.

<Title>Just Amazing
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got the Muvo N200 for Christmas. I previously had a Samsung Yp-35, and was more than satisfied with it. However, this blows the Yepp out of the water. Here's a list of some of the pros and cons I have found with the player.  PROS 1. The volume range is great. I have never had to turn it all the way up, so you wont have a problem with it being too quiet like some other players. 2. The folder starage is great. Instead of scolling throught a couple hundred songs, I can just go through a dozen or so folders. 3. Great size. The thing is tiny 4. The button interface on it is very well laid out. I can use it in my pocket, without haveing to worry about hitting the wrong thing. 5. The recorder and microphone are great. I particularly liked that you could change the bit rate right on the player. (bit rate: higher bit rate= better quality, but larger file, and vice-versa.) 6. The line in ias a great feature. 7. Really easy to use. Just copy and paste your files. 8. Completely customizable equalizer. 9. Great options for the player's diplay. Reversible screen, contrast, etc.  CONS 1. Like some other people commented, there is a buzz in the background when the light is on. However, you only barely notice if the volume is at lower than 23 or so. (the volume goes up to 40) 2. The ear phones, while they do sound pretty good, are HUGE. They definetly are not the most comfortable things in the world, but they soung pretty good, and you can always replace them.  Overall, I think that this is definetly an awsome buy. Personally, I don't think i will ever regret it. However, I've only had it for one day, so I'll change my review if anything comes up in the future. But as of rightnow, it is great.

<Date>Thu Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've purchased this item, and I must say that this is one of the best mp3 players (of its genre) i've ever tried.  The controls are easy-to-use, the sound is great and, what a beautiful design!  It has nothing to envy to any Mac product because of the design. Also, the recorder is a good plus (35+ hours)  In one word, excellent

<Title>Quality Tiny Player
<Date>Mon Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the Micro as a gift after suggesting it to someone else.  I'd done a *lot* of research on MP3 players, and this one fit exactly what was needed--small, flash-storage, not too expensive, good quality.  After playing with it, I have to admit the research paid off.  The sound is great, the controls are easy to use, there are lots of options, the accessories are just what you need and the price is nice for how much they packed into it.    To answer the biggest questions I had before getting one....The FM works.  In fact, my wife seems to think it works better than her car stereo.  We had no problem picking up a radio station 70+ miles away (of course, that's in flat ND).  The included software does rip CDs without a problem, though the method for transferring previously stored MP3 is rather awkward.  It does *NOT* accept songs directly from iTunes.  You'll need to be...creative...to get that to work (iTunes downloads in MP4 and protects the file).  The thing is tiny and can go pretty much anywhere.  The protective case is a frosted white material (plastic/rubber/silicone) and covers most of what you want covered, but none of what you don't want covered.  Line-in and microphone are there and work, but aren't exceptional.  The earbuds sound okay, but are pretty big and will probably need to be swapped out.  Oh, and the dark blue version is a nice navy color.  The only things I'd consider changing (beyond the size of the buds) are giving it a replaceable USB-rechargable battery and making the volume buttons feel just a bit more solid.  Really not much of an issue though.  If I was going to buy another MP3 player for this price, there's no doubt I'd buy this one again.  Only thing better would be a 1GB version.  (Mine will be moving around alot, so I don't want a non-solid-state (iPod-type) player.)

<Title>The BEST MP3 Player Money Can Buy Right Now
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received this MP3 player for Xmas, after doing a TON of research, and this product is sublime.  I got mine for a mere $119 on amazon, new, and the shipping was free.  The sound quality is excellent, thought what people are saying about the white earbuds is true (can hurt after awhile.)  But once you get over that initial pain in your ear, the pain definitely goes away as you will be listening to sweet tunes.  The sound quality is definitely exceptional.  To use the line in feature, all you need is a stereo with a CD player, pop the CD in, press record on the MP3 (with the included cable attached), and you can go take a shower or do whatever you need to do, and the MP3 player will AUTOMATICALLY space each track for you!  So you don't need to sit there and press record for each track.  And I agree with the others, that the FM radio is top-notch.  Stations come in nice and crisp, and it even has a preset feature.  As far as the design, it is FLAWless.  NO SKIPPING.  Ever.  Impressively, it is very very tiny, mine is orange, you can adjust the LCD screen for a lefty or a righty, and the solid color selection is the frosting.  This little bugger is an intuitive DREAM because eventually, you can slip it into your pocket, and you can adjust volume, change folders/tracks or swith playing modes while it's STILL in your pocket!  It's THAT easy to use.  Very intuitive and you will catch on quickly.  It also scrolls the song titles and artists, which I appreciate very much.  The USB 2.0 cable that comes with it delivers seriously lightning fast transfers.   And as far as flash space, I can easily hold 10-15 albums on it.  I know that you can record from the FM radio, but I have yet to figure that out.  The only minuses are: I would trade it for a 1 GB version in a second.  And when the LCD screen is on, there is a very slight buzzing, though you can only hear it if you are in bed about to go to sleep, and even then, it goes away after 2 seconds and it doesn't bother me one bit.  I have to say that if you buy this product, you will NOT be sorry.  I carry it with me constantly and use it constantly.  So far this player only received excellent reviews, so you should get one.  It is the cheapest and the best.  And even if you don't consider the price, it is STILL the best flash MP3 player ever.

<Title>Small, but ineffective.  Size does NOT matter.
<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Although I love the size and plug-and-play simplicity of this player, I can't stand the way it works.  A perky customer support person at Creative told me that it was not designed to support "playlists."  What that means is that you cannot control the order in which songs are played.  So, if you are making a workout mix, you can't put the fast songs first and then cool down songs.  You can't listen to albums in their entirety or intended order.  You can't control anything about the playback experience.  So if you don't mind having Hayden and Hendrix mixed together, this is the player for you.  But if you want to experience music how the artists intended to be experienced, or how you intended when you made the mix, then steer clear of this one.  You will either be disappointed, or very frustrated as you change all the song names in your music library to "a" "b" "c" so that it will play as you want it to.  Bummer.

<Title>Stop looking and start enjoying this player...
<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If size, sound quality, and overall function are your priorities, then this is the player for you. I bought this player after weeks of contemplating and researching. Here's what I've found after 2 weeks of use:  Pros: Size (smallest I've seen) It has better sound quality than i-pods and ALL other flash-based players. There are multiple pre-set equalizers in addition to a 5 channel custom eq. After all, this is made by a company who makes premium sound cards!  Easy set up and use. Despite what one reviewer said you can put tracks on in order, you just have to understand how to use the program. The wheel for scrolling around the player is brilliant.  The belt clip/case and armband are very well designed and seem very durable.  The headphones are good, especially when compared to other (more expensive) players that barely attempt (i-river, i-pod, etc.).  Now for some cons:  Price, I paid $139.99 at Circuit City. I realize you can get it a little cheaper and it is competitive against comparable players but... if I didn't need the small size and reliability of a flash player for working out I would've spent another $100 or so and gotten a hard drive based player.   As previously discussed the volume button seems a little chinsy. (but at least everyone's is consistantly loose suggesting that there are no problems with quality control)  The software is a little invasive, it wants to be your next Windows Media Player, but is a feeble attempt. The default settings can be changed so it is strictly a support device for the MuVo.  That's it, if you are looking for a flash based player, this is definitely the right choice. I give it a 4.5 for the price thing but there is not option for that.

<Title>More like 4 and a half stars
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This isn't the perfect Mp3 player, but it's pretty good, especially when you consider the price. Overall, this player has more good features than it does bad.  It also has a number of features I doubt I'll ever use.  The Good: - Size - at 512 meg, it's not meant to hold your entire CD library.  It's a great player to take jogging.  It holds roughly seven or eight full albums. (maybe more depending on the quality of the mp3s) - File transfer - it's a flash storage device.  So to get songs onto your mp3 player simply drag and drop the files from your computer. - Size/weight - the thing is less than an ounce.  (Try holding two AAA batteries, that's how much it weighs with its battery).  It's about the size of a lighter.  - Strap and holder - comes with it's own velcro strap and rubbery holder. I-pod charges another 20 bucks for theirs. This player comes with a strap free. Free!! - Battery - while on the Ipod subject, this player uses one AAA battery.  I'm not sure how long it lasts, because mine still has juice, so at least several hours on one battery.  So, unlike the Ipod that has an internal battery and costs oodles of cash to replace, this comes with a AAA battery that's cheap and easy to replace (and it only needs replacing on rare occasions). - Sound Quality - uhhh...it's good and stuff - Price - Quite a lot of bang for the buck.  I've seen players with half the storage sell for the same price. Again: this player will not hold your entire mp3 library, if that's what you want, this player's not for you. - System compatability - some mp3 players (Ipod again), only work on Windows XP or 2000.  This one will work with Windows '98.   The Bad - Rubber USB port cover - it's flimsy and I just know it's going to fall off.  I don't think that'll affect the player, but I'd rather have a cover that worked and didn't fall apart. - backlight noise - with low volume (25/40), there's a perceptible buzzing noise whenever the backlight is on.  Of course, you can turn the backlight off, and it's completely unnoticable when the volume is turned up (mine' usually at 30 or so when jogging). - Track playing problems - a couple of tracks skip on this player, and other times whole albums would not play unless I transferred each individual track (instead of just dragging the entire album file).  - Ear buds - these furry things annoy me. They're okay for sound quality, but they're a bit uncomfortable. Ipod's are much better. I already had earphones for my old mp3 player, and I use them instead of the ones that came with this one.  Stuff I probably won't ever use - FM Radio - if I wanted an FM radio, I wouldn't have blown $120 bucks on an mp3 player! - file management software - even though you don't need it (see file transfer above), the player comes with its own mp3 management software.  Actually, I've used this some, and it's better than some (Rio, musicmatch); but it's still pretty useless. - microphone - The quality is OK, but why would anyone ever want to record their own voice into an mp3 player? Maybe I'm just narrowminded... - Mp3 ripper - this player comes with its own line that you can connect to a CD player to rip mp3's directly onto your player. If you're looking at mp3 players, odds are, most of your CDs are already ripped.  I have to say, overall I'm pleased with my purchase.  It's not perfect, but at the price it performs very well and avoids a lot of the pitfalls of other mp3 players. No it's not a 40 gig player that stores ALL your songs you ever heard.  It is a good value, and the perfect player to take to the gym.  ****UPDATE**** After 5 months, this product stopped working properly.  It skipped tracks, and played some but not others.  Customer support was a complete joke.

<Title>Great for audio books
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for a flash mp3 player that would work well for audio books.  I had briefly thought of buying the new Apple Shuffle, but realized that it really wouldn't suit my purposes well (who'd want to accidentally hit the "Shuffle" button in the middle of War and Peace?).    This one is excellent.  I signed up for Audible, and downloaded a couple of books.  The cool thing is that if you start to listen to one track, and then flip to a different one, it remembers where you were on the first track -- very cool.  I was able to listen to my Wodehouse book, and pass it on to my bored 8-old to listen to an interview with Lemony Snicket, then flip back and pick up my book right where I was.  It's very small, and the nice holster clips easily onto my jeans pocket.  With 512MB, it has plenty of space -- I've already put about 9 hours worth of material on it, and barely made a dent in the available space.  The only complaint I have is that while it has a place to slip on a lanyard, it does not come with one.  A fairly minor complaint.  All in all -- a great player.
