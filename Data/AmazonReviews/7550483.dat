<Content>I bought this product for my daughter's christmas gift, but, the worse buying that i do in my life. The product is bad quality, from 24th December until yesterday (14th January) i can not transfer music files to this device. All PCs -freeze- where i was trying to transfer any file, i am very sad for this poor gift. I recommend you, save money and buy an iPod, more money.. but best product. Good, nice & cheap not apply for this product. NO BUIT IT.
