<Title>Not as quick to operate
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first purchased this item, I loved it.  I really appreaciated the very long battery life and how quickly it charges back up.  However, I have noticed that it now does not hold its charge as long, or it doesn't charge up all the way.  I do not do any exercising activities with it, so I have never had the moisture under the screen problem and it has help up very well in the past two years that I have owned it.  However, I started to feel the annoyance of the fact that you cannot fast forward or rewind songs.  Also, you can't just push a button to go the the next song.  I have to go to the main menu, go into the albums, find the album, and scroll down to find the next song that I want.  Other than these small annoyances, it works great!

<Title>decent enough
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>my dad sent me this after my video ipod got stolen.  I have to say that it does the job well enough.  Controls are great once you figure them out.  Very compact.  Long battery life.  Quick charge up.  Nice sound quality.  Also comes with FM radio if you get tired of your own music.   all an all... it's a nice basic MP3 player if you aren't looking for anything fancy.

<Title>Unbelievable Battery Life
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Battery life is great, you really don't need to worry about charging this player. Menues are pretty easy to work with but the fact that there's no search option can sometimes make it somehow cumbersome to work with, try making playlists so you can find things easily.

<Title>Great MP3 player!
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this MP3 player.  The reason I picked this MP3 player over all the others is because it is small and it has an FM Tuner.  In the winter when I have to exercise inside the gym has televisions with FM transmitters to listen to them.  If I didn't have the FM tuner I would be able to listen to the televisions and it gets old after a while if you can only listen to straight music.  It is also nice to listen to a local station to get the local news and events that are going on.  The only downfall on this item is the display is difficult to see out in the sun.  Battery life is super long and it charges up fast if you forget to charge it up.  It really does last 3 hours with a 3 minute charge.

<Title>This is a great little player
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was having a lot of problems with mp3 players until a friend gave me this one used.  THIS THING IS AWESOME! You can organize your music on the player from Sonic Stage which is a great program. The battery lasts a long time and takes a very short time to charge via usb 2.0 port.   It is absolutely excellent

<Title>if you don't want video or your whole music library with you.....
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this little mp3 player for over a year now, bought one for my wife, and my brother loved it (bought one too). It's about the size of a lighter, light weight, and comes with a clip that actually works well. You got to spend a little bit of time to figure out the controls, especially if you're just trying to figure it out on your own, you might not notice the shuffle control. A tiny little button on the back side of the player.   Battery time is awesome, there's just nothing else to that.  The moisture thing is true... I just started to notice it about a month ago. A small part of the screen is starting to have a little cloudy spot on it.  But after over a year of using it on my runs and workouts, and all of my travels, I cannot complain.   I had bought a zune which was huge, then an ipod (not as big, but still bothered me on my runs). Then I realized that I don't need my whole music library with me at all times, so one gig is perfect for me.  If you purchase a good set of headsets... this player will deliver a good sound, great battery time, and plenty of music (you can use the atrac formatting from sony).

<Title>Don't even accept one for free as a gift--(0 stars)
<Date>Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>functionality of device itself is good but the software you HAVE to use is terrible.  Why can't it just be drag and drop through windohs explorer?  I just don't understand proprietary third party software.  I bought a Sony cd mp3 player a couple years ago, installed the software and almost immediately uninstalled it because it was so bad and just made mp3 cds with whatever burning software I had--couldn't have been happier that way. In my experience Sony software is far less than functional and is to be avoided and here you are not given the option to not use it unless you just want to use you player as an expensive 1G storage drive.  That alone makes it not worth buying.  Stick with players that are open source.  As for the authorization thing to get files off the player?  I wish there was an option here to give less than one star on the review.  Player sounded good though and didn't have cosmetic problems some note before I returned it.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For every one of you who is looking for a way to transfer MP3 files directly to this player (or any other newer NW-EXXX models) follow the link below and download Sony MP3 file manager V2.0: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3  You need to install the drivers first so that the Windows would recognize the device. You don't need SonicStage if you use this software to play MP3 files. All you do is to run an executable through MP3FM folder inside the player and drag & drop your MP3 files. Unfortunately I could not find a way to combine/rename folders after the transfer. Even if you organize your mp3 files into folders as you want to access in the player beforehand, after running this software your folder structure will be gone if it's deeper than 1 level.  Apart from this the player sounds very good with an awesome display. VBR (variable bit rate) MP3 files are recognized and played back flawlessly. The track/album access with the dial is also designed very well. On the negative side the player feels a bit too plasticky, not like the earlier titanium NW-MS70D. Also the bag that comes with this player is too big for the player itself. I wish there was a smaller one bundled in.

<Title>Some Clarifications
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before I start with my mini review, let me first clarify some things:  1. This device support MP3 drag-and-drop without using Sonic Stage using a program provided by Sony. See the following links:  Sony: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3 How to make it auto-launch: http://forums.minidisc.org/index.php?showtopic=11234  2. This device works as a regular flash drive. It lets you copy non-audio files.  Mini review:  Having used a Sony miniDisc player before, I'm used to Sonic Stage already. One thing I don't like about it is, there's no Mac support. Sonic Stage is not really hard to use. I look at it as, it's not as easy as iTunes.  It comes with 5 free songs (gift cert) at Sony Connect. The upload of the songs to the device was a bit slow since it's USB 1.1. A good thing about Sonic Stage though is, you can choose what songs to upload to your music device (Apple added this feature when the Shuffle was released).  Although just one color (light blue), the OLED screen is great. Think of an LCD screen but brighter (it makes me want to get the Sony Clie VZ90). All devices with screens should use OLED! :D  The metal controls require getting used to. It reminds me of the small dial at the side of an analog watch -- pull once and twist up or down to scroll through the songs, pull it one more time and twisting up or down scolls through the albums, push it in and it's on 'hold' and controls are protected from accidental pushes or twists.   On power saving mode, when a song is playing, after a few seconds, the screen turns off. Every after a few seconds thereafter, an animation - like four "(" - runs to show you that something is playing.  Battery life - I have no plans of testing it but the box says it will last 50 hours of continuous playing. The box also says that a 3-minute charge is good for 3-hours use (wow). Charging is done via USB through the computer by the way.  As for weight, it's slightly heavier than the Shuffle.  There is an option to adjust bass and treble. Using good earphones makes it sound really better than the Shuffle.  Purchased music are in ATRAC3 format, though it can play MP3, WMA, and WAV files if you upload them via Sonic Stage.  Earphones, USB cable, belt clip, a black pouch, and a 5 free song Sony Connect coupon are included in the box.  As for the cost, the E507 (which has 1GB) is $199 - the 1GB Shuffle is $129. Is the $70 difference worth it? Knowing that Sony included an 3-liner OLED (not just a regular LCD) screen is well worth it already. It also comes with an FM tuner and a clock. While it says at the the back that it was built in China, the build is solid. I highly recommend this device.

<Title>*SIGH* oh Sony! When will you get it right?
<Date>Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I loved this player.  I thought it was beautiful and it complemented my PSP quite well.    But you know of course that Sony had to mess it up.  Have they not learned anything from the ATRAC only Network Walkman debacle of a few years ago?    See here is what has happened.  Sony is composed of two companies.  Media and Engineers.  The engineers put out all the cool stuff like Plasma TV's, PSP, PS2 (PS3!), etc.  Media puts out cool stuff like Spiderman 1 & 2 and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Media side thinks EVERYONE is a thief and makes the engineering side put all kinds of stupid restrictions on their hardware.  Like on my PSP I have to rename .mp4 movies to NV25349.mp4 and place them in a folder called NV0001.  Music and pictures go in *gasp* the music and pictures folder!  Anyway this isn't a PSP review.  I got this MP3 player from Amazon and I was so happy when I got it.  I immediately unpacked it, marveled and drooled at how beautiful it is, and hooked it up to my USB port on my computer.  I then tried to copy over MP3's.  Alas that didn't work.  No I had to use this program that was REALLY lame.  It is very restrictive on what you can copy over and, like a previous reviewer said, you have to authenticate to even pull your mp3's off!  IT's MY MUSIC Sony.  I own all the CD's and you're treating me like I stole your baby's college fund.  Come on and wise up.  You didn't get where you are today by restricting your customers and your own innovation.  This could be such an iPod killer but alas restrictive software (even moreso than iTunes!) doesn't help me out.  I sold this player on eBay for more than I bought it for anyway.

<Title>love it!
<Date>Thu Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Has a great look, very modern & sleek!  The screen is really neat, but it's hard to see when using outdoors in the bright sun.  Love how compact it is, how light it is, and how the small number of buttons and things do so many different things.  I do wish there was a arm band for it, but I have concocted my own using a wrist band (sweat band thing) which works fine. It has great sound - I love the various sound options!   One thing I don't like... there are different screen settings, and when you switch one to show the time or something, I wish it would show the music information when you switch songs, but it doesn't.  If you select the time to be shown, you'll see that only until you switch over to the other Display mode.   I have had some problems w/ the software... but I got songs onto the player in the end.  It's not too user friendly.   But overall, I am thoroughly enjoying it.

<Content>It's awesome! I really really enjoy it. It is small, download is easy, setup is easy, sound quality is great and the FM is good.  The only (small) drawback is switching between the FM and MP3. The buttons are really small and makes it hard to switch between different functions.

<Title>Sony NW-E507 Network Walkman - * * * * *
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sony has a winner here!  Display is crisp and is easily seen in daylight. The Controls are easy to use and straight forward. The size and weight are minimal - you can clip in on your shirt. The sound quality is excellent - even at max sound level. The included sofware is fairly easy to use and setup. It would have been nice (hint to sony) if a standard retractable USB connector was built in - I just bought a mini-usb to USB adapter and keep in in the included bag. The FM tuner is sensitive and locks in the toughest stations. If you carefully look on the web, there is an alternate mp3 manager available that is tiny and can be run directly from the unit when plugged into USB.  The unit can also be used as a file storage device similar to a standard USB dongle.  Battery life is excellent.  Just plug into any USB to recharge.   5 Stars  Awesome!

<Title>Ipod Killer
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sony's NW-E507 Digital Music Player is perfection. The player's benefits range from its sexy design to it's user friendly downloading software. I had searched for a MP3 for several months and upon finding the NW-E507 I knew I had an MP3 Player to rival my friends Ipods. First the NW-E507 holds 1gb of storage which is perfect for what I use it for. My mp3 player is used for the gym mainly. I knew in my mind that the ipod was to big for the gym and the shuffle did not have a screen which was a definite negative. the sony mp3 player has a integrated screen, which has received several compliments. The quick battery charge is great as well and so is the navagational system on MP3 player. Not a single negative i can think of. just buy it.

<Title>Sony's software
<Date>Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It is a well established truism that Sony's primary operating software for their mp3 players is dreadful.  However, they have had the foresight to make available a drag-n-drop "mp3 Manager" that is ingenious in its utter simplicity. (Makes you wonder why they just don't tweak their miserable Sonic software that is both user-un-friendly and, apparently, hyper-suspicious re piracy concerns.)  I have found the MP3 Manager software not only at the Sony site but at a couple other places online.  Once installed, it automatically opens when you connect your player via USB, and opens a window that permits you to delete and add music files with the greatest of ease.  Note, though, it will only work with mp3 formatted files, and won't abide, e.g., wma format.  I have not yet received my NW-E507 (but give it 4 stars based on my experience with the NW-E75 I currently own), but the software works quite well with my NW-E75 (of which I am replacing with the NW-E507 only for the greater 1 gig v. 256MB storage capacity).  I assume, based on a couple postings here, that the MP3 Manager Software works equally as well with the NW-E507 (assume and hope....).
