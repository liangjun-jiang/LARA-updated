<Title>Not as quick to operate
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first purchased this item, I loved it.  I really appreaciated the very long battery life and how quickly it charges back up.  However, I have noticed that it now does not hold its charge as long, or it doesn't charge up all the way.  I do not do any exercising activities with it, so I have never had the moisture under the screen problem and it has help up very well in the past two years that I have owned it.  However, I started to feel the annoyance of the fact that you cannot fast forward or rewind songs.  Also, you can't just push a button to go the the next song.  I have to go to the main menu, go into the albums, find the album, and scroll down to find the next song that I want.  Other than these small annoyances, it works great!

<Title>decent enough
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>my dad sent me this after my video ipod got stolen.  I have to say that it does the job well enough.  Controls are great once you figure them out.  Very compact.  Long battery life.  Quick charge up.  Nice sound quality.  Also comes with FM radio if you get tired of your own music.   all an all... it's a nice basic MP3 player if you aren't looking for anything fancy.

<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Battery life is great, you really don't need to worry about charging this player. Menues are pretty easy to work with but the fact that there's no search option can sometimes make it somehow cumbersome to work with, try making playlists so you can find things easily.

<Title>Great MP3 player!
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this MP3 player.  The reason I picked this MP3 player over all the others is because it is small and it has an FM Tuner.  In the winter when I have to exercise inside the gym has televisions with FM transmitters to listen to them.  If I didn't have the FM tuner I would be able to listen to the televisions and it gets old after a while if you can only listen to straight music.  It is also nice to listen to a local station to get the local news and events that are going on.  The only downfall on this item is the display is difficult to see out in the sun.  Battery life is super long and it charges up fast if you forget to charge it up.  It really does last 3 hours with a 3 minute charge.

You can organize your music on the player from Sonic Stage which is a great program. The battery lasts a long time and takes a very short time to charge via usb 2.0 port.   It is absolutely excellent

<Title>if you don't want video or your whole music library with you.....
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this little mp3 player for over a year now, bought one for my wife, and my brother loved it (bought one too). It's about the size of a lighter, light weight, and comes with a clip that actually works well. You got to spend a little bit of time to figure out the controls, especially if you're just trying to figure it out on your own, you might not notice the shuffle control. A tiny little button on the back side of the player.   Battery time is awesome, there's just nothing else to that.  The moisture thing is true... I just started to notice it about a month ago. A small part of the screen is starting to have a little cloudy spot on it.  But after over a year of using it on my runs and workouts, and all of my travels, I cannot complain.   I had bought a zune which was huge, then an ipod (not as big, but still bothered me on my runs). Then I realized that I don't need my whole music library with me at all times, so one gig is perfect for me.  If you purchase a good set of headsets... this player will deliver a good sound, great battery time, and plenty of music (you can use the atrac formatting from sony).

<Title>Don't even accept one for free as a gift--(0 stars)
<Date>Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>functionality of device itself is good but the software you HAVE to use is terrible.  Why can't it just be drag and drop through windohs explorer?  I just don't understand proprietary third party software.  I bought a Sony cd mp3 player a couple years ago, installed the software and almost immediately uninstalled it because it was so bad and just made mp3 cds with whatever burning software I had--couldn't have been happier that way. In my experience Sony software is far less than functional and is to be avoided and here you are not given the option to not use it unless you just want to use you player as an expensive 1G storage drive.  That alone makes it not worth buying.  Stick with players that are open source.  As for the authorization thing to get files off the player?  I wish there was an option here to give less than one star on the review.  Player sounded good though and didn't have cosmetic problems some note before I returned it.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For every one of you who is looking for a way to transfer MP3 files directly to this player (or any other newer NW-EXXX models) follow the link below and download Sony MP3 file manager V2.0: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3  You need to install the drivers first so that the Windows would recognize the device. You don't need SonicStage if you use this software to play MP3 files. All you do is to run an executable through MP3FM folder inside the player and drag & drop your MP3 files. Unfortunately I could not find a way to combine/rename folders after the transfer. Even if you organize your mp3 files into folders as you want to access in the player beforehand, after running this software your folder structure will be gone if it's deeper than 1 level.  Apart from this the player sounds very good with an awesome display. VBR (variable bit rate) MP3 files are recognized and played back flawlessly. The track/album access with the dial is also designed very well. On the negative side the player feels a bit too plasticky, not like the earlier titanium NW-MS70D. Also the bag that comes with this player is too big for the player itself. I wish there was a smaller one bundled in.

<Title>Some Clarifications
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before I start with my mini review, let me first clarify some things:  1. This device support MP3 drag-and-drop without using Sonic Stage using a program provided by Sony. See the following links:  Sony: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3 How to make it auto-launch: http://forums.minidisc.org/index.php?showtopic=11234  2. This device works as a regular flash drive. It lets you copy non-audio files.  Mini review:  Having used a Sony miniDisc player before, I'm used to Sonic Stage already. One thing I don't like about it is, there's no Mac support. Sonic Stage is not really hard to use. I look at it as, it's not as easy as iTunes.  It comes with 5 free songs (gift cert) at Sony Connect. The upload of the songs to the device was a bit slow since it's USB 1.1. A good thing about Sonic Stage though is, you can choose what songs to upload to your music device (Apple added this feature when the Shuffle was released).  Although just one color (light blue), the OLED screen is great. Think of an LCD screen but brighter (it makes me want to get the Sony Clie VZ90). All devices with screens should use OLED! :D  The metal controls require getting used to. It reminds me of the small dial at the side of an analog watch -- pull once and twist up or down to scroll through the songs, pull it one more time and twisting up or down scolls through the albums, push it in and it's on 'hold' and controls are protected from accidental pushes or twists.   On power saving mode, when a song is playing, after a few seconds, the screen turns off. Every after a few seconds thereafter, an animation - like four "(" - runs to show you that something is playing.  Battery life - I have no plans of testing it but the box says it will last 50 hours of continuous playing. The box also says that a 3-minute charge is good for 3-hours use (wow). Charging is done via USB through the computer by the way.  As for weight, it's slightly heavier than the Shuffle.  There is an option to adjust bass and treble. Using good earphones makes it sound really better than the Shuffle.  Purchased music are in ATRAC3 format, though it can play MP3, WMA, and WAV files if you upload them via Sonic Stage.  Earphones, USB cable, belt clip, a black pouch, and a 5 free song Sony Connect coupon are included in the box.  As for the cost, the E507 (which has 1GB) is $199 - the 1GB Shuffle is $129. Is the $70 difference worth it? Knowing that Sony included an 3-liner OLED (not just a regular LCD) screen is well worth it already. It also comes with an FM tuner and a clock. While it says at the the back that it was built in China, the build is solid. I highly recommend this device.

<Title>*SIGH* oh Sony! When will you get it right?
<Date>Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I loved this player.  I thought it was beautiful and it complemented my PSP quite well.    But you know of course that Sony had to mess it up.  Have they not learned anything from the ATRAC only Network Walkman debacle of a few years ago?    See here is what has happened.  Sony is composed of two companies.  Media and Engineers.  The engineers put out all the cool stuff like Plasma TV's, PSP, PS2 (PS3!), etc.  Media puts out cool stuff like Spiderman 1 & 2 and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Media side thinks EVERYONE is a thief and makes the engineering side put all kinds of stupid restrictions on their hardware.  Like on my PSP I have to rename .mp4 movies to NV25349.mp4 and place them in a folder called NV0001.  Music and pictures go in *gasp* the music and pictures folder!  Anyway this isn't a PSP review.  I got this MP3 player from Amazon and I was so happy when I got it.  I immediately unpacked it, marveled and drooled at how beautiful it is, and hooked it up to my USB port on my computer.  I then tried to copy over MP3's.  Alas that didn't work.  No I had to use this program that was REALLY lame.  It is very restrictive on what you can copy over and, like a previous reviewer said, you have to authenticate to even pull your mp3's off!  IT's MY MUSIC Sony.  I own all the CD's and you're treating me like I stole your baby's college fund.  Come on and wise up.  You didn't get where you are today by restricting your customers and your own innovation.  This could be such an iPod killer but alas restrictive software (even moreso than iTunes!) doesn't help me out.  I sold this player on eBay for more than I bought it for anyway.

<Title>love it!
<Date>Thu Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Has a great look, very modern & sleek!  The screen is really neat, but it's hard to see when using outdoors in the bright sun.  Love how compact it is, how light it is, and how the small number of buttons and things do so many different things.  I do wish there was a arm band for it, but I have concocted my own using a wrist band (sweat band thing) which works fine. It has great sound - I love the various sound options!   One thing I don't like... there are different screen settings, and when you switch one to show the time or something, I wish it would show the music information when you switch songs, but it doesn't.  If you select the time to be shown, you'll see that only until you switch over to the other Display mode.   I have had some problems w/ the software... but I got songs onto the player in the end.  It's not too user friendly.   But overall, I am thoroughly enjoying it.

<Title>Sony NW-E507 Network Walkman - * * * * *
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sony has a winner here!  Display is crisp and is easily seen in daylight. The Controls are easy to use and straight forward. The size and weight are minimal - you can clip in on your shirt. The sound quality is excellent - even at max sound level. The included sofware is fairly easy to use and setup. It would have been nice (hint to sony) if a standard retractable USB connector was built in - I just bought a mini-usb to USB adapter and keep in in the included bag. The FM tuner is sensitive and locks in the toughest stations. If you carefully look on the web, there is an alternate mp3 manager available that is tiny and can be run directly from the unit when plugged into USB.  The unit can also be used as a file storage device similar to a standard USB dongle.  Battery life is excellent.  Just plug into any USB to recharge.   5 Stars  Awesome!

<Title>Ipod Killer
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sony's NW-E507 Digital Music Player is perfection. The player's benefits range from its sexy design to it's user friendly downloading software. I had searched for a MP3 for several months and upon finding the NW-E507 I knew I had an MP3 Player to rival my friends Ipods. First the NW-E507 holds 1gb of storage which is perfect for what I use it for. My mp3 player is used for the gym mainly. I knew in my mind that the ipod was to big for the gym and the shuffle did not have a screen which was a definite negative. the sony mp3 player has a integrated screen, which has received several compliments. The quick battery charge is great as well and so is the navagational system on MP3 player. Not a single negative i can think of. just buy it.

<Title>Sony's software
<Date>Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It is a well established truism that Sony's primary operating software for their mp3 players is dreadful.  However, they have had the foresight to make available a drag-n-drop "mp3 Manager" that is ingenious in its utter simplicity. (Makes you wonder why they just don't tweak their miserable Sonic software that is both user-un-friendly and, apparently, hyper-suspicious re piracy concerns.)  I have found the MP3 Manager software not only at the Sony site but at a couple other places online.  Once installed, it automatically opens when you connect your player via USB, and opens a window that permits you to delete and add music files with the greatest of ease.  Note, though, it will only work with mp3 formatted files, and won't abide, e.g., wma format.  I have not yet received my NW-E507 (but give it 4 stars based on my experience with the NW-E75 I currently own), but the software works quite well with my NW-E75 (of which I am replacing with the NW-E507 only for the greater 1 gig v. 256MB storage capacity).  I assume, based on a couple postings here, that the MP3 Manager Software works equally as well with the NW-E507 (assume and hope....).

<Title>Its a good product, but you have to know  a few things
<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read several reviews for mp3. I had chosen the cheaper model of sony (the crappy circle thing). I had software issues so i returned it. They were out and I got this instead. All I am going to say is that it works very well once you know how to use it. The software is a nightmare until i realised that it was just looking for copy right protect songs, which you can easily fake using the wma format. It will convert them when transfer to the player. All you have to do is click the wma file to sonic stage, (then it makes a short cut) and transfer to the player. It will even allow you to reduce the bite rate the 48 artac format.  Another thing is that you must make your playlist first and tranfer how you want the playlist to play. once it is on the player it will allow search for artist and album so naviation isn't bad once you figure it out.

<Title>SHAME ON SONY--Save yourself the $$ and aggravation!!
<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I think that buying an electronic device is kind of like getting married: you should do a LOT of homework before making a commitment, based on your needs, preferences, price range (okay, well that *shouldn't* apply to *marriage*), etc. So, when I was looking for an MP3 player to use while running, I looked at a lot of reviews and compared features before finally selecting the NW-E507. I agree with those who found the software limiting, but I knew about that going into the purchase and felt that the huge memory, amazing battery life, compact size and easy functionality were a fair trade.   So . . . my first year of marriage to NW-E507 was everything that a blissful honeymoon should be. It worked exactly as it was supposed to, and I loved it and took very good care of it. Then, just a year after purchase (and long after the 90-day warranty expired), its personality changed. Well, at least the electronic equivalent of that--all of the buttons stopped working properly, it began to fast-forward sporadically, the battery wouldn't last longer than a couple of hours. It was an MP3 player possessed. I tried erasing its memory and reinstalling my files, scoured the owner's manual for troubleshooting ideas, cursed, prayed and finally decided to write a scathing review.   If I could give this product zero stars I would, because $200 (alas, I bought this when it first came out and paid retail) is WAY TOO MUCH (even $139 is too much) to pay for a poor quality product that is designed (I believe purposefully by Sony) to break so that it has to be replaced. Sorry, that's just bad customer service on Sony's part, and I will not be purchasing their products again.  So please, learn from my mistakes, vote with your dollars for a better product, and teach Sony to not be so disengenous with its customers.

<Title>un.............believ...a......ble
<Date>Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll type this with what CPU time SonicStage allows. I was concerned in "going digital" that I'd spend too much time in overhead -managing which tracks to get, which to put on the player. Still I tended (or chose) to discount the many complaints about the software over the niftiness of the player. 700 tracks over 250 for a 1-gig Ipod with a radio and long battery life thrown in. Indeed the ATRAC format sounds fine and its the best mini radio I've used.   That's the 1-star. Unfortunately, the software is as much the product as the gadget itself. It's all the forementioned and more (when I got it to run -it requires XP service pack 2 which Indian support never told me). Its maddeningly slow- bringing the whole system to a grinding halt where other windows can take a minute or two to respond when its loading the player. (Don't think about doing anything else to SonicStage.) It has no end of idiosynchrosies- the why-did-it-do-thats and why-can't-I-do-this's never stop. I've wasted many evenings in the last 6 weeks trying to load it- learning just how to select the tracks so they'll end up in the right album folder and not in another, or dumped in folders called "new album" or "untitled". The tracklist for the player won't sort and can't be printed. Who knows if everything's there. Sonicstage will arbitrarily refuse to load tracks to the player with cryptic error messages (aplenty). Reimport the tracks to Sonicstage and its got no problem. And a few corrupted (screech) files have showed up that worked before.   Anyway what compelled the post was the other night when newly loaded tracks were again going to the wrong folder. There being no way to stop the transfer and in what wasn't the first white rage I killed SonicStage from the task manager. When it restarted it didn't recognise the player and said I would need to delete all files please-to-thank-you. 800 Meg. Now this is the equivalent of "Windows was improperly shut down- please reformat your hard drive". An overnight reload has it halfway back but I sure wish it said something about backups.   Again taken as software/hardware, this a consumer product that makes the Yugo look good. There are plenty of choices. I urge you to keep looking.

<Title>With normal use, condensation will damage/kill this player
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved this player when I got it, BUT, 9 months after I bought it, the unit stopped working.  Upon inspection, it looked like there was condensation inside the plastic case.  I called Sony and they told me I would have to pay something like $40 for labor even though the item was less than a year old.  They also said that the technician would inspect for moisture inside the plastic, and if they found moisture (or "signs of moisture") the $40 fee they planned to charge me would be increased.  Any moisture in the unit was not my fault: The unit never got wet- I used it for running but always kept it dry.  The moisture in the air must have caused the unit failure.  This is obviously a design flaw.    I decided not to bother with sending the unit back since they said they wouldn't fix it because of moisture in the unit- plus I was not happy at the prospect of paying about $40 to have an item repaired which was less than a year old!!!  After a week, the unit dried up and started playing again, but not all the buttons work now- Most importantly, the button which moves tracks forward doesn't work, which is a major inconvenience.    Another flaw is that when you load new data onto the player, it resets so that you lose your place.  I have to write down the track number/time I was listening to before loading new data so that I can find my place again.  Of course, that is now much more difficult because I can't move tracks forward!!!!!  Buyer beware!

<Title>Beware: Do Not Operate With Wet Fingers
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are four things I really like about this player: 1) The very long 50-hour battery life, and all on a quick charge time; 2) The great sound when it's played on the one preset level with extra-bass. The other preset levels sound tinny, so you'll likely never use them; 3) The 695 (with 4-minute songs) track storage capacity. 4) The excellent FM reception even inside a building workplace.  There are two things I didn't like, so I took 2 stars away, and gave this Sony MP3 player an overall score of 3 stars: 1) The Sony Sonic Stage software you must use to upload songs into the player is purely anti-consumer with its DRM to prevent piracy. Though, there is an easy way around it such as burning a song stored on you computer to a CD-R, then uploading that song that's now on a CD into the accompanying and mandatory SonicStage software. If most of your music you plan on uploading into this MP3 player is already on CD than it's no problem, but if most of your music is stored only on your hard-drive than you might want to forget this player unless you don't mind burning your songs onto CDs first. 2) But the REALLY big problem I have with this MP3 player is if your fingers are wet, or in anyway moist, and you press any of the operating buttons on the unit then moisture will get trapped in-between the surface and the display screen, so if you use this while exercising, or work in a cold and wet environment, only operate this unit with it inside a plastic freezer bag as I do. It's just one big design flaw that I'm surprised Sony overlooked.

<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really enjoyed this device up until 3 weeks ago.  It has long battery life and a large capacity for storage.  BUT that does not matter if it just cuts off on you.  Lately, has I hit an hour mark of running, it just shuts off.  I did notice that the player looked as if it had moisture inside so i thought it was from my sweat.  After reading the other reviews, i realize this is a feature of the player--- moisture getting trapped inside....I wish I would have known this before,  I would have just gotten an IPOD.  Anyhoo, on top of that, if you run in the daylight (which i believe most of us do) you can't read the player because of the reflection against the sun.  I find myself having to hover over it or go to a dark space in order to see what songs I am changing it too....If you don't run, and just sit around with it, buy it, but if you plan on doing any activities with it (i.e. running, walking, excercise) DONT BUY IT!!!

<Title>Headphone 
<Date>Wed Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this for my 14 year old nephew who figured everything out without taking a peek into the instructions, in a matter of minutes downloaded the software to all 3 computers, and handles  downloading ,transfering, erasing music with ease. I think it is an awesome little piece of art. The length of the 2 lines to the headphone IS supposed to be different. I didn't know myself so asked him, and was told that one side goes directly to your ear from let's say your front pocket, the other goes behind your neck then to you other ear so the thing doesn't dangle on your chest under your chin.

<Title>Finally, an MP3 player that looks cool. 
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been waiting for an appealing MP3 player to come out for years, and Sony became my savior. When I first recieved this particular mp3 player, I charged it for about five whole minutes. The thing played for nearly five hours! The battery itslef, when fully charged is good for 50 hours.The FM Tuner is a nice feature, and is only staticky where absoulutely no signal can be detected, such as in tunnels, and some hallways. Other than that, I have owned mine for about a month, and have had no other problems. It is surprisingly durable, as well. At one time while I was handling it, a passerby knocked it forcefully, but accidentally to the ground. Much to my surprise, it was still playing the same song, unsratched and unscathed. It also came with it's own clip, Usb cable, and headphones as well. I have been noticing that people have been having problems with the headphones and their unique design. One earbud wire is made longer thatn the other, so that it may be worn around the back of the neck and not be a nuisance, swinging and dangling in front of you, and tangling on things. When used correctly, the design will be much appreciated. However, the reason that I did not give five stars was also because of the headphones. Personally, I like to leave the headphones connected, and wrap them around the player when I don't use it. This prevents me from leaving them places. While most headphones have the L-shaped jack, this is a strait one, wich bent the wire strait down each time it was wrapped up. After about three weeks, and much to my surprise, the wire insulation separated at that point. It was nothing a piece of duct tape couldn't fix,or a new set of headphones, for that matter. The software is easy to use, but if this is your first MP3 player you should read the instructions first. The package also includes a free Napster Trial, which is nice for the song(s) that you just never could find. The Design of the player itself is very unique and easily accesible. After about two days of carrying it around I could operate it with one hand. All in all, if you ever plan on getting an MP3 Player, I would recommend this one.

<Content>I didn't know that until I read the spec. I also didn't know that usb 2.0 can be this slow. It's like... you're driving ferrari in freeway at 20mph! Why did Sony make this device USB 2.0 if it takes 10 sec to transfer one song, and another 10 sec to refresh the list? I now can see why iTunes is great.  After several Sony cassette player, Sony MD Plyaer, Sony CD Player, and now Sony mp3 player, I will never buy Sony again.

<Title>works indoors as long as you aren't moving fast
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this device primarily because I wanted an FM receiver.  I liked the compact size, capacity, battery (charge and recharging) but I intended to wear it while running.  First, the manual stinks and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off, or stop the repeats.  Eventually I worked that out.  The ear buds caused sores in my ear canals and constantly fell out.  I replaced these with SONY $80 ear buds that aren't much better.  Then I couldn't see the display when I ventured outdoors.  The quality of the display just kept getting worse, until it died completely.  Finally, the whole thing stopped playing after 27 days.  I took it back to SONY and the manager told me that it had been abused.  He would send it back to SONY for an autopsy and let me know whether it was covered by the warranty.  I simply used it while running.  I haven't received the forensic report yet but I wouldn't recommend this product.

<Title>M y screen is cloudy!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned my player for barely 2 months.  It was working great until it suddenly stopped playing.  Condensation built up inside the screen while I was using it inside and it stopped.  After a few hours, the condensation was a little better and it started playing again, but the display options don't work properly anymore.    The customer help line told me to keep it in a dry place for 1 - 2 hours and let it dry out.  It's been "drying" for a week and the screen is still spotted and cloudy.    The really cool design was the main reason I bought it and I thought a Sony was supposed to be good.  Sony did make me the wonderful offer of exchanging my almost brand new player for a refurbished player of "comparable" quality.    Still seeking satisfaction.

<Title>The best until nano showed up, still there are advantages
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>All in all, this little player is really great, with its extremely reliable battery life you're going to love that this thing will spend more time in your pocket than charging itself up. I don't know how is the ipod nano speed to charge going to be, but sony really keeps its promise: "3 minutes of charge, 3 hours of life" and the "50 hours of battery life" (against the 14 of ipod nano), I've been using it a lot and this thing lasts a least a week and more.  The sound is really good, and unless you are a music maniac the 1gb capacity should be enough to keep playing a good selection of music till you can change them in a week or so while it charges.  It comes with a clip which I find it really useful to be able to change the song quickly, but if you don't want to impress other pedestrians by having it on the belt-clip you can just put it in your pocket and you'll barely notice it.  I use to travel and that's why I love its battery life, also the FM tuner (which the ipod nano doesn't have) keeps you up to date whenever, wherever and, even when you won't be using it a lot, it's really great to have it available when you want it.  The transfer speed is not really slow, but kind of. The software that comes with it is not the best but neither the monster that everybody wants you to believe, it's really easy to use.  While ipod nano is hanging around 200 and 250 this thing looks expensive, but it is really worth it.

<Content>Great sound.  I thought 500 songs would be enough, but (how spoiled are we) I'd be happier with more.  On the other hand, it's solid state, with no little spinning thing whose MTBF I have to worry about.  Endless battery charge.  I just took it on vacation...long sessions by the pool...and I barely made a dent in the charge.  Can't see the messages in bright sun.  But I only needed to know one and could do it without seeing it.  My daughter has a little iPod and I'm not at all jealous.  I'm sure my point of failure will be well after hers.  But a friend has a big one with much, much more capacity.  I'm kind of jealous of him.  But mine will still be running long after both of theirs die.

<Title>Great 1st MP3 player
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased the blue version of this player along with a set of Fontopia MDR-EX81SL earphones and a Sony lanyard. This is my first MP3 player and was looking for a quality device, great sound quality, FM tuner, large storage capacity, long battery life, portability and "coolness factor".  I got all of these and more with the NW-E507.  I found using the included SonicStage3 software very easy to use.  Sound quality is excellent even using the ATRAC3Plus setting of 48 kbps.  At this setting, you can download 45 hours of music into the player.  You won't need to worry about recharging the battery very often as it's rated at 50 hours after connecting it via USB cable to your computer for 2 hours.  There's also a quick charge feature where you get a 3 hour power supply after charging for only 5 minutes, great for people on the go!  The form factor of this device is excellent and the controls are easily understandable.  I'm able to use only one hand when controlling the player.  The OELD display is definitely cool (as well as informative).  The OELD is bright and the information appears to "float" on the side of the player, as there isn't a visible screen.  This is my first player and I'm very happy with this device!

<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had a tough luck with Sony in the past. For example PDA that I had needed a special Memory Stick which costed like 30% more, special format for MP3 and stuff like that. When I got this device I was dissapointed at first, dunno why. After 30 minutes playing with it I fell in love with it. I got used to controls and Sonic Stage which actually lets you upoload MP3 in it's orinal state without converting to sony format ATRAC3 or wateva it is. Ability to control this player with just one hand is AMAZING. Regarding the battery life all that I can say is WOW. It charges thru USB, so whenever you want to upload a song it charges itslef up. All you people who are considering between Apple and Sony, Sony should be your choice even though it's a little more money.

<Title>Finally Sony delivers
<Date>Fri May 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In the past Sony was synonymous with superior audio products with innovative design.  Up til now their mp3 products have being disappointing and frustrating. I had my 64 meg mcp10 for 5 years now and it's time for an upgrade.  If you're like me, I don't understand the whole Ipod hype.  The product (design, and functions) does not justify the cost.  I was about to get an I-River when I heard about the new NW-E500 series. It has all the features I want and it excel in some area.    Design: Finally a mp3 player that looks more like an electronic device than a computer device.  The size is about a slim version of most jump drives. The jog dial seems odd at first but the it's a 5 min learning curve and very intuitive.  You can perform all the functions such as volume, track forward/rewind, album forwarding without looking.  In the end, the ergonomic is great.  Display The biggest gripe I have with the shuffle is the lack of a display.  The NW-E507's organic EL display is sharp and shows the artist and song title.    Battery It uses a rechargable lithium battery via your USB connection.  Surprisely, the quick charge feature does work.  They claim it's about 40 ours of playing time using standard mp3 format.  So far, it looks promising after a couple hours of playtime.  Software: I think the biggest issue I had in the past with Sony is their ATRAC format.  I had to format my mp3 to that format in order to transfer it over to the mcp10.  Well that's finally changed!!! You can transfer normal mp3, wma without any conversion.  The new Sonic stage software isn't bad but could be improve upon.   Right now I have one issue , it doesn't allow you to transfer songs from mulitple computers without deleting your existing content on the nw-e507.  urgh another Sony lame anti-pirating feature.  I'll have to look more into this.  I haven't try downloading songs from their Connect network. so I have no comments on that.  Storage: It's plug and play, shows up on your computer as a removeable device.  Summary: For $199 you get a good all around mp3 player with a fm tuner and a display.  Compare to the Shuffle, there's no comparison. Compare to the I-river... pretty much same features but better styling.  Hoepfully they offer other colors in the future.

<Title>Great player, unfriendly DRM software
<Date>Sun May 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is fairly small, although it may be confused with a shiny lighter. I actually kind of like that kind of camouflage since it makes it less likely to be stolen. There is no mistaking it for a lighter once the bright OLED display comes alive.  The controls are well-thought, a Sony trademark of sorts. There is a large play/stop button, two paddles on the "shoulders" for volume, and a sliding joystick control around the headpone jack. The joystick works like a watch crown. Pushed down, it puts the device in "hold" mode. It has two other positions. To skip to next/prev song, you rotate the joystick a bit (when not in "hold" mode). The bottom hides the mini-USB port. Minor gripe: the device stops playing when the USB cable is plugged in.  The OLED display is a very nice touch and it integrates quite well with the player's design, although I wish it were a tad longer to be able to display more text without scrolling. The fixed font makes it hard to read sometimes. A proportional font would work better (probably fixable with a software upgrade).  Which brings me to the reason why I gave it only 4 stars. And why I am going to return it. There is simply too much hassle associated with putting music on the device and copying it back from it. The software insists on controlling what I can and cannot do with my own files. You can only upload mp3s by using the included SonicStage software. But, regardless of the original source, it will not let you download the files back unless you perform an "authorization" with some remote site I don't care for, presumably because it assumes you're a "thief". That, my friends, I cannot have.  Sigh. The recipe was simple and easy to follow. The mp3 player is a USB storage device, with a universal driver, you plug it in, you copy files to/from it, it plays whatever it can from your folders. It would have worked everywhere, even with a Mac or Linux, or even years after support for the actual player had lapsed, without any extra effort. But no. Not with this one. You can certainly upload files to it, it will just ignore them if you didn't put them via SonicStage. You can look at it as having two areas on the drive, one for the encoded music that it will play, and one for your files, that it will not.  To recapitulate: it is My computer. My mp3 player. My music. I find it odd that Sony thinks I will pay them money so they can POLICE my own computer. Nuh-huh. Not me. I guess I'll just have to put up with a clunkier interface of Archos, Iriver, or I don't know, Lexar, that at least give me the FREEDOM to do what I want with my own stuff.

<Title>Great digital player, FM tuner. Can't see display in sun.
<Date>Mon Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First for the good.  This player has great sound, both from the digital player and from the FM tuner.  Good FM reception well outside major cities.  The bass and treble can be adjusted for the digital but not for FM.  Music is clear from low to high volumes.  Battery life is very long.  For those who listen to FM only, Sony claims 22 hours.  Digital using Atrac is 50 hours.  My informal tests showed these numbers to be true.  Once the controls are learned (and it's a quick study), the unit is very easy to use.  Charging times are very fast.  The SonicStage software is OK.  It did everything I wanted and a little more than I expected so I have no complaints.  On to the bad.  The headphones Sony supplies are terrible.  For a $200 player, they should include something better.  I am currently using Sony headphones MDR-A34.  I paid $17 and the sound is great.  The OLED is absolutely NOT visible in sunny conditions, no matter how I turn and twist the unit.  It looks great in normal and low light conditions.  It's not a show stopper since I hardly need to look at the unit to switch songs, radio stations and the volume.  It would be nice if the unit could play while plugged in and charging.  I use it at work where I can't copy music files to the local computer but I can use the USB as a power source and external speakers instead of the headphones.  In conclusion, if Sony would include better headphones and find a way to make the OLED visible in sunlight and allow playback while plugged in, this unit would be 5++ easy.

<Content>This is a great player, supurb sound, great FM reception.  I used mine for running and after running with it two times, the shiny metal coating over the OLED display wore off.  It's still readable, but looks crappy.  I have no idea how it happened.  I'm wondering if the salt from my fingers wore it off as I turned the knob.  I'll be returning it to Sony for a replacement.  Disappointed with the quality though, so 3 stars.  Update:  What happened is when I pressed the display button, the salty sweat from my fingers got into the player causing the screen to be coated with a salty substance.  So, word of warning:  Do not operate controls with wet hands.

<Date>Mon Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I waited forever for this DAP to be released here in the US. I finally got it with a $150 gift card and sony card bonus points... so I paid a whopping $12.57 for it. If I did not get it so cheap, I would probably take it back... but this is a conditional statement...  One of the things I like about the player is the ability to display foreign languages. One of which happens to be Korean, although I have not found an official list of supported languages.  If all of my MP3s were in English, I think I would give this player 5 stars... even with the minor headache of using SonicStage... but the big problem I have with SonicStage is that it does not support Korean, even though the player does... so how do I go around this problem? I have to rename all my files to English, keeping the ID tags in Korean... this is more than what I really hoped to do... I am used to iRiver drag and drop from Win Explorer...  The only other drawback is the display that is said to be visible in any lighting? If you are outside on a sunny day... you can FAINTLY see the display...

<Title>Functionality Superior to the iPod Shuffle, But Has Issues
<Date>Thu Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought one of these on vacation as a replacememnt for my iPod Shuffle which I had forgotten at home. Head-to-head from a functionality point the Sony wins hands-down. Hard to beat a 50-hour battery and the fact that you can actually see and navigate your playlist on the readout: an obvious and frustrating drawback on the Shuffle that Apple oddly markets as some kind of virtue.  Now the drawbacks. I used mine for running. After a mere 3 days the salt from my hands caused some real wear to the finish. Can't imagine what it will look like a month hence. Unacceptable. Also, Apple does a slick job in itegrating the iPod with the Mac.  Getting songs onto the Sony is a cumbersome and frustrating process. It's also about twice the price of a Shuffle.  So which would I choose if going in cold? I'd go with the Sony. Love the long battery life and the readout. And I'm sure I could get use to the crummy Sony software if I weren't spolied by the Apple iTunes interface.

The software is a pain in the ass!!! even though the package states it recognizes WMA, WAV, MP3, etc... it actually only works with sony's ATRAC3. the software converts all other files to this form, which seems to take forever. I had a iriver before this one and as soon as i get back from my trip I'll be selling this sony on ebay and finding a iriver, used if thats all i can find. sony can kiss my arse!!

<Content>I am very happy with the player, it is super in terms of sound and battery life however there are some serious design issues. The LCD portion has shown some damage (I am guessing due to my body heat- holding it in my palms, putting it in pocket close to my body etc.) the inside looks melted!!. It hasn't affected the performance in any way, but the disfiguration decreases its aesthetic value. The disfiguration actually hasn't even stopped yet- it seems to get worse! Also, this is VERY stupid, but the display is useless under bright daylight condition. SONY needs to re-design! I expected better from 'em. Buyers beware!

<Title>AWESOME!!!!
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After reading reviews I was little concerned about sonic stage software, it was a total non-issue for me.  I have purchased music from 5 major sights and ripped music from personal collection and there was NO ISSUE.  Others who encounter sonic stage issues may be trying to interchange formats and/or have other sources of music formats.  Take the time to load and learn software as it works very well and is rather painless, as you can really organize your music.   Software will install operation manual on your computer, take the time to read them as paper copy does not cover a lot of features.  GOOD FEATURES 1) 1GB - NOT 1.5GB+ when you use sonic stage software and still great sound quality. 2)Display - COOL with lots of choices ex: date, time, artist,song etc which you set. 3)Battery Life/Charging- WOW, no one beats about 50 hours per 45 min charge.(3min charge = 2hours) 4) FM radio - included, good sound with 30 present channels, no extra cost. 5)Sound Mode- 3 settings 1 factory, 2 personal sets(you set bass and treble from 0 to 3) limited but yet adds greatly to sound quaility better sound that most MP3's. 6) Volume - 2 volume control setting A)manual volume increases/decreases by 1 step intervals B)Preset volume which has low, med, and high sets(which can be changed)so volume up/down buttons jumps between 3 quick steps when using this feature. 7) AVLS-  limits volume (helps police my love for loud tunes) 8)Repeat Mode - 3 repeat modes(They are a little trickly to figure out but convenient depending on personal styles) 9) Hold - holds settings at current state so bumping of buttons does not change during play or off. 10) Shuffle - mixes it up -great.  Organize + organize + organize = sweet! Take time to organize your music on sonic stage software before transfering to E507.  The software automatically organizes by artist-album-song.   I created playlist folders with song groupings on the software and then transfered my playlist folders, well worth the effort.    The controls allow you to jump between folders in one setting and then in another setting you jump between individual songs within that folder. (Your folders will either be by Artist or playlist depending on your organization choices.)  The controls can be operated with one hand, tricky to learn but work very well. BEWARE OF SWEAT/SALTY HANDS AS CAN DAMAGE DISPLAY AS PER OTHER REVIEWS, THANKS FOR ADVICE.  POOR FEATURES 1) Ear buds - not great but already have good earphones, worth investment, for sound quality. 2) Clip - could have been better but really a non-issue, pockets work. 3) Surface can get scratched but other reviews helped avoid, THANKS, again. 4) DISPLAY + SUN = HARD TO SEE!  use hand to shade display, that works for me  E507 takes a little bit of time and effort to organize, set and learn the controls but well worth the effort, your effort or lack of effort will help to determine your view of the E507, all of these features working together create great harmony...( I know BOO HISS, just throw the eggs at next guy's review)  This is prefect for exercise and taking your music on the go.  Lives up to my expectations after all what else is expected for $100 USA without having to buy extras. And it rates pretty high on COOL scale for looks and display screen, sure beats a flat checkbook style with boring black font....

<Title>Good for old people
<Date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>To address the most talked about topics:  The software SonicStage 3.4 (which you need to download from the web the box comes with version 3.0) is easy to use and does a great job of "ripping" CDs into ATRACS3plus files which are then easy to copy to the player. Sometimes SonicStage doesn't recognize that I put a new CD into my computer's CD tray until after I exit the software and restart it. Mildly annoying.  This is my first digital music player and I didn't have any MP3 files on my computer so converting the MP3s do ATRACS3plus format wasn't an issue for me. Maybe this is player is a bad choice if you have a big collection of MP3s, but it's a good choice if all your music is on CD.  I tried to compare the 64kbps ATRACS3plus file on the player to a CD straight out of a CD player (using the same headphones) and I couldn't tell the difference. That doesn't mean there isn't a difference, it probably just means that I'm not good at discriminating how bad the 64kpbs files are--nevertheless it seems to work for me.  I estimate that this will hold about 40 CDs worth of music at 64kbps quality. And you can keep a lot more CDs worth of music on your computer hard drive and use SonicStage to swap them out--this is a relatively quick and painless process.  The display is legible outside during the day, but it looks like it will get scratched easily.  Recommended for old people like me. If you're a kid and you mostly download MP3s from the internet, you probably want something else.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own this MP3 player and it's great.  I'm unintentionally very rough on it. I have it clipped to me (it comes with a clip) 5-6 days a week during at least 50 minutes of very rigorous cardio (stairmaster & crosstrainer), 40 minutes of abs and 40 minutes of free weights.  It still looks, sounds and functions like new. I also have it on 5 days a week during 50 minute traffic trips to and from work where it's basically in my hand the whole time and I change tracks a lot.  (functions even when sweat on, doesn't melt in hand)  My brother's cat accidentally knocked it off the counter onto a brick kitchen floor from about 4 feet high... not a scratch and still works as it did when new.  (shock resistant)  And it stays in my car all day in a black gym bag that's open to sunlight all day  (heat resistent)  The track loading software is very easy... I'm as far from being technical as can be and I figured it out so anyone can. Very fast loader. (fool proof)  The 50 hr+ battery life is no joke.  Go back to my first paragraph to see how much I use this thing.  With that, I've never ran out of battery life and I rarely charge it. Also, this thing recharges at a rate of 3 hrs per minute so 17 minutes (if not less) charges the entire battery. It charges while plugged into your computer so you can load tracks or rearrange your songs while its charging. (VERY long battery life and VERY fast recharger)  I do have one complaint though but it doesn't affect functionability. The complaint is that sweat gets inside the LED case. It has absolutely no effect on the play or display, its just annoying. You'll get over this problem really fast though, it bothered me for like 10 minutes, that's it.  I've had this player since February and I've used it this way the entire time. It's totally worth buying and I guarantee you'll be very happy with it.  Sound quality is Sony/excellent.

<Content>Hardware great. Software a nighmare. Just google for "SonicStage" and you will see Sony fails to get this right.  What drove me to write this? Downloaded half a gig of Podcasts. No amount of helpfiles or Googling can let me work out how to use Podcasts via SonicStage. SS seems determined that it must be an album and to look it up online and being a PodCast it can not. In the end I gave up and the device has half the value now since it appears not to support Podcasts.

<Title>Trust all of the reviews regarding terrible software...
<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Believe me, I had an iaudio before but I thought the Sony HD3 was nicer looking, so I purchased it for 300 dollars.  The software was SUCH a hassle, I ended up giving it to my boyfriend and purchasing another iaudio.  In terms of software this was the worst.  I consider myself technologically savvy, but this was the worst.  It took me 3 days (with the computer on day and night) to upload 5,000 songs into the player where in my iaudio it took me less than 10 MINUTES.  And once you transfer all your music it doesn't allow you to transfer the songs to a new computer (I gave away my old - but still relatively new flat screen computer and found out I could not transfer songs from the device to my new one).  Horrible service as well.  Website very inconsistent and software crashes ALL the time.  Don't say you weren't warned.  Not worth it, no matter how sleek the player looks (and it is beautiful to watch and to hold).  There is nothing worse.  For an entire week I couldn't download sonicstage, and I was following all of the directions.  Please, stay away, far far away.  They should really be ashamed of themselves for releasing such horrible software.

<Title>Sony should be ashamed
<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Beautiful manufacturing, stone-age software. It looks and feels gorgeous, intuitive controls, everything you would expect from a sony, until you try to put music on it. Choose between very limited and mind-crushingly slow drag and drop functionality using "MP3 File Manager" software or lose the four or five years work that you've put into organizing your music library by using "Sonix" software. I've got a collection of over 1,500 albums. This Sony won't be playing them. I want to listen to music, not sit in front of my computer growing old waiting for this thing to download files. I'll be buying an ipod and handing over the sony to my worst enemy. Sony you should be ashamed.  UPDATE: Aug 9, 2006.  Sony should still be ashamed, but for you poor souls that actually own this thing, I recommend using google to find a piece of Sony software called Vaio Music Transfer. It's a small program that allows you to avoid the abysmal Sonix software (although you still have to install the Sonix core on your computer for this to work) and allows drag and drop addition of files at a slightly faster rate than the MP3 File Manager.  Oh, and as for my comment on getting an Ipod, scratch that. They have too many battery issues. Get yourselves an IRiver CXW-2G. You'll be a happy camper.

<Content>I bought this product with the intention that I would be able to jog and listen to music.  Especially since sony claims it has a one hand toggle system for joggers.  The overall product isn't bad, but the headphones are totally pathetic.  There is no possible way one could job long distances and expect those earbuds to stay in.  If you are planning to use this for any kind of exercise I would look elsewhere.

<Title>Great player horrible software
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Sony NW-E507 is an awesome MP3 player.  With its sleek, compact design and 50 hour battery life, the E507 is an MP3 player with a fighting chance against Apple.  Enter Sonicstage.  Sonicstage is the software that comes with the player that is sony's failure.  The software is one of the very few ways to transfer files in the ATRAC format, which is recognized by the player.  In order to use the player you must "authenticate" the player on the internet for each computer you use.  Music files from another coumpter may not be transfered if files from another computer is present.  The good news is that sony has an alternative program on their site now that removes these oppressive restrictions.  In light of this development I give this product 4 stars.  It is a solid player now.

Most of the MP3 file in my computer cannot be played by this device. I always got a "Cannot Play" message. The menu is not that friendly too.....

<Title>A Competent Sony Product
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>"Reviews" are meant to "review" the product. It's not a place to advertise another product.   I feel there's a need to introduce myself before I review this product. The readers can then get a glimpse on what type of Digital Audio user I am, before they consider my opinion. This is the first D.A. (IE: Digital Audio) gadget I have bought. I like my gadgets to be separated (IE: Phones should only call or text, Digital Camera's should only take pictures, D.A. should only play music). I like any product that does what it says it'll do and do it for a long time. Quality over quantity. Originality is also a plus.  I bought my Sony NW-E507 at a local computer store and have had the pleasure of using it for the past week. The product came with the D.A. device, ear buds, extension to the ear buds, USB connector, small black drawstring pouch, belt clip, and software/instructions/papers and such.   I was extremely excited to open the box. The first thing I managed to pull out were the ear buds, which at first sight made me say "what the hec", and I also remember laughing. The ear buds were strangely irregular. The left ear bud is about one feet shorter than the other. I suppose it was made with the intention of your D.A. device always being on the left side of your body. I didn't care so much about the ear buds. They're always replaceable, and I didn't buy the product for the ear buds (so I saw them as a bonus, even if it does look strange). I will warn all image conscious consumers that the ear buds may compromise your look. However, if you have long hair you may be able to cover it up. I'm not a fan of ear buds in general because they hurt my ears.   The ear bud extensions came out next, and it's a little longer than one feet. It's a good extension that'll work with any headphones/ear buds. I managed to pull out the D.A. device which is the sexiest shaped gadget I have seen. It looks alien, plus it's very shiny. Recharging the Sony NW-E507 was a joy to watch, and the O-LED is extremely bright in a dim room (even brighter in a dark room).   The Sonic Stage software wasn't so difficult to deal with, at least not the way other people have described it to be. I think the problem maybe that a lot of users are not flexible (or comfortable) with using new software. I will say this, Sony products assume that a lot of their consumers are competent to some level and are capable of using different software. If you're unfamiliar with using broad ranges of software and have absolutely no patience, this may be a minor (or major) hurdle for you to cross. Once you're comfortable with using Sonic Stage it shouldn't be a problem. There are also updates on Sony's websites where they allow the "drag and drop" feature that a lot of D.A. users adore, so the Sonic Stage fiasco can be averted. The software for the Sony NW-E507 should no longer be a factor to consider when buying this product.   The device itself is very easy to control. The O-LED light in the morning is a bit washed out to see, but I still manage to see it. If you angle the device there's no doubt that the screen is readable. However, I've never tried viewing it in direct sunlight so I'm not sure what the implications of that may be. It comes with a black drawstring pouch which you can always use to shield it from the sun. Rarely do I take the device out to pick a specific song. I usually have it in the pouch hanging off my belt loop while I walk around campus.   The main reason of my purchasing the Sony NW-E507 is for the battery life. After the charge, I managed to use the device for around 15 or so hours and it only consumed one-third of the battery panel. The battery life has unbelievable stamina. Some consumers are concerned about the battery being "built in", which leads me to comment that on the bottom of the device where the port for recharging (and song loading) lies there are two screws. The battery is replaceable, though I'm not sure if you should do that on your own. It's probably best to send it in to Sony to replace if you have no clue what you're doing.   The sound quality is great, and the volume is able to reach high levels. Since the Sony NW-E507 is a flash based D.A. device, your songs will never skip because there are no moving parts. I tested this out by shaking the device to an extreme degree, and it didn't skip a beat. I find myself listening to the fm radio ALOT. The radio does become a bit fuzzy at certain spots and I'm not sure if jogging or running may cause it to be fuzzier.  The surface of the device does seem to scratch rather easily. After a weeks use of mainly having it in the carrying pouch, I've managed to find very light surface scratches (nothing deep). I'm also afraid to touch the device with oily or greasy hands. If there was one thing I could ask to improve on the next model of the Sony NW-E507 it would be a more resistant surface.   I've heard that some devices can still play music while they load, but since this is my first D.A. gadget I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or a good thing. I only load music from my own computer, and while I'm loading music into the Sony NW-E507 I can always listen to the same songs on my computer. It may be a problem if you're using a different computer that does not have your music collection? There are still ways to go around that if you try. It's not something that I would consider to be a problem.   All in all I really love this product. It's something that will last for years (if you take good care of it). I enjoy and appreciate its company. It does what it says it'll do (play music) and it does it well and it does it long (battery life). While I walk through a campus located in the middle of a city, I could not thank Sony enough for creating a device that manages to drown out the annoying cell phone users whose conversations can be heard a mile away. Sony, you are my hero.

<Content>Sony sure makes some nice products, and this is one of them, it can compress the music files smaller than mp3, using their atrac system, with very nice results and fits just about 700 songs on 1 gig capacity, with FM tuner and nice display, if You can get over the fact that You have to "register" your PC with Sony so You can transfer files to it, and they let You register 5 PCs, my PC crashed one time and when I opened the program again, I was informed that it was the second PC that I have registered, I had 3 more to go, it was the same PC!, I guess Sony is very protective of their music and products, but this drives people buy other brands.

<Title>Great buy - software problems resolved
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I first saw this product, online at the (...) website, I was impressed by its compact, sleek design - especially that the screen cannot be seen unless it is displaying the track - and many features. As well as an mp3 player and FM radio, it can be used as a memory stick. The device fulfilled my expectations fairly well. The controls may not be intuitive at first, but after using the device for a few minutes I was able to get the hang of them. Using the NW-E507 as a memory stick is slightly inconvienient because of the long USB cable, but that's not its main function anyway. I am very happy with the device.  However, as many people have mentioned, you must use the Sony SonicStage program to transfer files to it. The SonicStage program is not the best program, but I have seen worse. My main beef with it is that it tries to do too much; if all it was was a utility to transfer songs, I would be fine with it. But no: it's a big program that takes a few seconds to start up and doesn't always do what I want it to do. Also, when I made a playlist to put onto my NW-E507 and transferred it, it transferred all the songs along with it, all of which were already on the player. Most likely, I was just doing something wrong, though. I don't mind the software too much. I'm just glad I don't have to play my music with it. The other slightly annoying factor is the long USB cord that comes with the player. I always have to have it coiled up on my desk when transferring songs. I suppose I could go out and buy another one, but I'm too lazy. Anyway, I am overemphasizing the things that annoy me a little, and not writing about the good stuff. It has great sound quality (no thanks to the Sony earphones), and once I get the songs on it, they are easy to find, and they will stay well-organized if I make them that way on SonicStage - not the easiest thing to do. I have just downloaded an update that I hope will allow me to transfer music directly to the NW-E507, and ... AHA! Yes, it does! So never mind all you people worried about the software. You still need to use it to change the names and stuff, but I hope the "MP3 File Manager" makes my life a little easier. (...)  Anyway, so far I have a very good impression of it. Though it may not hold as much as an Ipod, I would much rather have the NW-E507 than an Ipod.

The conversion programs are easy to use so you can use all the space available in the walkman. For me the only downside is the SonicStage jukebox version included since it is too basic.
