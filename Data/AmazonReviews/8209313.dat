<Title>Its good but its not amazing.
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I bought this for my self thinking that I was gonna have an amazing mp3 player since it was made by philips which is amazing in technology. I lean to them as my favorite company any ways to the mp3 player. I got the mp3  player and i put a song on it and decided to listen to it seeing how clear  the sound was it was kind of clear but not totally. So i thought ok not bad  but then i decided to take a run with it and i could barely hear anything  except for the on coming traffic it wasnt loud enough and sometimes it  would skip not very much but some times. I could only store about 8 songs  cause most of my songs were 5 mega bytes so i was mad about that.

<Title>Underwhelming
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This player looks more impressive on the box than in my hands. It's bigger than I had thought, and feels kind of cheap.<p>The LCD is not backlit, the maximum volume level is pitifully low, the interface is confusing (explain  what &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; buttons mean), and the software  that ships with it (the freely-downloadable version of Real Jukebox) is  minimal.

<Title>Music lovers or just plain lovers?
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>When I first saw the Philips SA101 Rush 32MB MP3 Player, i was spellbounded - what an incredible bit of beauty!! Almost a year after it's release, it's bright LCD screen and that sophisticated charm about the object remains - even though it's little 32MB chip is out-of-date compared to the new 6 - 10 GB chips now available in the market. <p>Don't buy it if...<p>----&gt; you're not the music lover whose going to take it to a space journey using the full 6 GB available in one of the new ones (the battery will prob. run out much before the space, mate!)<p>Buy it if: ----&gt; you're that simple person, not looking for a complete music industry in your pocket, but a little device to play you your fave 8 - 9 songs while you walk the dog....<p>Overall - this cheap gadget attracts attention, and gives a good performance to the average listener ... remember, it's not what's insides that counts - it's the outside....

<Title>overal quality
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This mp3 player has good music quality, organization, and a nice heavy duty case.  It suits my needs perfectly, not something that you will put all your music on, just your favorite songs.  The bookmark function also is quite nice, especially since i like some parts of songs better then others.  My ONLY complaint about this mp3 player is the lack of bass, and no bass boost.  Overal this is an excellent product and I highly recommend it like all other philips products.

<Title>INCompatibility, INCompatibility, INCompatibility, IN.....
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>NOT compatible with Windows NT or 2000.<p>NOT compatible with standard SmartMedia File Systems (so you can't swap cards with someone or download using diskette or pcmcia adapter for SmartMedia).<p>NOT compatible with newest version of RealAudio and the old one provided has some big bugs.  Like dropping laboriously typed titles for home-made mixes.  Like not being able to print play lists.  Like hanging on attempts to delete songs from Rush.<p>NOT compatible with internal rechargeable batteries - and it chews its 2 AAA up in 1.5 hours or less!<p>NOT compatible with jogging since the &quot;case&quot; is a keyring and it bruises your body parts if you let it bounce in a lower pocket - or flies out of a shirt pocket - it needs a good sports case.<p>NOT compatible with usefulness.  No ability to restart from beginning.  No retainer on USB data port cap.  Can't read mode status due to 1 mm characters.  Must always use &quot;hold&quot; slider as buttons are sensitive and you burn out your AAA even faster while it plays on the shelf.<p>(Philips user support site does NOT reply to requests for help or info such as &quot;when can we expect windows 2000 drivers?&quot;.  This review is of the new 64MB Rush.)

<Title>What's the fuss?
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>So, most of the people complain about it not being compatible with Win2000? Rest assures that this no longer is valid! I upgraded to Real Jukebox 2 since the one supplied with the CD didn't work under Win ME and Win2000. Although strongly advised not to upgrade, I went ahead and upgraded to JukeBox2. I downloaded a couple of songs onto the player and test listened to them, and it worked! Win2000 doesn't recognize the USB device (the Rush), but if you supply the CD that came with the Philips Rush it will take the driver found on the CD. The Philips rush is a pretty neat MP3 player, small enough to put it into your coat pocket (the advantage over MP3CDPlayers) and has enough storage for 1 hour of near CD quality music (enough for the trip to work and back home). However it does support the RealAudio formats, hence possessing longer playback times when listening to news and similar. I agree that the power consumption of the Rush is horrible! If you decide you want this device, then BUY RECHARGABLES (best Li-Ion). Those should keep the power expenses at their minimum (my previous RIO300 had a similar problem). NOTE: The Rush doesn't recharge the batteries although an adapter is included in the package! You will have to use external recharging devices! The supplied carrying bag looks nice, but shouldn't be used (it easily opens when jumping around). Otherwise I am happy with the RUSH, it's running smoothly and happily under Windows2000, Windows ME and Windows98 (I tested it under all three operating environments).

<Title>Broke after a week...
<Date>Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I was really happy with my Philips Rush MP3 player. It came with a lot of cool accessories (car adapter, belt clip, power adapter) and was small enough to fit in my pocket during trips to the gym. It also came with great software (Real Jukebox 7). However, after a couple days of use, the Previous and Next buttons on the Philips Rush did not want to work all the time.  I had to press the buttons very hard to move to the next or previous song. After about a week, my Philips Rush decided it didn't want to turn on at all! I even tried different powersources, but to no avail, it stayed off. I took it back to the store for a full refund and am now on the hunt for a new MP3 player.

<Content>Guess what, I bought a Phillips Rush 64MB MP3 player, double the price of the above one and absolutely no use at all!!!! I am in situation where I can't use it or throw it.<p>That's really a cute little piece which attracted me, but I can't transfer files from my hard disk to the device. Called up the customer service, they never ever got such an error...!!! Now what???<p>And more over it doesn't work in Windows NT or 2000, only with 98. So give a second thought on this item.

<Title>No Windows 2000 support,
<Date>Tue Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Do not buy a Philips Rush. The software only supports Windows 98. It does not support Windows 2000 or Mac. Think you'll just use a SmartMedia card reader like SanDisk ImageMate to transfer MP3 files? Think again, the Rush will not play normal &quot;unsecure&quot; MP3 files, they have to be encrypted with the RealJukeBox software. The Rush also does not support Windows Media Audio, the firmware is not upgradable, and it is expensive..

<Title>Philips SA 107 Rush 64 MB is good
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I've heard bad things about the SA101 32 MB Rush, but I've got to say that the SA107 64 MB Rush is really good.  I've had mine for awhile and it hasn't failed me yet.  64 MB isn't a whole lot of memory, so spending extra cash on more flash cards sucks.  But the SA107 is easy to use and holds a decent amount of songs, plus its light and small.  The MP3 players that hold 6 GB are too heavy to run with.  It doesn't skip, it works well, songs get transferred fast and sound good.  I like it.  For my money, I would go with the Philips Rush SA107 64 MB MP3, its definitely worth it.

<Title>Beauty IS only skin deep...
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Sure it's cool looking, but as soon as you start trying to use this [product], you discover that you'd have been better off with something less glitzy.  It doesn't work with Windows 2000 (a MAJOR mistake on Philips' part, seeing as how Win 9x is soon going the way of the dodo), the case is another example of pretty but function-imparied, it uses a miserably slow parallel interface, it plays only MP3s (no WMA support), the format it uses for its SmartMedia cards is proprietary, and it uses Real's misbegotten RealJukebox software.<p>If you're looking for a high-quality, flexible, functional digital music player, do yourself a favour:  KEEP LOOKING.

<Title>A decent player at a decent price
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this mp3 player anticipating some technical problems involving windows 2000.  Although I updated my real player software and went through all the motions, the program could not find the device.  One review claimed no problems.  Perhaps he/she was running 2000 professional instead of server, and used a usb line instead of a parallel.  Whatever the case, I had a win98 machine and everything worked smoothly.  The sound quality was decent and I haven't had any problems.  Overall it's a nice little player and isn't bulky like a cd player or walkman.  With the 32 mb smart media card you get nearly an albums worth of material.

<Title>Philips SA 101 64Mb MP3 player
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Philips SA101  64Mb is an attractive and lightweight MP3 player. It comes with a neat carrying case which can be clipped over your trouser belt.   A triumpth of style over substance. Never buy this; here are the reasons.  1) Has download problems even with win 95.  2) Is not future proofed ie cannot run in windows 2000  3)  The smartmedia card is propriety formatted. i.e cannot be used in another none philips device or swapped between MP3 players unlike other players.  4) Download rate is abysmally low.  5) High  battery consumption .Lasts no longer than 4 hours. Uses battery energy even when downloading. Does not have built in battery charger. Current consumption is 300ma - very high for a Solid state portable device.    6) The sound level is not high enough.   7) No protection for the glass fronted LCD display- could easily     be smashed.  8) Costly. Expensive compared to other MP3 players. Should at least have built-in recharge circuitry for this money.   9) Sound quality only average.Not compatable with Windows media player  10) Philips do not respond to tech support enquiries.Your on tour own if you have problems.<p> Summary <p>The Philips SA 101 is a poorly engineered MP3 Player with   software and hardware compatibity issues. The sound quality is only average.

<Title>No software problems
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought a Philips RUSH SA107, and I was worried because of the reviews on how terrible the software was. Here's my experience.<br>* Software does not work under Windows 2000?: It works perfectly. After installing Real Jukebox 1, just remember to install the patch for Windows 98 (also comes with the CD, works with Windows 2000 as well). Then Real Jukebox 1 can recognize RUSH. I did it on both Windows 2000 Server and Professional. The only reason I upgrade to Real Jukebox 2 (even though they recommend against it) is that it allows me to modify song details (title, artist ...)<br>* Can load 96kbps songs and lower only?: It's true that you can't encode MP3 more than 96kbps with Real Jukebox, unless you get their free add-in. However, even though I don't have that add-in (Real update server ...[stinks]!!), I can load 128kbps songs and higher to RUSH smoothly. The solution: encode your songs with other softwares (plenty of them) and use Real to load them to RUSH. With 128kbs, the sound is perfectly clear to my experience.<br>So, the software problems can be solved if you try.

<Title>Does work with NT, 2000, *AND* WinXP!
<Date>Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This nifty little gadget is great.  Contrary to what everyone has been saying, it does work in all Microsoft OSs, with USB!<p>tips to install w/ USB : first, plug in the device.  Windows will tell you its found a new device and ask you for the drivers.  Tell it to look on the CD and it should install fine.  If you have Win2000 or WinXP, it will tell you the driver isn't signed.  It works fine, so tell it to use it and continue.<p>Next, install Real Jukebox using the CD.  After thats finished, install the Win98 patch, which should really say USB patch!  It's not just for Windows 98.<p>Now, everything should be fine!  However, if you have Windows 95, you'll need to make sure you have the Windows 95 USB Supplement installed or you won't be able to use any USB devices, even your Rush!<p>I love this little critter.  As soon as I figured out the interface, it made perfect sense.  Yes/No buttons to answer yes/no questions like Delete? or Erase Card?.  No acts as a pause/off button, while yes is the on/play button.<p>Great device; I'd buy it again!  Got mine ...

<Title>Too Bad
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I purchased my Rush SA107 30 days ago. The unit comes with all the accessories that you would need, however, they are to no avail when the main unit doesn't work. This is my second unit. The first one had a bad connection for the audio output. The unit I currently have also has a bad audio output jack but I learned to live with that. <br>The unit keeps shutting off after a minute or two. I just got off the phone with Rush support and it appears this one is defective. I will soon be on my third unit.<br>I bought mine at a discounted price($...) instead of $.... Had I spent the full reatil price I really would be sick.<br>My advice is to keep looking, don't stop with this unit. It is a slick unit and would be great if it worked as it was supposed to unfortunately, this isn't the case.

<Title>NO software problems with RealONE !
<Date>Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>RealONE player is the new version from Real, replacing older versions of Real-Jukebox and Real-Player.  It is much, much better than the older versions.  However if you install it using the method documented, your Rush player will not work (you may or may not be warned, depending if you are upgrading from Real Jukebox 1 (warning given - not supported), or from Real Jukebox-plus 2 (no warning).<p>The solution is to copy the previously working file pdphilip.dll from C:\Program Files\Real\RealJukebox\plugins to C:\Program Files\Real\RealPlayer\plugins.  Then open RealONE, and click Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Devices -&gt; Philips Rush (Disabled) -&gt; Enable Device?<p>Note that:<br>a. above file locations are for Windows 2000 using default locations - other OS may differ slightly.<br>b. If you have not upgraded yet, save a copy of pdphilip.dll from C:\Program Files\Real\RealJukebox\plugins before upgrading - the upgrade may delete it!<br>c. If you have upgraded, and pdphilip.dll was deleted, re-install RealJukebox1 from your Rush CD, then remember to install the &quot;Windows 98&quot; Plug-in patch (as others above point out, it is needed for all OS if you use USB!), make a copy of pdphilip.dll, then install RealONE, copy pdphilip.dll as above ....<p>You may get away with just installing the &quot;Windows 98&quot; Plug-in patch - I did above before thinking of trying that?<p>I actually have a RUSH SA126 but expect the same applies to SA101 SA107 SA125 and SA126 - they appear to only differ in memory card size, or type of mains adaptor &amp;/or documentation delivered with them in the box.<p>Does anyone know why Philips don't put a definitive statement on their site (I've emailed them several times, but never got other than an auto acknowledge email back), and work with Real to get the RUSH driver indexed from the Real &quot;Devices&quot; support pages.<p>The Philips RUSH rates:<br> 5 stars for hardware,<br> 5 stars for performance,<br> 4 stars for Software BUT <br> ZERO for software installation instructions and<br> ZERO for manufacturers software support<br>Overall 5 stars only for those who are willing to work it out for themselves.
