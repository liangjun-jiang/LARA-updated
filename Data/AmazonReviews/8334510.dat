<Title>All Around Great Product
<Date>Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This MP3 player is a steal for the price! For once, the earphones are excellent!! The quality of the sound is fantastic, considering that the earphones came with the player. I hear no static when I play my music at high volumes. I suggest getting a memory card to boost the player to more than 64mb, because longer songs fill the player to capacity very quickly. The LCD screen is very clear, and the buttons are very nicely laid out. Most importantly, the player's MP3 software was a breeze to load onto my computer. My player was up and running in 2 minutes or less. I definitely suggest this player to anyone wants to get the most for their money.

<Title>Buy something else....
<Date>Sat Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My fiance got this MP3 player for Christmas. The buttons are not in a user-friendly layout and it's not easy to find the button you need. There is no carrying case or strap to make it easy to carry around...it [isnt good] if you want to use it to work out. Downloading music to it is not easy at all, especially for computer novices...and the worst thing, is that one day, it just stopped working completely...and we can't figure out how to fix it. I would recommend the [something else]...

<Title>great starter player...beware of support
<Date>Wed Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>First of all let me tell you that, though the controls are a bit hard to get used to, the player is great for the price. Unless you are wanting a do-everything player, this one is great. With an additional card you can hold a couple of hours of music. It's perfect for the train/bus commute, or for walking around town. And the record mode is great if you are wanting to catch thoughts on the fly. (well, it's a little difficult to navigate to the control, but it works out in the end.)<p>For anyone having problems, I'm sure it starts from the nowevolution.com website. (the "maker" of the device.) I actually downloaded a firmware update on their site which they consequently took down from the website after I called requesting customer support! I got a run-around which included them telling me to return my product! It's brand new and it worked until I installed the update!<p>...which is the manual for the same product under a different name. (found after much research) So if you are trying to update the firmware, you have to hold down the play button for 5 seconds...etc.<p>But let me tell you, my exhaustive research was well worth it! Now my player is working again, and I'm glad that I sent so many angry emails to get to the bottom of it.<p>So yeah, it's nice. Get one. It's ...seems to be pretty sturdy. One more thing, htough, if the battery seems to not fit exactly, just hold it in and slide the cover over it and it'll be ok. ;)

<Title>MTV Now Evolution 64MB MP3 - Pump it up!
<Date>Wed Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I must say how impressed I am with this little jewel. At first I thought it might be cheesy, being how it had the MTV logo on it & it retails for such a low price...but I was wrong. I know of no other unit that has what it does for the price.<p>Many other similar ones only had 32MB, and had no ID tag display for the songs. This has a decent, albeit a little slow, ID tag line. The display is condensed, but gives you the total & elapsed play time for the song. The EQ is pretty typical, having 5 settings. The volume cranks nicely for a unit this small (2.75 x 2.25 x .75 inches). <p>It remains to be seen how long the battery (one AA) lasts, given that it does produce good volume.  It does have a small battery indicator. UPDATE: BATTERY LASTS ABOUT 12 HOURS & LOW BATT INDICATOR WORKS WELL. It appears to be well made, and I've had little problem operating the controls once learned. The ear buds seem to be of really nice quality & sound great. UPDATE:  I'VE DROPPED IT SEVERAL TIMES NOW ON THE TREADMILL WHILE RUNNING - & IT GOES FLYING OFF.  ALTHOUGH BATTERY MIGHT POP OUT, IT STILL WORKS GREAT!<p>It has a fully expandable memory as well, which will then hold over 2 hours of music. Oh, almost forgot the sound quality - very nice! I was hearing things in songs I actually had never heard before.<p>Now for the downside - the CD failed to load. My XP system wouldn't recognise the unit. I had read by another user somewhere, that a patch was needed at the Now Evolution website. You have to go in & download this zipped file. Once you do that, and reboot, it will recognise the new USB hardware (USB cable included). After that, it's just a matter of drag/drop the MP3 files - it sees it as another drive. The user manual comes in MS Word with the patch download. The only other downside is it has a place for a lanyard, but doesn't come with one.<p>Overall, I'm quite delighted to have found this - thinking that I was going to have to settle on something with less memory & without ID display. ...<p>The company is only a couple years old out of N.C. I hope they do well with their marketing stategy, and actually make some proffit to stay in business making inovations like this. Perhaps the partnership with MTV will make this possible.<p>One last note on MP3 players. There seems to be a lot of stinkers out there. I had another brand that started acting funny right away - weird noise pops & shutting down by itself. A friend had a more expensive one that just quit after several hours. (hopefully this one will be OK) So, keep your receipts, check out the warranty, etc!<p>UPDATE: Had for a week now . Continue to be impressed. Battery life is surprisingly good for the volume output. The factory says the warranty is 6 months, which includes parts & labor. Go find one now!<p>2 WEEK UPDATE:  Still great - see above updates in CAPS.

<Title>Uhhh..........it just DOESN'T WORK!
<Date>Thu Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>At first i liked it because it met my simple needs-a simple mp3 player that played some songs i like so i dont have to burn a bunch of cds. But, it kept having problems from the getgo. When i put my smartmedia card in, it just froze and the only way to turn it on or off, was to take the card and the battery out before trying it again. Also, it can freze at random times too and i have to take the battery out. You also have to hold the on button for literaly 5 seconds! And it only plays mp3, so i have to downloade free softwear to convert wma or wav to mp3. If this unit just worked how its supposed to it would be good for money, but it doesnt. I mean, the features are pretty good for such a cheap mp3 player but is just that-CHEAP! So right now i curently cant get it to turn on at all, so im gunna try and return it.<p>PLEASE LISTEN AND DONT BUY IT. I DIDNT WHEN OTHERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND LOOK WHAT HAPPEND!

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Tue May 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>When I was searching the net for good mp3 players I saw this one. When I saw the price I didn't think that it would be that good. But after ordering and receiving this player I prooved myself wrong. This player is very small and light. It is the only player that I know of that has display for the price. Occasionaly the sound will skip but not often enough to be annoying. The interface is relatively easy to learn and the bouttons are not too small (in my opinion). It has 64MB internal memory and has a SmartMedia Card slot that takes 8,16,32 and 64MB cards. Getting is to work at the start took about 15 minutes to figure out what to do but after it was installed putting music onto the player was as easy as copying and pasting. The computer sees the player as a removable drive. Overall this player is the best you'll find for the price.

<Title>It breaks
<Date>Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I loved this tiny, brilliant machine.  However, the one I bought broke in the first three months.  Radioshack immediately gave me a replacement, but this has stopped turning on, a mere three weeks later.

<Title>Mine broke
<Date>Sun Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>After about 3 months it won't power up, and I haven't even received my rebate yet! I have seen other reviews with this same problem. This player only has a 90 day warranty. Other manufactures offer 12 months. I would not buy this player again.

<Title>For my first ever MP3 Player...
<Date>Sat Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had this mp3 player for about 8 months and it has given me nothing but satisfaction. The size is awesome for taking places and i just wish they made a specialized bag for it. Yeah, your thinking, 64mb isn't that much space. Your right. It will hold around 23 songs. Willing to spend 30 more dollars? Go out and buy a 128mb smart media card. All you have to do is slide it into the player, it's that easy. That's what i did and with that it'll hold about 60 songs. I took off the extra star because on the screen it doesn't show the name of the song very clearly. It'll say something like, if the song is Billie Jean, it will say &quot;/_BILLIE/_&quot;  across the screen. Otherwise this is a great mp3 player and i think you should go out and buy it!
