<Title>BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been waiting for a long time for the flash memory MP3 players to get large in capacity.  I would absolutely recommend this model if you were to get a flash memory player, because it can store up to 2,000 songs in WMA format at 64kbps, that's about 133 CDs.  I also played with this at Best Buy.  I hope I can get this little one during the summer before I go to college.

<Title>Love It!!
<Date>Tue Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Zen Micro for the past (2) years, but the headphone jack died on me.  Looking for an Ipod alternative, my girlfriend and I decided to take a chance on the Z5.  After getting used to using WMP for transfers and figuring out how to navigate the touchpad: We LOVE this product.  Battery life is outstanding, it sounds good, looks great and it feels sturdy (a big problem I have with the Micro and the Nano is the flimsiness). I wish there were a 5 gig version, but I'm getting used to the amount of music I can carry in one shot :)

<Title>Don't be fooled.....
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A few weeks ago, when I was looking for an mp3 player, I came across the Z5 at my local Best Buy.  I was so excited to find an iPod alternative that had all of the capabilities of the nano at around the same price.  In addition, I was amazed, yet slightly suspicious, about its "song capacity".  Both the iPod nano and the Z5 have 4GB of memory, but the Z5 said it held twice as many songs.  I asked the clerk at the store and told me that the Z5 holds 2,000 songs in wma format at 64bpm.  Hel then let me listen to what a song sounds like in 64bpm, then in 128 bpm (what apple uses as a "standard").  I felt a little bit betrayed when the 64 bpm song had horrible quality and sounded like it was being played underwater.  Not CD quality at all.  The battery life though, was amazing, even though i would never go for 35 hours without stopping somewhere where i could recharge. After considering all of my choices for a few days, I went back and bought an iPod nano even though I originally didn't want to.  I realized that even though everybody else in the world has them, they are the clearly the survivors in this mp3 player eat mp3 player world.  They have the most accesories available and Apple is a very respectable company today (my sister has a mac and loves it). Lastly, I realized that being different for the sake of being different wasn't really worth it in this case.

<Title>It is not as good as it looks
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pro: It has a bigger LCD to play photos. It is slim, and well constructed, and looks great.  Cons:  1) For $240 unit, the quality of sound is not impressive.            2) For the unit I own, the battery never runs 30 hours as Samsung claims. It only lasts no more than 8 hours without playing any photos.            3) Recharging battery is a big headache. First of all, you must connect the unit to a computer with Window XP. Sometimes, when I try to connect the unit to my computer, it is not able to get through. My computer does not recognize the unit. I have to restart my computer several times before get the unit connected. Then it takes 4.5 hours to 5 hours to fully recharge the battery. It is ridiculous for a MP3 running less than 8 hours, and then takes 4-5 hours to fully recharge.

<Title>Better than the Nano...
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I agree with most people Pros... -Great battery life -Great sound quality -Very nice design -Made of aluminum (and not some cheap coating that scratches) -Relatively large screen -Dedicated volume control  Cons...  -No on-the-go playlists -Has to charge through computer -Hmmm... Can't think of much else  I would definitely recommend this player. And I'll just give you a tip: Don't listen to the people who say that it has a difficult touchpad. I heard the same thing before I bought mine. When I pulled it out of the box and used it for the first time, the learning curb for the touchpad was about 2 minutes... seriously... I think some people are so used to the ipod that they have a hard time using anything that isn't a clickwheel.

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for my first mp3 player for a trip back east, and I was seriously considering an ipod. I had messed with my friends nano, and I did not like the click wheel. Also, it was too thin, I couldn't get a nice grip on it. I bought this one because it looked about the same, and I liked the volume button on the side. I've read some of the anti-Samsung reviews for this player, and they're stupid. For one, the touchpad works better than the Ipod. Unlike the ipod, if you want to move between A through Z with a lot of artists, you have to keep spinning the wheel. With this, you just hold the touchpad down. The sound quality on this is awesome, but the headphones lack a good amount of bass. The picture quality is about the same compared to the ipod. I like being able to choose a background picture. If you have your own picture, just drag it into the wallpapers folder on the player. It says you need WMP 10 to work, but Winamp, Musicmatch, Real, all those non apple jukeboxes will work with it. I havn't timed the battery life, but it last a very long time. Sometimes a listen to it a night, and I fall asleep, leaving the player on all night, and the battery will still get me through the day. I wish it did come with an AC charger, but guess what, neither do the ipods. The body is thick and sturdy, but it isn't heavy. I just got a case for it because I wanted the beltclip.  Overall, there is really no problem with it and I think it far surpasses the nano. Just get an ac charger (ironically, the ipod charger works the best), some new heaphones (I got the Sony MDR-EX71 earbuds, yes I said earbuds) and a case if you want, and your set to go. You won't be dissapointed

<Title>Great sound quality, steeper learning curve than expected
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 player, so I can't compare the YP-Z5 to the ipod.    The YP-Z5's sound quality was considerably better than I'd expected ... really, the best listening experience I've ever had while using headphones.  Other MP3 players might be even better, but I'm more than satisfied with the YP-Z5.  The learning curve was much steeper than I'd expected for an appliance of this type.  I had to browse the Z5 specific forum at anythingbutipod.com to find tips on reducing battery drain, and sniff around the Windows Media Player help files to avoid uploading tracks with redundant and cross-linked menu listings.  The how-to for creating a mobile playlist also was on anythingbutipod.com -- I don't remember seeing it in the Samsung manual.  And I also learned from the Internet that the YP-Z5 can be operated in UMS mode, rather than strictly through WMP.  Battery life is acceptable, now that I've turned off the backlight and have taken other steps to reduce battery drain.  (None of which were provided by Samsung.)  I also can create a mobile playlist, thanks to an online FAQ.  The touch pad is a bit sensitive, but practice makes perfect here -- the more I use the player, the fewer errors I make.    I upgraded the firmware, and it's possible that the YP-Z5 behaves well specifically because I'm using a latest-greatest firmware version.  But the firmware upgrade is *not* intuitive, and some users have reported problems while trying to upgrade.    The online world doesn't agree on an appropriate charger to use for this device, when a computer isn't available.  I think Samsung could have included a wall charger, or could sell one separately at an other-than-cutthroat price.  Prospective buyers should know that far fewer tailored-for-YP accessories are available than can be purchased for the ipod.    Overall, though, I'm pleased with the purchase -- now that I've put in the study time to learn how to use it.

<Title>SIMPLY THE BEST MP3 PLAYER!
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently received the SAMSUNG 4GB YP-Z5 as a gift and after comparing with others, it has more bang for the buck.  I recommend checking out Sam's Club first.  So far, nothing beats their price.  I thougt of getting the IPOD, but it was too expensive for the same 4GB and looked too fragile for me.  The Z5 is sturdy and more stylish in silver.  The first time I dropped it, my heart skipped a beat, but relieved after it kept playing like normal.  The 4GB is more than I would ever need and anything else would be overkill and simply a waste of money.  Yes, we have to spend that extra money on gas for the car...  It holds up to 1000 songs, which is plenty.  Additionally, I hooked up the Z5 to my speakers at home and I was impressed with the clarity and bass.  Didn't think this compact MP3 player could put out so much sound, but it does...  As far as battery life, nothing comes close.  It goes on and on, just like the energizer bunny.  The last thing I want to worry about is having to keep recharging it.  I tried it out and believe this is a great selling feature.  I'm not too concernced with the hype of IPOD but long lasting quality.  Give the Z5 a try and you'll never go back.  I'm looking for some accessories to go with it now.

<Content>Slick little MP3 player, easy to use, but battery died if I went more than 48 hours without playing it.  This is my 6th MP3 player, and one of 4 I have in use, but I decided to rreturn it to the store.

<Title>Where are the accessories?
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a 4 month ordeal trying to get an older, worthless iteration of Samsung MP3 player to work. Samsung really won me over with their customer service, as they eventually replaced the device with the pink version of this model.  My daughter was absolutely thrilled to get the pink version, and I was absolutely thrilled to have the monkey off my back for getting her something that never worked.  Obviously, this thing has some good points.    The things that make this better than an ipod nano: Battery life is really good. You can drag and drop files onto the device as if it were just another folder on your system. You don't have to install any bloated software that takes over your music files, renames them wrongly, stuffs metadata in them, etc (referring to WMP which is required by a lot of non-Apple products - iTunes isn't really bad, IMO). It supports OGG very well.  This doesn't matter to a lot of people, but if you think Apple audio format is good, you haven't heard this.  Not for the non-techie, though.  Bad points:  The earbuds really are very poor quality compared to what Apple gives you with any iPod. There are no accessories!  Where is the charging cradle with AC?!  Try and find cases, clips, etc.  Just not available. Playlists are very difficult to build and use.   Too many things end up in the 'Unknown' album since this thing can't simply list a folder name (which would be the group) when the tagging doesn't contain the group info.  This is a programming weakness; if Samsung had half a clue how humans work, they wouldn't have released this device with this particular programming failure.  It is one thing to know how your device works and yet another to understand how your market will use it. No AAC support, as well as other music formats that sometimes make sense.

<Title>Yes, it works, but..............
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the Audio Player works well - does its job as designed, we imagine - it's only a couple of loose ends that are annoying, really annoying  Microsoft redesigned the Windows Media Player - so the information provided does not line up with the actual computer view - the software cd was out of date, would not play and required a contact with Samsung - to date, they have not provided an up-to-date cd - we did download the manual via DSL otherwise, given it being 40-odd pages, we would still be waiting for it to finish downloading.  We were able, by trial and error, to figure out how it works as opposed to the iPod owned by my wife - who is much more capable than I am with Digtal Audio Players - what does this say about Apple and Samsung? - hmmm.....
