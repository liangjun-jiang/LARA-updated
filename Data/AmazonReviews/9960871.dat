<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is an excellent alternative to the ipod. Its features are great ranging from a line-in jack to built in microphone to an FM tuner. However the headphone jack on my player wore out eventually and so I unscrewed the back and inserted a small piece of aluminum into a side of the jack and now I get full sound again. A small hassle but an awesome product overall.

<Title>Adequate

<Content>Not the best player out there, but it works.  I can use it with Windows Vista and my XP laptop.  Controls could be easier to use and give more options (like making playlists).  All in all, it was worth the $100 bucks I paid for it.  I just wish those jerks at Creative would have continued to support the Zen Nomad Jukebox, instead of saying it "has reached the end of service life".

<Title>Unreliable!
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The COBY MP3 player I purcahsed worked fine at first, but it is very poorly constructed and the two halves are held together by 4 screw into very thin plastic ears which broke the first time it was dropped.  It still worked OK held together with tape, but now (3 mos.) the HDD is dead and therefore the whole thing is useless except as an FM radio (which does still work). Certainly NOT a robust product - better to get a flash ram one at nearly the same price!

<Title>Slow Tech Support and then HDD Read Error
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first got this player I e-mailed tech support because I had a question and did not get a reply after two weeks.  Then, after 4 months of purchase (Coby warranty is only for 3 months), I got an "HDD Read Error" and all that worked was the radio player.  I managed to contact tech support and they told me that I need to buy a new player because mine is out of warranty. I searched the internet and found out that many people are getting the same error message as me. I cannot recommend this player.
