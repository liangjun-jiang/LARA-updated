<Title>iPod just gets better and better

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLKIHA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-1146140-6494507">Apple 80 GB iPod classic (Black)</a>  It just gets better and better. I got the 80GB. Thinner and lighter than my 60GB with video, and the navigation is superior. I really enjoy cover flow. I can finally get my entire music library, over 1000 CDs, on one tiny device. Amazing. Those who do videos may want to spring for the 160GB version, but this meets my needs perfectly. The new iPod touch is impressive, too, but the capacity is too limited. When Apple comes out with the 80GB model I'll be the first in line.

Can't believe how good this player is.  Great build quality, features & sound.  No complaints whatsoever.  For those who grump about the sound, 2 tips:  invest in a decent pair of headphones (e.g. in ear Shures)and rip your music at a high variable bit rate.

<Title>Always getting better

I still had three other mp3 players, including a beloved creative zen (with the metal case), and I didn't like the ugly white ipods. But I thought I should try one. My first gen ipod was a piece of crud, w/a battery life of almost 2 hours.  wow!...generations later, I can't imagine life w/out my 80 gig classic ipod. this device is really sick!

<Title>Decent, but ultimately not satisfying

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLKIHA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-1146140-6494507">Apple 80 GB iPod classic (Black)</a> Firmware version 1.0.3.  I preface this review by noting that I bought the ipod classic for one primary reason - music.  I am not that much into videos on such a small screen and am not into podcasts (yet).  The ipod classic has a great deal going for it, including large capacity, slim form factor, great battery life, gapless playback, podcast support, and itunes/itunes music store (some may disagree, but itunes gets the job done fairly smoothly and has a lot of content  - just ask Zune 80 owners).  However, ultimately, it came down to ease/comfort of use and sound quality, both extremely important to me.    The ipod is renowned for its supposed ease of use (I'm talking about menu navigation within the device); however, after having using this device, it leaves a lot to be desired.  The touchwheel was a great innovation when it first came out, but now seems outdated.  I found it frustrating navigating the menus; the reason for this is mostly because it is not sensitive/accurate enough.  I found myself constantly "missing" my desired selection on menus (for artists, albums, or songs, etc.).  Having this occur frequently, particularly with extended periods of listening, gets annoying and becomes a chore and actually somewhat stressful.  Also with a decent sized collection of songs (about 6000), having to use the wheel to navigate from one end of the collection to the other is not smooth.  If you spin around the wheel fast with your finger, it will eventually bring up letters which you can then scroll through (from "A's to B's, etc.), but I found that activation of this feature was inconsistent and I ended up having to scroll around the wheel tens of times to get to certain albums or songs.  These two issues made using the ipod uncomfortable and not enjoyable or relaxing.  For comparison, I have tried a Zune 80 (actually bought and returned one before buying the ipod classic) and suprisingly found that its touchpad and navigation system was far more accurate and hence, the Zune was more enjoyable to use (for music, at least).  The second issue with this device besides the navigation was with the sound quality, which is very average to my ears.  It's not horrible; "middle of the road" describes it quite well.  First, I tried listening with no presets activated; I am not an audiophile type but it just didn't sound that clear and was somewhat flat and plain; I am unsure if the classic may have a poor signal to noise ratio compared to other devices I have listened to.  I then tried with the "rock" preset and this actually livened things up a bit, but still did not impress me that much.  For comparison, I have an old iAudio M3, which has a much fuller and clear sound quality.  Overall, given the above issues, I returned the device.  I think if you don't place prime importance with sound quality and don't mind the touchwheel and are able to navigate the menus well (I couldn't), then the ipod classic will be a great choice.    Again, it has alot going for it.  It has great capacity, battery life, nice slim form factor, gapless playback (impressive, one of the only devices with this ability), games/extras (such as calendar, etc.), external hard drive capability, and auto playlists.  It is also coupled with itunes (very polished) and the music store, which has plenty of content (music, movies, podcasts, etc.).  But if it's difficult to navigate and doesn't sound that great, then having those good qualities is moot for this reviewer.

<Title>New to iPod. I'm in love!

This is my first iPod, so I don't really care how this compares to other models. In short, I am in love. While it took me a good half a day to figure out the click wheel thing, but now the light bulb has clicked and it's a breeze to use.   I love how easy it is to sync with iTunes. I've been a big user for years, but always tethered to my computer. I'm excited to take my items on the road. I have plenty of room left, so I think I would have to add much more of my music.   This is a top-notch product for bringing together your digital media files and having fun on the go. Thanks Mom for the awesome birthday present!
