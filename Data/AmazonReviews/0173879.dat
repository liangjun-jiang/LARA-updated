<Title>Great Player
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a really great DAP.  The sound quality is amazing, I have a set of $300 headphones which often causes problems because the last two mp3 players that I have purchased did not have enough power output to run them properly. The m6 sounds absolutely spectacular (it also has a custom 8 band equalizer which you can adjust to your preference)  The interface takes a bit of getting used to but it is relatively intuitive. It is not quite as easy as the windows pmc system in the Toshiba gigabeat or Zune, not bad though.  The new firmware supports album art and greatly improves the overall functionality.   The m6 comes bundled with video conversion software which will shrink your Divx files down to a more manageable size for the device. The screen is sharp enough to be able to read subtitles on movies.  Overall I am very happy with it

<Title>Small and Mighty
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is thing SMALL, less than the size of a business card.  But the screen is big enough (2.4 inches) and sharp enough to display photos and movies quite well, and it's even useful (in short doses) for reading text files!  As for the music playing, it sounds great, however, I don't find navigation and playlist organizing very easy.  Unlike the iPod, you don't need any special software to load songs and photos onto the M6, it's just drag and drop!  (Special software is included for converting videos, which works well enough for me).  Also, unlike the iPod, you don't need a proprietary cable for the USB interface, it's a generic, which is great.  This is the best MP3 player I've had, and I love having my favorite photos and a few movies along with me on the road.  Battery life is good, so far about 18 to 20 hours for music, I haven't tried draining it (yet) in video mode.

<Title>Nearly Perfect
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player because of the great reviews its sound quality had been getting. If you want absolutely great sound quality in a digital audio player you have to avoid Apple and either buy this player or a Cowon player.   I don't like one aspect of the player: it's not easier to get music to the player. Not that it's hard, but it's not as easy as an iPod. Also, on occasion it takes a tad bit long to start up, but usually it just boots up after a couple seconds.   Other than that it's a great player at a great price and I would've give it a perfect score had it not been for the the imperfect music uploading abilities.

<Title>Cool little player with a minor graphics gltch
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was drawn to this player for two main reasons.  First, I like the flash memory of 8GB...plenty of storage for hours of tunes and a few movies.  Best of all, no moving parts as with a hard drive.  Second, I wanted a portable movie player. Movies look ok, but the screen is very small, so don't expect a movie experience like you would find on a portable DVD player.  Still, it is ok.  The one drawback is when you go thru various menu options, the graphics occasionally get scrambled, forcing a restart with the power.  I don;t know if it is just my unit or if all units experience this annoyance.  Since I use the player mostly for music, I don't have this problem.  The sound is great with plenty of volume and clarity. Being about the size of a credit card, it will fit in any pocket.  I purchased a crystal clear plastic case from eBay which protects the screen nicely.  For the money, I think this is one of the best units with flash memory out there.  IF it were not for the occasional graphics problem, I would give it 5 stars.

<Title>Acceptable.
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The product froze once after 2 days of my receiving it. I reset it and it did not give me any more problems. I reinstalled the firmware so that it would be in Chinese (because I needed the player to display Asian characters in various encoding formats), so there might be a discrepancy between what I had and the International/European version, but I doubt it.  The sound quality impressed me, although the earphones did not. I did not try the video feature.  While better than I had expected, the product was not without flaws. The playlist function doesn't seem to work smoothly and I agree with another reviewer in that navigation is badly designed and it is difficult to change the volume sometimes while a song is playing. I personally prefer a tactile design, but I dislike even the iTouch's screen, so I'll admit to bias.  I ended up selling the product to a friend and got a Zen, but only for smooth compatibility with Rhapsody-to-Go. I would have kept it otherwise.  Recommended.

<Title>Meizu 8GB MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Chinese knockoff at it's best!!! I like it better than my wife's iPod.  Really, really, good sound quality, outstanding bass without sounding muddy, lots of options for customizing. FM radio is a nice touch but I wish it had AM as well. Ebook feature is a plus. Excellent battery life. The screen is large and vibrant and the unit is thin and light. Comes with  tough vinyl protector already attached to front and back to keep it from getting scratched.  Finding the proper firmware update and installing it was mildly confusing but well worth the effort. Meizu appear to be responsive and working hard to improve the product.  Only has 2 games. Touch control is a little too sensitive. Interface is a little quirky here and there.   Video converter is PC only but worked fast and well in Parallels Windows XP environment on my intel Mac Mini.  8 GB is a lot of room, but I've almost filled it up already!  Overall, I really have enjoyed it. Great player for the money. I'm looking forward to their iPhone knockoff which is coming soon!

<Title>Just over 4.5 stars.
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As you have read, if you value multiple formats and awesome sound quality, your choice is this player or the Cowon A2.  The A2 being about $70 more expensive and, having read reviews, hard to manage without looking at the screen (use mine a lot in the car) made this the obvious choice.  Virtual3D is an amazing technology, the Bass response is tremendous and if you can't satisfy your need for Bass, you probably have a hearing problem. For me, complete and seamless OGG support and OS independent were key factors as well.  Video is good quality.  The picture viewer is amazing, and don't believe the specs, any size JPG works, so you can use this to carry your albums around with you without having to resize to 1024x1024.  You can customize menu's, font colors, and put your own picture as your background. The reason it doesn't get the remaining 0.49 stars, huge playlists (like on the order of 250 songs) can take a minute to load and start playing, and the touch pad is sensitive at times (i.e. tap on center pad is the same as "enter", a few Doh! instances on my part).  Build quality, look and feel, style, just an all around good player.  Before you spend $70 more on an iPod that just doesn't match the sound quality, flexibility (i.e. iTunes locked), and format capability, read more reviews and see it in action at YouTube.  Of course, if you bought a lot from iTunes, better to enjoy your next iPod (or burn and re-rip your DRM tunes into MP3).  It supports DRM from other stores, but never tested that, I have never purchases a DRM infected song.  Course, MP3 downloads from Amazon work great. :-D

<Title>Good, Solid, But one issue
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Over all the mp3 is solid.   * Sound is crystal clear. different functions and styles.  * The browser function is a great, unique, and really cool feature. you can organize your files whichever way you want, which isn't a feature you would find in most Mp3 I-pod like players.   * graphically it looks great, you can change the background with any picture.  * video feature is simple and easy.  * there is a Mic. works great for meetings  the only downside is that the scrolling bar is sometimes a bit too sensitive, so you kind of miss your choice in the menu or the play list.  overall, great player solid sound, great browser feature. you need to have steady hands to scroll though.
