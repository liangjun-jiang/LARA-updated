<Content>Unless they have fixed it this is junk do not buy it. After sending the first one back for a refund we received a second one with no refund. It worked...for about ten mins. the batery clip fell out. I gave it 1 star because there are no negative numbers. This is a complete piece of junk  
<Overall>1
