<Title>Solid MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A lot of reviews I saw that it was hard to use but its really pretty easy to use.  If you can't figure it out in 5 seconds than you might as well be using cassettes.  It does the same thing as an ipod and its way cheaper.  It's a little bigger so if size is important to you it may not be the way to go, but I use it in my car and at the gym and it works fine.

<Title>Better than an iPod
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The look and sound of the H10 is excellent! I got one of these and my brother got an Ipod Mini, and the only differences that I can see are that my player does not have games and you can't take playlists from your computer and transfer them as a list onto the H10. All the songs will be on it, but they won't be in one easily accessible playlist, you'd have to go through and select each one and add it to a new playlist.   Sound quality is awesome and the having a built-in USB is extremely useful. I do have trouble getting my H10 to disconnect after syncing music because my laptop doesn't seem to register it as a USB drive, but it works fine on my brother's computer, so it might just be my labbie.    I will say that Window's Media Player is not as user-friend as the iTunes program, and I'm having trouble getting the program to recognize Mpeg music files so that I can add them to my H10, but I've been told that I can convert them to Mp3s, which are, in my opinion, the best to use for the H10.    So far, my battery is going well. I think I got about eight hours on the first charge, but that's what can be expected the first time you use a rechargeable. Recharging took between four and five hours and every time it's plugged into teh USB, it's recharging as well.    Overall, this product is great. It fits in all the cases for the Mini and is easy to use with great sound. I've only had mine for a few weeks, but I already love it. It costs less than an iPod and is just as efficient.

<Title>Avoid at ALL COSTS!
<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is by far the worst decision you can make.  You have to use Microsoft Windows Media Player to organize all your music.  It is the most frustrating program in the world.  Then, it will take you about 5 or 6 tries before the program recognizes you've connected the player.  Then, the songs take forever to actually download to the player.    Then there is the matter of the charger.  It is absolutely ancient in design.  There are two parts to it that need to be attatched.  One connects to the computer and the other connects to the outlet.  You feel utterly stupid and embarassed using it.    On top of that, a few weeks after buying it, the damn thing started to crash on me, atleast a few times a day.  It eventually degraded to not being able to use the forward button.  Every time I pressed it, the player would get stuck and I would have to restart it which would take atleast 5 minutes! (that is not an exageration, I honestly measured it once!)  I took too long to report it and Amazon wouldn't allow me to return it.  They suggested I sell it to someone else.  But I could not bring myself to inflict that on anyone else.    I wish they allowed you to choose negative stars!

<Title>iRiver H10 5GB Sucks - Terrible Product
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iRiver H10 product has been a problem from the start.  Please do not not not purchase this item.  It is NOT a quality product.  You will be totally disappointed.  My iRiver shipped to me with a Hard drive error.  Even though I fixed that problem, it still never worked properly. It crashed on the 32nd day from the arrival date.  Total waste of time and money.

<Title>Poor customer service
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got a working H10 yesterday. I ordered one in August. My 1st H10 didn't sync to my computer and the firmware didn't help. My second H10 couldn't even get to that point. It would freeze after turning on. I tried to talk to customer service, but I would get a busy signal and so I tried through e-mail and it took 3 weeks to get a response that I would get a response. When I did get a rep on the phone, they only could tell me how to update my firmware, when obviously that wasn't my issue. I did save money by buying a remanufactured H10, but I don't recommend it. If I had bought a new one it would've been around the same price as an iPod, which is what I should have gotten in the first place.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Contrary to the reviews below, I find this device incredibly useful and a true bargain. It works fine and I have had mine for almost a year and a half and it still works perfectly and the battery is fine and long lasting too. Also, the product comes with a case which is always a plus and it has many different equalizer settings. A definite buy for anyone in the market for an easy to use, well made 5gb mp3 player.
