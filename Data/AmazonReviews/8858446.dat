<Title>Great little mp3/ogg player
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Samsung YP-MT6V 256 MB digital audio player is a superb mp3 player.   It is able to play all types of codecs including ogg which was the big seller for me.  It also has a root directory meaning all you have to do is copy your digital files directly to the player using windows explorer.  You do not need to use some fancy program that complicates the process even more.    The one "AA" battery is said to last up to 42 hours, and with the quality of sound and performance of this little gem that is remarkable.  It also has an FM transmitter and a voice recorder. The factory headphones produce great sound, so overall this is a heck of a player.  Easy to use, and a true digital media player. Highly recommended

<Title>Great Digital Audio Player (A Must Have)

<Content>The Samsung YP-MT6V 256 MB is a perfect easy to use music player. The things that I like the most about it are its perfect compact size, and great stylish look. Also, whenever you are not around a computer, you can just hook it up to a cd player, or other music device that takes headphones and mp3 encode a song. It has a great sound and I think its much better than the same priced iPod Shuffle. Mainly because it can record voice, FM radio, you can record straight of a cd player, and you can see what you are listening to, unlike the no screen shuffle. The only disadvantage of the 256 mb player is the fact that it only holds 256 mb.

<Content>I own a iBook G4, and copying songs from iTunes to this device was easy.  I'm a ver exigent quality sound person and at first sight I was wanting t to buy an iPod Nano, but was very expensive for me.  One Friend of mine toll me that this Samsung was very very good enough for his daugther so I gave it a chance, and I'm impressed!!  The only think that I had to do was update it's firmware (Downloades form Samsung's support page), but that was very very easy.  Why? I like see Spanish menus on my devices and with it's original firmware (V.1.1) has problems, but with new one (V. 2.1) was working like a charm.  I reallu recomend this product!!! Great work Samsung Group!  P.D. If you want more great sound avoiding external sound, buy an earpad pair and put it over the the earpad that comes with this device!

<Title>Great MP3 Player

<Content>I like this unit very much. After my IRiver was stolen, I looked around for a replacement.  The unit is easy to use and comes with everything. The software is a bit unwieldy though. At first I had a split screen to rip songs and see what is on the player itself, but that went away and I don't feel like reinstalling to bring it back. Then you have to go to Windows Media Player (I use 9) to transfer the music over to the device.  I've gone to a another CD ripper and just drag the files over. Much faster and much easier.  I'm a runner and the screen is bright and clear. I like being able to lock the controls as they tend to get pushed when I run if I don't lock them.   The sound is really great with the ear buds and even better even using a cheap headset.  I bought a wireless transmitter (GE) to use in my car but you have to really crank the volume up to get anything out if it. I think this may be more a function of the transmitter.  Everything else about the unit is great. Samsung did a very nice job with this player and FM tuner.  I am a very satisfied user.
