<Title>Great little personal media player...

<Content>This is a great little device.  It's nice and compact unlike a lot of other video players and fits pretty much anywhere.  It handles music and video which is always a plus and has some nice bonus features like games and voice recorder.  It also has an external speaker which is great when sharing videos or songs with friends.  And even though it's tiny, the 1.8" screen is very vibrant and displays well.  The only drawback is the videos need to be converted, but that is true with every player.  The good news is this one doesn't take all night to convert your videos.  The video conversion is pretty quick and easy to use.  A great player all in all and highly recommended.

<Title>Don't believe J. Palanca

<Content>Interesting that J. Palanca has reviewed so many different Visual Land products and always says the same thing. He's easy to please, I guess.  Aside from this device feeling cheap and cheesy and having a pretty sub-standard battery life, it put some kind of pirate software on my PC that killed about 5 hours of work time for me. Fortunately, I was able to remove it with new anti-virus software.  Also fortunately, the Visual Land people were very nice, helpful and accessible and although they denied there could be any such virus in their product, they did promptly and with no hesitation refund my money. But they need to work harder to ensure their products are suitable for the US market.  The VL-558A is priced cheaply and has lots of features, but don't waste your time and money; buy an iPod or a product from a distributor that sells a product designed for American consumers, unless you speak Chinese, enjoy flimsy, poorly-made things and are a software engineer.
