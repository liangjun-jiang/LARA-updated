<Product Name>COBY MP-C641 MP3 Player with 256 MB Flash Memory
<Title>Wouldn't Recommend.

<Content>I bought this Mp3 player as something cheap to use while skiing so I wouldn't have to use my expensive one and risk breaking it. I wouldn't recommend this product to anybody. 256MB is only about 50 songs, which you have to scroll through yourself. There is no menu to find certain songs you want to listen to. After a few weeks, mine started speaking giberish. If I went to the menu, it would look something like SJ#$#@^%(JFS. The battery time is only a few hours, and the USB connection is something I've never seen before. If you lose the cable, as I did, somehow, then there's no way to use it again. I've been trying to look online for something similar to it but I just can't find one.
