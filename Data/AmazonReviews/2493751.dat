<Title>Went to China and Back - worth every penny!
<Date>Sun Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I took this MP3 player with me on a trip across China recently.  It was great!  Very small...about the size of a lipstick. Fit nicely into a pocket and held a large amount of music.  Definitely a great value and worth the money.  I was worried about the rechargables since I would not be able to recharge during travel.  The battery should last up to 19 hours and so far so good.  Still on the first battery and used for hours.  Never expected to like this so much.  What a great surprise!

<Title>*Was* Valid Complaint, But Now Firmware Fixed Problem
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>"I primarily listen to spoken work programs - audio books and radio shows. If you do this as well, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER. It does not have any resume feature, whatsoever. If you turn it off, you must manually fast forward or rewind to your stopping point. To make it worse, those rewind/fast forward speeds are horribly slow without any menu options to change those speeds. I had the eariler Sandisk 1mb player and it was a much better product."  One of the reviewers mentioned this problem. This was a problem with just about all the MP3 players. I took one of the files from NetLibrary that did *not* resume properly with earlier SanDisk products, but it works fine with this one.

<Title>Great player at an awesome price
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was torn between joining the Apple Borg and getting an I-Pod Shuffle and exploring other brands of flash-drive players.  I knew I neither needed nor wanted one of the huge 20GB hard-drive behemoths, as I needed to be able to take my player to the gym (which the hard-drive models make it difficult, if not impossible, to do) and there is no way I would ever need to sort through EVERY song in my entire CD collection.  A flash drive player was the obvious choice for me.  And so I bought Sansa m240 on the recommendation of reviewers on several different websites.  Man, am I glad I did.  This is a really great player with terrific sound even on 64kbps WMAs (which take up half the space of similar-quality 128k MP3s).  I've got about 150 MP3s and another 100 WMAs stored in the 1 GB of memory, and I estimate I've got room for about another 100 WMAs.  I have no idea what else I will put on this baby, but I'm good to go for now with about two workdays worth of music.  Loading songs is tremendously easy--just drag and drop like you would any other file in Windows.  The operation of the unit is also fairly intuitive, with noncomplicated menus and easy-to-use controls.  I was up and running within five minutes.  The FM tuner works great, although I haven't really used it all that much.  It's a nice feature, though.  The nicest feature of all, though (for a unit this size and price), is the four-band equalizer.  That's something the similar-sized Shuffle does not have (Heck, it doesn't even have a DISPLAY).  I haven't used the voice recorder because I have a PDA that does the same thing,   nor have I explored its audio book and subscription music capabilities.  I could go on and on about this unit.  I've had it a week now and I really haven't found anything I DON'T like about it.  It's HIGHLY recommended if you are in the market for a flash MP3 player to listen to tunes on.

<Title>Sandisk m240 crackles every 20-30 seconds during playback of Audible.com files (AA format 1 and 4)
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The M200 series may be a bad choice for Audible.com listeners -- at least until they release a patch. This review is only about bugs when playing Audible.com content, and some navigation issues with audio books on WMA.  So if you only listen to music, ignore this review!  Sandisk Sansa m200 series crackles every 20-30 seconds during playback of Audible.com files. The noise is a split second interruption, like a click or a crackle.  Sometimes it blanks out half a word, sometimes it garbles half a word.  It took me a few hours to realize that it was consistent, I just thought I wiggled a connector, but it does it when I am still.  I upgraded the firmware (v1.3.0A) from Sandisk after I got it out of the package two days ago (12/20/2005).  Other web forums mention this problem in January/February 2005, but they said the firmware fixed it.  I guess not for Audible files.  I talked at length to Sandisk support.  They were very friendly and I got them immediately, no wait!  This is a known bug with the M200 series for the AA formats 1 and 4 only. I think he said that Formats 2 and 3 have no crackle.  It does not crackle on mp3 and wma.  They are working on this problem with low priority since it is reported infrequently.  Some people can ignore it I guess.  I also discovered a problem when playing WMA's: the M200 has a bug with rewinding or fast forwarding WMA's.  I downloaded a short book from Overdrive Media through the Fairfax County library.  I could play it fine, but it would skip to the beginning or end when holding the rewind or forward buttons.  It would also skip to the end if I paused it twice, or turn the unit off a second time.  The Sansa E100 series is better, but it does not remember where you left off when you power off in the middle of a WMA file.  I tried the same book as above from Overdrive.  It does resume fine for Audible AA files.  The sound quality was great for Audible, no clicks.  The following is the details of my observation of one Audible.com book.  Sandisk assured me that it happens with all Audible format 4, with different timing:  When I play my Audible book on the Sansa m240, it crackles every 25 seconds. It resets this 25 second period when I stop or rewind. It continues to crackle every 25 seconds if I go to the menu and stay at the menu while playing. I noticed that when it crackles, if the back-light is on, it will flicker. The scrolling title is in sync with the crackle. It happens twice during the full scroll. The full title is: "On Intelligence (Unabridged), Part 2 ". The first time when I played it, it crackled as the two L's in "intelligence" scroll off the the left, and then again before the "P" in "Part" reaches the left edge. It crackled every time the title scrolled to those two exact same positions. However, if I stop or go to the menu and back, it crackles at two new positions of the scrolling title.  Hopefully they fix this soon. I think it is a great little player otherwise!

<Title>Worth the price and holds a ton
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My brother did a little more research than I did and gave me this mp3 player for Christmas, and it turned out to be far better than the one I gave him (oops).  I have spent a little time with this since then, and have been downloading large amounts of music to the player with no sign of it having major problems.  The sound quality provided by the earbuds is a lot better than I expected, and the easy controls make this pretty simple to appreciate and use.  Included with my package was an offer from two third party companies worth checking out.  The first was from audible.com for audiobook downloads (be warned that a lot of them are larger unabridged offerings) that has a huge selection to choose from, and the other was for Rhapsody, offering an $80 rebate if you subscribed for 6 months to their service.  I have had a problem getting the Rhapsody website to accept the UPC number from my player required for preregistration, so be aware you might have a problem.  I am planning on taking this lightweight one-AAA battery player out on the ski slopes to have something tolisten to, and think that this will more than capably do the trick.  I strongly recommend it if you have never gotten an mp3 player, because until I got this one, I hadn't had one, and using the USB connection and armband plan to get a lot of use out of this player.

<Title>Well designed.  Great Value.  WORKS WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In an age where half of the Made In China junk you buy needs to be returned, I'm happy to report that the M240 is truly a great product (even though this too is Made in China!)  To start out with, I was looking for an MP3 player that works with subscription music.  Buying CDs or even download music is a waste of money for me because I get tired with most music after about 3 plays.  Subscription music is great because you can download almost anything, then delete it when you get bored and download some more!  I don't know why this hasn't caught on more.  I'd think more people would feel somewhat the way I do.  I've been making the rounds of free trials on the subscription services, starting with Napster.  Now I'm with AOL.  The Sandisk works flawlessly on either of the two I've tried, though Microsoft and AOL can be kind of quirky.  The 128k WMA that AOL provides are just right.  I can load up about 10 albums and only half fill my m240 1gb model!    The sound from this thing is great.  I replaced the earbuds (fall out of my big dumbos) with $10 Sonys and they sound great together.  I also purchased a Belkin Tuncast II (about 33 bucks) for my car, and these also make a great pair.    I also went out and bought a pack of rechargeable AAA batteries. Because the unit does go through alkalines pretty quickly.    The unit is rich in features.  You can access your music by playlist, album, genre or artist.  The FM radio sounds great. I've yet to use the voice recorder.  The backlight works well too.  The display provides a great deal of information, but is a bit small. I guess it has to be on such a small unit.  That's another great thing about it.  When I hop out of my car, I slip it in a pocket and can plug it into my head phones at work or home.    Overall, A great product!

<Title>This may not be an Apple but it's a real peach!
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this about a month ago as a Christmas present to myself, but wasn't sure if I really wanted to keep it...I guess I was a bit too impressed with the iPod name.  On Christmas Day my cousin's kids received iPods so I finally had a chance to see what the fuss was all about.  Needless to say I was not impressed.  So I finally opened my Sandisk and what a surprise!  I just love this thing!  Just to give it a try, I downloaded a couple of CD's I had in my computer.  I was quite impressed with the ease of the download and the instructional CD that came with the unit.  Now mind you I am not computer savvy at all and this was a breeze to do.  I had read a previous review posted here about a cassette adpater so you can use this in the car.  Lo and behold when I was at BJ's the other day they had a Belkin model for $14.99.  Seemed a bit cheap but I thought I would give it a try.  Tried it for the first time today and WOW!  I was seriously considering installing a CD player in my car, but now I can save the hundreds of $$ that would have cost with installation and all.    Can't wait to try the free offers for Napster and Audible.com downloads that came in the package!  Love, love, love it!!!

<Title>Love the sleep function
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros: sleep function, easy to use, controls haven't worn out yet Cons: not exactly sleek body design, chows batteries listening to audiobooks  I also have an e260 which has no sleep function, the wheel is impossible and wearing out already.  But these m240s just keep on tickin. I bought two more for my wife and mother-in-law.   Wish they had them with more than 2gb. I've been putting off buying a larger mp3 to replace the stinky e260, because I'm disappointed by all the other options for midsize players. I'm thinking about getting the 2gb and just rotating them out every once in a while.

<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player about 2 years ago and use it 3-5 times a week at the gym. It takes its share of abuse and keeps on going. The sound is great and the software that comes with it is fairly easy to use compared to the Rio MP3 player that this replaced after less than 90 days! In my opinion, iPods are overrated and a BIG marketing gimmic. If you're looking for a tough, basic but great sounding player that will last, I would highly recommend this player.

If you want to get the most for your dollar then I do suggest this SanDisk MP3 Player.   The battery life on this thing is amazing as well. 3 to 4 days have gone by since i've bought it and I don't need to replace the battery just yet.  Transfering files is a breeze. 1. Plug in the USB cable 2. Drag and Drop 3. The end. It's that easy.

<Title>AVOID this player...or at least try one before you buy...
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the first Sandisk MP3 player Christmas 2004 because it had a large screen and was $50 less than the comparable Iriver model.  What a catastrophe!  After returning version1 then version2 of their first model by RMA, they sent me the SANSA M240.  These players do function, but as another reviewer warned, don't buy them for audiobooks or recorded radio programs.  Sandisk is trying to cover up faults in their resume function capability.  My M240 is resuming after power off as I am testing it, but overall this player is terrible.  It doesn't even have settings to adjust the speed of the fast forward functions.  The sound on an Iriver or Samsung player is *much* better, and this M240 doesn't even have a directory structure for picking your selections.  Sandisk customer service is an utter horror as well.  Customer service was slow, often unanswered and they could *never* get their story straight.  Deceptive to say the least...while their press releases boasted record company profits.  This player is a piece of plastic worthy of a prize in a box of cereal.  Not much more.  It will play your music, but buy an MP3 player with a "line in" function for MP3 encoding.  Such players have superior electronics and you can record from any source including external microphone.  Samsung and Iriver also have 3D sound and bass enhancements.  Before you buy a "Scamdisk" player, TRY it first.  I wish I would have.  People have written good reviews, but I wonder if they have compared this player with others, or realized it's shortcomings.  Sandisk is charging a quality price for a knock-off quality player.  And as I mentioned, their customer service is the WORST I have experienced.

<Content>After reading a number of the negative reviews on this item, I had to weigh in. I have been using my M240 heavily for several weeks now and have not run into a single problem with it. The original battery (replaceable AAA -- can't beat that!) is still ticking away, the sound quality is superb, the menus are easy to navigate, the FM radio feature comes in handy if I want to catch up on current news, downloading songs onto it is child's play (and I am NOT a tech-savvy consumer! Just drag and drop), the 1GB storage capacity is more than enough, the buttons are a breeze to use even with mittens on during Winter runs -- all in all I can't find a single drawback, especially given this little fella's low price! If you are looking for a good quality, pint-sized MP3 player/FM radio for a great price, look no further!

<Title>Great Little MP3 Player - Must Have for Rhapsody ToGo
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little charmer is priced the same as the iPod shuffle but delivers full MP3 capabilities and FM radio capabilities at only a slightly larger form factor. The big sell is that it works with subscription services like Rhapsody and Audible, which was the clincher for me.    I plugged my m240 into the USB port and Rhapsody picked it up immediately - no futzing with settings or installing software. I was transfering music in just minutes with no configuration at all.  Please note, though, that I signed up for the Rhapsody ToGo service before plugging it in. ($15/month) I use Rhapsody at work all day and love the whole "juke box in the sky" concept where you can basically listen to any artist you want at any time for a monthly fee. Now that I can take it with me in this compact little package, I am totally happy.  It should work with any of the Microsoft "Plays for Sure/Subscription" logo services.  The display and controls are nothing special, but for under $100, you get a full 1GB of storage.  It's perfect for the gym too, as it includes an elastic armband thingy.  The earbuds are below standard but usable. Haven't used the voice recorder. The FM transmitter is what you'd expect too.  It takes 1 AAA battery which lasts for many hours. I have used mine for at least 2 already and the battery indicator is still maxed out.   Please note, if you buy your music from iTunes, stick with the iPod devices. The Apple DRM and music format don't work on this player.  All in all, this is a great value and absolute must for subscription music lovers.

<Title>Buyer beware
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nice, lightweight little player but be careful - SanDisk is not truthful about what support is offered for various formats.  I have had serious issues playing back audio files in wma format.  I spent many hours with SanDisk tech support resolving possible causes.  Initially they blamed the bit rate, but with some work I was able to transfer files with a sampling rate within their spec.  Finally, I was told that wma would not play correctly at all (it will skip or not support fast forward or rewind) - it is a 'known issue.'  They will not authorize a return or a credit for another model in spite of the fact that they advertise full support for wma.  This company is not truthful in the product spec they present, so buy at your own risk!

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product because I wanted to read books downloaded from the public library.  Unfortunately the downloaded books played back erratically, skipping and without control to navigate within sections.  These are legal downloads and the Sansa was on a list of devices that are supposed to be certified for use with Microsoft protected downloads.  I called Sansa and they kept me occupied with various "fixes" until I exhausted the possibilities - and myself - at which time a supervisor told me that this was a known problem, and basically that its my tough luck.  SanDisk has mislead me both in their advertising and in their after-purchase support.  I would recommend to a prospective buyer that you move on to another manufacturer.

<Title>nice digital music player
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am updating my review, I have had the Sansa M240 for over a year now and have not had any problems with it. I use it at work everyday and the Sansa picks up from where I stopped it everytime. I like the Sansa so much I bought a pair of small Sony speakers to listen at home, the sound over the small speakers is not great but it's fine to nap to. I do take care to not damage the door when replacing the battery and make sure to turn the unit off before you replace the battery or you will get choppy sound play. I only use the MP3 feature but it works great for me.                    I bought this Sansa M240 to replace my bulky CD mp3 player. I was surprised at how much better it sounded than the mp3 disks I burned even though I used the same files  on the Sansa as I did to burn CDs, but the other reviewers are rigth don't even bother to try the enclosed earbuds. I rip the mp3 at 128 bits so I was only able to fit 200 tracks but that fit my needs, a few hours of shuffle play at work while I am in the office. I found the menu easy to use and loading music was as easy as drag and drop. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't tested the battery life or how rugged the contruction is.   All in all if you are looking for a cheap DMP without a lot of frills with very good sound I strongly suggest you give the Sansa a look.   After daily use for more than three months I have had no problems with my Sansa, the battery life is good and the construction is good also. I whole heartly recommed the Sansa.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00066EK2W/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-7411381-4614325">SanDisk 1 GB MP3 Player Silver</a> Overall, I enjoy this MP3 player. I am even thinking of buying its 2GB version. What I like in this product: Excellent sound quality and ease of use. It requires a AAA battery, that is both convenient and inconvenient. You'll have to replace the battery every so often, but it should not be a problem if you use the rechargeable batteries. It has an advantage over the kind of player that uses the built-in battery. That player will have to be discarded when the built-in battery dies down as it is not replaceable. What I do not like: the odd shape of the player and the earplug type of the headphone. The player looks ugly and is too bulky to put in the shirt pocket, especially if you are a woman as it will sit right on your boob. The earplug is uncomfortable and hurts my ears.

<Title>Good service for RMA
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have purchased 3 of these for various household members over the last 18 months.  All have work great except for one that died just one week after the 1 yr warranty expiration.  I purchased it on Nov 29th and it quit working on December 10th the next year.  This was a Christmas present for my wife so it was not even opened until Dec 25. (Normal Sandisk policy is warranty for 12 months from purchase date, not from take possession date.)  The good news is that after a couple of phone calls to Sandisk, they agreed  to a replacement and the RMA was issued promptly.  They were good to work with and I am pleased now with their response.  Be sure to keep your purchase records.  My unit just froze up and would not boot.  No fix available from their tech service.

<Title>Just buy an Ipod!
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought 3 of these for my 3 kids last Christmas.  I had to send 2 back after they died  or froze within a few days and then the replacements proceeded to go bad also!  The third mysteriously still works.  I think it's because it gets much less use.  It IS easy to read and use - when it wants to.  The 2 defective ones got stuck on the first screen and the music couldn't be accessed, much less played.  I returned them again and just bought Ipods on Ebay!  I would say this is a good choice if you like to gamble with your money:)

<Title>Just Don't
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this as a Christmas present.  I wanted something simple to use while riding my exercise bike, nothing fancy.  It seemed just what I was looking for -- for about two weeks.  Then it stopped accepting transfer of songs.  One minute it accepted them, then it just didn't.  I've sent four emails to the support line at SanDisk over the course of two weeks, and got no reply.  The User Guide is useless, and the online support info is even less so.  You're gambling.  If you're one of the lucky ones, it's a great mp3 player.  If not, you wasted money and time.

<Content>I purchased this item for my 7 year old daughter.  She received it as a gift this past Christmas (2007).  She loves it and has been able to figure out all the controls without any assistance from me or her mom.    The device runs for a decent amount of time off the AAA battery used.  It also was immediately recognized by Windows Media Player.  Drag and Drop worked flawlessly.  I am very pleased and may purchase one for me in the future.

<Title>Disposable.
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one of these exactly 29 days ago to replace a more expensive Sansa e270 player that I dropped (while travelling at 70mph... oops).  Figured I'd find a cheap Sansa player in case I drop it again. However, after 29 days (used approximately 14 hours), I went through one new AA battery, then halfway through another battery. Then, I couldn't play mp3's anymore. About thirty minutes later, the radio quit, as well. Deleting all the MP3s then writing a new MP3 back seems to have fixed it, but not without a fair amount of resetting to factory settings. Also had random power offs for no apparent reason (irritating when traveling at 70mph on a motorcycle)  So, it eats batteries, and loses data every 15 hours or so.  Maybe good starter MP3 player for a kid who's going to replace everything every week or so anyway. Not so good for me.  You get what you pay for.

<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It does a good job, for the most part. I love this brand, but I wouldn't buy this particular player again. It can't hold very many songs, and the user manual seemed to be lacking in explanations for some things(like the voice recorder option, which I still haven't figured out). I like that it has a built-in FM radio, and the earphones are pretty comfortable. Most other earphones don't fit in my ears, but these ones are nice and padded(you have to put the pads on yourself though, which got a tad bit frustrating). Overall, a nice, cute, little mp3 player.

<Title>Quality control?
<Date>Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Sansa recently, and I really liked the user interface, good storage capacity, form factor, etc.  That said, the little device let me down.  The first one lasted a week, then locked-up.  Sandisk tech support told me that there is no reset function on the unit, so I had to return it to the store.  No reset button, really?  The second Sansa lasted two weeks before I experienced the same issue.  I returned it and purchased a Samsung YP-F1, a player that still allows configuration as a Mass Storage Device.  That way, you can treat it as a hard drive and simply drag-and-drop the files you want onto the unit.    As an aside, let me register a complaint against the current copy-protection frenzy.  "Plays for Sure" simply means that the user is going to be inconvenienced by software that is going to make sure that the user is authorized to listen to something before allowing a file transfer.  I don't steal music, and I also don't buy music from any online source.  All the music I put on my player comes from ripping my CD's in my collection.  There are no licenses for this, but it is no less legal than copy-protected music.

<Title>Great lil player
<Date>Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just recieved this unit today, I love it! It's very compact and easy to use. Sounds good except one of the headphone speakers was fried when it shipped..no biggy.  I did hook another pair of phones to it and it sounds full and has a decent volume level. The quality of sound and 5 preset eq. settings are sweet and your bound to get the right mix for your style of music. The led display is a cool blue and it's easy to read and cycle thru the menu's. I managed to stuff this player with (281) .WMA files at a bit rate of 128bps when transferred, even tho it's advertised to hold (480) .wma's, i prefer sound quality to quantity. I mean c'mon 281 songs is alot anyways, unless your planning a trip to mars, or you want your sound quality to decrease by recording your tunes at 64bps or less. Not me. This is a great player for the price. Tho the usb cable could be a tad longer than 3". Also very easy to transfer files. Excellent purchase....

<Title>The player's fine
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After I got some cash I felt like I should get a new mp3 but I didn't feel like wasting all my money away either.  So I did some research and I found this.  This Sandisk has one gb for less than other manufacturers and it sounds pretty nice too.  The earphones they sent might not have been the best but they work pretty well with the player.   In the pictures the sandisk looks a lot smaller than it actually is.  I know that the player uses a battery so it needs to be bigger but I didn't like the way the company had pictures that would easily fool the eye.  The size is fine though and it fits in your hand just right. The player needs a computer to delete files which isn't convenient but it's not a big deal My biggest regret though is having to waste money on batteries unlike some other players which might be rechargeble.  But the battery does last for a while and be sure to carry a spare battery on a long trip-just in case :)

<Title>Durability problem. Think it as "disposable". 
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Big durability problem. It worked great for first 3 months. Then it's dead. The button doesn't respond.  There are nine independent "push" bottons, Much easier to navigate than ipod. I hated ipod's "touch-sensitive" button. To transfer (non-copy-right-protected) MP3 files  (but not MPEG4), you don't even need to launch MP3 application (MusicMatch, itune etc), which makes file-transfer much faster and easier. Very light, you can drop it thousands times, and it never breaks. It works like a removable USB drive (You need to go to Menu>Setting>USB> to change Auto to MSB. Manual doesn't explain this!) You can also use this as a USB thumb drive. You don't need to install driver either. The only caveat is a poor written manual.

<Content>I really thought this was a bargain and I would love the device if it would just stay powered on! I only had mine for a month before it started randomly turning off by itself for no reason at all. I use rechargable batteries and the cause is not because the batteries are dead. The cause is also not because I accidently hit the power off switch, because you must hold down the power switch for 5 seconds in order for it to shut off. Additionally my device has not been mistreated.  It's a piece of garbage, if you buy it just make sure you hold onto your receipt in case you need to return this junk.

<Content>Great first time MP3 for my two kids, ages 9 and 11. Didn't want to invest $200 on something they may or may not use, may lose, or otherwise destroy. Bought our first one in December 2005. Bought our second one in Jaunary 2006. The SanDisk MP3 is very user friendly, easy to download music to and easy to navigate - especially for MP3 newbies. Good sound quality, long battery life, easy-to-read display (shows song playing, battery life remaining, number of songs on player, and more) all add up to a great little MP3 player.

<Title>A very good product at a great price
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Basically, this is a great little MP3 player from a good name brand for a great price.  Where else are you going to find a 1 GB MP3 player for under $100?  The Sansa M240 sounds great.  It comes with earbud-type headphones, and using these, the player sounds pretty good.  It has a good volume range, and sounds just fine at all volume levels, from quiet enough to use in a library to loud enough to hear over a lawn mower.    It is rated at 19 hours of battery life on a single AAA battery.  I have not actually timed how long a battery lasts, but it seems about right.  I have bought a few rechargeable AAA batteries, and this has proven much more convenient with MP3 players with a built-in rechargeable battery, because I can charge the dead batteries while still using the player, which is a definite plus in my book.  Probably the only real complaint that I have it how the Sansa handles files.  Transferring files to the Sansa is not perfectly straightforward.  You have to build a playlist in a music player utility on your computer, such as Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, etc., and then synchronize that playlist with your Sansa.  This basically means that it will compare the playlist with what is on the Sansa, and make sure that they are the exact same files.  It will automatically make the two lists identical.  While this is not a bad way to go, I would like to be able to easily add just a couple of songs directly to the Sansa, or take a few off, without going through Windows Media Player.  It's a small complaint, but it's still a bit annoying.  However, if you are computer-savvy enough to use Windows Media Player or some similar program, rip music from CDs, and make playlists, you will be able to put the songs on the Sansa without a problem.  I have gotten into audible books since I bought this player, and it works great for those, too.  It also allows you to use subscription services, where you download "rental" files and things like that, which is a nice feature if you want to use Napster or one of those types of services.  A nice plus that you won't find in many of the more expensive players.  The Sansa also comes with a plastic sleeve-type case for the player and an armband.  The case is a little bit cheap-looking, but it does a fine job of protecting the player, and what else can you ask for at a rock-bottom price?  It even comes with a AAA battery to get you started.  Granted, a AAA battery only costs $.50, but it's still nice to get one in the package.  The menu system built into the player is very straightforward and easy to navigate.  The buttons are also built in a logical way, so that they are not so prone to accidentally hitting them, which is a common flaw to many MP3 players, like iPods.  This might seem like a minor thing, but I have talked to several owners of iPods who complain constantly about accidentally skipping songs, etc., because of the poor design of their wheels.  This player features a flash memory system, instead of a hard drive.  While flash memory players generally can not hold as much as hard drive models, they are also much less prone to skipping and/or damage if they're shaken severely, dropped, etc.  They should also be much more reliable long term, as the flash memory is a much more solid construction than hard drives.  And this player is rated to hold 480 WMA music files, so how much more do you really need?  I bought one of these players, and asked my wife if she wanted one, too.  She said no.  Then she used it one day, and we went out the next day and bought her one, too, she liked it so much.  I heartily recommend it to anyone looking for an MP3 player with good sound quality, decent storage capacity, and a great price.

<Content>I gave this gift as a present for my father. I really wanted an mp3 player that had an FM tuner so he could utilize it at the gym. The first time he attempted to load the device with music it locked up and would not let him do anything further. I spent several hours troubleshooting and only found other people with similar problems and no help from the manufacturer that worked. At this time I am having trouble getting SanDisk to respond to my support requests so there is a chance I may not even be able to get it returned. Bad hardware or needing a software update happens in technology devices and I am willing to work with that. Bad customer support on top of it makes this product a disappointing waste of time and money.

<Title>Very Good Player
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had several MP3 players and I like the Sansa M240 a lot.  I use it for both music and Audible files, and it works well.  It and the Creative MuVo N200 are the only ones I have been able to walk with for over 3 months and have not needed to be serviced.  Rio replaced my Forge several time and I have had to take the iPod (4th gen) in twice, but maybe it's because I racewalk at 7 to 10 MPH? (depending on how I feel and traffic lights)  Walking that speed is easy on the knees but hard on anything attached to you. :)  Note to Audible users, be sure your player has Firmware 1.03 (highest available when I wrote this).  For a quick check, press the center button when an Audible file is playing and look for a "CH" in the lower right corner.  If it's there, then it's updated and will support chaptering (in Play only) and will fast forward and rewind correctly.  While the Creative MuVo N200 and SanDisk Sansa m240 will both play Audible files, the Sansa is my prefered player because of the chapter support, menu support and better display.  For just music when walking, the Creative wins for size and weight.  Someone asked about crackle with Audible files and Yes I get both crackle and dropouts, though I get a lot less playing Format 3 instead of format 4 files.  On the Sansa M240, there really isn't a lot of sound quality difference between 3 and 4 like there is on the hard drive players or the Rio Forge.  The Sansa M240 is not perfect, but if you want a durable lite-weight player that is battery powered - it's the best I have found.  I like it enough to upgrade to the M250 before my next camping trip.  (I would consider an iPod Nano, but how could I recharge it in the woods?)

<Title>just so so
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I paid $69 and while the price here is $77 now. If I could get the 15 mail in rebate back , it will be $54.  3 months ago I bought a creative nano 1G mp3 which cost me $110. At that time the cheapest price for this one I can find is $84( no any rebate during that time period). I would say, I 'm not regret to pay the $110 for the creative mp3 ( for my girlfriend) when I get this one.   From the pic showed here, I formerly thought it was a flat part, but it's not. It's larger than I imagined. The outside material is plastic , looks like cheaper one than creative one( also the creative one is also plastic).   The Carrying Case w/armband is so.... It will take a while to put the mp3 into the carrying case, and the carrying case is only a small plastic bag. You need to take a while to get the mp3 out again in order to replace the battery. Looking at the creative nano's pretty and easily handling carrying case, this carrying case is trash.  The sound quality is not bad, not exciting. like the title, just so so.   All in all, I paid 55 dollars for this 1g mp3(if got the 15 mir), and $110 for creative nano 1G mp3. You pay and get what you pay.

<Content>I am not going to write a review full of techincal terms. I am just going to say that I love this little mp3 player. It holds up to 480 WMA songs and that is more than enough for me, especially for the $69 dollars that I paid from someone here on Amazon. The sound quality is great, the FM stations come in clear and putting the songs onto the mp3 player was as easy as can be.

<Title>Perfect
<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been through my share of mp3 players and this one is the best. I've had this for about 5 months now and never had one problem. The only thing that I wish this had was you cannot delete songs from the player which can be a nusance if your computer stops wanting to reading the songs on it, but other than that it is a perfect mp3 player for the music lover. About the battery life, I suggest you spend a few bucks and buy a pack of sony mp3 player AAA batteries. I did and one battery lasts for 3 months of above average use.

<Title>Perfect MP3 Player For What I Need!
<Date>Mon Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just needed one for the gym, so i did my research and decided this would be the best 1GB player for me.  I basically just read reviews online, and they were all right!  Once out of the box, I hooked it up to my computer and started putting songs from my cds onto it.  However, keep in mind, I'm not the quickest when it comes to computers and technology.  Its pretty cool because it uses Window's Media Player.  Very easy to use and navigate through the menus.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great MP3 player for the gym or exercising.  1GB holds a lot of songs!

<Title>Great MP3 Player, Terrible Recording Capability
<Date>Mon Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using the Sansa 1 GB for several months now and while I am happy to use the Sansa as an mp3 player, I am terribly disappointed in its subpar and unreliable recording capability.  As an MP3 player, this device is as simple and easy that it can be.  Copying files is as easy as plugging in the device and dragging and dropping audio files.  The size is wonderful and light.  Battery life is more than sufficient.  My big complaint other than the device's poor recording capability is that the battery gauge is terribly unreliable.  Particularly when the player is running low on battery, the battery display will jump between "full", "semi-full", "low", and "downright empty".  This is frustrating when trying to figure out whether there is enough juice to get through the next hour of use.  A big downside is the device's poor recording capability. - Recordings are very soft compared to other recording mp3 players.  I've tested this side-by-side with other devices, including iRiver players and Sony Clie recordings. - The software to record is very buggy as recordings would frequently disappear.  At first, I thought it was because of the way I was using the device but despite my best efforts to consistently use the device according to the manual, I would frequently find my recordings disappear.  I would approximate that I'd lose about 1 recording every 30 recordings for no reason at all.  While that may not seem very frequent, there should be no reason that a recording device will lose recordings without my explicit instructions.  This is poor software design.  I checked and double-checked everything about how I was using it to confirm whether or not it was user error but I've tried many things like making sure to lock the device whenever I'm not actively pressing a button and making sure to follow the instructions in the manual.  Recommendation: Do not purchase, unless you get a really good deal and/or don't plan to use the recording feature at all.  There are better models out there, especially nowadays (as of April 2006), at the same or better prices.

<Title>Didn't work
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my wife for Christmas. First, it was a pain in the rear to get it to connect to the computer (Win XP; WMP 11). Once I installed some driver updates, it connected. I moved a number of songs over to the device and only a handful actually played. I kept getting a message saying that I needed to upgrade my subscription (Why? All the music was from my own CDs!). So, I deleted all the songs and tried it on a different computer. Everything seemed to work just right: connected on first try and moved songs onto the device with no trouble. Then I tried to play the songs. Screen said, "Playing," but there was no sound.  I boxed the piece of junk back up and shipped in back. :-(

Well, I had it 6 months and suddenly today the power button made a clicking noise and now it won't work. And I didn't drop mine 1000 times like the person above me. (heh) I'm slightly upset, although I do remember reading reviews about this sort of "suddenly stopped working" problem before I bought it but I figured at the price I got it for, who cared! Well, I care now. I will remember next time that you get what you pay for. Bad Sansa...BAD!

It was a great gift, VERY affordable, and just, well, I'm sure, once again withstand the test of time and has already gotten a LOT of use.  A great product for the $!

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched for days and months to find the right mp3 player. Considering the price, I thought the sandisk brand would suit my needs. It turned out to be very disappointing experience. When you look at the pictures of the sansa, you assume It is going to be somewhat thin, but not as thin as the ipod nano. Sadly, you will be mistaken because it is FAT has heck. The radio and voice recording are awful and produce poor quality sound and static. Also, what's up with the battery cover? It looked loose and it shooked. The plastic material used to make the sansa looked and felt extremely cheap and non-durable.   It's not worth it. In less than a day, I returned the sansa to circuit city and brought the ipod nano.

<Title>Failed within 2 weeks of purchase
<Date>Mon Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Sansa m240 from Amazon ($89) in February as a birthday present to myself to use at the gym during a month long cruise. I agree with the other reviewers here about the loose battery compartment lid and seemingly cheap plastic composition.  I also agree that the FM reception and ease of downloading music were good.  My problem with the unit however is that it became locked in "initializing mode" after trying to add more songs to it in the second week I owned it.  This is how I discovered that the Sansa has no reset button.    I contacted their technical support team at Sandisk.com and they walked me through using my device manager to attempt to reformat the unit via my computer, but the problem was that the Sansa also no longer appeared as a drive when installed on any computer, so reformatting was not possible.  Sansa sent me a "return authorization" including a 2 Day FedEx pre-paid label, and I returned my m240 to them for free.  I received an email a couple of days later that they received it, and another the next day stating that a new one was on it's way to me.  I should get it by tomorrow.  I just hope this one will last awhile.

<Content>I wanted to get a small music player for my wife, but iPods are outrageously expensive. Instead, I download iTunes, burn them to CD, then convert the CD tracks to MP3 and load them into the Sansa. With just a little work, I have tons of music on a player that's less than half the price of a comparable iPod.  The Sansa works very well. It installs itself automatically in a few seconds on a PC with the XP operating system. Transferring music or audiobooks couldn't be easier - just drag and drop with Windows Explorer. The controls are simple and easy to use even with my big hands. Sound quality with the included ear buds is pretty good.  There's really nothing that I don't like about the Sansa.  I may keep the Sansa and get another one for my wife!

<Title>Easy to use, good sound quality and a good value
<Date>Tue Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using the Sansa M240 for a week. I could not be more pleased. Out of the package I was able to upload albums of music and podcasts directly from my PC using the included USB cable without loading any addtional software (the Windows Media software that is a component of Windows XP handled it all). The ear-buds that come with the Sansa are comfortable and provide better sound quality than others I have used (think i-pod). The Sansa's LCD on-screen instructions are adequate and intuitive.  The unit has a bulit-in adjustment for customizing the sound to presets for several types of music (i.e. pop, rock, classical). Even the standard AAA size battery is included.  As a daily transit rider, I was looking for a small player that could drown out the sound of the Metro subway while being of a moderate cost should it be damaged or stolen.  The only accessory I would add is the silicon case for the unit sold by various vendors.  It not only protects the unit, but the stickiness of the material allows it to stay-put in your pocket.  Bravo! Sandisk for a well designed, highly functional product.

<Title>Many Cons
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player seemed great at first glance, but was extremely hard to use. The first thing you have to do is shut off the mass storage or you have the possibility of all the songs getting put onto it, and not showing up on the drive (through my computer). also, you have to personally edit all of the id3 tags and even with that, sometimes the artist shows up as unknown.  I have had it for 4 months now, and it just locked up for the first time this morning. I was listening to the recordings, and it said the play time was 09:07:01 and there was a really loud feedback sound. I had to take the battery out to fix it (AAA batteries).  To add to that, with one of the batteries i used, the mp3 player kept shutting off.  The things that I really do like about it is that it can be used with any program ie. rhapsody, windows media player (except itunes... i think) and it has radio and a voice recorder.  a few more cons are that you have to use the computer to delete recordings, the backlight doesn't always work, and mine wont let me create playlists like it says on the website.  overall I really don't like this mp3 player, but if it is for someone younger, I think it might be a great first mp3 player.

<Title>Caution - 1,000 File Limit
<Date>Sat Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This may seem like plenty, but I listen to voice tracks of about 3 minutes in length recorded at 32kbps mp3.  I have another 1gb size mp3 player from IRiver which I can fill with about 1240 tracks.  This Sansa only allows me 1,000 (or 999, one or the other).  Pretty specialized requirement I know, but still it requires me to either combine tracks (way too much hassle) or lose 100-200 mb of capacity on the player.  As I bought this for my daughter I am really disappointed.  I really hope this might be addressed in a firmware upgrade...  Other than that, it's really simple to use as long as you're careful with your MP3 tags and loading using Windows explorer.  I also have the 512mb M230 Sansa which I like, but did not give me any clue that there might be a file limit.

<Title>Great little player!
<Date>Tue Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my Sansa as an upgrade from my dinky little 128MB. I couldn't be happier, I got 1G for under $100, and it's  so easy to use. Just drag and drop your music folders into the Sansa window! The earbuds that came with it are adequate, if you're not an audiophile, but the cord seems very lightweight, I don't expect them to last long. Invest in an better set of headphones. The UBS cable is short, like 6", so you might also want to make sure you have a longer one. I did, so it's not a problem. The instruction booklet is useless, it lost a star there. I also recommend buying the $14 silicone case for it, the plastic thing that comes with is cheaper than cheap. The FM feature works well for me, but I live in a urban area, where the radio signals are really strong. I'll have to see how well it picks up the signal when I'm out in the country. I also like the AAA battery, I bought rechargeables designed for digital devices, when my battery runs out, I can just pop in a new one, I don't have to wait for it to recharge.   Pros: PRICE - DIRT CHEAP! Features - FM radio and microphone recorder Display - backlight makes it easy to see navigation - I didn't have a problem, it seems like even large fingers wouldn't have a problem Battery life - I get about 8 hours on a fresh battery. It probably varies depending on what features you're using. Easy to use - Simply drag and drop. That's it. Foolproof. Or at least fool-resistant.   Cons; Extras are cheap. - included case, earbuds and ubs cord are bottom of the line UGLY - It's designed for function, not form. You can get a couple of colored cases for it though. Doesn't fit well in a pocket. It's kind of uncomfortable to carry in a hip pocket, but with the case I bought, it has a belt clip. Useless instruction booklet. Seriously, it's completely useless. The instructions that came with the carrying case were just as long. As if you needed someone to tell you to put the player INSIDE the case.  Basically, if you want a nice, cheap little mp3 player for music or audio books, this is for you. If you want a stylish, trendy thing, buy the Ipod already! I couldn't be happier with mine. 1G is plenty for me.I don't know what I'd do with the Ipod's 30!

<Title>A Bit Touchy
<Date>Tue May 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Physically, the device itself is fine.  The headphones are adequate, if not stellar, and the armband, while kind of cheap, gets the job done.  The menus are pretty basic, and with good sound, the m240 is pretty decent overall.  However, software problems are an issue.  The device comes with an advertisement for three free Audible audiobook downloads, but when I tried to upload them to the device, problems started.  Most of the time, AudibleManager wouldn't recognize the m240, but when it finally did, it wouldn't upload the files.  I tried to upgrade the firmware, only to find the device refused to turn on.  I called SanDisk, and they said that this was a known problem and that I needed to go back to the store to exchange it!    In short: if you can get it running, it seems to be pretty okay, but it's awfully touchy if you try to get fancy with it.

<Title>A fine MP3 Player, Reasonably priced
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my SanDisk Sansa for close to a year now, and it hasn't let me down yet.  It is easy to use, sounds great, and runs for many hours on a single AAA battery.  At first, I was worried about the apparently flimsiness of the buttons, but they've worked well and show no signs of wear or trouble.  The radio works great and tends to get better reception than my car radio.  The audio recorder is little more than functional -- it saves your recordings as low-quality, mono WAV files.  This is fine for recording reminders or even basic conversations if you needed some sort of record, but don't count on them for making podcasts or video voiceovers.  Nevertheless, it is a solid audio player, and I've been pleased enough with mine to purchase two more as gifts for Christmas this year.

<Content>I purchased 2 of these a few months ago.  One for me and one for my other half.  I purchased it thanks to the good reviews it recieved.  It worked good for a good while, considering how often I used it.  Now, if I try to listen to a tune or two, there's a 99.99% chance it will turn off for no apparent reason.  And, to top it off, it's difficult to turn back on.  The same goes for the other one I purchased.  I highly advise anyone not to buy this one if you are in the market for a mp3 player.  Just imagine..you are in the middle of a strenous walk, rocking to a favorite tune and *boom* it's gone.  Makes for a boring and maddening workout.

<Title>Good
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the best mp3 player I've had to date (most which have only lasted for a few months).  I've had this mp3 player for about 2 years and I've never had a problem with it.  I've dropped it on concrete a few times and it is still up and running.  Transferring music is a breeze, just drag and drop.  The sound quality is good.  It's small and lightweight.  The only annoying thing is that I have to constantly buy batteries for it (AAA) and everytime I try to put my playlist in order on my computer, it reverts back to the order the sandisk had it in (therefore none of my songs are in the order I want them in).  I would definitely recommend it, especially for the price.

<Title>Best MP3 Player I've Used!
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I hated my iPOD Mini so I tried a small flash player that was OK but hard to read & use. Then I found the Sansa M240 (1GB) for only $87 (Circuit City) and I'm thrilled with it.  Sound quality is very good with the supplied earbuds and using the Custom EQ. Without the Custom EQ I might not be so happy. A neckstrap with the earbuds would be nice but can be added. There's a hole to add a lanyard. These 55 year old eyes found the Display easy to read even in the dark with a large, bold font and good contrast. The backlight is good but I'd prefer a lighter shade of blue for even better contrast. Very minor issue and really a matter of preference. The controls are outstanding and one of the best features! The LARGE buttons are very easy to use and provide good tactile response. Build quality is typical of similar products and seems well made with good fit and finish. Lightweight and handy size. Overall design is excellent in that they've put a large display and large buttons into a unit only slightly larger than a thumb drive! I haven't gone through a battery yet but I do like the fact that it runs on a single AAA battery and doesn't need to be recharged with a cable or charger. I always keep a few AAA's in my briefcase anyway for "in-flight" replacements. Connection to a PC is simple with the supplied standard mini-USB cable (same as for my phone and camera!). I like that there are no proprietary cables or connectors. I prepared my playlist with WMP and synched the M240. The M240 automatically sorts by artist, album and genre.  Although I haven't used it yet, the subscription compatibility is something I will probably use. The FM Tuner receives even weaker stations and has 20 presets. With that many I can use different groups of presets for favorites in multiple cities. It would be nice to be able to record from FM as some units do but it's not a big deal. There is a voice recorder funtion that might be handy but I don't really need it. If you like simple & easy and eschew tiny, hard to use buttons and miniscule displays, you will like this a LOT - and it SOUNDS good. Bottom Line: YES, I would buy it again!

<Title>Worthless for non-music files
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I primarily listen to spoken work programs - audio books and radio shows. If you do this as well, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER. It does not have any resume feature, whatsoever. If you turn it off, you must manually fast forward or rewind to your stopping point. To make it worse, those rewind/fast forward speeds are horribly slow without any menu options to change those speeds. I had the eariler Sandisk 1mb player and it was a much better product.

<Title>This player RULES
<Date>Wed Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I took a chance with the m240 while it was on sale for $79 thinking "man, this is cheap, I bet it might suck," but I was pretty much blown away. This player sounds awesome! The built in equalizer really tweaks & boosts the sound, though I recommend better quality headphones than the included earbuds to experience its crisp, clean sound. The control buttons and menus are very easy and straightforward to use. FM works fine. I admit it's not the prettiest player around, but if you're like me and don't care about the cuteness factor (aka ipod), dazzling full color menus, photo/video capability, or ridiculous amounts of storage space, this player rules.   Only criticisms (or maybe just me being too anal): 1) If you switch to FM mode in the middle of a song, it doesn't remember your time position within the song, or even what song you were previously listening to 2) The shuffle feature is kinda hidden within the menus; I wish there was a simple shuffle button 3) Playing full albums in the correct track order only works if the ID3 tag is formatted in a particular way (i.e. track "2" instead of "2 out of 10"), otherwise the tracks will be automatically played in alphabetical order

<Title>It wins out over so many others.
<Date>Thu Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There is a feature here to counter the awfully slow fast forward/rewind.  While the track is playing, if you power it down, (turn it off) it will resume at the same place upon start-up.  I listen to only spoken word, 1- 1.5 hours at a time, and the fast forward is terribly slow, but if you remember to do this, there isn't anything else that bugs me about this player.  It is loud enough to be heard over my machines at work, (other players didn't live up to this) and the firmware is much like other flash type players, most of the time you'll hear what you load first, depending on the arithmetic title you load. Folders are tricky on this one.  Load time is a bit longer than some, screen's OK.  The plastic pouch is helpful to keep water from it, battery time is better than most players at loud volume.  This is probably the very best player on the market for the money.

<Title>Great player for a great price
<Date>Fri Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this player because of black friday and i just can't stop raving about this little miracle.  This has 1 gig of memory, it can be used as an external drive, it has an FM tuner, and it can record music, + it has an LCD screen.  Something with all those features is awesome and it costs under 100$.  Also just playing music is easy, just connect, open the folder ,and drop ur music files, it's really that easy.  This is an awesome bargain compared with the iriver or shuffle, so this really is a nice player for a great price

<Title>Great Mp3 Player but somethings wrong. 
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this back in October and I was looking for something to use with Yahoo Unlimited Subscription Service. This worked perfectly and it has met all my needs except now that I'm reaching the half battery mark. Now the Backlight won't come on. I have it set to turn on when I skip a song and now it won't. I have to pause the player 3 times to get it to come on and then when it go's out after 3 sec it refuses to come back on. The only way to fix it is to put in a new battery when the old one is only half gone. I thought this was just a problem with mine but my wife's M230 does the same thing. Still it's a great player but this quirk really bothers me.

<Title>Great 4 the $
<Date>Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Point #1 I paid only $70 for it @ a "Black Friday" sale.  Having said that, I only have 2 criticisms.  First, the battery door is destined to come off or break due to the rather flimsy construction of the tab used to secure the door.  Second, playlists are not so easy as one might think (when you sync a list it only syncs the songs not the list).  You can create playlists for the device in WMP and save them to it since it recognizes the device as a drive.  Other than that, sounds great, plays WMA's (which some say are a higher quality file than MP3 while taking up the same amount of memory), MP3's and other files.  Loud enough for me.

<Title>How to create folders with this player !
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you organize your files into folders and subfolders in Windows and then drag and drop them to the Sansa player you may be disappointed when you go to play them: they may be listed as one big mass of files - no folders / subfolders. This will save you a lot of aggravation: The problem is that ID3 tags on the files must all be uniform. Put files in folders on your pc how you want them, then open the files in winamp and select 'View file info' - under Album type in the name you want like "Album A" - do this for the id3v1 and id3v2 tags and hit Update. Do this with each song. All songs you want under album A must have an "album A" tag, B must all have "b" tags, etc.  Now when you want to play by "folders" on the Sansa player hit the Menu button  - select Play Music - then Album. There they are!

<Title>A good buy nonetheless
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Purchased this after reading amazon.com reviews.  Nice lower cost alternative to the iPod.  However, the instruction manual is definitely barebones.  You get just enough information to get started.  Nothing more.  I've seen warranties longer than this manual.  My bluetooth has more comprehensive instructions!!!  Also, have a spare USB cord available.  My tower computer is on the floor.  The USE cable that comes with this is so short, that to do anything, I had to get on my knees under my desk to work the device.  The arm band that the device comes with is so-so.  However, I'd prefer a belt clip  But, I want it to play music at an otherwise dull desk job and it does that just nicely - once I figured out how to operate the thing. I'll probably get one for my 13 year old daughter.

<Title>Great player--Here's how to organize folders easily
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wonderful--put me in the category of finding this player great.  Basically a no-brainer and intuitive menus. Two minutes after opening the box it was operational.  Anything more look at the full manual in your CD or amazon digital locker. I have a notebook with windows media player 10 and it works flawlessly with this. I'd expect the same with the other compatible music services.    One thing I initially had a problem with was how to organize some of my files--for instance I have language CDs which are tagged inconsistently and wound up all over the place when I synched. Or you might simply want to rename or reorganize your files into groups. The other review with the how to didn't work for me so if you still need help and use Windows Media Player to synch here's all you do:  1.  Open your Media Player and go to Library.   2.  Create your list library as usual by placing music or files in middle column.  3. When your list is complete select all files you wish to organize or rename and right click. Select "Advanced Tag Editor". 4. Every track you selected will appear. Using a consistent organizing system go to "Artist Info" and name the Artist (1st Level), then go to "Track info" tab and name your Album (2nd level) with your title and track number.  You can give it a Genre if you desire as well.  5. When completed start your sync. Sansa will recognize your system and will play files in the sequence you numbered your tracks.  Voila. You can batch tag some categories e.g., "Album" saving yourself some time if you have lots of files.   This is a great bargain for the money.

<Title>Great for the price, but a couple of quirks you should know about...
<Date>Sat May 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I listen to podcasts and bought this for a trip, so I could have lots to listen to while on the long flights.   The unit was great; SMALL, LIGHT and HELD MANY HOURS OF PODCASTS, AUDIOBOOKS.     But podcasts are, by their nature, short-lived; you listen and then delete, then load the next day's or week's episode.  This player DOES NOT have a DELETE function when you're listening to it in stand-alone mode.    The other quirk: the FAST-FORWARD IS NOT VERY FAST. On many models, if you keep pressing fast-forward, the unit picks up speed after a few seconds.  This one does not do that, so fast forwarding through an hour of material takes too long.   This becomes a problem if you accidentally touch the fast-fwd or reverse buttons too quickly and they simply skip to the end or beginning of a recording. (You have to press and *hold* to engage fast-fwd or rewind).     One more minor issue.. the PLASTIC COVER that becomes a belt clip and that also connects to the arm strap is VERY LIGHTWEIGHT & CHEESY  In summary, USABILITY IS MEDIOCRE BUT Otherwise I love it for what it's best at:  HIGH VOLUME STORAGE AT A GREAT PRICE

<Title>in 2006, having a user interface like that is a shame...
<Date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>bought this sandisk m240 today. installation was fast. documentation is poor. the software is rhapsody which is not good. you have the choice to use explorer to browse. not bad so in this department. it's usb 2.0, so the transfer is fast.  now the interface: who designed it? the name of songs takes about 30 seconds to show up (very slow left to write scroll). doesn't show the name of the folders. i can't figure out how to create a play list without installing rhapsody. i had a bad experience with rhapsody 2 years ago and will not install it again. i put 64 tracks in 8 folders and believe me, i am not able to get to each folder without going through all previous tracks.  the form factor: oh my god. looks slick on the shelf but it's one inch thick once you open the box. it's totally misleading. it's actually thick.  can't wait to return it. i'm very disappointed. i guess sandisk is after all a memory manufacturer and not a consumer device company.  last but not least, the quality is not good at all. got a bit better when i changed the headphone but still not good.  price was good but not good enough to convince me to keep it. i had a Rio and i was not happy. i tried Zen early 2005 and i have to admit that the interface was actually good. a bit heavy and expensive but i'm sure they came up with new models. ipod is still too expensive.

<Title>Sandisk has a great value in the Sansa m200 line
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My current small, favorite WMA music player is the Sandisk Sansa m240, with a gigabyte of storage, USB 2.0, an FM radio and long battery life from a rechargeable AAA battery. The m240 may soon be handed around the family as the m250 is dropping in price. It works well with [...] subscription "to go" music, Windows Media Player 11, and the new [...] service as well. The only thing that keeps it from being five stars is the fat form factor: look to Sandisk's new Sansa e260 for the next big thing in Windows compatible music players.

<Title>Annoying, but okay
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, let me say that I just received this product and have been using it for only a few hours. It plays songs and podcasts just fine, the volume is good, and the player functions fine. I like the screen and the easy-to-use menus. I bought the m240 because I won't use it much, I'm going on a trip to Europe and I don't want to have to buy a converter just to charge it, and I didn't want to spend $200 to get an equivalent iPod. For what I'm going to use it for, I think the m240 was a good buy.  Now for the down side. The product info says that the m240 will only work with XP. This isn't true. In fact, I still can't get it to work on my XP (SP2) laptop. I plug it in, it "rebuilds the library," then shuts off, and won't power back on. It turns on fine when not connected to the computer, but it won't work at all when connected--and yes, I do have the latest firmware update. On top of that, the product comes with an "Easy Start CD"--HAH! It won't run on my Windows 2000 desktop at all (which I expected, given that the product info says XP only), but when I put it in my XP laptop, it says I need the newer version of the CD (I just bought the thing!) and asks if I would like to be taken to the web page to get it. I click yes, and it takes me to--the Windows Media download page! I'm already using the newest WM player, and why a Sandisk product would send me to a Microsoft site for updates to its software is beyond me. Needless to say, I've given up trying to use it on my XP laptop.  Right now, I have it attached to my 2000 desktop, transferring files through Windows Explorer, and it's working fine. Go figure.  So this is a good little player, when you can actually get files on it. I really think the people at SanDisk need to get their act together and make sure their products actually work like they're supposed to.

<Title>Sansa Super for Simple User
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Several years ago I bought my son an Archos player. Last Christmas I got him a Video iPod. I knew both were too big and bulky for my needs. A few months ago I got an iPod Shuffle and loved it but there were three problems. One, the lack of any display, two, the controls were a bit small for my fingers and three, it can only charge off a USB port. I'm headed to Odessa, Ukraine later this week and won't have access to a computer's USB port so I wanted something that runs off good old-fashioned batteries. So I bought the Sansa m240 from Amazon while they were running the $[...] rebate. [...] I've read the complaints of some of the reviewers and so let me say upfront that I don't need or ask much from a player. If I can load the songs that I want and then be able to listen to them, in sequence or shuffled, I'm happy. The Sansa lets me do exactly that. I spent last weekend loading my MP3 collection into Windows Media Player 10 on my XP SP2 Home machine and rating the songs to get 1 GB worth of music with 4 stars.  Today I connected my newly arrived Sansa m240, copied my four-star listing to the sync playlist in Windows Media Player and downloaded the music to the Sansa without a hitch. It couldn't be simpler. I set the Sansa playback to shuffle and life is good.  Someone commented on the lack of documentation but the user guide available on the mini-CD or from the Sandisk website seems more than adequate. I've also heard the arm band and case is a bit cheesy. Perhaps, but it does what I want it to do which is hold the Sansa on my arm (the iPod Shuffle lived at cord's length in my pants pocket).   Finally, someone complained about the size. Well I'm not sure if there's anything smaller than the iPod Shuffle and I don't consider the Sansa much bigger. Given the display and the ability to swap out an AAA battery on the road, I'll take the Sansa over the Shuffle anyday.  The Sansa m240 is perfect for my needs, which are to have my music on the road in a light package, be able to see what's playing to appease my occasional curiosity and be able to use easily replaceable batteries. That's why I give it 5 stars.

<Title>Fantastic mp3 player for gym rats!
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Sansa SanDisk M240 2 months ago and I've been very pleased with the purchase. Here are all the reasons I bought it and like it:  -I needed an mp3 player to use during workouts (both at the gym and runs/walks outside). It comes with an adjustable elastic arm band and a plastic protective sheath for use with or without the armband. This unit is perfect for working out. -Reasonably priced (around $75) -Large-ish capacity (1GB) flash drive which also functions as a jump drive to store non music files on as long as you have your usb cord with you -Runs on 1 AAA battery (!!!) (they say 16 hours of play time and that's about right) -Features an FM radio -Hold switch to keep unit on or off  -It's small, lightweight, and quite attractive. -The display is easy to read. -It has a microphone but I have never used it so I can't comment on that function. -Comes with headphones that are probably the best of the 3 pairs I own -Simple drag and drop file transfer to load/unload music (but not compatible with Windows 98)  The only issue I had was on the first day that I got it, it wouldn't let me drop more than 125 songs on the player. When I called customer service they immediately suggested that I create a folder on the player and drop the files into the folder (instead of directly onto the drive). That solved my problem and I was able to load up almost a full 1GB of music onto it. I was impressed with how knowledgeable and helpful their customer service was.  May I suggest that you buy a set of rechargeable AAA batteries and a charging unit (I like Rayovac) to help save our planet?   I would buy this product again in a heartbeat.

<Content>I purchased this MP3 player for my daughters 10 birthday. This is her first and she loves it. I would recommend this player to anybody wanting a first MP3 player for their child or themselves. The only problem we have is that it locks up once in awhile, but usually if you turn it off and then turn it back on it resolves the problem. We also have it almost full of songs so that could be why it locks up sometimes. It holds about 250 songs. We also use Energizer rechargeable batteries because a friend told us it drains the batteries pretty quick and they work great.

<Content>Okay first off when my 512 MB SanDisk MP3 player broke I then returned and saw this Sansa SanDisk 1 GB for a sweet deal of $59.99 the same price for the 512 MB(this was 1 year ago) So I then decided to get this Sansa Sandisk m240 1 GB silver so then i bought this and got home and loaded it up with 436 songs and as I was listening to this I thought it was a great MP3 player the sound was great and everything till after a week then the troubles happened. So then I turned this on one day and their was no sound at all(i checked the headphones they worked fine on my stereo) so then i kept trying to get the sound back nothing did it i tried everything i tried connecting to the computer no good using new heaphones no good nothing worked so then i looke up this on their website none of the posts helped at all, and then i called their number to ask how to fix it so then the person i was talking to i could hardly not understand what he said but he said for me to try to listen to the FM radio so i tried that doubting it would work and i was right it didnt work so bassicly i then returned this and got a C240 1 GB MP3 player that now the headphone jack fails and i have to plug the headphones in funny to get sound on both sides but now i have gotten a apple iPod 3rd Gen. Nano the new video ones no more Sandisk for me. I say if you want Sansa go for the 4 GB Video one or go for the c240 2GB for only 50 bucks or the one i got for the same price as this color screen everything or just get an iPod or anything whatever bad buy bad bad bad the only reason i rated it 2 stars was how much i liked it at first

<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: I bought this Sansa MP3 player on the black Friday of 2007. After using for more than a month, I am pretty much satisfied with the product.        The sound quality is very good. The "Play Music" option has sub-options. You can select option to play by genre, song, playlist, or album...I didn't expect these so convenient functionalities with such a cheap MP3 player like this. Awesome!  Cons: Doesn't have a rechargeable battery. The player takes more power from the battery so the battery lasts less time than the spec says.       The play/pause function gets frozen if switched so fast, and I have to restart the whole thing (turn off and on back).

<Title>Shuffle problem
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased this to keep me entertained while doing my daily walking.  Loaded it up fully with music.  Clicked the "shuffle" box.  During two hours of walking, have heard the same song three times.  If it holds 15 hours of music, I should not hear the same song three times in two hours.  Apparently the shuffle feature is based entirely on random number generation and does not have an algorithm to ensure the entire music deck has played before recycling.  Otherwise, it works just fine. I am downloading podcasts of educational material to walk with.  These podcasts are between and hour and an hour and a half, and they certainly keep you occupied and informed.  I also download Clark Howard podcasts, and listen to a one hour show in 34 minutes.  Quite a treat not to have to listen to the incessant commercials.

<Title>good decent player
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pro: small, light, has recorder function I need, FM radio, good battery life, can be used as thumb-druve via USB 2.0 port, no skip. Con: if you use different functions, you have to go though menu to switch them bit inconvenient if you need to do this often. Overall: find it to be simple and feature packed, if you use it as your main, I suggest more RAM say 2 or 4 GB model will be better for you. ANother tip is get some Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable betteries, will never need to worry about running out of power on the AAA.

<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bad product. Period.  Ok, it has a radio tuner. But what good is it if you cannot download files on it after a few months?!  Even while it was functionning, it was hard to use because the navigation system is sooooo lousy. You have to be very patient to select a tune you'd like to listen at the moment. At the end, I just let it play whatever it wanted to play. Now, it's dead.  If you buy cheap, expect cheaper. And then, buy again.

<Content>Although the sound is OK, it's not easy to use.  There is no way to back up to a previous song, only forward.  The plastic case is hard to take off, and it's pretty big so it doesn't fit in the key pocket of running shorts.  The price is right if you can handle the size & inconvenience of this thing.

<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this a year ago for my daughter at Christmas.  It just locked up on us.  It hasn't even been used much.  I googled this model and the word "locked up" and found it is common for this model.  Update:  I'm not a techie type but I took the advice on some website and hooked our player up to the computer with a USB, then I went to "My Computer" and right clicked on the Sansa icon.  I selected reformat and it reformatted the player.  It wiped everything out and I had to reload songs on it, however it is working again.

<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am an older person who has no interest in the Ipod frenzy but wanted a small music player for the gym/car at a reasonable cost.  This player fits the bill. I was able to use it easily once I figured out how to scroll.  Music downloads easily through Windows media player( which recognizes the Sansa automatically).  I have had no problems at all and it is so easy to simply replace the AAA battery. Recommend this highly as a really good value.

<Title>simple design all the functions that I need
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted a tiny FM tuner for working out so I could listen to NPR. I was really happy to find this mp3 player with a FM tuner because it's much smaller than my ipod and any of the other sports radio. The design is simple and has all the featuresI was looking for.    I wish I could have given it a 5 star. I didn't do that because the instruction for linking up to my computer was too simplified. After trying for several hours of connecting it to my windows xp laptop, I finally figured out by trial and error that I needed to change the setting on the player to MSC from auto-detect.

<Title>Excellent, low-priced MP3 player
<Date>Wed Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa M240 is a great buy, and a top-notch MP3 player to boot.  The retail price on this baby just can't be beat, especially considering the great playback features and sound quality!  If you aren't watching videos, skip the Ipod and go for the Sansa.  It even has a resume funtion (if powered-down in either Play or Pause mode), so its great for podcasts.  Here are two tips that I have to get around the player's minor annoyances: name and number your MP3's in the order that you want them played back, as the player does not allow you to access any folders directly.  It plays the songs in alphabethic/numeric order, so keep that in mind.  Also, it turns itself off pretty quickly in the Pause mode if you don't hit any buttons, so remember to power it down whenever you don't want to lose your place.  Great player, great price, good times!

<Title>Thoughtfully engineered, sparkling sound.
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am really impressed with this MP3 player. I paid close to nothing for it, and was amazed at how fast I could get to use it. It plugs right into your PC's USB socket, drag and drop whatever music you like and Voila! You have about 150 songs ready to carry around. On one AAA battery it gives you about 15 hours of play time on average. FM Radio reception is quite good for a gadget this size. Headphones supplied are quite good and comfortable. 1 GB is a lot of music. Perhaps 4 GB is better but this one works for me.

Who needs an ipod when u can have this cute little thing? I really would give this a five star if it were not for the repeat/AB button, i have no idea what it does. Also the headphones positively suck, they might be nice and cute to look at, but man they hurt! The last bad thing is that the instruction manual is WAY to vague. I still would by it, i guess. It is not an ipod killer but hey, you cant have everything can you?

<Title>Cheap and easy to use...what more do you want?
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you want more, cough up the $$$ for an ipod.  Honestly, this is a great little device.  I'm not the tech wizard, and I didn't want to spend a lot on something that I might end up hating.  Consumer Reports gave this player a good rating for the $$$, so I said what the hey.  And as the 5 stars indicate, I am pleased with what I got.  Great for exercise (comes with armband) and for long business flights!  General comments: I was able to fit about 290 songs (WMA format) on the 1 GB player; SanDisk's tutorial suggests you could fit up to 320.  Maybe there's a way to fit more on?  The sound quality is very good, though the ear buds are a bit big for my ears.  Battery life is good.  I like the big buttons and the display.  You can play songs by playlist, artist, album, genre.  No, it does not shuffle songs on the player.  If you need to randomize, do it before downloading the playlists to the player.  Size-wise, it is not as skinny as a Nano, but you have the benefits of the display and large buttons.  Re: the spare "instruction manual"--yes, it isn't much.  Thankfully, SanDisk is now including a CD that sets up Windows Media Player for you and includes a how-to interactive tutorial.    Re: the "Repeat/AB" button--click it once and it repeats the current song, click it twice and it repeats the album/playlist.  Click three times to turn off repeat function.

<Title> A GREAT MP3  PLAYER
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm 14 and my Sansa is my first MP3 Player.  I've had it for about three weeks and it has every thing I wanted in a MP3 Player. *Pros:  You can choose to listen to your music by artist, genre, album, and all your songs in alphabetical order.  I also like that you can scroll through all your songs instead of having to skip through all of them (it is a great time saver). Once you understand how to load songs on to your Sansa it is really easy and does not take much time at all. I really like the ear buds it comes with, they are long enough so you can easily put your Sansa in your pocket. *Cons:  Like I said, I've only had my Sansa for three weeks and so far there are no problems.

<Content>My 1 gb player has seen heavy use for a year, and never given me any trouble. Why not those cute Ipods for christmas gifts? 1)SanDisk players support a large range of music/audiobook formats. 2)you can buy your batteries at the grocery store--ipods need to be sent in for a battery change 3)price 4)reliability 5)ease of use.  There are mp3 players out there that have sleeker design & more buzz. But if, like me, you want a player so you can listen to music or radio on a run or in the car, and like being able to use standard batteries--or if you are new to mp3 players, this is a great, dependable and inexpensive option.

<Title>Easy and Affordable
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I read a lot of reviews before buying this mp3 player.  I am not into technology and know nothing about mp3 players. I know I love to listen to books (about 2-3 books a week) and some music. I know I hate having to carry around a bigger CD player and the book on CD and extra batteries. I know I didn't want to spend a lot. THIS gadget has been perfect.  I can load my favorite songs along with 1 to 2 WHOLE books. I saw the review where someone did not like this for books but I can't figure out why.  I get the CD's from the library and put them on the mp3 player.  Then once I have listened to them I delete them.  Using Windows media player is very easy for me. The main thing is that I title every disc with the edit feature and put the number of the disc after the title.  This makes it so easy for me to find the disc that I am on if, by chance I loose that information.  The mp3 player automatically goes back to where you were when you powered down and that is easy enough to use.  It has a back lit screen that is fairly easy to read even without my glasses.  The light could stay on a little longer though.  All in all very worth the cost and very easy to use.

<Content>Forget the buzz about iPods, when it comes to durability, functionality and performance the SanDisk blows away iPod.  It may be a silly little thing but what i like test is the very friendly design/shape for holding - It is perfect for exercise both to hold and switch songs and adjust volume. Try doing that with an iPod without coming to a complete stop from what ever you are doing.  The Sansa also appears to be tougher - One ding on the iPod and boom - time to get a new one - Ever try to get Apple to repair one!!  Try this out.  Much better value for money and over-hyped and over priced iPod.

<Title>Great MP3 player -- better than an Ipod!
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Would I rather have this player or an Ipod, even if they were the same price range? This player.  That's right, Ipods don't have an FM tuner, a battery you can easily replace (meaning you aren't screwed if you are away from an outlet or computer), or a voice recorder. Also, this is small. It may not be as slim as a Ipod Nano, but it is more compact and I'm not worried about scratching it up. It may be "only" a 1GB player, but that is more than enough for me -- about 250 songs. (For the record, I have used an Ipod Nano for significant amount of time.)  I love this player. This player feels solid, not like my last player*, and I'm really pleased with its organization...  I just downloaded my music onto the player using Microsoft Explorer (using folders to organize the music), and now I can surf around on the player by folder by using the Menu.  The player is simple and intuitive. It doesn't get better than this. I'm very pleased and would definitely buy it again.  *I owned a Memorex that pooped out after 2 1/2 months of light use and no abuse, and Memorex never responded to my multiple emails to them about the warranty, even though I contacted them directly using the forms on THEIR website! (Yeah, I was happy to buy a new MP3 player from a brand I trust... toss Memorex from your cart and/or wishlist if you are thinking about buying from them... cheap products and no customer service.)

<Title>A Terrible MP3 Player - Don't Buy One!!!
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my second M240 as a replacement for the first one, which was defective.  If I was lucky, I could get it to play -- only to have the volume control automatically turn the volume down after 3-4 seconds of play (almost like playing a CD in preview mode).  I was SURE this was the one-in-a-million unit that was defective and didn't hesitate to call for a replacement (which Amazon replaced in two days).  I was pleased with the player until I discovered that the "Select" button wouldn't bring up the playlist or add to favorites - which renders the player useless, in my opinion.  So - my experience with the M240 has not been good at all.    I liked the look and feel of the unit as well as the way it fit in my shirt pocket, virtually weightless.  I'm really disappointed in SanDisk and will not buy their products again.  I will advise others to avoid buying this unit as well.  It is an inferior/defective product -- don't buy one!!

<Title>Excellent little starter player (with help from Real)
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Sansa M240 for a couple of weeks now, and I couldn't be happier (almost - see controls).  When I ordered it, my main concern was getting music onto the thing.  I envisioned myself spending countless hours ripping CDs to WAV files, converting them to mp3's, then using some unknown tool to get the music on the player.  When I got the player, I accidently discovered that RealPlayer 10.5 does all that.  Probably other products do that as well, but I'm a newbie at this.  (Running Win XP)  The player is about 3 inches long, and about an inch in diameter (it's kind of semi-circular).  I have not yet tried the (included) case or the arm band -- I just stick it in my shirt pocket.  I put it in "upside-down", so that the "skip-to-next-track" button is ready at hand at the top of my pocket, and I'm ready to go.  My only beef with the player is that the menu controls are, shall we say, VERY non-intuitive.  Of course, there's only so much you can do with five buttons and two or three lines of "screen" to work with.  It took my a good two or three minutes of hunting thru the menus (much of that time spent retracing steps because I had pressed the wrong button) just to get to the selector that puts it in Shuffle mode.  (Note: I have not tried the radio or the voice recording feature -- I bought the thing just to play music, and those features are irrelevant to me.)  I found the earbuds a bit uncomfortable, but that's going to be a very personal thing for each user.  I went out and bought a simple pair of wrap-around-the-back-of-the-head headphones, which came with its own volume control.  Now I'm all set.  I am already quite surprised at how this has changed my listening and even my exercising habits.  With about 150 tracks (some of mine are long symphony movements), I've got plenty of variety when I go for a long walk.  Maybe someday I'll get something with more space, more features, more whatever, but that will only be because I have thought of something that this little doodad can't do.  Until then, I'm a happy camper.

<Content>Although I anticipated sitting down with the instructions and carefully learning how to fill my player with the podcasts I'd downloaded after I'd done my Saturday errands, I couldn't resist opening the package first thing in the morning and plugging the device into my computer.  Without reading anything, I figured out, using the Windows media player, how to sync audio into the player, and had hours of entertainment all weekend. Probably the hardest part was getting the thing out of the shoplifter-resistant hard plastic card--I wonder why, since Amazon shoppers don't have the opportunity to slip items into our pockets without paying for them, Amazon can't get these goods from manufacturers in ordinary cardboard boxes!  Oh, and filling the 1 gig was impossible.  All the podcasts I'd downloaded, two books I'd bought from Audible, and there's still room left over.  I can't imagine needing more memory.

<Title>If using for Audio Books read this
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this unit to use for listening to Audio Books. I read the reviews here and decided on this unit. There is one detail I didn't come across in any of the reviews that has a big impact on using this unit for books. The counter only counts to 18 hours. During the first 18 hours each time you turn the unit off it starts where you left off when you turn it back on. If your book exceeds 18 hours the counter starts over again at 0. When you turn the unit off and then turn it on again, you are in the first 18 hours of the book, not where you left off in the second 18 hours. You then have to fast forward 18 hours to the point you stopped. If your book exceeds 36 hours the counter starts over again at 0 and it becomes a real nightmare getting to your place again. I did contact the help desk and they said there was no solution to this problem.  That being said, if your books are all under 18 hours this unit is great. It is very easy to use. Transferring files is easy even for someone who is not very computer savvy.

<Title>Best Bang for The Buck

<Content>From the moment of purchase till today I am very pleased with this unit.I didn't even have to load the driver provided.It was just plug and play....Loaded 256 songs in Wma format!Battery life is unreal.The only thing I don't like are the earphones....Sound reproduction is good,But I never liked that style of headphone;shoving something inside your ear...So,I replaced them with a standard headphone set.  Don't guide yourself by the name of the product.It's a Winner at a great price....

<Content>This player works exactly as discribed.  The sound quality is excellent and it was very easy to work with.  I had 5 CD's transfered onto it within minutes of opening the package.  Well worth the money.

<Title>Owned three other Mp3 players, all more expensive, this the best

<Content>This player is way better than the Samsung YP-T8X and IPod Mini and Nano.  This one has not frozen, the LCD has not died, and the software hasn't crashed, just to name a few of what the others have done ( this is with minimal use, never dropped any of them and left them carefully on my desk when not in use).  I have 202 songs on my Sandisk, all transferred quickly and safely.  I run on our treadmill about a mile almost every day, and the included case and armband are very nice for this, much more useable than a belt clip.  Like the IPod and unlike the Samsung, you can also make playlists on it.  I think that even if you have more money you should buy this player, unless you need video or picture viewing.  I have had mine for over a month, and my liking for this player has not faded.

<Title>Good price but...

<Content>The manual that comes w/this mp3, is horrible.I had this mp3 for about a year, and I still can't figure out how to erase the music from the player. Very annoying. Also, there is no title of the album or the name of the song, can't figure out that part as well.Very confusing.
