<Title>The Way it Should Be
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My wife and I had previously owned two Philips GOGear HDD6330 30GB mp3 players and had many many problems. Mostly with syncing the songs onto the devices and also some with proper playback. The interface was also not as nice nor responsive as the iPod. So we returned the Philips players and got an 80GB and 30GB iPod. Neither has let us down once. They sound great, the battery lasts for days (4-6 hours a day use). itunes is very easy to use and seems to almost know what you need to do before you do. podcasts are neat and free, you can download tons of videos from google video, you can put pictures on it, no problems finding accessories. It is really just night and day vs. the current windows based offerings. On the 80GB iPod we have about 6,500 songs, 50 videos, 200 photos, and all of our outlook contacts and it is only about half full. Not to mention the games that come with it. If you don't mind spending a little more for quality, this is the way to go, it just works.   My wife uses the 30GB white version and loves it. it does have a lot less space and shorter battery life than the 80 GB, but it is much slimmer feeling as far as the thickness and still has all of the other features that make iPods so great. We also both sync using the same itunes without any problems (turn off auto syncing to do this and drag songs etc to device.) This was not the case when we both were using Philips GoGears and Windows Media Player. Everyone else that I know that owns an iPod has never said anything bad about them, Apple really has a winner here, it would take a lot of convincing to ever switch me back over to windows based mp3 systems.

<Title>Great product, buy one today!  But . . .
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>don't buy it here.  Go to the Apple store either online or a retail location.  There you will get the product and support you need and you won't have to wait a month or so to get that wonderful Amazon message that says they can't fill your order at this time, but would you like to wait?  And after 4 months or so of not getting your new ipod, just try getting your money back from Amazon.

<Title>Great, but has a sluggish interface
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I upgraded from the previous generation iPod (4g), and expected this new iPod to be better in every way...well it is better in every way but one.  The interface is comparatively very slow to respond to input.  When you try to navigate through your songs, there is always a slight delay.  And when you scroll through your music, it goes scroll scroll stop (for a quarter second)...scroll scroll stop. Overall this is a great player, and I am surprised they didn't put a faster processor in there.

<Title>ipod or zune...???
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>well let's take a quick look at both of them, which one's sexier? well for me ipod is way sexier than zune (besides zune looks really bulky). Zune's screen is bigger, but i guess the screen is not a big problem is it? ipod's wheel make navigating through menus easier, while zune has a pad instead of a touch-sensetive wheel. The wireless thing would be really cool if you could actually keep the songs you receive!! but no, they only last 3 days, and you can only play them 3 times, now that sucks. If you want an MP3 for christmas, i'd really recommend ipod, cause zune just isn't as good as ipod. Yeah microsoft may rule at computers, but they suck at making MP3 and videogames. So that's all i have to say for now, hopefully this helped you realized that ipod is the best MP3 out there.

<Title>Moving on to Bigger and Better
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own both the iPod (5.5) and the Zune - buy a Zune. Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant "let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel" navigation "aid" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion.

<Title>A Great Buy for Kids and Adults!
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted an Ipod video really bad for my thirteenth birthday, but my parents said that it was too expensive. So, you can imagine my surprise of seeing the Ipod video box nestled under the wrapping paper! The first thing I did with it was connect it to our Mac and download the songs from Itunes onto it. The Ipod downloaded the songs quite fast (I was very impressed! It took my sisters nano forever!). I then went to check out the movie store and bought Harry Potter and Napoleon Dynamite. After, I downloade Pac- Man from the games section. I played around on it until my mom said I had to go to bed. I didn't feel tired, so I brought my Ipod with me and watched Napoleon Dynamite under the covers and a couple Tv shows until midnight!                The next Night, my friend Alexis had a sleepover, and I decided to bring my iPod to it (I have trouble sleeping at other people's houses, it freaks me out). When I was in the bathroom changing into my PJs, my friend Mary was in my bag looking for Chapstick that I said I'd lend her. She saw the Ipod in there and showed it to everyone else. When I came out, they were all looking at it, amazed that it could do so many things! When they saw me, they rushed up to me and started asking me questions. The rest of the night went on as normal. We did each other's hair, a couple girls played Pac man and watched Hannah Montana on my iPod (I don't like Hannah Montana! I swear! It was already on iTunes!). When it was finally time for bed, I couldn't sleep (duh) so I got out my iPod. I guess I wasn't the only one not asleep, because my friend Alexis saw me and asked what I was doing. We watched Harry Potter together, and Napoleon Dynamite! When we knew we had to sleep, it was 5 a.m.! This iPod is addictive!                        Of course, nothing can be perfect. I know you didn't want to waste your time reading me babble on about how great the iPod video is. It scratches a lot! I'd invest in a case to protect it. Whe I'm scrollinng through my music, the scroll sometimes stops for a second, not that important, but extremely annoying. Also, the scroll wheel is smaller, which means that it takes longer to go through your music.                 There are also a lot of new features with the iPod video. There's the combination lock, where you can set a password so that only you can get into it. Also, it's the only iPod able to play games and videos (duhhhhhh). REASONS KIDS LIKE IT... It's great on long trips like feild trips, to pass time. All of your friends like it (this can also be a bad thing! It scrartches easily when your friends handle it roughly! Please be careful.) The games are lots of fun when you have free time in school (be sure that your teachers will let you bring your iPods to school.) When you can't sleep, the movies are a great way to pass time REASONS ADULTS LIKE IT... It's functional and practical Very portable You can use it in work while your boss drones on and on (or so my mom says...) My dad says that the podcasts are fun to watch (I like Strong Bad ones) TIPS: Invest in a case! I cannot say this enough! You'll regret it if you dont! I recomend the Belkin Brushed Metal/Acrylic Case for iPod. It comes in Light Green, Teal, Pink, and Silver! I have the Teal one, it makes my iPod video look like it came blue!

<Content>You simply can't match the value you get for the price of this gorgeous iPod. The ability to view and show others your photos and watch video is priceless. The quality of the video and images is simply incredible. This is my second iPod (the first being a 10 GB white click wheel I had for over 3 years) and I have convinced so many of my friends and family to get them. I have been able to watch almost two hours of TV shows on an airplane with no problem (haven't tried watching a full-length movie yet). Overall this is a fantastic product for the money and you will not regret your purchase!

Last month I was looking for an iPod for my sister, which should cost maximum 50-80$ and then I found this one - and fell in love with it :-)  It was in the "Refurnished"-category, but actually I couldn't find any bigger scratches or other problems and now I've already been listening to it every day and it's just great! The battery works really long and the 30GB of memory are just...awesome :-) Thanks very much for this great item!

<Title>Nice video player - try it with TiVo
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>What can you really say about the iPod that hasn't been written already. I'll try one thing: as a commuter who own Tivo at home, I love being able to Tivo movies (TCM - Turner Classic Movies - has them without commercials!), transfer them wirelessly to my Mac computer, then export them to iPod-viewable format for me to watch on my iPod to and from work. Much easier than watching movies on a laptop. (If you do this, record the movies "Basic" quality on Tivo and the encoding and exporting will go much faster and the file size will be reduced - and the quality of the picture will be indistinguishable from "Medium" or even "High" when viewed on your iPod

<Title>Mounting issues 
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm the veteran of many IPod models, and have worked with all of them on various Macs and PCs.  My advice is to get the biggest one you can afford, load it up, and don't count on it ever interfacing with your computer again.  An absolutely wonderful device once you get it loaded, but horrific in terms of consistently being recognized by either your desktop or itunes itself.  I'm still happy I have my current 30 gig model since it's loaded with just about everything I'd care to listen to anyway - and for that reason alone it was worth the money - but I'm amazed at how popular a product it remains (especially the smaller ones) given how poorly it fares with both firewire and usb connectivity.

<Content>Excellent product Apple! I've owned this product 2 years from now, and I'm still using it.  There are 2 ways of using it, 1. As a music player 2. as an external hard drive. I like those ideas! that's what made me give up on my new iPod Touch and return back to using my iPod Video.  I strongly disagree that it is prone to finger prints, mine is perfectly clean, like it was new from the box. On, the front, there are absoloutly no scratches, but there are a few on the back.  Pros  -Long battery life -Can be used as an external hard drive -Games -Contacts -Screenlock  Those are all I can remember from the Pros of my iPod, and now the sad part ...  Cons  -Lacks built-in FM radio tuner -Lacks coverflow  I really like this product, I'll be keeping it with me a few more years, then I'll get a new one.

<Content>I always told myself I would never give into the Ipod trend... but last weekend I broke down and bought myself the 30gb black video Ipod. I'm already in love with it... it's my new baby! It's very simple to use, sounds great, and looks good. I love the fact that there are so many accessories available for Ipods too! I was so close to buying a Creative Labs Zen W but backed out because of it's huge size and lack of accessories.  One disadvantage is that it gets fingerprints on it VERY easily- you MUST use a case with it! Another small gripe about it- I don't think you can use wallpaper or a screensaver with it, which is something I really think would enhance the whole Ipod experience... maybe I'm just too new to the whole thing and I can't figure out how to do it- but it doesn't look like you can customize the interface like that.

<Title>I hate this thing
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this thing for about 12 hours now, and I'm about ready to chuck it out the window and let it rust away in the snow.  First thing you should know...there's no AC adapter in the box.  You have to buy one separately.  Yeah, I know, you charge it by connecting it to your computer.  That's kinda handy, since you don't need another AC to plug in.  But it does me no good on the road.  Sure, you can purchase an AC adapter separately, but this is the only device I've ever seen that didn't have one in the box.  Lame.  Second thing you need to know...the installation software is not in the box.  You have to download it from the Internet.  It took 5 stinking hours to download the da*n software.  Yeah, I know...they recommend you have a broadband connection.  But not everyone has access to broadband.  So ruralites like me, who live in an area with no broadband and lousy phone lines...it's going to take hours to download.  They save a couple bucks by not putting in a CD.  I spend 5 hours to download.  I don't know about you, but my time's worth more than $0.20 an hour.  Lame.  iTunes, the software that you're supposed to use to manage your files, doesn't suit my needs.  I use an MP3 player to listen to audio books while I'm driving.  I have all the MP3 files on my computer, from when I ripped them from the (legally purchased) CDs back when I had my iRiver.  All I needed to do was copy them to the iPod and listen to them.  It should be so simple.  You can copy the files to the iPod without installing the software, but you can't listen to them.  Then when you install iTunes, you cannot access the files (until you check the checkbox that lets you manage the files yourself, and find where to Save that change).  Once you do that, you can put them into the Library. Lame.  iTunes also does not let me customize the Library.  I don't need "Movies", "TV Shows", "Radio", or "Podcasts".  I need "AudioBooks", and I can't add it (and I can't remove Movies, etc.).  I also can't create folders in the Library.  All my audio-book files (which were nicely organized in folders on my computer) get dumped into the "Music" folder without the folder structure.  Sure, I can create Playlists for each book, and I can create folders to organize the Playlists.  But I have to dig through thousands of files in the Music Library to populate the Playlists.  And besides, I already have them organized.  Now I have to do it again.  Lame.  And this blasted wheel control on the iPod.  Sure, after some practice I'll get the hang of it.  But you know...you shouldn't have to practice to be able to use it.  I didn't have to practice to use my iRiver, I could use it right away without problems.  If this thing doesn't last longer than my iRiver did, I'm going to be really angry.

<Title>My first iPod
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I have read all the reviews from the "haters" of the iPod and it makes me wonder why these people even bought one in the first place if they don't like it. On the other hand, I love mine! There are a ton of accessories for the iPod and it's just simple to use (Apple's catch phrase of "it just works" that they use for the mac applies here).   I have owned a couple of mp3 players over the years and recently bought a zune to see what it is like in the real world. Let me put it to you this way, the zune is back with amazon. After using the zune for a week and then going back to my iPod, the iPod is by far the better device. Much more simple to use and a "sexy" device (as one reviewer described it).   Apple has always designed beautiful products that are also functional. So what if you have to download iTunes? Most of the people who own the iPod have broadband internet access anyways (and a mac on top of that).   I know that if you spend the money on this device you won't be sorry. My only reccomendation would be to get a case for it (if nothing else other than to not have to carry it in your pocket).

<Title>The best disk based MP3 player bar none
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my fourth MP3 player. I have previously owned a 4th generation, 40GB iPod, a Creative Zen Touch 20GB and currently own a Sandisk 1GB flash player as well as the new, black, 30GB, 5th gen video iPod. When I opened the box and took out the player, I was amazed at just how slim it is. The 40GB 4th gen iPod I had was much thicker. I would think that the 80GB 5th gen model would be about the same thickness as my 4th gen model. The screen is larger and very clear. I orginally just wanted a music player but after downloading some video podcasts (free from iTunes) and seeing just how high the video quality is, I am really glad that I have the option to play videos as well as music. After getting used to the Zen Touch's scroll bar, I forgot just how comfortable it is to use he iPod's click wheel, it is the most natural interface I can imagine (other than voice) and is a joy to use except for the fact that clockwise is down and anti-clockwise is up. I can't recall if it has always been that way with iPods but to scroll down I naturally want to scroll 'anti' (I'm right handed) and I am finding it a little odd to have to do the opposite(maybe it's just me). Sound quality is very good - not better than the Zen Touch, but very good. I wish there was customizable EQ settings but maybe that will come with a future firmware upgrade. Using iTunes is a joy. I know how restrictive it is but I just love the interface and its functionality. I love the fact that after subscribing to podcasts it will download new episodes automatically and then sync then to the iPod; kind of like a DVR series recording feature. The lack of a dock (which came with the 4th gen iPod I had) and also a mains charger is a bit of a pain but I guess the exclusion of these have helped bring the price of the iPod down to a a very reasonable level so I can't complain. Battery life is much better than the 4th gen iPod and I believe that the sound quality is too. One thing, the iPod I got from Amazon looked like it had defaulted to Khazakstanise but fiddling about with the settings (and hoping for the best) enabled to me to change the language to English so don't panic if the first time you hook it up you can't understand a word! The iPod, still the King, as these latest models show.

<Title>great addition/upgrade to my iPod collection
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got into the iPod scene rather late in the game. My first iPod was a first generation iPod that I bought used a little less than two years ago. It was a little too bulk for my main uses which are mainly working out and walking. I upgraded to a new 4GB iPod Nano and loved it. I was starting to run out of space on my Nano, so I was fortunate to receive the 30 GB iPod as a gift. I'm already a fan of iTunes and the various features of the iPod family, bu the new feature that I like most about this iPod is its video capability. Even though friends had told me that watching video on the iPod was not bad, I had my doubts. However, after taking my new iPod on a transatlantic flight and watching a couple of episodes of Law & Order, I have to say that I was very satisfied with the quality of the picture. It sure helped to pass the time. For some reason I did not get the 3.5 hours of video playback that Apple claims. In fact my battery was almsot drained in a little under 2 hours...perhaps my iPod was not fully charged. In any case, it seems that there are a lot of small external power/battery options that will get my iPod across the Atlantic next time. I should note that this iPod is perhaps a little too bulky for my workouts...fortunately I still have my Nano for the gym.

<Title>Only a few minor glitches....
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, this thing is pretty awesome. I am 13 and it holds everything that I need, and I see now that I didn't need the 80GB. I will say that you need to immediately buy a case and AC adapter right when you get it, if you plan to bring it in the car. The case is something you ABSOLUTELY have to have, unless you want a smudged, scratched, finger-printed ipod. Also, I have the white and my friend has a black one, and the white doesn't show the scratches quite as badly. Skip the rhinestones and glitter, girls, because you need a case on your ipod more than you need extra sparkles to show off!!!! But, there are lots of positive aspects to this player as well. First, the screen is alot brighter and I don't know what the people are talking about who say the screen is dull. Remember to turn on the backlight while watching movies. My 17 year old sister has a Creative Zen, and the Ipod is better. But not by much. The ipod has the click wheel and is alot easier to find your way around it and navigate through than the Zen. If you are looking for a media player that is easy to navigate, stylish, fun, popular, and useful, get the 30GB ipod, unless you need a  TON of space, in which case I would recommend the 80GB. I hope you enjoy your player!!!!!!!!

<Title>Great for the music fan, but go to the 80gb model for the video fan

<Content>I have been an Ipod fan for a while and was thrilled to see this new Ipod come out in 30GB with video capability, color screen and the whole works. This is a perfect item for those who want to carry around the bulk of their music but don't have the need for hard drive sized storage. For those like me who have hours of tv shows and movies I like to carry around, the 80GB version is definitly the better way to go. The battery life is excellent and the color screen is crisp and clear, although I still hate the earbuds with a passion bordering on wanting to crush them with a bat.   The casing is sleek, and seems to have mostly eliminated the problems of scratching the first generation Nano's had. The price point seems well suited for Christmas buyers. Think about the type of use you want to get out of it, and then make the your decision. No matter what, you can't go wrong. If there are mechanical issues, Apple will fix them under the warranty, but a protective case is a highly recommended addition. If you know you are going to get the 30GB model, wait a few weeks after Christmas. The price points usually drop a bit as Apple gets ready to start rolling out updated models in the summer.  A.G.

<Title>Nifty
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my 30G iPod.  I currently carry in the neighborhood of 5,000 songs with me wherever I go.  Rating songs and making smart playlists on iTunes really allows me to enjoy all my music in a way that would be very difficult to pull off any other way.  The Pod itself is well-built, the menus are easy to navigate and the screen is nice.    Why not 5 stars?  There are a few things that I don't like or understand.  Not only can I not transer songs/playlists from one computer (home) to another (work), I can't hook up my iPod and play them through the second computer at all.  Yes, you can transfer them over like a jump drive but why do I have to go through the extra work of rating songs and making playlists when I've already spent a ton of hours doing it once?  I can also only acquire songs to my library via the first computer.

<Title>What if it's stolen?  NOTHING!
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iPods are hot.  Because they're hip, because of their size, because of their re-sale value, and because Apple does NOTHING to help if an iPod is lost or stolen, many of them are indeed hot.  Once connected to a computer on the Internet, Apple could *very easily* render an iPod that's been reported stolen to become inoperable, and request that it be returned to an Apple Store, no questions asked.  However they know that by doing this it would cut into their profits.  Instead of returning a lost/stolen iPod, the victim is expected to buy a new one, and the recipient of the "acquired" iPod will likely buy songs through iTunes.  It's not a bug -- it's a feature!

<Title>My second opinion on the iPod
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I hated iPod (something to do with my first one literally blowing up) But I gave it another chance, and to my surprise, it's been working great. I give the actual product 5 stars, but I loathe iTunes, seeing as how I had to delete all my music from it since I ran out of memory on my HD. Luckily you're able to set it to manual sync, meaning your iPod won't automatically sync the content currently on your iTunes account, or in my case LACK of content. It's inevitable, but I'm gonna have to eventually upload all my albums again. A simple "load content from iPod to iTunes" feature would do wonders for me.

<Title>Short Life
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ipods are great when they are working. 30 GB was more memory than I'd ever need to take my whole music collection with me and an occasional movie. On the downside, it is was not very customizable, but that was really minor.  The major problem I had with it was that it only lasted a year. That is really horrible. I don't know if it's the battery or the hardrive, but either way it's not worth the money to get it repaired.  I'd hope the new Ipods last longer.

<Title>The Best Gift EVER!!
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my IPOD for Christmas 2 years ago. How cool is it to be able to upload your CD collection .. up to 7500 songs on the 30GB.. onto ONE little IPOD!!?? And never have to mess with CDs and CD cases again! Frees up your shelves at home (no more CD library!!), and makes long commutes to work in the car much more enjoyable!  I have an IPOD dock that is hooked up to my home stereo as well. I can't say enough about how great this thing is! The only drawback so far after 2 years of use- You can't see the touch-wheel in low light or in the dark. It would be helpful if the buttons had a backlight! Oh  and yes it scratches easily, so I think it should come with a case or protective skin instead of having to go buy one! Other than that, great gift!!!

<Title>A wonderful albeit expensive mp3 player
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've used my 5G 30GB iPod for 2 years now as both an mp3 player and as a portable hard drive, and it has fulfilled both of those roles well.  The interface is very easy to use, and compatibility is not an issue. Being able to carry 30GB of music around is great!  I've dropped my iPod on numerous occasions-- on carpet, on hardwood floor, and even on asphalt-- and it still works like normal.  My only complaints are that the rear aluminum casing scratches very easily, taking away its aesthetic quality, and also I wish I could take my songs off the iPod without using third party software.

<Title>Great Player horrible support
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Ipod is a great device for a while, but Apple has horrible support for these devices. They were designed to be disposable which means Apple believes you should be willing to drop 250 every two years. I am glad Steve jobs is rich, but it is upsetting that he thinks the rest of the world is. Also, the warrenty says everything about apple's confidence in their product...90 days. If you want longer you have to PAY for it. This is also true for all of apple's products. Thats why I am a PC guy, if I'm oly going to get 90 days I'm not going to pay large sums of money for substandard products.

<Content>At first, I did not think I should have picked up the new Ipod so late in the year. knowing Apple, something new is coming. I picked up the the 30gb hard drive ipod to replace my 10gb one. I mostly go it to play the video. I had to feel it out for a week to see if I would keep it of just send it back. Well it's been a week and i love it.   The screen is brighter and the videos I play on it looks better on the Ipod then they did on my computer. I have not had any problems with the 30gb Ipod.  The video is great and the sound is greater. This thing has the best sound I have ever heard. The Tv Shows and the music sound great.   Apple is a great company the make great products. 5 start out of 5

<Content>Our 9 month old 30GB IPod stopped working, we sent it back in their special box, with the special tape they provide.  They say it arrived empty and they will not replace it.  DHL, which Apple forces you to use, says the box arrived untampered with.  No one will return the box to me, Apple hung up on me (after 5 hours on hold and after speaking to 5 very "apologetic" people who understood my frustration).  Apple stole my IPod.

<Title>iPod Beginner
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I purchased the iPod 30 Gb Video 5.5 geration, I had numerous questions I could not find answers to.  For those just starting here are a few facts:  - I love this model.  If I had known the capabilities I would have   purchased a long time ago. - This iPod will hold about 500 hours of audio.  That would be 38 books having 350 pages each. - Broadband connection (DSL is OK) is best for downloading books.  It took about 1.5 hours to download a 700 page book from [...]. - You can take CDs you already own, import them into ITunes on your comouter, and download them to your Ipod from there.  This includes music, lectures, talks, etc. - Since this model only plays for 14 hours between charges, I bought a Battery Extender.  Be sure to buy the one specifically for this model.  It lengthens playtime, between charges, to 42 hours. The Extender comes with a skin for protecting the iPod. - With the Extender on the iPod, it will not fit most cases or docking systems.  It does, however, fit in the Bose iPod Sound Docking System with romote control.  Icidently, this Bose system is great Bose quality and worth the money.  Bose also makes ear-buds that are incredible. - The ear-buds that came with the iPod were hard and too big for my ears.  Both Sharper Image and Bose have softer ones with better sound quality, fitting ear canals of differing size. - This model plays 3.5 hours of Video.  If you are going to use this source to play movies, you may want to consider the 80Gb that plays 6 hours of video and has 50 Gb more memory. I am happy with this model as I wanted it mostly for books, lectures, and classical music. - I recommend the 3 year warranty for the iPod and warranties, where available, for the accessories. - If you are buying a gaget to hook the iPod to your car FM, be sure it fits your car model.  I have to send back the one I chose for this reason.

<Title>Mixed Feelings
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent Product in terms of design, software functionality, evolution etc etc.  BUT they constantly have problems - I was on my 4th,.. (yes I have taken it back to Apple 3 times, from which they happily give me a new one) G4 60GB Ipod Photo. They constantly stuff up, freeze... I had one of them not work for 2 WEEKS, I tried everyday to start it and I got the unhappy Ipod face,.. I finally located an apple repairer, I took it in I went to show them what was happening and it turned on in the store (WTF???). I asked them to test it anyway. 4 Days later they said nothing was wrong with it.  So I took it back,.. only for it to STOP WORKING AND NEVER WORK AGAIN about 3 weeks later.   All of these models I took great care of, they didn't get dropped,and were in protective hard leather casing.  BUT essentially you are walking around with a portable HD,.. so come on guys,.. I don't go exercising with my laptop,.. and it is fine. In terms of exercise all that shock can't be good for the Ipod. So what do you expect?  So yes they are great things to have... yes my experience are they stuff up all the time, Apple are good with replacements... and YOU SHOULD DEF get the EXTRA APPLE CARE PLAN... though an extra $100 sucks.  Better luck with my G5? We will see fingers crossed.

<Title>Not ready for Prime Time?
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought a 30G for my daughter's birthday.  It lasted about 3 weeks before giving up the ghost.  One day we just couldn't get any response at all from the unit.  We went through all the reset procedures on the Ipod (excuse me, iPod) support site to no avail.      Amazon came through and paid the return shipping on the dead unit and sent us a new one before receiving the old one.  The new unit got here 3-4 days later and probably lasted a whole 30 minutes dying exactly the same way as the first one.    These units weren't dropped or mishandled in any way; so I believe the failures are probably due poor design or quality control on Apple's part.      I've had an Iriver 20G for a couple of years now.  I've traveled extensively with it and no problems.  So it is apparently possible to produce robust HD based units.    Anyway, I feel badly for my daughter because I think she really enjoyed it while it worked but this product appears to be a triumph of marketing over quality. .

<Title>My HD failed just as the warrenty expired!
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When it works, the iPOD is a great product. However, I'm VERY frustrated by what happens when it fails (and it will). Apple's advice? Buy a new one. I bought a 40G IPOD Photo 2 years ago for $500 plus the AppleCare 2yr protection plan ($65), plus $500 worth of iTunes. It crashed 1 month after the plan expired. Apple says there's no way to fix it and suggests I simply go out and buy another one (for $350+tax). No way! I'd never spend more than $100 for an iPOD again. And I'll never buy a hard drive based iPOD again. If I did, I'd be spending an average of $400 a year simply for the luxury of owning an iPOD -- that's nuts.

<Title>Truly stunning:  iPod does it again.
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first of its kind:  Small, sleek, and stylin'  the iPod has many new features to offer.  It now(as you already know) can play all of your favorite TV shows, Music Videos, and even Movies.  It is now also slightly adapted to the gaming world.  Some older classics such as Pac-Man and Tetris have been adapted for the Click Wheel but other new games such as Vortex are truly worth the very reasonable $5.  The iPod video is truly one of its kind and is quite remarkable.    PROS:  Great Capacity  Vibrant Color Screen  Sleek  Next Generation  All-New Download types avalible on iTunes only avalible for this model  Can put already owned DVDs on it using QuickTime 7 Pro [...]  Fits and Syncs perfectly with iTunes unlike some other media players  Almost any accesory type imaginable is made for iPod  Runs on Lithium-Ion battery  CONS:  Short battery life for long trips  Apple Brand accesories are a bit pricy  No way to change dead battery except to send it back to Apple  Scratches and gets fingerprints on it easily  Few accesories in box that would be useful such as charger for outlets(it normally charges in computer USB Port)  Needs a new USB adapter w/ power cord for power for very old models of computer(2000 or earlier ABOUT)  There are more valuable Pros than Cons when you consider a weighted system for iPod score.  I am not a music Guru and use my iPod about once or twice a week but even then it makes a great present for just about anyone at a fairly reasonable price.  Not a "Must Buy" but definately deserves considering.

<Title>Read reviews carefully
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a 3rd Generation 20GB iPod, and have had it for several years.  I use it in the car with a car adaptor, I use it around the house, and I take it to the gym with me, and I love it.  I have dropped it several times, both with and without a protective case, and it continues to work without a problem.  I think the only problem I have had with it is that my computer only has a 30GB hard drive so I had to buy an external hard drive to store backup copies of all my music without completely slowing down my laptop.  This is hardly the fault of the iPod.  The reason for writing is I just think that everyone needs to read reviews carefully.  Everyone I know has an iPod - including nanos, shuffles.  No one has ever had the problems I have read from Amazon customers.  You'd think that about half of all the iPods died, due to no fault of the user of course, and that Apple is a completely evil, unfriendly company.  Now, I'm not saying that these things don't happen.  When you mass produce any product, there are bound to be some that don't work, something we have all experienced.  (My Bissel Carpet Cleaner just died after only 8 months of use.)  However, I think we have also all had experience with people who make mistakes but somehow have an inate inability to accept responsibility for it and can only try and blame others for their mistakes.  I just wanted to say that I have had no problems with the iPod, I think its a great product, and thank god for Apple for inventing this so everyone else can be a follower and try and copy them rather than be innovative.  But in the process of reviewing products for purchase, be sure to carefully evaluate the customer comments to make sure you are getting the true picture.  (This includes even scrutinizing my review, because I'm obviously a big fan of Apple...I'm writing this in my Mac.)

<Title>Why is apple allowed to do this?
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this ipod with the naive idea that for its price and popularity it would be a quality, and at the very least reliable product. It worked as it should for the first week, after which the video playing capacity went dead.  I tolerated this for confidence that this was going to be its only defect, hopeful expectation for a product that I've later come to find has been designed to fail. The headphone jack has suddenly stopped delivering music in favor of distant muffled garble, and the charges last shorter as the battery life already starts to wane.   Anyone who even does light research on this product before purchasing will consistently find that they're systematically faulty, and extremely expensive to support and repair (but why go through the trouble when you can buy the next new model for hundreds more?). It shouldn't be legal for Apple to operate in this manner. It's an insult to the consumer, and a tragic, unnecessary setback on what could easily be a formidable piece of technology.

For no reason whatsoever, the screen has gone black with a silver apple on it.  Can't see what's playing or anything.  I tried all the steps they have to fix it.  Of course they don't.  I went to the website for help, didn't get any, uh other than being told to do the same steps that I already tried.  There is also no email address or phone number to ask for a refund.  This has only cemented my realization that Apple products are horrible and will NEVER purchase one again.  Just more money down the drain.

<Title>Why does Apple do this?
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After spending nearly $250 on an MP3 Player I must ask why Apple feels the need to nickle and dime people to buy an FM player. Creative and Sandisk both include this.  However with an Ipod a $50 add on, clunky headphone is needed to get FM reception.  Obviously Apple knows they could easily and inexpensively add this to their Ipods, but I suppose since Ipods are selling like hotcakes, they feel that they can slap the cost on to the consumer.  I like the product overall but it does irk me that they do this, because in effect, Apple feels it can.

My only complaint is that the video playing length is too short. Though yes, 3hrs is nice, I would prefer to have a bit more (5hrs?).   Kudos to Apple for making a quality product.

<Title>Bravo Apple!
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am completely happy with my ipod video. It is so great! My parents bought it for me for Christmas. I was so happy to get it. I have songs and videos on it already. The picture is amazing! I bought an episode of South Park on iTunes. It looks cool on the ipod. And I bought a movie. That was at 2:30 AM. Since then I haven't been able to download a thing. Probably because today is Christmas and a lot of people got ipods. And iTunes got a lot of people. I bought Pacman too. I like it. I have the 30 gb model. It is black. I thought it would be thick. But it isn't that thick. I am going to buy a case for it tomorrow. Along with some accessories. Since mine has a lot of fingerprints already. So if you are looking into buying an iPod buy an ipod video! Even if you only love music you will still love the video. Even if you don't watch videos a lot. As a conclusion iPods are great! And Apple has got themselves a great product.

<Title>Apple's 5.5 Generation iPod, The Step-Up From CDs
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's no doubt that CD players are still being used today, but MP3 players are still an upgrade from those players. Similar to cassettes...actually similar to an 8-track to a CD player. Everyone knows that the MP3 player market has tons of brands to choose from. Yeah there's Apple, but there's also SanDisk, Creative, iRiver, and so on. But the question is what is more user friendly. I used to own an iRiver H10 and have to say I wasted 300 bucks on that POS. Only in five months the player kept freezing and I'm ending up reinstalling the firmware every three weeks. Finally in July it completely crashed and refuses to add music.  At that point, I stated that I simply REFUSE to buy another iRiver. Not again, to Apple I come. Actually I was a little anti-Apple but it seems that millions of people have iPods and work fine, so why on earth would I have trouble? Well, I have to say, I do like my new 5.5 Gen iPod. There are a couple of annoyances but otherwise it is a very decent player.  What comes with the player is: the iPod, a USB cable/charger, earbuds, and a slip in-case to resist fingerprints and scratches. The USB cable/charger is a bit underrated by these users. Yes you must eventually buy a seperate charger for long trips but the cord was not short at all. Also it's somewhat nice to have both the home charger and USB cable all in one so I don't worry about losing anything. The earbuds are average. The have a clear sound but less than adequate bass. Also if you're using white cords it's painfully obvious that you have an iPod. I'm currently using my new jWIN earbuds that have a dark cord and sound better than the Apple earbuds. The slip-in case won't protect your iPod at all. You should definitely buy a case, which I'd recommend a camera case, they're cheap and get the job done, plus they have slots for your earbuds. However the slip-in case is good if you like your iPod to be free of scratches (like me).  The first step when you wrap your iPod is to download the software. It does take a while if you have dial-up but you, no matter what, will have to use it. iTunes is a fair program and is better than WMP in my outlook. When you have iTunes downloaded you can now import your music and then export them to the iPod. iTunes only goes by ID3 tagging, therefore if you have your music already on your computer you should be mostly set and ready to add. Just drag Music to the iPod and (ta-da sounds goes here), it's on your iPod. It didn't take me long to load my iPod (someone on here said three days, lie I think), I'd use the conversation of 15 minutes per 1,000 songs at 192 kbps. Especially a decent time since I have USB 1.1. It'll probably move faster if you used AAC but slower if you used a hefty rate like 320 kbps. The computer suprisingly ran just as well with no iPod, while when I connected my iRiver H10 it was always a big issue.  When you get your music, videos, and photos on your iPod, it's up to you at this point. The best thing I'd do is get the album artwork for any music you have on your computer already. All you have to do is go to your music, select all, and click get album artwork. You do need an iTunes account but it's very simple to set-up.  The categories on the iPod are set-up very neat, making it simple to find what you want. There's also a well designed search function which is useful if you have a large collection of music.  Otherwise, the iPod has a few extras you might enjoy. Nope, it still has no FM tuner, but I'm thinking who cares if you have such a large collection of music, which made an FM tuner not a big deal to me. It has a clock which is nice but not a biggie. It has the ability to store contacts with pictures which is a good bonus (it would be really cool to see a phone in here or wireless internet on a later generation). It also has a calendar with a built-in alarm, but the alarm isn't very loud so keep your alarm clocks. You can also enter in text files, a good idea if you're a heavy reader. A little stopwatech is also included. And if you want people to lay off your iPod, there's also a screen lock which makes it impossible for people to get in. For other settings, there's a volume limit if your buying this for a kid and don't want to kill their ears before they turn 60. You can adjust brightness and backlight settings to save some of your precious battery life.  The sound quality from the iPod is good, but I found the bassier presets to be too much and distort a bit. My heart-set preset is hip-hop, providing good but not overwhelming bass and clear mids and highs.  The iPod also features games. This was a hit or miss for me. They were fun to play but ran somewhat choppy while listening to music. Not to the point where they're unusable but slightly annoying. If you didn't know you can buy extra games for five bucks each at the iTunes store. A little pricey if you ask me, but I did end up buying Zuma and don't regret it. And of course you can buy music, TV shows, and music videos on the store as well. Movies can be purchased, but the selection is slim so you may want to check out other services for that. Gift cards are avaliable at every store in the world. I've even seen them at Walgreens!  Some annoyances (or bugs) first started on the Click Wheel. I did enjoy it and will more the next couple of weeks but there's no way to change the speed of it. I wish there was because it was way too fast for me at the beginning and was hard to play some of the games and hard to scroll through things. After a week of owning it I've adapted to it but I hope the next firmware update fixes this. It only charges through the USB which can be slightly annoying so you might want to find a USB charger to wall for trips. This may also be not a good thing for older computer users. Mine is only a year and a half old and charged through USB just fine but it might not for computer older than five years. One last annoyance (actually a bug) is that when I disconnect my headphones the song automatially stops. I'm not sure why, it could be friction from the plug, but no other player I've owned has done this before.  For durability, I've only owned it for a day so far so I will definitely do an update but so far it seems to be durable enough for me. I bought a very strudy camera case and use the soft case that comes with the iPod and I'm sure that'll protect it very well. People say it's prone to scratches and fingerprints but I'd say tat both the screen and the iPod are not too prone to scratches or fingerprints, but the back is a complete disaster. I bought the white anyway so if it does get scratched it won't be a huge ordeal.  Although some bugs need to be fixed on the 6th generation, this iPod is definitely a good upgrade from the 4th generation and an excellent upgrade from a CD player. I will update as problems or good things come up, but for now this was definitely worth the purchase and the offical step up from CDs. 4 stars.

<Content>The last reviewer bitched because of the video screen . What if you want to hook up your ipod to a tv, do the "music only" ipods allow for that? If they do then he's right theres no reason for a "video" ipod. I want the cheapest Ipod with at least 20 GB, that alows me to hook up it up to a tv. Are refurbs  anygood?

<Title>Ipod? There's still an IPod?
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>How many of you hate to deal with ITunes? I know I did when I used this device for the little time I owned it. How many of you hate to eject the IPod from ITunes before you disconnect? I did. How many of you are just sick and tired of everyone else having one of these things? Yeah, I'll admit to the hype. I jumped on the bandwagon too. But, I jumped right off when IPod gave me problems. The black screen of death. IPod works for ten minutes then never turns back on. If you want, you can get an mp3 player thats ten times better then the IPod out on the market today. The Gigabeat by Toshiba, the Zune by Microsoft, and other countless companys offer great alternatives to the IPod. I personally have never used the Zune. But, everybody I know says it's great. Way better then IPod. The one mp3 I own that works. lol. Is a Gigabeat. This product is amazing. No ITunes. No disconnecting (unless syncing, but that is every device). Uploads faster then IPod. Way quicker, about 1000 songs in 30-40 min. You can workout with it in ease. If you have used an IPod, you'll never know the difference. Controls are easy to grasp. Even a person without computer skills could master this in a week. I'm a person that likes life to be easy. The Gigabeat does just that.

<Title>Apple iPod Classic 30GB
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the 3rd generation of iPod that I have owned.  At first I was very pleased that the price has come down somewhat since I paid $239 for this and several years ago I paid nearly $400 for just the color/picture iPod.  Apple didn't take long to disappoint me when, less than a month after I purchased this, they discontinued it and was then offering the 80GB version for the same price!  That being said, my observations are as follows:  1)  Nice, sleek design.  Very functional. 2)  Easy to download or transfer videos from DVDs. 3)  Battery life appears much longer than my previous generation iPod. 4)  I've had this for about two months now and so far no problems.  I know this is what people expect, but every single iPod I've owned, I have always experienced problems that required sending the unit back to Apple for repairs.  That being said, buy an extended warranty. 5)  Screen and casing does not scratch as easily as I expected based on other reviews I have read.  As with all electronic items, just be a little careful. 6)  Overall, I'm happy with this iPod, but it's difficult for me to recommend that anyone buys it since the price can drop significantly the next day making you regret your actions!

<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine to use with the Monitor Audio i-deck speaker system and so far I can't fault it. Its very easy to use and the sound quality is excellent with this setup.   Currently I'm ripping my CD collection at 256kbps, which produces near CD quality. My only quibble is that it takes a long time for itunes to rip the CD's - but this may be my incompetence rather than anything to do with the product. However, once the iPod is connected songs are uploaded very quickly.   I haven't tried the provided earphones yet, but from what other users have said these are not worth bothering with. Compared with a previous HDD/mp3 player I bought this is vastly superior in every respect, and I now understand why Apple dominate the market for these players.

<Title>Not bad but not superb...
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm lucky my job gives us ipod videos as a job perk after your first month of employment. So I've had this since it was first released.  Pros: After almost 2 years of ownership I still haven't filled up the 30g of memory on it. I only use it for music. Good sound quality Sleek design I've not had the battery problems others have but I have a desk charger at work so I can keep mine fully charged and it does not seem to have the bugs others have had.  Cons: I cannot stand itunes! It is not intutive in the first 2 months I owned this thing I accidentaly wiped all my music off it and my ipod. Also you can only use it to find none itunes music on your intial setup(or if you have to start all over..)It would be nice to be able to do this whenever you want as I STILL use WMA for much of my collection as I dislike itunes proprietary software and want to make sure I have my music in both formats. Because I cannot copy WMA files whenever I like I have to burn my cds, then manualy add them to itunes. Twice the work...  You would think for almost 500 dollars they could give you a dang operating manual! I mean please I'm not an idiot but I swear it took me 5 minutes to figure out to turn the dumb thing ON! And a quick and dirty how to for itunes would have helped me to know what NOT to do so I didn't wipe all my music.  The stoopid thing occasionally goes bugnuts, just this week I was unable to use for two days because I could not get it to my home computer to plug it in there to get it working again...I have a charger at work so the battery was not the problem it just stopped working and this is the 6th or so time I've had this happen.  Agin for almost 500 dollars would it kill them to add fm radio, oh shush all the sattelite folks I have a very nice local station I'd love to listen to on my way into work on the bus. Or how about a voice recorder?  I have had 3 different irivers before I was given this ipod, and I still have the 1 gig I bought before I got this thing cause it has radio and voice recording which I use regularly and that machine costs a fraction of the ipod.(It's not perfect either but at least it had an on/off switch!)  All in all I won't buy an ipod once this one dies unless they do add the features I have on my iriver and dump the proprietary itunes...and never would have bought this in the first place for those same reasons.

<Title>I love my iPod!
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Why I love my iPod.  I was given an iPod as a present from a friend I had never met, but whom I only knew through email and later by phone. She had uploaded to it a variety of music, from disco and pop to classical. The iPod kind of reminded me of Sony's vintage Walkman. Remember the Sony Walkman back in the 70's? At the time, everybody had to have one. I certainly did, and it was a cool gadget that became a necessity I couldn't live without. But I soon outgrew my Sony Walkman right after high school, and listening to music while on the go became a thing of the past.  Now a few years later, I received by mail an iPod from a person I had never met. The music selection was great, but it wasn't really me to go around my everyday business with an iPod headphones stuck to my ears.  I remember how I used to make fun of Japanese people walking around with cameras attached to their necks as permanent fixtures. I quickly tossed my iPod aside--but not for very long.   I used to download audio books from the internet to later listen to on my laptop. What if I used my iPod instead? I soon learnt how to upload audio books to my iPod using iTunes, and a new world opened up for me. I now could listen to my audio books while cooking, driving, exercising, walking, sun tanning, hiking, biking... I can now easily finish two books a week, when it once took me two weeks to finish a single book. My library has suddenly grown in books that I have read or listened to. My knowledge has expanded, and my time has been put to good use. I actually am encouraged now to go for a walk by the sea, for guess what--it would be a perfect opportunity to listen to Grisham's latest court drama or King's latest horror novel. And my walks have increased in duration, for what fun it is now! And hey, my health is benefiting from all those long walks. And my spirit is uplifted from being outdoors and in touch with nature.   Going to the gym is fun too, for I can now listen to Atkins' and Dr. D'Adamo's diet books. An hour on the treadmill is not as tiring as it used to be, and time seems to flow faster. Am I really spending so much time at the gym? I must be, for hey, my abs is starting to show. Wow!   Cooking is now spent listening to the latest science books. What a joy it is to cook--I never thought it can be so instructive. And yummy my food tastes better.  And at night, just before I go to sleep, with my eyes tired, I might want to listen to a fable, and remember my days as a child, when my mother used to read to me stories at bedtime.   O how beautiful the world has become with so many words to listen to everyday!   What a great gift that iPod was! Though in all likelihood Apple designed it for music, and that's probably its biggest market, the iPod is an excellent tool to listen to audio books. If you love reading books, the iPod will speed up things a lot!!!! Your library will quickly expand with books you thought you never had time to read!  Get yourself an iPod, and all the books you've always wanted to read will suddenly be accessible.

<Content>I wish I never bought this thing !   ---------------------------- NOTE: I expect tons of negative votes on this review, because Apple is flanked by Steve Jobisciples who can't stand to have their precious items criticized with the same scrutiny the rest of the worlds consumer products are subjected to. Jobisciples love all Apple products more than the NRA loves all hollow point ammo! ----------------------------  Despite the fervor about the iPod, keep in mind some important issues and deficiencies:  1. Hard to use with more than one computer 2. Tedious and deficient computer interface to manage the iPod 3. Unreliable song playback 4. Ineffective Apple Technical Support  .... READ ON FOR ELABORATION OF THESE POINTS -----------------------------------------------  1. If you have to reinstall iTunes onto your computer, you'll have to completely format the iPod device and reload it, for my 60GB which has 40GB of music (two thirds full) it takes approximately 6 hours to reload the songs.  2. iTunes is the only interface to manage the songs on your iPod and iTunes can't be used to manage the song file. In other words, if you want to move the song file on your hard drive, you can do so but then you have to find the listing in iTunes and point the song listing to the files new location. Windows Media Player has the capability to refresh its database... ITUNES HAS NO SONG OR SONG DATABASE RELOCATION FUNCTION, so if you ever have to manage the location of song files with iTunes you have to redirect the index entry to every file. If you move a whole directory, plan on spending some time inside iTunes.  3. Some songs on the iPod just stop playing at the same point every time, they play fine on the PC with iTunes or Media Player or any other music player, but they always stop on the iPod at the same spot and skips to the next song, no matter how many times I rip the song again, no matter how many formats. (two songs so far are Moby God moving over the face of the water and New Dawn Fades from his I Like to Score CD.  4. Apple Technical support is about as helpful as hemmorhoids, they're friendly and will sit there and listen to your problem, just to say "I understand" then tell you to reset your iPod back to factory settings (essentially a format and reinstall) and you get to.... reload the songs again.  In short, Apple is behaving as they did in the 80's and early 90's by assuming because they have the market share, their design must be perfect. Similar to how they lost the desktop to Micro$oft, they're going to lose the portable music player market unless they fix some basic issues.  Which is too bad, because it would be nice to Apple hold some aspect of the consumer electronics space instead of losing it to Micro$oft (again).

<Title>Better hope it will go out in the first six months
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I originally bought this IPOD due to the fact that I am in the military and would like to be able to have the options of watching movies when I'm deployed, or listening to music at the gym.  And it was great at first, but now it constantly freezes up, will not turn on, and if I would like to get it fixed, I am going to have to pay up to $100 dollars plus tax just to ship/diagnose it since it is older than six months but less than a year.  I think that if I'm going to pay a couple hundred dollars for a product, they should at least have full warranty coverage for the first year.  Oh and in case your wondering, after researching it, I have found out that my hard disk is shot and the whole IPOD needs to be replaced.  So unless I decide to pay the shipping and handling fee, I have a $250 paper weight.

<Title>iPod 5.5 vs iPod Classic
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have this iPod 5.5Gen while my friend recently bought the new iPod Classic. I have compared the two side by side and I must say that the new Classic sports only a couple of new features against its predecessor. The price is quite a bargain though. The menu navigation on the old 5.5 is a little bit faster than the Classic. I bet this is because of the slideshow running in the background while navigating through the menu. The menus are admittedly very sluggish on the Classic as compared to the 5.5. Good points though are the "scratch-proof" surface, which I think is rather a compromise in looks for functionality. The coverflow concept is also nice but I just wished the hardware could keep up with refreshing the album art thumbnails while browsing. And don't forget to start downloading those album arts.  Back to the iPod 5.5. Well, this device has entertained me during long drives and has made me sleep for the past several months. It definitely never failed to do its purpose. I learned to love iTunes to make playlists and organize my music. But don't hesitate to use third party software like floola when you need to backup your stuff.  The bottomline is: if you are not one of the early jumpers when a new device is introduced, this device is perfectly cool for you. Honestly, I would've still bought this one now even with the iPod classic around.  Be cautious though, since this is a hard drive device. But I bet you already know that.

<Content>I love my Ipod, there is no comparison to any other ugly MP3 player. Unless of course, you are still using a PC and these new devices are too challenging (YOU HAVE TO PRESS A BUTTON???? WHY?????).

<Title>APPLE HAS THE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got an Ipod for Christmas 2006 and I instsalled Itunes and it was fine.  You probaly know that when you get an new toy like this you have questoins, right? Ihad a couple and could I find Apple address? NO!  Could I find there email? NO! There was no contact info but at the bottom of the screen it said "contact us". So I clicked on that and what did i find? NOTHING! Overall the product is great it has nice sound quality. Nice screen. Has a lot of memory! It is a great mp3!  But in Itunes you have to have the right athourization to get games or when you switch computers you have to have it too!  I rate the Ipod 99.8 out of 100 and the costumer service a 4.1 out of 100!

<Content>Moved up from a 3rd generation iPod and it is a tremendous improvement. Moved  my entire iTunes library (about 6 Gigs) in less than 5 minutes. Love the new look, and would not even try to compare it with the ugly Zune!!

<Title>Buyers beware
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My wife and son went in on a 30G Apple I-Pod for dad's (me) Christmas gift.  I was elated, having wanted one of these forever.  I'm a professional musician and the idea of being able to store my entire CD collection as well as hundreds of  my own studio recordings certainly appealed to me.  Well, my Christmas was ruined by getting a gift that was totally useless without I-Tunes.  My computer's operating system won't run I-tunes 7 which I learned too late is the ONLY way you get anything on or off an Apple I-Pod.  I understand the reason for I-Tunes and I'm sure Steven Jobs is a hero with the music industry.  But it's almost like buying a PC and expecting to run it without Windows.  I have hundreds of mp3 files in my computer that I wanted to be able to take with me.  I was dumb enought to think I could transfer those directly into my I-Pod.  No way.  If you're looking to do same, the I-Pod is not for you unless you have a Mac running OSX and I-Tunes 7 installed.

<Title>Are u Kidding????
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking forward to buying an ipod for myself,until my niece asked me to help her load music on hers. She had a $25 dollar gift card for music and video. The design was light weight and modern 1 star. The functions were excellant video and music at high quality 2nd star. I Think that sums up the pros. Cons- You have to PAY ( even with the gift card) to subscribe to a sight to download music. After paying $280 I was expecting a month or so of a free subscription. YOU STILL HAVE TO BUY THE MUSIC AND VIDEO. Which I puchase from Yahoo and (Walmart 88 cents)* You don't even get a nice discount for your paid subscription. At this point, I knew I would look for a media player with more options then their (monopoly-like loading options). I could not tranfer or convert music to transfer from my PC. I'M BUYING A CREATIVE ZEN OR iRIVER!

<Title>Amazingly Good!!!!
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just purchased this 30GB iPod the other day at Best Buy for a good price. I was immediately impressed how wonderful and compact this iPod was. The video quality is amazing, the sound is amazing, everything about it is wonderful in my opinion. The only bad things about it are the headphones, fingerprints easily, and scracthes easily. For having a wide span of a music collection this just about fitted all of my music. Now i have to go out and buy the accessories for the car, etc. I would highly recommend this to any music lover looking to store a library of music on this compact iPod. 5 Stars!!!!!!!

<Title>Surprised... It's pretty good
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wasn't really that into the iPod craze a few years ago or even today.  I collect music and like reviewing music, spinning tunes and putting together playlists and specials for some of my friends.  Heck, I still hunt religiously for good vinyls (just check the reviews lol).  Long story short, the woman :) knew that I lugged my cd's around with me and wanted to get me an iPod.  But I wasn't wed to the iPod idea or Apple and because I collect, I figured that I didn't really need iTunes, (downloading tunes) and I'd heard the horror stories behind Apple, iTunes and how seemingly obsessed they are with proprietary information.    So I picked up a Creative player instead.  It was very nice... a Zen Sleek.  But it had this nasty habit of crashing... too frequently.  Finally, it just stopped working about 6 months after getting it, so I thanked the heavens for the insurance I got from a popular electronics store, and went ahead and got this 30G iPod and honestly haven't regretted it.  Granted, I thikn the drawback to me was iTunes... I could've done without having to download that program.  But I do like that Apple uses Gracenote, who helps with linking the titles of some of the off-beat stuff in my collection.  Once I figured out how to really use iTunes though, it wasn't that bad of a system... not as good or in-depth as others but I like that you can just go into the iTunes store, get a song from .99, and have it synced to your system, etc.  You can also put in a few tv shows in it (maybe not a few... but many!), like Robot Chicken, etc.    It's not perfect though.  I think if there are any drawbacks, it's that if you use the light, the battey drains quickly.  Also, I think the iTunes store could be organized a bit better.  And the screen scratches extremely easy - if you do get this, you definitely want to get a tough screen protector, and even put that into a cloth pouch.  I have mine completely in a Belkin hard case, and a pouch.  And of course, I guess the iPod doesn't support all MP3 formats, so you have to convert the files.  While you can fool around with that, at the end of the day, realize that you still may need some re-writes to back-up your music if you want to switch away from the iPod in the future.  Last but certainly not least, the sound quality of the headphones in the package are crap.  And that's being generous.  So if you can, you'll want to get a good set of headphones (Sony, Phillips, etc.).  I mean really, I don't know how Apple can use those obnoxious people dancing around with those white headphones stuck in their ears, looking as if they're having seizures when the music sounds like rubbish through them.  So expect to spend at least another $50 on accessories if you get this.  Still, I've been enjoying my MP3 player.  I was pleasantly surprised by Apple and recommend it. Oh... some bits of advice, get the insurance (from wherever you get it) and I'd hardly recommend getting one used.  Also, definitely shop around... I'm still not an "iPod for life" person and if the Zune was around before hand or been more established, I might've checked that one out instead and I think the Creative ones hve improved - the sound at least in the headphones they provided was infinitely better than Apple's.  But as it stands, this one is better than the Creative one I used to have in that it hasn't crashed & I'm enjoying using the store, etc. so I like it.  And I suppose the moral of the story is, the woman was, as usual, correct & it's good to carry so many songs of mine and hear them whenever I want without throwing out my back with them in my record bag/back-pack.

<Content>I love my ipod, i got it for christmas and have been using it. People don't know if you turn off the light while listening to music the battery doesn't run out fast, when you have the light on you can tell the battery goes fast. Try it, you might think it's stupid but when you try it you'll thank me!

<Content>This ipod is amazing! I got one for Christmas and it works perfectly! The picture quality is amazing, and the screen is incredibly clear! I'm not sure why people say the Zen is so much better, because my brother has one of those and the ipod's screen is MUCH better. The only negative thing is that it still scratches SO EASILY! If you get one, when you are removing it from the box be EXTREMELY careful! Get a case before you hold it and get scratches and fingerprints on it. Also, the ipod never stalls and is never sluggish. I never have to turn it off and then on again! I would definetley recommend this product!

<Content>I normally do not take the time to write reviews.  But, this produst is great.  You CAN upload your cd collection, and any of your own mp3 files from you computer.  You have to have windows 2000 sp4 or windows XP sp2 or later on your copmuter.  There really is not any difference between the creative zen product and ipod (I have both) except that the ipod is sleeker.  Everyone complaining about having to buy songs from itunes, not an issue if you have cd's.  I have 27gb of music/videos, and I have NEVER bought a thing from itunes.
