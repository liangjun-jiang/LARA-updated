<Title>Excellent Choice for anyone
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am not a computer geek like some people, but with a little practice, I found the Flash Trax XT an excellent device.  It was a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved it.  The 80 GB is tops and I recommend that if anyone decides to purchase this device, make sure you get the 80 GB and you will really appreciate your choice as you become accustomed to it's capabilities.  The only down side that I found was that the instructions may not have been as detailed as they could have been, but then sometimes a little less information is better then to much.  I travel a lot and I have no regrets on this purchase and have really enjoyed all that it can do.  My wife tells me that I use her present more then she does.  Overall, it is fantastic!

<Title>Flash Trax XT memory card reader
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my Flash Trax XT today and was shocked to discover that it won't read Sony Memory Sticks. I tried to see if they have an adapter so that the reader will read my memory sticks but none is available. I can't understand why it does not support one of the most widely used memory cards in the world. Or at the very least have and adapter at a reasonable price that I can buy. Why was the fact that memory sticks don't work in this device not made clear in the buying information. The player looks like it is a very nice unit but I'll never know..........

<Title>A solid product.  I'd give it a 4.5 if there was that option.

<Content>I just got one of these to go with my new 10MP DSLR camera/memory hog so that I won't need to sort through 50 CF cards to keep track of my pictures when I travel.  The folding lid is great to protect the screen, buttons logically laid out, and the menus are easy to navigate.  The MP3 and movie players are an awesome bonus for long flights or train trips.  The built in FM radio is pretty cool too.    It's a little bit of work to manage files using their push-button navigation structure, but it's a small inconvenience for everything else it does.  It's easiest to wait till you plug into your PC to deal with that stuff.  Battery life could be a little better, but I haven't quite run it dry yet.  Get the 80GB!  MP3's & a few movies will take up a bit of space before you ever transfer your first CF card of photos.

<Content>It is a great item except it will not accept cards of more than 1G. It chokes on anything larger. I was assured by the company it would work with my 2G cards, but it does not.  While talking with technical support they revealed the unit will not work with anything larger than 1G. It will sometimes work with a 2G card, but rarely.  If you use nothing larger than a 1G card the product is great.

<Title>Like trying to transport an egg
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the XT 80GB and while it does take some time to learn how to use it to its full potential, transfering files between my camera (+2GB CF cards) and my computer was extremely straight-forward.  My caution (and reason for the low rating) is this: even with the flip screen to protect the LCD, my LCD cracked within 3 months of purchase. It's not like it was being tossed around, or just thrown into a backpack. I've invested alot in my kit and use well-padded cases and packs to transport my equipment. The XT was snuggly and securely padded above and below in the heart of carry-on sized Tamrac Cyberpack8 for a short flight. No turbulence, nothing cramping it, even a case in the outer pocket didn't break.  Maybe it was a fluke, but I thought the price was a bit too good for 80GB of storage when i bought it; shoulda known better.  Just as a note - I gave it 2 stars because even though the screen doesn't work, I can still back up cards and download them with the same interface (obviously) on my computer. The drawback is that i can't confirm the transfer to the unit and might lose parts of a shoot - which is why it's just collecting dust in a closet right now - but it is still usable in a limited sense
