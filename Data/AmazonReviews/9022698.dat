<Title>Good, not perfect
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched lots of hard drive mp3 players before buying one a year and a half ago. All the reviews I read said the Carbon was the best value for what I was looking for, so I decided to go for it because I-pods seemed over-rated and too expensive. I had no problem with it for about 7 months and then it stopped working for no good reason. Tech support sent me a new one and now all is well. It works fine, but there are some little quirks. The interface is not the most user friendly, and the clock refuses to work on mine, for example. Those things being said, I still give the carbon 4 stars because they aren't that annoying.  On the plus side, it can play lots of different types of files, has a built-in microphone and a long-lasting battery, which lasts twice as long and takes exactly half as long to charge as an ipod mini. It has a sleek look,fits easily in my pocket and doesnt feel fragile. I like the Carbon wheel better than the I=pod wheel. Someone on this site said they have had 3 different players and the wheel broke on all of them. I simply can't believe that that person wasn't just really really dumb. The wheel is perfectly sturdy. The case they give you doesn't have a belt clip and you need to take it out of the case to press the buttons, but you can buy a better one.  Rio seems to have really good tech support. I think they realize that their products are a bit quirky and they don't give you a hard time about getting a new one (this is based on my experience and that of one of my friends). All in all, I know four people who have a carbon (including me) and two of them broke and were replaced, so guess you just get lucky or you don't. That said, I know a few people who have I-pods that just cut out for no reason and/or don't charge properly, and they dont have good customer service to even it out because I-pods are so popular. So, in conclusion, this is not a perfect player by any means, but I'm happy with mine, and it's still a good value.

<Title>My third Rio product - this was a super deal!
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apparently unlike many of the reviewers here at Amazon, I have been pleased with Rio products thus far - first one was one of those little 126k MP3 players, then moved up to a Cali 256k.  I'm very accustomed to using Rio's Music Manager software as a result.  Anyways...I've been wanting to get a player that would be compatible with Napster2Go, but until recently most of the subscription-based players have cost $200 or more...too pricey for me :) so when I saw the Rio Carbon selling for $99 here at Amazon I jumped on it, and boy am I glad I did (granted, I've only had it for a week or so).  While I did have some issues installing the software and getting my PC to 'see' the Carbon I got a great deal of assistance from the forums at riovolution.com and rioworld.org - including a link to version 3.02 of the driver for the Carbon.  Once I uploaded that, it was smooth sailing...so far anyway.  The carrying case could've been better (what no belt clip???) but fortunately there are compatible cases out there - it would have been nice if the case that came with allowed the user to view the screen and the controls without having to take the player out.  Anyway - so far so good, in fact I'm considering buying another one for the hubby - being able to use Napster 2 Go is totally awesome!  I've downloaded 150 songs so far and barely used any of the Carbon's storage room...

<Title>0 stars - piece of *%$&
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've probably used this thing for 10 minutes in all the time I've had it and spent hours trying to get it working. Don't bother wasting your money.  First, it didn't power up at all.  then, it powered up but the pc no longer recognized it.  I finally got it all working AND charged up the battery, upgraded the firmware, etc.  Unplugged it to listen to it and what do you know?  None of the buttons are reponding.  It looks like it's cycling through the songs but can't hear anything.  Now it doesn't get recognized by the pc OR the power adaptor.  Nice.  Pushing the reset button does nothing.  If you do buy this, make sure you start TRYING to use it right away so you can get your money back.  I waited too long til the warranty was over.  I spend my whole day dealing with computer problems.  This was supposed to be a "relaxation device" for me!!!! :)  Just posting this as a warning - take a look at all the people who have problems with this.  I'm buying an Ipod.

<Title>Great player and easy to use
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I managed to get this player brand new for $69.99 during a clearance sale.  It is great for long commutes and work.  It works as advertised and I get about the stated battery life depending on current volume.  The only thing they should have changed was the carrying case.  You can't use the main buttons when the player is in the case.

<Title>I love it, and would buy another...
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 Player has given me hell.  But don't get me wrong... it's a love-hate relationship. It's incredibly attractive with a sleek and shiny back and an easy-to-maneuver front. It's lightweight and hold's in your palm nicely. The sound quality is great and I play it for long hours and it has lasted for a long time.  That being said, I've had my Rio for 10 months, and I've dropped it a few times (no practical protective case, really). Problems I've encountered have been it shutting off and bearing the message "Upgrader" not allowing you do anything. The best remedy I've found for this problem has been to plug it in to the charger, and it will typically take care of the problem. This was a recurring problem, but it has quit being a pain, and I've had practically flawless play with it the past few months. However, I dropped it recently and the wheel broke, which means I can not turn the volume up or down on the Rio, only through the output device (speakers). That's my own fault though.  You get interesting comments when listening to the Rio... "What's THAT?"... mainly because people are so used to the Ipod, but I would choose the Rio over Ipod anyday. Ipod's overrated.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player!
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It has been two years since I purchased my RIO carbon, 5MB player.  I drop it at least once a week, it spends 25% of the time rolling around in my coat pocket while commuting back/forth to work, the other 75% is spent rolling around in the bottom of my purse.  Although it came with a case, it's not really practical.  You have to keep taking the whole thing out to change or search for different titles.  An improvemnt would be to have an opening which allows you to change your opions easily. Anyway, I dropped it one last time thsi week and the volume button came out and it won't work anymore. I'm buying another one! I see there is a 20GB Rio that has my name all over it!

<Title>Great Player!!
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Both my wife and I have each had a Rio Carbon for over 2 years now.  Mine gets dragged (and dropped) everywhere.  I have wireless FM in my car so I can even listen to it while driving.  Neither of us have had ANY problems with our players, other than occasionally forgetting to recharge it.   I've dropped mine many many times without any problems.  My 7 year old borrows it all the time and it keeps on ticking.   I have firmware version 1.43.  I have 1,508 songs on it (WMA variable bit rate) and still have 20% of my hard disk left.  Haven't touched my CDs in years!  I like the long battery life and I fly overseas to India and Japan quite a bit.  It's nice having a long life MP3 player with on the flights so I don't have to listen to the canned airline music.  And I can recharge it off of my laptop when I'm in my hotel room or at work.   I have had no issues with the menu button or the little selection wheel.  If this one ever dies, I'll buy another one without any hesitation!  The only negatives I can say is (as others have mentioned) the case sucks and is worthless.  I also wish I could create play lists without having to use the Rio Management software.  I have gotten around this by using the `genre' as play lists.   I use Media Tagger 1.3.5  (which is freeware) to re-write the tag data on my music files.  Also as a side note, always have your songs backed up on a hard drive some place.  Even the best player can get lost or stolen and you don't want to have to re-rip, and re-download all of your CDs and songs you bought on-line!!!

<Title>Way better than iPods and half the price!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband bought this mp3 player for me as a birthday present. It's a whopping 5 GB player and you'd have to put down at least $250 if you want an iPod with comparable storage. It holds an amazing number of songs and I especially like the recorder feature. It's great for undergraduate and graduate students because you can record lectures and listen to music with one little device! Both the device and the software are straightforward and easy to use. I agree with the other reviewer because it is a tiny bit annoying that you can only create playlists when you're hooked up to the software, but it's really a minor flaw and definitely not a big enough problem that I wouldn't recommend it to others. Even if I hadn't been biased against iPods before this because of their ridiculous marketing strategies ("Buy our products because they look cute and come in flashy colors! Never mind if they're quality products or reasonably priced!"), I still would have thought this product was 10x more efficient and reasonable.   My only complaint is that mine broke easily. I see that others reviewers have dropped it multiple times with no problems, so I guess I got the token dud. I only had it for a few months and I dropped it once at the grocery store, and now it's broken and unresponsive to anything I do.   Here's my personal plea: It looks brand new on the outside and I hate to buy a new mp3 player for $100 when I know there's someone/someplace out there that can fix it. I checked Rio's website and they no longer fix their players, so does anyone know of other companies with websites that I can check with? If not, do you have any general suggestions as to where I could start? Any type of stores or business that might offer this service? Thanks and I'd appreciate any help!

<Date>Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Very frustrating!  The Rio Carbon comes in an industrial strength plastic package.  I spent over 15 minutes trying to get it it open -- it is too thick to cut with scissors or slice with a razor blade.  Once I got it cut, I gashed my hand on the plastic.  I am no wimp -- this packaging is just crazy!  It could serve as the shipping container.

<Date>Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>What a great little player (once my dad got the crazy package open).  It's about 3/4" shorter than the iPod mini, but about 1/2 wider.  Similar thickness, but more rounded.  Similar weight.  Like carrying another cell phone.    The rubber grip is nice too -- fits great in the hand.  One complaint: the shiny chrome case collects fingerprints and scratches like crazy.  After 2 days, the back is pretty scuffed just from sliding it across the table.  The iPod Mini has a brushed metal case, which hides scratches and fingerprints.

<Title>Incredible product
<Date>Sat Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Carbon for about two weeks now, and I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase. First off, kudos to Rio for the sleek design; it's amazingly small and light, travels very well, and looks very, very stylish.   There are minor annoyances associated with the Carbon though. First off, if you buy this, make sure to have a set of good headphones / earbuds of your own with a gold plated plug. The packaged earbuds are crap, and anything uncoated apparently produces a lot of static due to some design error. Secondly, the back of the Carbon and the touchpad collect fingerprints like mad; being the neat freak that I am, I spend quite a lot of time polishing the bugger (annoying!).  Beyond these small grievances of mine, the Carbon trumps the iPod in both storage / battery life. Beyond the obvious 1gb increase, I'm never concerned about the remaining battery power (although I haven't tested the claim of 20 hours, I've never ran out of power, and I use this thing all the time). If you do buy the Carbon, make sure to upgrade the firmware; lots of small fixes and charging while connected via USB = plus.

<Title>Cool product - needs a little more thought put into design
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been a big fan of Rio/Sonic Blue products since their inception. The Carbon does have a lot of storage space for music, it the perfect size and weight (I use mine while working out and running).  Also, cool metalic backing like the iPod.  Ease of use.  Dislikes: battery goes fast!  6-10 hours of use before it needs to be recharged.  Also, battery guage is crude and not all that accurate.  Not precise.  Also, NO HOLD BUTTON!  That is probably the biggest design flaw - I keep hitting the buttons and pausing/forwarding/reversing songs unintentionally.  Lastly, the leather carrying case, while very cool, does not have a viewing window so to fast forward songs you need to remove device from case and manually fast forward.  Really needs to be a "cut out" to view buttons and the screen display!!!!  A note about RIO products: while cool products, good size and weight, they do tend to break rather quickly.  I'm not that rough on the equipment but previous 2 Rio products had problems that required fixing.  I bought my first Rio at Best Buy (yeah, they ripped me off) but got a cool protection plan that allowed me to trade in if product breaks within 3 years (for an extra $39).  You can return for same product or upgrade to the latest and greatest!

<Title>Great so far
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I chose to pick up this guy over the ipod mainly because the ipod uses itunes and aac. I'm one of those "bad" guys who prefers to pick up my tunes from p2p networks without the hassle of converting to apple's format.   Some pluses about the carbon: -Supports wma, this works really well with j river media center which allows you to upload and convert to wma on the fly. -great battery life, some people are complaining that they want a removable/replacable battery, but by the time the battery goes dead the player won't be worth keeping by then. -I personally like this design better than the ipod; as one reviewer said, I think the design appeals more to a male audience that finds the ipod a bit too toy-like. -I use this to also listen to audio books in the car (via the Belkin Tunecast II). The carbon supports the audible format, but I just rent audio book CD's from my local library and upload them onto the player.  -the 5 gig seagate harddrive can be removed, and it actually works in most devices that use type II compact flash (yes, it's that small). But from what I hear there are bugs with replacing a CF card back into the carbon.   Some cons about the carbon: -Like any other mp3 player, the stock headphones do not bring out the potential of the player. There are alot of earbud headphones on the market, but I recommend the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia for those on a budget (amazon has it for 27 bux). These earphones appear to be nearly identical to the MDR-EX71LP's, but the 71's have only a 15 inch cord because it's designed for players with a remote. The 71's come with a one meter extension, but the adapter looks bulky and the overall length becomes too long. Also, if you get static just put some clear nail polish around the base of the earphone jack to prevent direct contact with the metallic casing. of the carbon.  -the playlist feature cannot be edited from the carbon itself, and mine takes a bit long to process the playlists but only after I've uploaded new songs. (not a big deal, only about 10 more seconds and that's only after i've synchronized).   Overall, a very good buy considering the features, performance, and price. Plus, you avoid becoming an ipod clone.

<Content>Rio's products are horrible, and the Carbon is no exception.  Looks nice, but will break within weeks.  The controller pad failed on me, making it half useless.  Not to mention that the  battery is not replaceable and so when it dies in 1-2 years, so will your Carbon.

<Date>Wed Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I waited at least a month after the Carbon came out to see what others thought, would it hold up, what bugs are present ect..  Then i made the plunge.  Overall its GREAT.  the battery life does last 20 hours.  You can even use a usb card charger i got for my palm to charge in the car with the included mini usb cord.  Holds a good amount of cds and love the fact i can listen to my audio books.  Any negatives are the power button.  With in the first 3 days the unit fell and the power button stopped working.  BestBuy exchanged it no problem but i made sure to get the 2 year warrenty extention with the new unit.  And this needs to build play lists in the fly.  I never used playlists untill i got this. But it would be nice.  How ard would it be to add this?   This looks so much better then the mini ipod and takes up very little room in a pocket.  If u use this in your car get the belkin tunecast II.  It powers via car charger.  Im tired of buying batteries for the tunecast I.  Carbon lasts longer then it does  UPDATE.  Im on my 3rd carbon.  This is the last try.  Love the player but something happened to unit and it wont power on.  Didnt drop it but did have a hard jolt.  IS ANYONE ELSE HAVING THIS PROBLEM? If this one fails then i guess i get an ipod.  But damn it works so well.

<Title>A dissapointing purchase
<Date>Thu Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Prior to buying my Rio Carbon, I spent days searching the web for both professional reviews from major and smaller consumer electronic device reviewing sites, as well as many consumer reviews of the Rio Carbon. After reading all the hype and glamor everyone had to heap upon the Rio Carbon, I decided that it was time to finally get one myself.   Though the price was quite steep (around $270 after s/h), I was still very happy and satisfied at purchasing what I thought was a superb product. Upon receiving the Carbon, my first reaction was awe. What a cool looking device! Very sleek, thin, and fits comfortably in the palm of my hand. I then proceeded to carefully read the maunal and follow the directions step by step before even turning on the player itself. I charged the player for 3 hours just like the manual told me to do. Then went online to Rio's site and downloaded the latest version of the Carbon's firmware. I then proceeded to plug the USB cable into my USB port in my computer and followed all proper installation procedures to upload the firmware into my Carbon. One really neat thing that I noticed at this point was that when the USB was connected to both my Carbon and my PC, it would actually take that time to charge my Carbon through my PC's USB port! I then proceeded to take out the Music Manager CD that came with the Carbon, installed it onto my PC, and then surfed the web to update it to the latest version. Then started the task of uploading all my MP3s onto my little player. It was then, FINALLY, after a good excruciatingly long 7 hours after I had received the Carbon in the mail (after all, I wanted to make sure that I didn't do anything that might damage or deter from the directions laid out for my little expensive player), that I FINALLY turned on my Rio Carbon.   It was definately worth the wait. For as I turned on the Carbon, I was greeted by very cool red glow from the Rio logo on top of the player. And as the menu lighted up and displayed all the little neat functions of the Carbon. Such as voice recording mode, music/voice/audio playback, stopwatch, and a few others tweaks and settings.   However all little neat features aside, this was after all a MP3 player. And the whole reason for purchasing it was to play.....you guessed it......MP3s! I quickly pulled out the earphones that came bundled with the Carbon, plugged them into the player, and pressed play.  Much to my dismay, the sound quality was HORRIBLE! Maroon5 sounded like either a girl or a guy with a VERY high pitched voice. And my other MP3s didn't fare too well either. I couldn't understand if my player was just defective, or that this was normal for the Carbon. It occured to me that maybe a few of the MP3s may have gotten corrupted somehow during the transfer from my PC to the player (though I don't see how that would be possible). But the fact that ALL the MP3s didn't sound the way they were suppose to quickly ruled that possibility out of my mind. I pulled out my flash drive, uploaded all my MP3s onto it, and then transfered them onto my laptop to make sure the original files wern't the cause. And as I suspected, they played perfectly on both my PC and laptop through Realplayer, as well as Windows Media Player. Which left me with the conclusion that something was wrong with the Carbon. At $270, I was not overly eager to ship it back to receive a replacement that might give me the same results. So instead I opted for a full refund.   Overall this player had a great design, was a very good idea, but ultimately it failed where it counted the most. In its ability to actually play MP3s.

<Content>Great small player.  Price was well within reason for what it provides (I got mine for 250 online)  Pro's:  Small, light, sleek.  Real easy to charge (USB).  I've so far been happy with the sound (be aware, if you use an all-metal plug for headphones, it may cause distortion! Design flaw).  Thumbwheel and buttons all well placed and easy to use.  Been jogging with it several times without any skipping (very nice)  Con's:  Case.  Okay RIO, just why do you make a case that neither has an arm band nor a clip? Plus you can't access any of the controls while it's in it. Someone just wasn't thinking! The music software that comes with it is adequate, but watch the defaults if you like a specific way to load your music.    Small nits:  Playback.  I would like to be able to playback music by directory as well as "artist" or "genre". Yes, I know I could make playlists, but I'm lazy. RIO made some nice features including a clock and a stopwatch.  I wish they went the one extra step of adding an alarm to the clock (to wake me up) and a countdown timer to the stopwatch (for jogging).
