<Title>Great Step Up
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've rocked out an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y7976/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-4812178-4699210">Apple 2 GB iPod Nano White</a> for a while and loved the mobility and such but figured since I'm heading off to an out of state college next year I'm gonna want more then 2GB storage space...which brought me to this iPod video. The upgrade in space is amazing and you dont lose too much of the great mobility the nano affords you. Costs a bit more then then nano but if you search out for one you can find one at a decent price. I got mine for $120 through an Amazon registered seller and it's been perfect.  I highly reccomend for college kids since you and your room mate may differ on what to watch and you might have some down time between classes but not enough to go back to the dorm or lug out and get all set up with a laptop.  Also highly reccomend for somebody whose nano just doesnt hold enough.

<Title>Battery life is horrible for music
<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got the ipod 30g.  I had the dell digital dj 20g prior.  the dell would easily go 10 hours plus on one charge listening to music and advancing songs as often as you like.  I cannot even do one leg on a flight with the ipod.  I get 2-3 hours per charge at best and that is trying not to touch the unit and have backlight set to 1 second.  If it try to plug into my laptop in flight you cannot use while it is 'connecting' and never stops saying that even when set to manual.  I always heard that ipod had battery issues but thought the newer ones solved the problem.  I did look at the battery tips page and they do not help, not a good sign that they have a whole page dedicated to just that issue.  Mine is likely going back.  Amazing how many they sell of these with these issues.  unit looks good but not practical

<Title>catch up on your desperate housewives
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this the day it came out in the stores...not on purpose though. I was bringing my U2 edition ipod in to the Apple store to be fixed, and when I saw the quality of the graphics on this screen, I found myself in a semi-sort of trance handing my credit card to the cashier. So far, I have brought it to a pre-party for u2's concert, and we all watched the videos on my i-pod while it was plugged into the awesome Bose base....it was fun...great sound and fun to watch.... Also, I have caught myself being very content eating alone in thai food restaurants watching my missed Desperate Housewives episodes.....how fun is that? and no commercials too....easy to download videos, songs, pictures from your computer....I have the Kate Spade case (very reasonable price and it perfectly protects it) and it clips easy on my purse so I can listen all the time to my ipod.....only thing i recommend....phillips makes better ear buds than the ones these come with...i bought them for under $15 I think....Enjoy!

<Title>What's with the complaining?
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is fantastic. For me, the battery life is solid, i've shuffled through songs for 5-6 hours without ever thinking about the battery, and last night i fell asleep with a 3/4 charge and forgot to turn it off, but was shocked when i woke up in the morning with music still playing. I have the white model and it looks great, people notice it a lot. I've had it for well over a week and still haven't taken the plastic screen protector off and I don't plan to until a skin comes out for this new model, and i recommend everyone else do the same, it's really hard to even notice that it's still on and the player is fully functional.  Yes you do have to tweak your videos before adding them, but you have to do this for most portable video players so I don't know why everybody is yapping. My only complaint is with adding photos to the ipod, there's no obvious way to add one photo at a time, you have to have a folder for the ipod to sync to, and delete and add photos accordingly, but its not that big of a deal. Overall i have been verry please with this product and recommend it to all.    Side note - everyone should realize that while customer reviews are very useful, people are much more likely to review the product if they have had a bad experience or a defective product than if they have had no problems, so the proportions of negative to positive reviews are somewhat skewed. Just something to keep in mind while reading reviews.

<Title>iPod Video 60 GB
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is undoubtedly the best iPod yet.  I have had the last three versions and this one is my favourite.  Like the iPod photo, the support for USB2 is much better that in earlier iPods (where there either was no USB support or if there was you still had to use a Firewire cable for power).  This version you can sync and charge via USB which is great as all you need on the move is the USB cable - you can normally find somewhere with a PC (or use your own laptop pc if you have it with you) with USB to charge up your iPod.    The screen is bigger so you can see your photos better and the iPod video is significantly thinner than the iPod Photo too which is great.  Width and Height seem pretty much the same as the previous iPod (with the exception of the screen which as mentioned is much bigger than before).  You can definitely watch movies on the video iPod.  I used it recently on a trip over to Europe and watched a few movies I had recorded on my Tivo video recorder on my iPod.  The quality is reasonably good and the battery life sufficient to watch a movie.  The current iPod is still a long way from ideal (I could easily list off a whole raft of improvements I'd like to see), but given the highly portable nature of the device, huge disk capacity and the not too unreasonable battery life its a very good effort at video, music and photos on the move.  Update Feb 2006: Having had this device a few months now, I remain very happy with it.  The main issue I have with it is the inability to play most video formats other than MP4.  Converting video into MP4 format to watch on the iPod is a pain.  If I go to considerable time and trouble I can do this using my PC, however it takes hours to convert a movie into MP4 and in my experience there are frequently conversion problems (e.g. sound getting out of synch with the video).  I'm hoping that the forthcoming support from Tivo for conversion of Tivo content for viewing on the iPod will make this simpler.  Until then (or until Apple upgrade the iPod firmware so that it can play back a wider range of video formats) I will probably continue to use my iPod mainly to listen to music rather than as a video player.

<Title>pretty good
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>when i first saw the video ipod online i was DYING to get one, but it's important for you to go and look at them in the store first.  this is my second ipod, my first one being a 4G mini. i bought the video primarily for more song space. the picture quality is great, even for the small screen.  however, i must say that i'm very disappointed in the scratch factor. i've only had mine for about 3 days and much of the faceplate has scratches on it. i have the black model and i'm seriously considering returning it for the white model, in the hopes that it will show less scratches. i've babied mine and there still remains to be numerous scratches.  any advice for returns?

<Title>disappointing
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Its an ipod and so, of course, you have to love it but... I was pretty annoyed to find that in order to transfer video to it I would either need to download from itunes store or buy a separate piece of software to do conversions. For $300 this baby really needed to include that. Also, the itunes that came with this one replaced my old itunes install but doesn't recognize my pre-video 20 GB ipod. This is causing some trouble as my husband and I share a computer but each have different generations of ipods. I still love the little guy. It's thin and the color screen is great but the annoyance factor is taking its shine off mighty quick.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the 30gig unit in the middle of October.  Like most of us I was a little worried about scratching, because of the media blitz on the nano.  I pretty much keep it in its case and if it's in my pocket it is always in the case.  I find this being a little annoying, but I'm going to keep doing this until a better case is on the market.  The screen does have scuffs on it but by NO MEANS DOES IT IMPARE IT'S USE.    I haven't timed the battery life, but it has never been a problem where it has drained and I couldn't recharge.  Recharging seems quick. Sorry haven't timed it.  I purchased a video online and that whole process was about the same has music but a little bit longer.  I also copied a DVD to it and that took about 3hrs to encode.  Both the Pixar video and the DVD look great on screen.  I haven't tried it on my TV yet.   About three years ago I got tired of replacing cd's that I already have bought, so I copied my whole cd collection to my PC.  Unfortunately I did it with wma codec.  The process of converting my collection took forever.  I haven't noticed any degration in the sound quality.  What is cool is after I copied everything over I still have about 14gigs free and that's the 30g ipod.    My laptop is only USB 1, so it is slow transferring to the ipod.  I hooked it into my PC with USB 2 and it was much faster.  If you are married pay attention.  I give the Ipod a WAR (Wife approval rating) rating of 10 out of 10.  She loves it.  I had a netgear 101 wireless audio media center for our home stereo and in her mind it was a disaster.  Now we just hook up the Ipod to it and everything is great.  I bought the monster fm transmitter for the car, but I was not happy with it.  I returned in and got the Transpod FM Transmitter and power dock. It works great with the video Ipod.  I don't believe it states that it is supported yet, but it works fine. The Transpod places the Ipod at eye level, so you are not distracted from the road.  I have had some complaints about the Ipod.  First, I hate the earplugs.  They make my ears sore and sound is not that great.  Also, don't like how itunes and the Ipod handle soundtracks.  You can group them but that removes them from the artist list and put's them in another menu screen.  I wish it would group sound tracks and leave them in the artist menu.  Hope this helps I love this unit and hope to buy another for my wife.

<Content>iPod Video 5th Generation Review The 5G (5th generation) iPod with Video and Photo viewing capabilities is the latest evolution in the iPod line. The key word here is evolution, as, for the most part, it only includes a few minor improvements from the previous 4th generation iPod. Read on, and I'll tell you exactly what I think of this hot new product.  Installing Installing the iPod, I decided to just plug it into my computer. Unfortunately, the iPod locked up! That seemed pretty bad to me. After browsing the web a while, I figured out how to reboot the frozen iPod (hold down the middle select button and the menu button at the same time for about 6 seconds to reset/reboot it). Also, make sure that the iPod hold switch is not set when you try to reboot it. After rebooting, I decided to upgrade my iTunes from 6.0 to the most current version at the time (6.0.1.3) just to be safe, and then plugged in the iPod again, and it worked this time.  Design The 5G iPod has the same classic iPod look of the 4th generation design. From a design standpoint, it is gorgeous, the same width and height as the 1st generation iPod, but about half the thickness. It has a classy and classic design that looks beautiful and elegant. In the hand it feels nice- moderate weight but solid. One thing that you'll notice is how minimalist the design is- there are very few buttons and knobs and switches. The most notable thing is its round touch wheel which has 4 buttons embedded on it and a button in the center. The 4 clickwheel buttons have a nice tactile feedback when you push on them, however, they are completely flat on the touch wheel. In fact, it's so minimalist that there is not even an on/off switch (you have to hold the pause button down for several seconds and then flip the hold switch). There is no volume knob- you use the touch wheel (which also serves also to scroll through songs and also for rating your songs). Sadly, the latest touchwheel is a downgrade from all previous versions. It is much more "twitchy", and error-prone than the one on my second generation iPod mini, and much inferior to my 1st generation mechanical wheel in feel and accuracy.  The LCD screen is color and it's beautiful. It is 2.5" diagonal and has a resolution of 320x240. Videos look good on the screen. Motion is clear and smooth, though the screen is really too small to watch long movies on. On the top edge, there is one headphone jack and a hold switch. On the bottom, there's a custom connector which you can use a cable to connect to your computer's USB port (Firewire is no longer supported). No docking station is included, a money-saving tactic on Apple's part.   I Call It Scratchy The 5G iPod has a very scratch-prone screen. In fact, after just 1 day of using it gently, and putting it in my pocket (without any metal objects or coins) it somehow developed far more scratches than my 3 month old 2G iPod mini which was not babied at all. In fact, it's rather upsetting that the screen in some parts is so marred with scratches that it causes video playback to sometimes shimmer in that area. At least Apple now includes a new ultra-thin neoprene-like case. I like the case a lot, it's very simple but compact and provides just enough protection for carrying around without adding much bulk.  Features  The iPod is fairly light on features. It plays music files in AAC format (used by Apple's iTunes music store) and plays MP3s and Apple Lossless format. Apple has finally added reasonable recording support (though you need to buy a separate add-on microphone). And, the big news is, Apple's video support. Actually, video support is pretty good. Apple's web site says it supports H.264 video at 320x240 resolution at up to 768 kbits/second, or MPEG-4 resolutions of up to 480x480, and 2.5Mbits/second but. The MPEG-4 video size limit is slightly misleading, as it in reality supports resolutions that have up to 480x480=230,400 pixels. That means with a normal 1.33 aspect ratio, it can actually do up to 554x415 pixels (good for output to a TV, the built-in screen is 320x240 and downsizes the video shown to fit the built-in screen). Note, using higher resolutions increases file sizes significantly and could severely decrease battery life because of the increased computation power needed. Other reasonable resolutions for a 1.33 aspect ratio are 512x384 or 480x360. I've decided to standardize my video content on 480x360 at 1.5Mbits/sec. as a reasonable compromise in terms of quality and space.  Photo viewing on the 2.5" screen is very nice. However, Apple left out the most important feature, being able to zoom in on the details of an image. Even my obsolete 3 year old digital camera could do that. Also, the iPod doesn't support viewing RAW photo file formats.   There is still no FM radio, there is no bluetooth wireless connectivity built in (you can buy extra 3rd party addons for bluetooth, but really, it should be built in), there is no 3rd party software support for applications to run on the iPod. I hope they'll correct these deficiencies soon. There are a few extras like an alarm clock which which is practically useless because the built-in speaker is so weak, and there are a couple of games that aren't very good.   Other extras include a contact manager, a calendar, and the ability to show text notes.   A recently added feature is support for Podcasts. Podcasts have their own menu and also are bookmarked if you switch to something else in the middle of listening to one. Also, a dot appears next to podcasts that have not yet been listened to (a nice touch). Happily, smart playlists work correctly (if you set the star ratings for a song for instance, it will dynamically get updated on the iPod without having to re-sync with the computer). This feature had been broken by Apple for my 2nd generation mini with Firmware version 1.3.   In Use With all this talk about design and features, we shouldn't forget, it's all about the audio. My opinion is, the iPod's audio quality is very good. Audio is clear and clean. It seems to be an improvement on the iPod Mini I own, as it doesn't seem to have audio glitches when switching tracks. I'm not an audiophile, so you may want to check for yourself if you're particularly picky. Overall, I'm happy with the audio quality.  Where the iPod really shines is on the software side. iTunes integration is fantastic. Keeping your music in sync between the computer and the iPod works really well. iTunes is great at managing your music, if you are willing to give it full control over organizing your music- I fought this for a while, but in the end gave in as it's just easier to let it manage and consolidate your collection. It has nice little features like finding duplicate songs so you can clean up your collection. The iTunes user interface and functionality is excellent.   Playlist management in iTunes is fantastic. It is easy to create playlists and rearrange music within playlists. In addition, playlist management is very good on the iPod itself as well. Smart playlists are playlists that dynamically get updated (for instance, you can have a playlist of all 5 star rated songs, or of the most recent songs you've downloaded). You can create on-the-go playlists on the iPod directly, which is one feature I really love.   This 30GB 5G iPod I own is advertised as having an 14 hour battery life, or 2 hours for video. The iPod battery is also not easily replaceable, so you can't just switch batteries when it runs out, instead, you have to recharge the iPod. Your battery results may vary. (Come back later for a full report on battery life!)   Video content is now available on iTunes. However, the quality and the restrictions are a joke. You pay $1.99 for video content (such as music videos, or TV shows) but you get poor quality 320x240 resolution videos that you can NOT burn to DVD. Low quality and severe restrictions, together with a lack of much content to begin with is a disappointment.   Trouble in paradise: There is a very dark side to using the iPod and iTunes, however. Apple has been very consumer unfriendly by refusing to let iTunes protected AAC format music to interoperate with other software and other MP3 players. You can not play music purchased on iTunes using any other MP3 player on the market. Although you can burn the music onto CD and then rip it again, that is a rather annoying and time-consuming barrier. Furthermore, if you purchase music from any other online store such as Real's or one that supports WMF, you can not play it in the iPod. In fact Apple has threatened to sue Real for making their music files playable on the iPod. This level of anti-consumer monopolistic behavior is beyond comprehension, for a company that has so much going for it. They basically lock you into their system and keep you there through incredibly anti-consumer practices. There is no excuse for Apple's monopolistic behavior and consumer unfriendliness here. They have a good product that stand on its own merits.  A Note on iTunes Encoding Sound Quality: When ripping songs from your CDs, you need to think about what sound quality you will be happy with. The audio encoder and quality settings are found in the iTunes Preferences (under the Edit menu --> Preferences), and select the "Importing" tab. The general consensus is, the high quality 128K bps AAC setting is adequate for most purposes, though definitely not CD quality. In general it's a lot of trouble importing your entire CD collection into iTunes, so, I recommend picking a higher bit rate AAC encoding to get higher quality (select the "Custom" option). I experimented with MP3 encoding and it seems to be produce poorer quality audio in iTunes. I ended up choosing the AAC Encoder at 192 Kbps, which is a reasonable compromise in terms of space usage and audio quality. At this quality level, all but the most serious audiophiles should be satisfied. See A Report on Apple's iTunes AAC Compared to CD. See also the iPod Audio Page for more details on audio quality.  CONCLUSION: The iPod 5G is an excellent music player, though still missing some important features. It has style and design that's unmatched, and works well with Apple's outstanding iTunes software. It is functional and works well for what it was designed for. Features are lacking, certainly lagging behind the competition, and you get locked in Apple's system, so that's a tradeoff you will have to weigh. I like my 5G iPod video edition, and plan to keep it at least until the next generation comes out

<Title>Well... it's an iPod.
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, I've had this new iPod Video for about a week now.  I've had one iPod before; the 4th generation 20gb.  I won't waste your time by writing the things you've read a thousand times.  I'll try to put a fresh spin on things.  First of all, the video capabilities.  Right now, I'm going to be honest, it's a pretty overrated feature (unless you're buying it simply for music videos).  There is very little you can purchase on iTunes currently.  All they have are 6 different TV shows and 7 Pixar shorts.  However, there is a plethora of music videos available.  Now this is not what I really want to utilize the video feature for, but there is a variety of them for those who do.  Granted, I'm sure Apple is going to be releasing more shows and even movies for purchase on iTunes, but as of now (Nov. 21), it's limited.  Of course there are alternatives, such as capturing your own video, but unfortunately this process can take hours to do.  Also you need Quicktime 7 Pro to convert it to the special iPod video format, which will cost you an extra 30 bucks.  But it'll probably be worth the money for some extra video on the iPod to watch.  So take my opinion with a grain of salt, but for those who want movies or TV shows alone, you might want to hold off on this for awhile.  Now, the style of this new iPod.  Of course, it is thinner than the previous model, which is nice.  It's about the same length and width, the clickwheel is smaller, and the screen is obviously bigger.  Now one thing that I did notice that was different about this iPod (and also the nano) is that the front faceplate is no longer rounded off but cut with sharp edges (see the side profile picture above).  This shouldn't bother anyone, but for me it was a change I'm not too sure I like.  I mean, an iPod is supposed to be round all over, just like every model before it... I don't know why the designers made this change and I hope that they go back to the old style eventually, but for now, it looks like it's here to stay.  Also, the headphone jack is offset to the right, if that makes any difference.  I'll also mention that I have the white model, which scratches less.  I've seen the black one at Best Buy and it is all scratched up and because it's black and everything shows.  Right now there are no official cases for sale at the [...] or Amazon.com for that matter, but they do have quite a few on eBay and I ordered the brand new leather one on DLO.  You can find that here:  [...]  All other features are still intact: music, videos, colored screen and the like.  The battery life however is roughly only 4 hours.  The backlight and keeping the backlight while video plays really sucks the life out of the thing.  But for me I usually keep the Pod close at hand or in the car where I can keep it charged.  So if you are always travelling and want to carry it with you to watch videos, you should probably get a full charge before you leave.  I think eventually this iPod will grow to the 5 stars it truly deserves, but as of now, there really is no improvement.  It meets all expectations for Apple's iPod, but it needs more video options to get a real step up from the previous model.  I hope this review has been helpful to you.  _Max
