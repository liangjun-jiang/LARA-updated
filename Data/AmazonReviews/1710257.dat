<Content>Everything was good quality. Gave this as a Christmas gift. The software needed an update becasue itune is always having updates but it took about 2 minutes and everythings was good after that. You would have to download the update form the itunes website after you install the installation disk. For the buck I saved compared to the full price it was excellent. I would do it again.

<Content>I absolutely love my Ipod....   The price was very reasonable and the direct shipping made it easy. Although it was previously owned, it came fully functional and you can't even tell that it was used.
