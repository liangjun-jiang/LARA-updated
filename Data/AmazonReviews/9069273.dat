<Title>Cant beat this price.....

<Content>OK....If you wanna get an iPod, then go and BUY AN iPOD!!!  because you will just not be satisfied....BUT, if you just want something you can take to the gym or on the "run", then YOU Cant BEAT THIS for price and features! PERIOD!  I was looking for these qualities: COMPACT, 512mb-1gb Flash Drive Storage (use it for saving other files), FM Radio, Cheap!! Anything else added in was just "gravy". After checking around at all the "cheap" ones at electronics stores and eBay, I settled on this one....   HIGHS: Micro sized-very cool looking         Packed with 512MB or 1GB flash drive-can play MP3/WMA         can store converted video (yes video) & pic files            to store and playback         FM radio, Voice Recorder, etc..  LOWS:  Micro Sized-very small buttons        Dont lose included USB, you cant get these in stores...        Converting viewable pics/video can be drawn out  First thing that impressed me was its size. I've taken home match boxes from restaurants bigger than this, it feels like  a thin Zippo lighter.   Because of its very compact frame, all buttons are on its sides and at first were a bit confusing, but play with it for a couple hours and you find that its easy to operate (buttons have dual functions-press once for play, press and hold to open "sub-folders" etc.  Next COOL Thing is its OLED screen...something that will be taking over the market in the near future, it runs with less energy, you can view it from any angle w/o losing clarity and has brilliant colors. The sceen is very small but having this little screen just adds to its cool effect, after you load you photos, you can have em play back during song play.  Convert your video files and transfer them for playback.....very cool showing off to your friends and co-workers. This OLED Screen is not really made for watching movies (although Im sure you could watch a TV show or something short) but just the fact that it can do it, well COOL!  Operation is drag and drop. If you got you Windows Media Player or whatever- all your songs are in MP3 or WMA format, then just connect the player to your PC, open the files and copy em over.  I connected my player via USB and Sync'ed it in the Media Player and it also worked fine.  The one thing I dont care for is if you want to add in your Jpeg or pic files, you have to convert or have them in Bitmap format first, then using the included software, convert it over into another type of file, which can then be viewed on its screen. Kind of a drawn out process but when you see you pics flashing their way across the OLED during playback, its neat.  The same cane be said for converting video files into ones which can be played and viewed on this player.  In my opinion, the Low Points are far outweighed by the HIGH points. As I've stated above, I was only looking for something basic. If you want more or something that will store your enitre music library, then go buy something else. If you want one of them lipstick type players but wanna be a little different, then get this. You'll have everything those things have and alot more.  I thought this was so neat that a couple days later I went back on eBay and bought another player from this company (VL535).   
<Overall>4

<Title>What a joke

<Content>I was looking for a new MP3 player, since my husband's using my old one.  This was not the one. I've tried for over a week to get it working with no success. Don't be fooled by the price, it's not worth it.  Buy the iPOD. I am.
