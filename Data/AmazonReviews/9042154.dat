<Title>Noticeable improvements
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my 8 GB nano to replace my 1st gen 4 GB, and I have to say that everything about it is better.  First, it has double the capacity and battery life, and yet it slightly thinner.  Second, the aluminum exterior is a big improvement, because it is much more durable and does not show scratches and fingerprints nearly as much as the plastic on the previous generation.  Lastly, the screen is noticeably brighter and sharper, and the sound is a little clearer with more bass.  The new headphones fit in my ears better too.  In my opinion, this is the best flash MP3 player available now.  I have had 5 MP3 players in the last 4 years, and I've found that iPods are the best-selling for a reason.

<Title>Excellent!
<Date>Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow! This is a wonderful machine - with easy to use (and to read) functions, and a great sound. I use mine mainly for music, but a friend of mine keeps a large library of photos on his iPod. It seems to be highly durable, but time will tell. To be honest, I was skeptical whether it would be worth the price, but I have not been disappointed.  Other reviewers have noted that you really need to have a USB 2.0 port for this, and I heartily agree. My old computer was wheezing and sputtering until I ended up getting a USB new card.

<Title>Many problems and glitches with 2nd Gen 8 GB iPod nano
<Date>Tue Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>UPDATE: After initially giving the 2nd gen nano 1 star because of the problems I was having, I am updating my review to 4 stars....BUT it won't let me!!  I still belive the 2nd gen nano to be of lesser quality than the first (click wheel quality, and lock out swith quality)...however, the combination of the 2nd gen firmware update and the software update to iTunes 7 has fixed the problems I was having. I occasionally still have to reset my nano when playing through my Alpine head unit in my car (NEVER had to do that with my 1st gen).  And occasionally, iTunes has a heck of a time when I go back and forth from 1 iPod to the other.... That said though, my experince has been good enough to now recommend a 2nd gen iPod to anyone.  NOW it is a good product!  OLD POST: This is my second nano. After my first, I built my life around the iPod...I wondered how I lived without one for so long...I purchased all of the goodies...3 sets of headphones, 4 different types of cases from workout to casual, I upgraded my car stereo so it plugged directly into the Alpine head unit, I purchased a 'remote' unit that plugs directly into my Audio Video controller at home...life was good.  Then came the purchase of the 8GB 2nd gen nano...and all hell broke loose.  The 'data' has been 'corrupted' three times in as many weeks. And every time that happens you have to follow the 5 'r's that Apple recommends, which basically wipes the memory on the unit and you have to reload all playlists.  The iPod itself, I have to reset on a weekly basis...my Alpine head unit will all of a sudden not recognize the nano, until I reset it.  The 2nd Gen nano has been VERY disappointing so far...  In addition, the 2nd gen nano, is slimmer and taller than the 1st gen...many accessories for the 1st gen (workout arm bands etc) won't fit the second gen nano...  NOTE++++Make darn sure, the accessory you are purchasing SPECIFCALLY says it will fit a 2nd gen nano!!!++++buyer beware!  RECOMMENDATION: I would purchase a 1st gen 4GB iPod nano since they are on sale, and wait for Apple to get the bugs out of the 8 GB 2nd gen nano.  I have gone back to my 1st gen, and everything seems to be working just fine.  If it matters to you--The 1st gen nano battery life is 2.5-3 hours...whereas the 2nd gen nano is about 23 hours...

<Title>The best MP3 player ever!
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This iPod has to be the best MP3 player ever made.  The sound quality is superb.  Navigation is extreamly easy.  The ultra thin profile is a brilliant.  I keep it in an armband and can hardly tell that it's there most of the time.  It's also nice to have the comfort of not having to worry about breaking a hard drive when working out.  I had no problems transferring music over and had fun buying music from the iTunes store.  The remodeled headphones that came with these are way more comfortable that the gen ones and don't fall out of your ears as easy.  The rounded edges of the body of this Nano are even slightly more comfortable to hold.  With all that being said, I'm having problems finding accessories to fit the gen 2 Nanos.  That's the only problem I've had with it so far, if one would consider that a problem.  I'll definately recomend this iPod to all my friends.

<Title>Dumped 4GB nano for this
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was impressed with the 1st generation nano 4gb.  However 4gb is too small to hold all my legally purchased songs as I use 320kbps in encoding.  Therefore I took the 2G nano 8gb.  Here are my 2 cent:  The Good: - The finish now resists some scratches, which is what we are looking for - Probably the best quality 8gb player on the market at this price range.  Big bang for your money. - It seems more responsive than the previous nano. - It supports song searching now.  The Bad: - Personally I perfer the silver color, but the black color is the only option for 8gb.  - The packaging looks like a cheaper product than the 1st nano; in fact $249 for a mp3 is not cheap at all - I don't know if the sound quality has been improved or degraded using my Shure earphone.  But at least I can recognize the default "EQ off" has been tweaked, which I need some time to get used to. - The LCD display is brighter, but the contrast does not look better than 1st nano. - I can't get iTune 7.0.0 working on my PC.  It seems like Apple was forced to release it the same day Steve speaks.  It is a big disappointment.  Finally 7.0.1 came to fix my problem. - It does not fit to 1st generation Nano Dock.  It is an unexpected big disappointment.  I really don't understand why Apple can't make it compatible with the former dock, as the connector is just shifted to the edge a mm!  The 2nd nano deserves a 4-stars, as it does not beat the 1st nano.  Anyway it is a hard competitor for Zune to beat.

<Title>The best MP3 player ever made
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you like me wondered if buying the 30 GB video or the 8 GB Nano (as they both cost the same $249), think about this: - are you really going to watch movies on the small screen of the iPod Video?  - do you really care about watching pictures on a MP3 player? - do you want a small and slick device or a bulkier one? - do you really need 30 GB, or 8 GB (2,000 songs) cut it for you? - and what do you think is giving less problems: a spinning disk (with the issues we all can immagine if the head bumps on the disk while running, jumping or , well, falling) or flash memory?  While everything pointed me in the direction of the Nano, I wasn't sure about the 8 vs 30 GB. What I did was to install iTunes, rip all of my CDs, all of them and make a backup on an external USB disk (even with the 80 GB iPod you still need to backup the data somewhere, as it is not a matter of if but when you're going to loose something) and while it was more than 8 GB, I knew I didn't want to listen to all of my songs. As a matter of fact, there are some albums I only care for a couple of songs. So I started rating my songs and putting in different play lists. Guess what, I didn't even get close to 8 GB, not even if I double my collection.  This was the final answer I needed, I ordered the 8 GB model and WOW! It's amazing. It's my first iPod, I used many other MP3 players in the past but this is by far the best, most complete, most advanced, really outstanding sound-reproducing device I ever used. You can't realize how small and handy it is until you have one in your hands (and you know it's yours!).  In other words, it's amazing beautiful (yes, the wow factor is important too for this price), very easy to use (I already want to get rid of my last MP3 player) and even if it doesn't have a FM radio or voice recorder, who cares, I wanted an easy to use MP3 player and it's 100% on target. Pictures, games (which it has some), calendar, contacts and so on are nice, but I have a cell phone for that so I'm not too hot about them - yes, nice to know I can add that too but I really, really love what it primarly is: a great, for my the best, music player since the introduction of the portable CD player.

<Title>Superb!  Exceeded all expectations.  Most limitations aren't.
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Absolutely fabulous mp3 etc player. Exceeded my expectations.  Had for two weeks now and I couldn't be happier with this one.  I've been a skeptic and hold out on iPods forever. Previously had a Creative MuVo 4gb mini hd system.  It was the tiniest by far in it's day for it's size, and had features, in theory.  But here's the real world thing.  The software on that suc*ked.  Caused me to not use it much, after the initial honeymoon, or kinda forced honeymoon.  This beauty in contrast, in addition to being just about the perfect form factor, incredibly thin, pretty narrow, and the right amount of tall, and a very sleek black plastic, bright color screen, has wonderfully easy to use software.  I guess that's been true of iPod's generally for awhile but it sure is of this one, with improvements.  Now what about the 8gb "limitation" compared to current HD iPods of 30 or 80gb? The thing is the iTunes host PC synching software is so easy to use that it's real simple to simply move around what's in the thing.  Just set up lots of playlists by artist or album, or type of music, or whatever.  Same kind of idea with podcasts.  Really well done.  Really easy to vary each day, usually only in part.  Or every so often,etc.  This baby's plenty big enough if you go this way.  Not to hold all you own, but why do that?  That's what big hard drives on PC's or external firewire's for laptops (like my 300gb for just music) are for.    Now what about Apple's locking out subscription services and tracks?  Simple.  Buy $50 Replay AV, or something like it, though that one's real good.  There are TONES of internet radio stations broadcasting in streams that software can capture, often at 128k and sometimes 196k shoutcast mp3, and it will even divide into songs AND TAG THEM WITH ARTIST AND TITLE.    As well there's now a nifty $50 (ok way overpriced, but excellent) Apple fm radio, shirt top TINY control button for everything, accessory.  Recommended.  As is Belkin's $5 on Amazon silicon rubber protective sheath and (detachable) running armband combo.  Couldn't recommend more highly.  This is the way to go for portable music today!

<Title>Much better than iPod Minis
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is slick.  It sounds great, the form factor is awesome, very small and thin, yet feels durable enough so that it won't break in your pocket.  The color screen is very nice and the controls are very intuitive.  That being said, the only reason I bought this iPod was because the battery in the old Mini I had was absolute crap, yet I had invested a tidy sum in music from iTunes.  Hopefully this iPod will perform better than the mini series but, malfunctioning batteries or not, the best bet is to buy CDs and burn them to MP3 so you are not locked into buying iPods all the time and the outrageously overpriced accessories required to do anything but listen to it with headphones.

<Title>A great looking product that even works sometimes!
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, the thing looks great and feels tinier than the previous generation of Nano and that's a good thing. There is roughly 7.5gb free space for storage and that's a good thing.  However! Buyer beware, because I have found one important negative detail, which is one serious glitch:  Approximately 1 in 3 of the mp3 file's I uploaded to the 8gb Nano won't play. Instead the screen turns black with a white Apple logo displayed for approximately 5-6 seconds, then the screen goes off completely for a moment, then reboots to the black screen with the Apple logo for a few seconds then displays the main menu. Sometimes the root folder of the mp3 file that didn't work is removed from the directory tree.  I haven't found anything online about this glitch--as far as a firmware update or if this problem is widespread. As much as I love it and want to keep it, I will probably be returning this iPod and waiting for a more stable version to be released.  :'(

<Content>For a first time iPod user...I was impressed with the versitility of the unit & the ease of instilation.  It didn't "take over" my computer which was nice & the Nano is easy to cart around.  However, I do not like the small font...can we please make it bigger?  Over 35's will have a hard time reading any of the iPods when they are playing in their respective docking stations or players.

<Content>This is the best music device - of any kind- that I've ever owned!  I absolutely love it!  You can sort your music in so many ways, make as many playlists as you want on your pc and sync it w/ IPOD.  Play music by Artist, Album, Genre, Most Played, Highest rating (you rate them yourself).  I've bought speakers to plug it in and play at home, ordered a jack for my car so I can play it in there.  Goodbye CD's!  I'm hooked!  It's fabulous!

<Content>I am not an Apple person and only got the IPOD to use in my car.  I invested in an ipod adaptor for my car so that I could use my steering wheel audio controls to control the IPOD.  It works great and I will eat my negative words about IPOD! It is a high quality and seems like it will be a long lasting device.  I recommend this IPOD (mine is the 2nd GEN IPOD 8GB not the new smaller one-I don't know about it).

<Title>Mixed Feelings
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this item for christmas.  I am using it primarily for running and at the gym.  It has some good features; high capacity, light weight, nice look.  However, I have found the controls to be akward in many situations.  The control dial is to sensitive, and the controls are not easy to navigate while running.  I added the Nike+ system and have had poor results.  Specifically, the menus are confusing, and the sensitive controls often leave me on pause during a workout or have my workout being logged when I don't want it to be.  I've had to re-load the operating system twice as I keep getting errors.  I also found when you turn the unit off, it will not come back on again until it is docked.  There is no manual included, you have to go online to figure out how to use it.  In all it has potential, but it is not easy to use right out of the box.

<Title>cool
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a neat one.  I like how the metal case is all one peice and wraps around the unit, unlike the other color 4gb ones that have the shiny back.  Looks super cool in black, if you are unsure about it, I can tell you it grows on you.  Much more solid then 1st gen ipods, mainly due to the flash memory instead of a hard drive.  Battery lasts forever, I use it to work out and it can go weeks on a charge.  Sound quality is also better, as is display contrast.  I have a new 3rd gen and almost like this one better, more compact and discreet.  Shows album art when available, but no cover flow like 3rd gen.  Also has nifty screen lock, so if u use it for party tunes you can prevent ppl from messing around with your playlist.  Basically, it looks dead sexy and works well.

<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>During the summer  I bought a pink ipod nano and still have it even though i hardly use it anymore cause it has been replaced by my ipod touch. But I sometimes use it to go like downtown and other places I know that my ipod touch will just be a big disturbance. I love this ipod but now I realize that if i had to choose between the color I had originally got and this black one I would have chosen this black one.. but oh well..the thing that matters the most is how it works not what color it is. Now I wish that can get the 3rd generation ipod nano..but I think that is too much with the ipods and will have to wait a while b4 i can get it..atleast till my ipod touch(not Itouch ppl) wares out on me. I overall love this ipod that if I had to recommend an mp3 player to a friend it would be this if they still had it on stock.
