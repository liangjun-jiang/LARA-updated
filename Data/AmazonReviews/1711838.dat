<Title>Zen Sleek Works Great!
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Aesthetically it looks beautiful! It's a little heavy, if you're used to the small flash player types, which I'm upgrading from. I started years ago with a mini disk player and loved it, but hated how I had to "record" everything to it instead of either burning or syncing, so I went for the iRiver MP3 CD Player and used that for a couple of years. Loved it! Then I bought a 512MB Samsung Yep. It was very nice for about 6 months and then everything I put on it had an annoying clicking noise for accompaniment. So I ditched it and went big with the Zen Sleek. It took about 5 minutes to get 1500 songs on it, and I guess I still have room for about 8000 more.  Navigation is very simple. Sort through artist, album or all music, listed alphabetically. Be sure to update all you ID Tags in MP10 1st. Radio reception is very strong. Haven't tried recording using the mic yet. Photo's uploaded easily, but contrary to the Amazon description I haven't been able to listen to music while I browse my photos yet, but that's not too important as photo viewing is just a bonus to an mp3 player anyway.  The only thing I'm worried about is the screen. I wish they made a case that had a protective screen built in, but unfortunatley I cannot find that many cases, other than the leather pouch and rubber skins for this player. I'd say if you're looking for an easy to use player, with photo, radio and recording ability, this is THE PLAYER at Amazon's current $169 price. Something with 20 gig 5 years ago would have cost us $2000. It's just incredibe how prices of high tech drop so fast. I always say buy the best from the last couple years and you'll be very happy, or get the latest and pay twice as much.

<Title>Very Disappointed
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a former Mac user who went over to the Dark Side with the purchase of a laptop PC which I love.  When it came time to finally buy an MP3 Player, I researched everything I could and I chose the Creative Zen because of the price, the capabilities and that it has a radio.  The second day I had it, after downloading 35 cds, it would not turn on.  I finally had to stick a pin in the reset hole and then the screen was filled with unrecognizable characters.  I ended up having to download the firmware on a ONE DAY OLD machine.  I figured it was "User Error" even though I did nothing wrong.  Today, a full two weeks since I bought the &*^!! thing, it won't turn on again.  Same problems PLUS the PC wouldn't recognize the USB connection.   I love my Toshiba Laptop and won't go back to a Mac but my next MP3 will be an iPod.   Now I hope Amazon will accept this back and give me either a refund or credit!

<Title>Software!
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I saw this item I liked the idea having 20GB at my disposal.  Some people have complained about the controls on this is kind of hard to master.  I had no problems figuring out the buttons on the player itself.  When I ordered this, I was really hoping it had the "drag and drop" feature like many Creative MP3 players have.  This one doesn't.  You have to install software to use it.  Here's the problems:  I tried installing it on my PC.  It installed with no problem.  However, the program WILL NOT recognize the device is plugged in.  I went to the Creative Support sight, no contact numbers.  Just a email service.  Got their email back, did everything on the list.  Still doesn't work.  SO, I tried installing it on my laptop, the software wouldn't even install.  Just gave me an error message.  Once again, I have sent an email to Creative.  This is the 3rd day I've had this MP3 Player.  So far, all I've gotten out it is that I have a wonderful silver colored $180 dollar paper weight.  Needless to say, if these software issues don't resolve quickly, I am returning this item and getting an MP3 player that may have less memory, but DEFINATELY has the drag and drop feature.

<Title>Will not recognize....horrible customer service
<Date>Tue Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this player and I was pretty excited. I hooked it up to my computer and it worked fine for two days. The third day it stopped recognizing the device. I did everything I could think of...checked out the online directions and did everything they suggested as well. Still couldn't resolve the situation. I called customer service and they wouldn't help me. Rather, they insisted on emailing me links to their website with directions to possibly fix the problem...rather than helping me fix the problem and walking me through it personally. I think this is horrible customer service. Needless to say I went back and forth, following the directions, not fixing anything, then calling back customer service to get another stupid link with more directions to follow. Finally the tech. rep. told me to reinstall my whole operating system since "that had to be the problem" I spent a whole day!!! backing up my files, and reformatting my whole computer. And guess what?? Same thing.....my computer still does not recognize the player when I plug it in. I have windows xp service pack 2 and they said this is what the player is designed to work with.   I really did not want to go with an iPod or something like that but I think I'm taking this back and I'm now through with Creative players. Take my advice and get something else. At least until they get this software issue sorted out. Very dissappointing player indeed.

<Title>It is not the best, but definitely good.
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its a good buy for less than $170.   I had no issues with the player so far. Sound quality is very good, and all the extra features like FM, voice recorder, alarm, organizer and the 20GB capacity adds its overall appeal.  The 2 cable design (1 for usb, a separate one for charge) is a bit weak.  Vertical touch pad is challenge to get used to - if you set the sensitivity of the touchpad to low, its easily usable.

<Title>My exact vision of the perfect Mp3 player
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an amazing Mp3 player in everyway possible with a few minor drawbacks, but of course, every Mp3 player has their drawbacks, and this one less than all the others.         it is a bit heavy, having a nice solid feel to it. the design is pure and sleek, with easy navigation controls if you are used to the touchpad. the surface is mettalic, so its really hard to scratch, and in my opinion, it looks waaaay better than those weird looking ipods.        all the control buttons light up beautifully, and clicks easily. the touch pad can be set to low, medium, or high sensitivity. the screen is just pure amazing, the photos look better on the sleek than it does on my computer. i jumped from a 1g no-brand name mp3 player with flash memory to this one and im astonished by the difference, and regret not getting it sooner. all the functions work, including radio, microphone, calender, time, etc. you can even manually set the items on the main menu.         when you are tired of the microphone in your ear, then you can connect the player to the speakers, and let music fill the whole room.         the sound quality is great! you really feel as if the band is right besides you performing.        the software is not at all hard to use. you just open it and put songs into your sleek, then after that you can organize them into playlists.       the only thing i dont like are the wires. they are quite the opposite of the sleek, being big and stupid. there are two wires the usb and the charger and when you want to charge, you have to connect the usb cable as well.... well its worth it.        i dont think theres another 20g player with photos for under 200 bucks....... its a great deal.        i bought mine on buydig.com for 147 bucks and am very happy with it so far. i hope this review helped you decide on the perfect Mp3 player for you. (although i suggest the creative zen sleek photo)

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In comparison, most commonly with the Apple Ipod with photos, i think this far exceeds the competitor.  The Creative Player has many adjusting features including how sensitive the control pad is as well as the vibrant colors and premade backrounds. Another great feature is setting a photo as the backround, which personalizes this player even better.  Though the Creative Player weighs more and is thicker than its competitor, it has a smaller perimeter, which is better for pockets anyways. Lastly, in comparison, Ipods tend to freeze frequently, but this creative player has not failed me once, and if it does it is programmed with a reset button on the side which will help tremendously if need be. I have and am currently enjoying every feature on this MP3 player and revel in the price differences as well between the  Creative player and the Apple Ipod.

<Title>After over a year, still a good little machine..
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this MP3 player since Aug. 2006. I use it at least an hour everyday. It is used mostly for listening to books that I download from my local library and speeches from my college website. I transfer and delete files all the time. It has had minimal problems with a lot of use. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It recharges fairly quickly on computer or using the electrical cord. It can be a little slow to change files, no big deal. It has taken a lot of abuse.

<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: 20GB CHEAP!       Simple to learn and operate       Plays multiple formats (huge bonus over Ipod)  Cons (unless I missed something):      No built-in equalizer      Girlfriend took the headset (Not product related ;) )      Aparently no way to  set up for  random play across specified set of folders, not even within a band. I find this incredible if true, so maybe I'm missing something. This is my only real complaint and the reason for a 4      Oh, documentation is a joke - hence my uncertaintly about the previous item.  Photo and other media cababilities not tested.

<Title>Wicked Awesome
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great bargain if your looking for a high capacity music player.  It doesn't have all sorts of bells and whistle but does all the key things that you'd really want such as being able to listen to music while it charges via USB, FM radio, voice recording, view photos, data storage/transfer and so on.  This is my first Creative MP3 player and the interface rocks - easy to shuffle, use playlists, find songs, etc... Not a big fan of the scroll/touch pad thing but its okay.  I've had a Gigabeat, iPod, and an iRiver previously and this is the best for about half the price I paid for those.  Actually the iRiver was pretty cool too because it had digital SPDIF inputs/outputs which was actually very usefull.  Battery life is decent.  Built quality is solid. I really don't have any complaints. Especially at the price.

<Title>Touch Pad Drives Me Crazy
<Date>Sat Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Zen Juke 60Gb device for 5 years and was upset when it failed (headphone jack became unstable). After reading many articles on MP3 devices I found that they are considered "disposable" and should be happy it lasted as long as it did. All that aside, after reading reviews on iPods I realized they are a product of marketing and not worth my attention. Being a big fan of Creative devices I started looking for a fairly low cost solution to my MP3 dilemma and settled on this product. I am very happy with the sound quality and seemless integration with Windows Explorer. Due to the 20Gb "limitation" I do not use the Photo features at all. I am extremely happy with the small form factor and ease of use. My only complaint (that I took a star way for) is the senstive touch pad that makes it hard to navigate while driving. That may be my bad but a easier to navigate device would definitely reduce my distracted driving and make my insurance company happy. Overall, buy this device over any Apple cutie pie iPod.

For a basic MP3 player this is just right and for the price it's definaly good especially since I paid a lot more for its predecesor.

<Title>Excellent Alternative to the I-Pod
<Date>Wed Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you don't want to bow down to the restrictions of I-Tunes, then this is the MP3 player for you. Creative includes a small program that easily allows you to add new songs to your Zen or modify playlists. You can even synchronize with Windows Media Player. My only complaints are that you can't swap battery packs like the Zen Micro Photo and that the battery life is less than advertised. The Zen Sleek Photo advertises 19 hours of battery life while i've only observed around 10 hours. Final Verdict = This is an excellent product that i would recommend to anyone.   -SDG

<Content>This is exactly what I thought it would turn out. The Sleek Photo is much easier to use in transfering songs from the computer onto the player. Everyone told me to get the ipod, but this is clearly better. The software is so easy to use and the sound quality rocks! Only glitch is that sometimes after you transfer songs and take the sync cable out, the mp3 freezes and you just have to restart it. Thats about it.

<Content>i've really been wanting to get a mp3 player for the longest time because i was tired of searching for w/e cd i wanted to use. so i got this creative zen 20 gb..i mean wow 20 gb. i thought that was awesome! the buttons work fine and if u make the pad medium sensetive then it's fine. uploading music to it is pretty easy but it helps if you have winamp to rename stuff and what not. the only problem i had was the first time i used it, the given headphones that were there...only the left ear worked so i bought a diff pair of headphones, otherwise that's it. it's a little heavy but it holds alot so it evens out. oh and the pictures ...some pictures don't look great on it because it's really blurry and small screen but it's still pretty cool that it holds pics too. i haven't used the recorder yet, but the radio works fine as well.

<Content>I bought mine last year and I'm just getting around to writing my review.  I love it.   It's a great unit and for a good price.  Creative MP3's (I had a Zen Micro before this on) upload twice as fast as my son's Ipod, and I have had no problems at all with my Creative MP3 freezing up like the Ipods do.  With that said... Creative could do a better job with their power cords and accessories.  The power cord is kind of funky and accessories are very limited.

<Title>Great player, another problem with software
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this product for about a year now, and there have been a few problems. After a year of usage, and three or four falls, the dirt and dust is starting to sneak into the screen. On this note, the player held up very well. Now about the software. I've read some reviews saying that you can use a different software choice. I used the included disc, and the problems are as follows. When you download songs and CDs, it will re-arange the music to be in alphabetical order, not in the track order. Also, when the download was finished, it did not show up on the player, so, a little disgruntled, I repeated the entire process, only to find that the songs and album art was already there. That was frustrating. Now in my search for different sources of music, I used MusicMatch, which is now Yahoo! music. I have had mixed results with the compatability of the songs. Some songs came out loud and clear, while others were soft, (could of been recording volume) but some songs only played halfway, then played static for the rest of the song. I recommend using LimeWire or some other free music source. Another note, I tried iTunes, only to find out that I had to burn the songs I bought onto CDs only to rip them onto my player. By now, there are many different choices, and maybe Creative worked out the kinks, but I am going over to the iPod.

<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For the money this is one great MP3 player, you get a lot of features i.e. FM Tuner, Photos, ability to change the themes for your color screen (which makes this a better value and not to mention just as attractive or more so than ipod). I found a silicone skin on the street here in NYC and so mine is staying in pretty good shape. I did drop it on the cement/sand street in West Africa (turned out ok, never had any damage other than a few scratches) and OH I forgot, the charger is dual voltage which is sweet if you travel all you need is the adapter. I have only had this freeze a handful of times on me but I just pushed the reset button on the bottom and it took a few minutes to re-build the library. My eyes are looking at the 80GB Zune now though if Creative does not come out with something comparable in price.
