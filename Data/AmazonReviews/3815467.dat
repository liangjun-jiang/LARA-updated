<Content>I bought 5 of them for my grandchildren for Christmas. They are GREAT! Easy to load music too! Easy to operate. All 5 of them are under the age of 10 and they love them! They have withstood a couple of Opps! I dropped it or bumped it and still it works. I would certainly recommend them for getting started.  
<Overall>5

<Content>I like this mp3 player. It is compact and fits just about any where. I did lose my USB cable and was able to buy a new one from Samsung. I was disappointed at the quality of customer service. I use my mp3 player everyday. The one thing I would recomend us that you buy new ear phones. The ones they give you are not the greatest if you plan on high physical activity. There are many more options on the settings than I thought there were.
