<Title>Wow!
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got the 8GB black a couple of weeks ago as an early present and it is incredible! Great sound, great scratch-resistant screen, great UI and the biggest surprise, the software. Yes, it's simplistic, but it also works well and makes syncing up your collection a breeze. Wireless syncing works well too; as a test, I was able to sync up with my home PC and get the new Ministry album I ripped to my library in about 30 seconds. Oh yeah, the FM transmitter is a much-improved feature, it actually works very well. Highly recommended!

<Title>Best player so far, with interesting new features
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my fourth portable music player since the first one 5+ years ago, a Rio S30, and it is the best so far (size, weight, capacity, quality, and features).  In addition to music, I always need a radio at the gym, both to listent o NPR but also to listen to the TVs, and the Zune has the best reception so far (and a nice interface to select from favorite radio stations).  I love the podcast functionality (subscribe from within the application and it syncs new downloads automatically, and removes the old ones), as well as the ability to sync over my wireless network at home.  I don't buy new songs every week, but new podcasts come out several times per week, and they get sync'ed to the Zune, without having to dock it.  And not just audio podcasts, but video as well (the NASA weekly ones being my favorite).  The player is easy to control and the display is very nice.  The earphones fit nicely and have a nice sound.  The PC software is simple and easy to use, very focused on the task of getting content to the player.  It is also easy to buy additional songs through the software, and I get to use the same points I use to buy things on the X Box.  There are some interesting social aspects to the player and software, for example being able to share your favorites and songs recently played with your friends.  8 GB (in red) was the right size for me.  The majority of the songs I like to listen to are now loaded in my Zune, with a nice variety of artists and genres. I also loaded a couple of my favorite photos, just to browse through them now and then.  Highly recommend it.

<Title>It is very good
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own iPod before, and Zune is definitely better than iPod. I like the size, the user interface, the sync software(even it can be dificult to install at some times), the wireless sync, support for wma, 2-way media transfer (iTunes does not allow you to transfer music from iPod to PC).

<Title>I Would Give the Zune 0 Stars if I Could!  Don't Buy It!
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought a Zune for my husband because all of our music files are in .WMA format, which is a Microsoft format. I have downloaded ALL of my music legally over the years in a .WMA format.  The ONLY REASON I bought the Zune was so that my Microsoft-formatted songs would be easily loaded onto the Microsoft Zune.  Imagine my surprise and distress when I discovered, after purchasing the Zune and attempting to load my LEGALLY purchased music, that it will not play ANY songs downloaded from any site OTHER than the Zune marketplace! In fact, when I called the Zune support line for support, they graciously offered to sell me all the songs that I have already LEGALLY downloaded and purchased from other sources! Isn't that generous of them?  SAVE YOURSELF HEARTACHE AND FRUSTRATION AND DO NOT BUY A ZUNE!

<Title>Great interface; semi-good player  (3.5 rather than 3 stars)
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I completely skipped Zune's first outing but thought the redesign was worth a shot.  I upgraded from a Sony NW-S205F wanting something with more space and more features.    The best thing about this player is the interface - it's extremely intuitive and looks great (especially if you've downloaded the album art).  The 'squircicle' gives you the option to flick your thumb to scroll left/right and up/down OR simply press and hold the edges.  I liked the touch function, although I found it a little too sensitive and turned it off.  I also found it didn't always respond to button presses and occassionally i had to press a button more than once, but it never became annoying.  The software was pretty good, although I feel ALL mp3 players should offer drag-and-drop functionality.  Now for the bad stuff: where is the EQ???  To me this was the biggest problem.  Coming from the sony player (their mp3 players are notorious for their sound quality!), the music felt sort of plain - although I'm a fan of bass so this may not be an issue for you.  Also, there's no mass storage function so you can't move files - music or otherwise - which seems silly to me since its got 8G to play with.  And I found the battery life merely adequate (I got about 15-18 hours without WiFi).    **Speaking of the battery, I should note that on my third day of use, the battery completely drained itself without my knowledge (i had used it for 30 min, turned it off, and it wouldn't restart later).  There are a few noted cases of this which you can google or find on Engadget.  It didn't happen again, but it definitely took away my confidence**  Overall, I thought the Zune 8 was good, but not great and I ended up returning it.  However, if you don't need a lot of bass or a long battery life, it's definitely a good choice.

<Title>The One
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before I start talking about the Zune I have to say that I've had several mp3 players in the past, from flash-based to HD-based.  My newest one is this 8GB Zune.  I got my Zune about a week ago, after getting rid of my 3G 8GB Nano, that I was not happy with.  So this is why I'm more satisfied with the Zune vs. the Nano...  Hardware -Shape is easier to hold and use than WS Nano -LCD is glass, more durable and sharper than plastic on Nano -Zune Touch Pad is more responsive and precise vs. click wheel -Wireless sharing/syncing option -Built-in FM Tuner -Better sound quality even without EQ...I just hated how bad the Nano sounds even with Shure headphones   Software -Very simple and easy -Asthetically better than iTunes  User Interface -No Coverflow but interface is more organized and intuitive -Customizable background, not an option on Nano -Easier to read  I have not tested the battery life but it's rated close to the Nano so I'll live with whatever it really is.  One thing I haven't checked on but someone else wrote about was the Zune not being a UMS Device when plugged in.  Hopefully that's something Microsoft can/will change so that you can store other files on it.  Overall, I'm must more satisfied with this player than the Nano.

<Title>I love my zune
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to have the 4 GB Zen and decided to get the 8 GB Zune this year. I was surprised by the new zune which is much lighter and sleeker. The zune pad is also confortable to use. There is no power off button it just goes to sleep if not used. Picture clarity is cool.

<Title>Great  little MP3 player
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My only regret is that I did not buy the 30 or 80 GB Zune.  This device is easy to use, compact, and the software is even easier.  The picture quality is amazing for videos.  The only slight negative is the finger pad.  It can be a little touchy as your finger needs to be right in the middle in order to make a selection.

<Title>No Zune for Christmas here!
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wish I had a Zune to review! I ordered this well over a week ago with Amazon's *guarantee* to be delivered in time for Christmas! Well guess what ... it is now Christmas Eve and there is no Zune under my tree for my son. That is very poor service, Amazon! To follow up on this ... I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped another in its place which arrived in 2 days. I appreciated their efforts to make the best out of a misfortunate situation.

<Title>Cooler than iPod nano
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to own both an iPod Nano and Video 30GB and bought the flash Zune to replace them after losing them.   Style is certainly subjective, but I really think the Zune is much more attractive than the standard iPod, both on the exterior and the on-screen displays. The size is great and fits comfortably in the hand.    The Zune has an innovative user interface. Like iPod, it allows you to navigate songs by title, artist and album. But one key advantage is that once you start navigating in a certain dimension, you don't lose the previous context. For example, if you start scrolling vertically through the list of artists and select one, you surely see the albums displayed, but that previous list of artists is still visible and navigable, just transposed horizontally on the top of the screen.   The only negative mark I would give Zune is that it can sometimes be difficult to navigate without looking at the screen and the touch pad, to either change the song or adjust the volume, especially with gloves on.         The FM radio tuner is a great feature and reception is excellent.  The screen is sharp and although small, can play videos very nicely. Lastly, the Zune player and marketplace is beautifully designed and easy to use. There are some missing management features, but this program is without a doubt a lot more visually appealing than iTunes. The iTunes player is as fun as reading a spreadsheet.   If you're going to buy music online, iTunes still has the best selection. I'd recommend buying from Amazon, which is cheaper, and comes without any DRM.  I managed to find a clever way to import my iTunes-purchased songs into my Zune library, while still abiding by "FairUse" guidelines.  The Zune marketplace requires you to buy credits in preset increments. I like  having the ability to buy one song at a time rather than having to pay $25 up front. The songs on Zune have their own currency as well, which isn't pegged to the US Dollar.  You might as well be paying in Euros.  You pay 100 cents for every 80 credits you receive. As most songs are 79 credits it appears a bargain until you do the math. This seems a bit deceptive and for this reason, I will not buy music from Zune marketplace.  It's a still good experience for sampling new music, however.

<Title>Horrible priority software !!!  Do not purchase
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I must preface my comments by saying that I am a professional videographer and producer for 15 years.  I had no problems with calculus at 15 years old. For the most part I am fairly adept at getting around what most would consider problems on the computer.   The good: The design itself is excellent and attractive.  The bad: Almost everything else  The software is by download only. Don't buy this as a present for a friend in a country where high speed internet is uncommon. I spent hours trying to upload my very rare collection of classical CD's that I spent thousands on.  I tried every trick I could think of to organize the files.  Originally I bought a Samsung K3 for a friend and had no problem upload the music. I believe the K3 can even operate without the Samsung software. I thought I could not go wrong with a Microsoft player that was second generation and offered 8 gigs of storage. I could not have been more wrong.  Unless you are satisfied with music downloads only you are wasting your money on this device.  If you are so lucky as to be able to get your files into this player you will then find out that both the software and the player have minds of their own.  No matter how painstaking you may label you files they software will rename the music. I may even revert some of the names to things on the web which are often incorrect.  I have no idea where it was getting the info from.  Originally I wanted to load some Pimsleur language CD's on it and the player failed miserably.  it refused to recognize my WMA files that were burned from my personal discs on windows media player.  After an extended effort I got "most" of them to be seen but they were placed in a very odd order. it is unacceptable to be forced to go through anything close to the procedures I went through.  It should not be a requirement to trick the player to get the music on.  It is obvious that Microsoft wants you to spend the extra money to buy their music.  It was only after the fact by going on line at the Zune site with a problem that they state how resistant the player is to any file that is not one of theirs. Check this out for yourself. Quote from Zune web page: If you buy protected songs from someplace other than Zune Marketplace, for example, they won't work with Zune. If your content is in a format that doesn't work with Zune and it's not protected, you might be able to convert it.    What is up with "might" be able to convert?  I cannot describe the frustration as a result of the hours I wasted trying to make this work.  I hate to be defeated but that is not even the point here.  The near complete lack of organizational ability in conjunction with the restrictiveness of this unit are nothing less than appalling.  this is in no way a "personal" player.  It is an unwitting investment in Microsoft.  ...and yes, I am a PC user exclusively.  A last note is that it is very susceptible to fingerprints and they are hard to remove from the screen.

<Title>Defintion of amazing
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune 8 came as almost a complete surprise to me. When i opened the box, it was almost as if i couldn't believe that it could be that small and that light. It's super thin, has a huge screen for it's size and is amazingly easy to navigate around. I could go on for a long time about the greatest thing about this amazing product, but instead I'm going to address the main issue.   THE SOFTWARE BLOWS -and how to fix that...  The main problem with the software is that it's clunky, slow, and syncs when you don't want it to, sometimes creating fifteen copies of one song.  EASY SOLUTION. In the setting panel, before even connecting your device, select that you don't want it to automatically sync anything. That means that whatever you tell it to put on there, it will put it on there and nothing else. Other then that, if you're patient, the software is actually pretty nice. Its super easy to use and has really nice aesthetics to it.   BOTTOM LINE: If you want a small player that won't break on you, get the Zune 8. If you want a high capacity player, get the Zune 80, which is identical to the Zune 8, except it has a hard drive and is a little bigger. Apple had better be biting its nails.

<Content>I love this thing. I have used iPods, Sandisk players, Rio, and more. I must say this is the best MP3 player I have used yet.  The sound quality is superb and should give apple a run for its money. I have already seen alot of these pop up in public and have convinced a few of my friends to get one of these instead of an apple product. They were not disappointed, neither was I.  I don't think you can go wrong by getting this thing. A++

<Title>Great Media Player
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Zune at Best Buy with my gift card.  After I unpacked it, I set it up immediately on my computer.  For the features:  Whenever I start playing a song, the sound quality is great, but it sounds very loud, so I have to the volume down.  The pictures look very sharp on the screen because the resolution of the screen is 320 by 240 pixels.  Also, the wireless syncing feature is great and about the same speed as syncing with the USB cable.  Furthermore, I even customized the menu background with one of my pictures stored on the device, and it looks fantastic.  Whenever I scroll with my thumb, it works very well, but I have to swipe my finger on the Zune pad several times in order to scroll very quickly.  However, I haven't tried the song/photo-sharing, radio, and podcast features yet, but I'll let you know about these features after I test them out.  Also, I haven't tested out the battery life yet, but I'll let you know after I find out.  One last thing:  I will be much happier if Microsoft added the feature where the Zune can display song lyrics, so I can sing anytime, anywhere without carrying a bunch of papers.  For the design:  It's very small and lightweight but a little bit thicker than my second generation iPod nano, which I use it to only record lectures because I already bought the Zune.  Besides, the body color red looks beautiful, but the surface still shows fingerprints.  One thing I really like is the lanyard hole, so I can wear it around my neck.  Therefore, I'm very happy with the design.  Overall, the Zune is a great product.  I will definitely recommend this product to people who want to buy something alternative to the iPod nano.
