<Title>Awesome MP3 Player!
<Date>Sat Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Pros:   -Very small and thin, about the size of a credit card.   -Extremely easy to put songs on and very fast with the USB 2.0. It only takes about 5-8 seconds per song to download to the player depending on the length of it.   -The equalizer is really nice especially since you can customize it.   -The battery was fully charged right out of the box and took about 5 minutes to get everything going including installing the software on my computer.   -The volume goes up nice and loud and doesn't loose clarity or anything.   -The radio has very good reception and never has static.   -The screen is very clear and has a nice sky blue backlight.   -The leather case is also very nice and handy.     Overall I couldn't have picked a better MP3 player with all that the MuVo Slim offers for only $160.     Cons:   The only complaint that I have is the ear buds that come with it. They have really good sound, but they are so big that they don't fit into my ear and just fall out. Also the latch on the battery compartment is a little fragile, but that isn't a big problem.

<Title>This is simply superb
<Date>Wed Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I think I have taken a good decission in buying this product. After searching over the net for a month, I choose this compact MP3 player as the best one and after using it over a month now, I found it to be the ultimate one when I compare this with other MP3 players those my friends are using. <p>It gives a harmony sound effect, no need to go for another ear piece. The voice recoding is excellent. I recorded so many songs and sent those to my friends and they couldn't believe that the voice is so much clear when I told them it is recorded by a mp3 player. They felt like I am singing infront of them. Lookwise, it is very nice and very handy for travel purpose. I also carry it with me whenever I go for a meeting. The download is very fast, only you need to attach the cable to the USB port.I don't see any disadvantage of this item. Worth buying it if you are a music freakout person. This item is for someone who loves music and listens to the soft voice. Also, it is one of the best gift items you can think of.

<Title>Important Note
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this item after much deliberation.  After much head scratching I found that this mp3 player can only play tracks in the correct alphabetic (numeric) order if there is an alphabetic change withing the FIRST NINE CHARACTERS.  So if you have an album with tracks: Band 01 - song name1.mp3 Band 02 - other song.mp3 1234567 thats fine  if you have the following: Bandrocks1 - song name1.mp3 Bandrocks2 - other song.mp3 123456789X Then it will play the tracks in REVERSE order (???). Maybe a future firmware change will fix this.  BTW: this problem is not specific to Creative products - I have seen similar effects with other products too!  Otherwise: I found that yes; the ear buds are a bit big and uncomfortable but produce clear sound (dont try to take the foam covers off as it is still uncomfortable and no I lost one of them!), the battery latch is fragile but once its on its firm (you should never need to remove it if you charge via usb.  The skipping folder option is really nice!!

<Title>This thing is amazing
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got mine out of the box and fooled around with it for a couple of hours.  I honestly did not know they made stuff this cool.  No it can't hold a week's worth of continous play like an I-pod, but then again it's about three hundred dollars cheaper.  The recording mic. works well and you can record stuff off the radio.  And it's so damn small.  I am completely and utterly satisfied, so satisfied that I decided to sit down and write this review at 1:00 in the morning.  If you've even thought about getting an MP3 player, this one is great.  Second Review:  This review is written about five months after the above review.  I'm responding to some of the negative reviews here listed about the muvo slim.  I'm sorry it didn't work out for you guys,  but as far as I'm concerned, the muvo slim is still the best MP3 device available for under $100.  I am an avid skateboarder.  I've taken about five good slams while using my muvo (one time landing more or less directly on top of it) and it's never had the slightest problem.  I don't think I'd run over it with a car, but it's pretty tough.  Battery life is still very good and it has never malfunctioned at all for me.  I love it.

<Title>I don't know how I ever lived without it!
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A great purchase.  I bought it about a month ago, and it still works great.  The equalizer allowed me to make the crunchy guitars in my music well...crunchier.  The radio was pretty good too.  It doesn't have AM, but who listens to AM anyway?  The voice recorder is EXTREMELY handy,  Especially for people without microphones on their computers, seeing as how this thing comes with one of the fastest ways of file transfering out there.  Simply amazing.  The quality is second only to my 6 speaker car stereo.  If you do choose to buy this, I would recommend that you buy a pair of headsets to go with it.  The included ones are very fragile, and constantly fall out of my ears.

<Date>Mon Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I LOVE my MUVO SLIM!!!  I'm a 56 year old woman, and when I say this is EASY to use, it really is!! It is SOOOOO user friendly!! I bought it to work out at the gym, but I also listen to it when I'm cooking dinner, scrapbooking, etc. I love the sound, and it's so tiny that I usually just stick it in my bra (in its case) for really easy carrying.  The drop and drag technology is wonderful! Mine holds about 55 songs, which is plenty for me. I love the way you charge the battery by just plugging the player into a computer.  This product is definitely worth the money... and I know I will buy things made by Creative Labs in the future, because they put a lot of effort into making this player absolutely perfect!

<Content>This was my second Mp3 player and I must say that I NEVER knew that it was possible for a player to be so easy to use yet of such high quality. I definitly recommend it to anybody looking for a small/simple/high quality Mp3 player. Another great thing about it is that you can purchase interchangable face plates to make it more colorful!

<Title>Overall I am very pleased with my Muvo Slim
<Date>Sat Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Muvo Slim for about a week now and I've figured out how to use all (or at least most) of it's functions.  I've ripped music from audio CDs and transfered them as MP3 files to my Muvo Slim and everything works great.  I'm no high-tech audio geek but I listen to music often and the sound output on the Muvo Slim is very good.  I'm currenly listening to a Haydn piccolo trumpet concerto and the responce is good in all registers.  I love the fact that the Muvo Slim recharges through the USB port, it eliminates the need for a seperate charging cord so I can recharge it at work.  The leather case is nice and has a magnetic clasp that keeps it from flopping open.  Even with the case it is slim enough to fit in my shirt pocket without looking goofy.  My only complaint about the Muvo Slim is that the FM reception could be better.  It works OK but I have an old Sony personal radio (powered by two AAA bateries) that gets better reception.  I do, however, use my Muvo Slim to listen to NPR while on the bus and the reception is acceptable.  If I used it to listen to music from the radio I don't think that I would be happy with the reception.  The metal construction and sturdy buttons give the impression of quality and longevity.  I hope that this helps!

<Date>Fri Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>just received my Muvo. Very cool.  Like the design, the pager like interface, the rechargeable battery, the usb cable (my usb ports are in the back). Little black creditcard size case with view windows and slot for earplugs and usb connector.Like the rock equilizer setting, crisp and hot. Not using Muvo earplugs,already had a sony pair that I like. Radio is ok but not a radio fan. When I carry it, people ask what it is (pager or phone) Doubles as a conversation piece when not in use.  Using it on a imac in finder  osx1.28. Dragging and dropping music folders are a snap. Have not tried it with itunes yet...

I installed their disc but deleted it after finding out about the media player.  The sound quality is excellent.  It is perfect for running and taking to the gym.  The only downer is the ear buds.  They don't stay in very well.  I am very happy that I bought it!!

<Title>Snazzy top pocket mp3 player
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After having a Memorex mp3 player die on me in the 4th month, I read a lot of reviews and the Muvo series seemed to get top marks for performance and reliability.  The Muvo Slim even got the top recommendation from a prestigious Consumer technology-review site.  One of the best things about it is the lithium ion rechargeable battery, which even recharges quickly through the USB port.  I went through a lot of batteries before.  Even if your mp3 player gets 10 hours on one battery, if you work out or walk to the bus stop every day, that can mean 1 battery per week -- that starts adding up quickly, believe me!  I ended up going for the Muvo Micro instead, but that's only because it has an arm band, and I go running.  I actually like the credit card shape of the Slim better, and it fits excellently in a top pocket.  But I finally got my hands on one in person, and I noticed that the nice leather case doesn't have a place for a belt clip or strap, so even if I had created my own arm strap, there was no place to guide it through.  Hope this helps someone else who was thinking the same thing.

<Title>Great package (including Audible)
<Date>Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Have owned many MP3 players over the years, this is by far the best, and the lowest cost. Battery charges quick (though the latch to close it is poorly designed, hope it does not break) with USB port to computer, I found the radio stations to be clear, and the size and shape is ideal for the exercise club. Not much to add to other reviews other than I use with Audible.com, and the download speed was very fast. What really made this a great unit is the fast forward button, which I did not expect it to have. You can listen to recordings, and if you miss something, go back and relisten to any section easily. Other MP3 players can stop, and start at same spot you left off, but here it is like a tape player. I record off of my PC webcasts and other events, and they download perfectly into this unit. So, in one unit, can listen to music, radio, books, or recordings. Only thing I would want more is satellite radio!

<Content>I recieved the MuVo Slim for christmas, and have had it for... oh. wait. 4 hours. anyway:  pros: VERY compact, slick carrying case (with all plugs easily accessible), folders which you can browse, etc, shuffle and shuffle repeat, also shuffle folder and single track, FM radio (WOW, this one's the really amazing feature, this thing gets such good reception it's like you're listening to a CD, voice recorder, MP3 and WMA, and especailly the FM recorder.   cons: earphones are not all that great; they fall out if you just think about moving your head. but hey, they're earphones. they're cheap and easy to come by - I know at my house we have more headphones and earphones than we know what to do with.   You know it's a good product when someone takes the time to get up on christmas morning and write reviews of MP3 players. Actually, it's not just good - it's amazing. Definitly worth it.

<Title>Major Disapointment
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First off, this thing deserves ZERO STARS. I bought the Muvo Slim for my son for Christmas, and I am very sorry I did.  It was great for a couple hours.  Then it stopped connecting to the PC.  The worst thing about this player is the battery retention mechanism is REDICULOUSLY DELICATE and was begining to fail almost immediately.  Why do these product engineers use a TINY sliver of plastic where they should use spring steel? I expect better from Creative Labs.  DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT!

<Content>I bought two of these for me and my wife for christmas. This is my first mp3 player and I am very satisfied. The battery has a very long life and is replaceable. I love the fact that you can transfer the music and other files to the muvo without any special software. I love the backlit screen and the tiny size. The sound is great (with my own headphones). The included headphones are okay, but aren't very comfortable. You can't go wrong with the Muvo Slim or Amazon!

<Title>It has its Pros and Cons
<Date>Thu Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this for Xmas, so im not saying anything about how long the thing lasts... but in my short term experainces ive experianceds some interesting things...  Pro's  The Sound quality is great, for and Mp3 player that is, since all the music i put on it was a mear 128 Kbps you cant expect lots, but even with that it sounds fine with now pops wizzez or cracks, even in my $150 Boss Headphones... Love that 5 Band Equilazer...  It Looks very snazzy  It has an FM Radio which I think gets great reception, It really shocked me with how good the reception was, and the cool thing is, you can record the radio! Which i have fun doing, get some good songs from your favorite radio statio, at semi good quality, it kinda seems to sound worse lissening to the recording though...  Rechargable Internal Battery, this thing charges quick and lasts a good 10-12 hours of constant play, and did i mention it rechanges Quick! so fast i couldnt time it couse i just left it for a little bit and it was done, and i was impressed...  And the Mic for voice recording, if you can find a use for it... doesnt pick up noise well, unless your speaking right by it.. dont count on recording any Physics lectures from your teacher standing 20 feet away.   Con's  The Battery holter flap is very flimey, it almost felt like i was gonna break it off the first time i opened it. In fact  The whole thing feels kinda flimsey which leads me to another point.  If your looking for something Slim, when you feel how flimsy this thing is, you wont ever want it out of its little casey thingy, which id say about double the thickness. But i guess its still pretty slim...  You need the Cable! To charge it, or transfer files on/off... not like the other Muvo modles where the Plug is on the player, so there is never a cable nessisary... very nice...  Weird playback system, took me a while to figure this one out... try and follow me on this one... So you break your music up into folders, and me personaly, each folder is an album, so in the individual albums folder you put the songs right! but if you transfer the songs on it in the order you want them to play, it will play it backwards..... stupid.. so if you want any order you copy the tracks on it in reverse order to what you want it to play..... very usefull information for someone buying one of these.. it took me a while to get my albums tracks to play in the right order, which is the only way to lissen to music in my opinion...    My nutral opinions...  The earbuds... you cant really complain about poor quality sound from earbuds, its all they do, ive had many sets of earbud headphones, and these sound no worse, maybe better even, probibly just average...  Im pretty happy with what i got... i wish i got the 512 model though...  Hope this review helps some...

<Title>Great Work Out Partner
<Date>Fri Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have done research on all of the MP3 players I have purchased in the past, both as gifts for myself and others.  The Muvo Slim seemed the perfect choice as an upgrade from my current workout player of like 2 years past (Intel 128 Mb Pocket Concert).  To make this a fast read, I will just do a pro's and con's list much like some others have done:  PRO'S   - Very slim, light and easy to hold - perfect for the gym.  - Software was easy to use and songs transferred to the player quite fast.  - Quality carrying case with a clever magnetic closure.  - Voice recording capability.  - FM radio capable.  - Straightforward and easy to use controls.  - Plenty of memory for gym use or otherwise.  CON'S   - Those of you who use the player at the gym and need to hear your songs in a particular order as I do when I am running long distance, you must go through an extra step before transferring each track to the player.  Unfortunately, once the songs are put on the player, they are automatically put in alphabetical or alphanumeric order.  To get around this, you must go to each track you wish to transfer and right click on it and hit "rename".  Place a number before each track in the order you want to hear the song.  For example, 1 - Where's your head at - Basement Jaxx 2 - Check it out - Beastie Boys.    - The case seems a little unsuited for protecting the player in a gym environment.  It seems like it would be too easy for sweat/water to gain access to the player itself through the open ends of the case.  - The headphones that come with the player sound great, but are totally useless for running, especially long distances.  They bounce right out of your ears, especially the left one.  I had to constantly reach up while running and reposition them.  Annoying as hell!  - Volume...Maybe it is my raggedy old headphones (Sony MDR-G52 behind the head model), but in a loud gym environment this player was WAY too quiet - even on full volume. My Intel player was SO much louder. I will try some new headphones and see if this makes a difference.  - The equalizer environments are neat, but some of them further reduce the volume, making it difficult to find a reason to use them at all.  Overall, I am very pleased with the form and function of this device, as long as I can sort out the volume issue somehow.

<Title>Not that good
<Date>Fri Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am giving two stars for the small size. Here are some of the problems I encountered with this product: 1. Very limited capacity to deal with folders. Only one level of folder is supported. That means, songs that are stored in a folder within a folder is in not accessible to the player. 2. No way to fast-forward or move back when playing a song. 3. Pause feature is very primitive. If you add a song or delete one, the player forgets about where it paused last time. 4. Control buttons are clumsy. Interface and controls are poorly designed. 5. Playing sons in alphabetic sequence doesn't work. This feature, if worked, would have been useful for someone listening to books on mp3.

<Title>Now I can hear the Dali Lama chant and much more!
<Date>Mon Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My husband wanted to buy me a fairly expensive MP3 player for Christmas--but I asked for this one instead. It has wonderful sound and I have had great fun downloading the free MP3s from Amazon and listening to them on walks. My son installed the software for me and showed me how to use it in less than five minutes and it is very easy and I can do it all by myself.  I love the small size--but the lit screen is big enough for me to see without my glasses. At first, I wondered about the main settings--two of them are immediate volume control--but after using it with headphones while walking and also in the car--I've found it helpful to have it set up this way.  I have also listened to a audio book on this player which is nice too. It has a little voice recorder which I plan to use to record traditional tunes that I want to learn. I already have access to a professional studio and don't need my MP3 player to be of professional recording quality--just good enough to remind me of melodies. :) I bought a set of headphones to wear as the ear plugs that came with this MP3 player hurt my ears. I had already read the reviews about this--so was expecting to buy a new set.  My sons all have Ipods and paid about triple what I paid for this, and will pay even more for extra mic hook ups etc. They are very pleased with them--but I could tell that my oldest son was very impressed with the price and quality of my selection.  Many of today's new techie items are wonderful, but have so many bells and whistles that it takes me a long time to figure out how to use them easily. The learning curve on this was really fast. There are still menu functions I have not used yet--but I'm pretty comfortable on the main ones already. This charges up fast on my computer with a USB cable. I can use the same cable with it as my digital camera--so I just leave it hooked to the computer and it is very handy.  My favorite free MP3 on Amazon is the one where the Dali Lama says a prayer over you. It is very nice to hear some wonderful music while walking, and then to suddenly hear the Dali Lama chant. I have never seen the Dali Lama and it seems a wonder to have a $99 MP3 player bring him to me with enough clarity to feel like he is really there. :)

<Title>MuVo-S Blue replaced my Sony NetMD Walkman
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My faithful 3 years old Sony Net MD Walkman had decided to retire before the long Easter weekend. After I was told about the hefty repair & part replacement charges by Sony Singapore, it seems wiser to  shop for a replacement portable music player.   After some careful research and price comparison, I have purchased the Creative MuVo Slim 256MB flash memory MP3 player [MuVo-S] for USD95 in Singapore.  PROs 1 OVERALL AN EXCELLENT machine from the maker of SoundBlaster PC audio card. 2 GREAT OVERALL PACKAGE is great value for the price & bundled with essential accessories & software. 3 SOFTWARE INSTALLATION is EASY.  4 ULTRA COMPACT SIZE & ROBUST FORM FACTOR.  5 ENERGY EFFICIENT. My unit plays for 15 hours non-stop on  first full charge!  6 ECONOMIC to operate, saves tons of money on purchase of dry  cell alkaline batteries! The MuVO-S pays for itself as it works for you! 7 ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY because it uses 1 QUICK CHARGE user  replaceable rechargeable battery which charges from the 5  volts USB port of your PC via the accessory USB cable provided. First full battery charge takes 3 hours, subsequent charge takes much lesser time. 8 FEATURE USER FRIENDLY PACKED includes a JOG DIAL for operation, FM radio, Equaliser, built-in Mic/recording...  9 GREAT companion for active outdoor workout without temporary losing the music to movement shakes. 10 ROBUSTNESS,the absence of moving parts like hard disk makes  the MuVo-S a tough portable product. 11 DOUBLES as storage for other important computer data files. 12 SLIM CREDIT CARD SIZE, its probably the thinnest any flash MP3 player could be.   CONs  1 USD95 PRICE COULD BE LOWER, but it is already currently the lowest priced branded 256MB MP3 flashplayer with same feature from reputable Japanese & Korean competitors. The latest 1GB silver MuVo-S costs USD180 but I don't need a jukebox. 2 Would be happier if a small matching color HAND STRAP or NECK STRAP is included with the MuVo-S to fit on its built-on eyelet for strap. 3 NICE blue backlight LCD display BUT I would like to see a COLOUR LCD DISPLAY in future MuVo-S if it is energy efficient enough to have one that will be real COOL. 4 You can't compare the sound quality of the MP3 format with audioCD but should be good enough while you are travelling.  6 NOT A STANDALONE PRODUCT, avoid if you are not in tune with the digital evolution and is unfamiliar with MP3.   This end user review would not be complete without some small talk about the close MuVo-S competitor, the chic Apple iPod Shuffle 512MB flashplayer. The MuVo-S is NOT an iPod Shuffle (iPod-S) killer. IMHO, the iPod-S appeals as a differentiated product which is designed to be a premium minimalist fashion accessory cum bare-bone music player. I have avoided the USD99, 512MB iPod-S because it lacks a built-in FM radio which I would have to replicate.Moreover,the plain iPod-S lacks an LCD display and may well cost me the price of a feature rich MuVo-S or another iPod-S just to replace the rechargeable battery of the iPod-S in the future.   Overall, for a little more than the current price of a 512MB/1GB flash plain memory stick or thumb drive, the MuVo Slim is a great choice for an ultra compact portable audio solution and it has successfully replaced my Sony NetMD Walkman, thank you for reading my person user experience of the MuVo-S.

<Title>Fantastic Little MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>With all of the hype over Apple's IPOD, many people have seemed to overlook the large number of MP3 alternatives on the market.  The MuVo Slim is definitely one of the best products out there.  The slim and lightweight design is perfect for carrying or putting in a pocket while exercising and the 256 MB capacity is more than ample to store enough songs for numerous workouts.  If you're looking for a portable MP3 player that is smaller than any of Apple's options, this is definitely the best product on the market.

<Title>Tiny and awesome
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I read an earlier review of this in a magazine, and it received a 9 out of 10. It is an incredible piece of machinery. I did purchase better headphones for it, but I never expect top quality headphones to come with an Mp3 player. The Ipod may hold more music, but the ease of use of this player, makes it much better.

<Title>Perfect MP3 player
<Date>Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player off Craigslist over the summer for $40, and have been very very happy with it. I had a free 64MB battery-powered MP3 player that I hated- it was going through a battery every two days, and sounded terrible to boot. This model has a great size, long long battery life and excellent controls and display. The downside is the very clear display does not light easily (you have to go to the menu and wait for it to time out to see the track name by night), but when it does it is very easy to read. And, you cannot browse by tags, for searching for artist, album or music type. Great device, and I am looking for a 512 MB model now.

<Title>great player with some glitches
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my muvo slim for several months. (I also have a zen micro 5gb, currently in RMA process) but I like this one for the bounce-able flash drive so I can use it while I'm running.   I've mostly loved it. I've never used an ipod, so I can't compare it, but it holds a reasonable amount of music, is compatible w/audible.com for audiobooks, is super easy to drag and drop podcasts into, etc. etc.     Everything's been perfect until recently. I just started having problems with it shutting down mysteriously for no reason, or if it's touched or if I yank the headphones or something just a little mid-play. I read that this has to do with the space between the battery and the battery door. Whatever the reason, it's kind of a bummer. Otherwise, it's a good player with a lot of features and it's cheap.

<Title>Buy another product
<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Loved it at first, then after a week software failed, so I had to download a new updated version from their web-site.  Worked well after that. I did not use it for about 6 months.  When I tried to operate it again, to my surprise, I noticed that the battery lad leaked and completly damaged the player.  Even though it was after the warranty, the company did not stand behind their product, despite the obvious battery problem.

<Title>Hate it but still use it
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm still using this thing but don't recommend it.  The rotary/push knob is a pain to use. It often misfires in the 'push' mode.  I usually use a fingernail to rotate it so it doesn't mis-push. I'd avoid this feature on any other Creative products.  Playing from folders and the play modes are a bit strange.  The battery connection became loose. I had to pry up the poor 'leaf spring' inside the battery cover to make it tight again.  Recording from FM is nice but only makes WAV files and not MP3.

<Title>Limited Capacity and Bad Batteries
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In the age of 8GB iPod Nanos, this player does not offer much by way of storage capacity for your songs. For some reason, the replacable lithium-ion battery keeps dying out on us. This has happened *twice* to us - the first time around, it was within a month of having bought the player so it was replaced under warranty and the second time around it was within a couple of years. On both occasions, the battery "puffed up" (making it very difficult to remove from the casing). Since a replacement battery is around $35, it's not worth replacing it for us.  Don't bother buying this player.

<Content>This is an awesome mp3 player. I bought it last year for my oldest daughter and she still prefers it to the new RCA Lyra she got for Christmas. It sounds great and it's easy to use. Recharge through your usb port and never change batteries again.

<Title>Nothing wrong with this.
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was pleasantly surprised by this device.  It's controls are simple, and not too bad even for big hands.  The earphones are actually quite good, but as I'm mostly a metalhead, I'll probably want some with larger magnets.  The custom EQ setting on this thing actually works, I got quite a nice mix with even pretty nice bass response, as well as cymbal definition, and it hangs in there even at higher volume levels.  Is it perfect, of course not, but I've read lots of reviews, and Creative Labs get better ones than most.  I read two horror stories about this particular player, but as well as mine works, I think maybe those were the inevitable defective ones that occur in any product.  I give 4 stars instead of five because I think they could include slightly better earphones, and the volume scale could be different, so there's more in reserve, so to speak.  But this thing is far from inferior, and I would certainly give it a try, if you're looking for one.  Lastly, this thing works really well with Windows Media Player, and the player software that you get with it is pretty cool too.

<Title>love it!
<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I cant believe that I have never written anything on here for the MuVo Slim. I got it back in early 2005 when it was came out with a great review in one of the computer magazines. At that time it was somewhere around almost $200 for a HUGE 256mb player that was smaller in size (not mb)than most other players and I didnt want to pay almost $300 for the 512mb. It is about 1/4" thick and is the size of a creditcard in width and height. I was shocked when I saw it was only $99 on here now. Honestly I cant give it 5 stars as much as I want to only because I dont like the software that comes with it. The software is hard to manage and work with. The MuVo works much better ripping with the Windows Media Player than its own organizer. I agree with some that say that 256mb is not much these days. But a couple years ago it was a big deal. Digital technology changes a lot fast.  I've had to make my own case for it because unless you have an IPod or one of the others, there isnt a case that clips onto your belt or pants. The earbuds were replaced with a great sounding over-the-earbuds that stayed on. The battery life is INCREDIBLE! I picked it up again after not using it for almost 5 months and it was still over 1/2 charged.  Ripping takes only minutes, it takes longer to choose the songs I want on it than it does to rip onto it, and I can get 95 songs on it. sure not a huge number compared to the players now, but it suits me. If you want more songs get the 512mb or if they ever come out with the 1G. My MuVo has stood up to walks in heatwaves to icychills, and yep I have dropped it more times than I care to admit. So its not the most popular mp3 player (ipod) but it is durable, has great sound, and if and when my MuVo goes out I'll buy another one (larger mb next time tho &lt;G>).

<Title>watch for the battery flap
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Creative normally makes good products, but I didn't even have this player a year and the plastic flap that covers the battery chipped off (even after taking care of it well) resulting in my many problems.  At first I thought it was my headphones, but I went through three new sets, and the mp3 player still sends input to the left headphone on and off... The headphones work in other mp3 players just fine.  This is a decent player but new ones hold more music for the same amount of money.  I'm just sad it didn't even last a year!
