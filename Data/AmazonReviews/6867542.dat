<Title>Looked good but the product was defective.

<Content>A high-tech piece of junk! I was very impressed with it when I first got it in the mail. After a couple of weeks, while trying to transfer some music files on it, the device just went dead and would not re-start. Make sure you  consider the risks before deciding to purchase it.

<Title>Software and Documantation Lacking
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this and it plays songs just fine. Trying to figure out how to make playlists and albums and sort songs on this is totally confusing. It seems to have some unknown limit on the number of albums and playlists you can have and the number of songs you can have in an album. I keep creating them on the software, download to the player and the song is there but no album. The documentation does not mention anything about limits or sorting. If anyone can help, email me at tukesmtn AT yahoo DOT com

<Title>This player is fly
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player the first week it came out and boy do I love it! Its so slick that i almost got mugged in the subway.lol. I dont care for video support and massive HD that holds thousands of songs. I wanted something slim and sexy and samsung delievered the goods.Ah yes, I just upgraded to 3.5 FW and I just love the custom settings for EQ and DSP along with visuals.The bass boost is seriously so sick that you can damage your hearing.My only regret is not having cool cases and accessories made for it.Two horns up.

<Title>Get it!

<Content>When I decided to buy an MP3 play for my boyfriend, I did all kinds of research and was ready for a difficult time.  But honestly, all I did was stick the CD in, download the software and hook the player up to my computer.  I preloaded songs into the player so it was ready to go when my boyfriend unwrapped it. I didn't even bother with the firmware - the software included works with no problems and does everything we ask it to do.  Including creating playlists.    We haven't really explored the photo or video features of the player, so I don't know how well they work.  However, the Samsung plays music amazingly well and that was all we are interested in.  The sound quality is amazing.    In summary: easy to set up, easy to use, sounds fantastic, great price.

<Title>OK, not great.

<Content>As for style, it's very cool looking. Functionally, the touch arrows are very sensitive, and the slightest touch will change you're setting. Also, one of the navigational arrows doesn't work half the time and requires repeated "mashing". Sound is great, and I don't regret the purchase, I just don't care for the sensitive navigational arrows.

<Title>One I bought had defective jack
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one of these as a Christmas gift for my wife. The jack on the one we received was defective. When you plugged in the earbuds that came with the unit, you had to spin the plug in the jack to find the magic spot that made the connection -- but even then the connection did not hold. We tried another set of earbuds and high-quality headphones with the device, without success: The defect was clearly in the jack of the MP3 player. We requested a refund and the Amazon return procedure went off without a hitch -- so 5 stars for Amazon but only 1 for the Samsung YP-K3JAB (only because you cannot rate an item as zero stars!).

<Title>Simple, Beautiful & High Quality
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this for xmas, and love it!  It's tiny, attractive and sleek as heck!  The sound is VERY GOOD.  Navigation is easy and self-explanatory, not that I require much where that is concerned nor do I have any basis for comparison.  The pad is completely flat and so pressing the buttons does take some getting used to (it's veeeery sensitive; subtle taps are all that's needed - any more than that will take you back more than one menu).  The LED display is really kickin', and I'm highly impressed they made something so classy looking with the simple (energy efficient!) LED.  Everything right down to the box it's shipped in is classy.  Go look at the video reviews on YouTube.  It's seriously nice.     This also has an FM radio tuner as well as a thing for photos that I haven't fiddled with yet. It will sort all your music by genre if you like, or if you import playlists it can do that as well.  You have to put those together in the software before it's transferred over to the device though.  One thing I love about this is that when you're stopped/idle long enough for it to power off, (a time length you can pre-select), this baby picks right back up exactly where you left off.   I listen to talk radio, so this is wonderful.  Listening time is at least 4 hrs between charges, and the player is  charged via USB cord that connects to your computer, not an a/c adapter.  The software they include for this is extremely user friendly, nice looking, and easy to use.  Like the player itself, I never needed to refer to the user manual or the help menus at all - it was all completely self-explanatory.  Samsung must know this, since the quick start guide they include is very brief.  Another really nice thing about the software is that it tells you how much of your alloted space on the player has been used.    Did I mention this thing's got style, and is really sweet looking?  Probably, but worth repeating.  I got the Eco-nique case to go with it, which I've mostly been happy with.  I like the fact that I'm paying for good sound quality and 4 gigs of space, rather than fancy memory-intensive pictures or an overly market-saturated brand name. And yes - I would definitely recommend this player to anyone looking for something simple, beautiful and high quality.  It may not have the name recognition (yet), but it's got everything an mp3 player should have IMO - nothing more and nothing less.
