<Title>Well Made Sounds Great
<Date>Sun Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I love my New Samsung player. The negative reviews are humorous. You can tell they were written by IPod owners &quot;defending&quot; their choice.I'm new to all this and could care less about Apple, Steve Jobs or anyone else. I just want a good player and legal service so I don't get nailed for stealing music.<br>I tried iTunes, Rhapsody and Napster. They are all fine. Anyone who says this player is no good or an iPod is a piece of garbage are just plain wrong.<br>My preference is for the Napster player that I bought because I like the Napster service the best. Its all about taste and I can't see all the fuss over priasing the iPod and trashing this perfectly fine music player/

<Content>Got one of these players today at Best Buy as they were out of the iPod. Can't complain I am using the napster service and for the same price as a 20GB Ipod I got a 20 GB Samsung player with 20 free Napster downloads and some nice extra features not found on the iPod.

<Title>Certainly a winner
<Date>Sun Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I researched this product in the magazines and here on Amazon. The only negative reviews were found here and I took them with a grain of salt as they were obviously written by iPod fanatics. When a reviewer says the Samsung Napster player &quot;does not work at all&quot; or &quot;it fell apart&quot; and then suggests that I buy an iPod, I have to seriously doubt the genuiness of the review.<br>In any event, the player is great and I have nothing to add except how to get the best price.<br>At Best Buy they have the player for $399 and you get 20 free tracks on Napster.<br>On Amazon you can get it through J&amp;R Music world for $399 and it comes in a couple of days or you can order it from Amazon for $379 and it comes in a week or two. I don't know if you order through Amazon or J&amp;R if you get the 20 free songs.<br>Find the best price and get this superb player.

<Title>Incredible
<Date>Mon Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>How they fit all the product features and storage space in such a small player is truly a miracle. The battery lasts for at least a week of my hour long + jogging sessions.<br>The best part about the player is the connection to the Napster service which rocks. I am a music nut and have tried them all.<br>Rhapsody sounds good but is limited on the download side.<br>Itunes doesn't let you listen to more than 30 seconds of a song.<br>Napster is by far the most extensive and flexible service out there. <p>The Napster player is the best way to take your tunes on path and on the road-it works really well in the car too!

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The best thing about this player is that it can serve many purposes.<br>1. as the obvious portable player tapped into Napster<br>2. for use in the car with the built in radio fm transmitter (something the Ipod does not have)<br>3. as your home stereo. Many people don't want to be tied to their computers to listen to music. They can use this player hooked up totheir stereo or just buy a good pair of speakers to hook into the system and plop the player anywhere you'd like in your living room. This avoids having to stream music via a wireless router from your computer to your living room system.<p>The features are all great and the interaction with Napster is a plus.<br>You can download all your other music not bought on Napster onto the player as well.<br>The only downside to this player is the cheap earplugs and handheld remote.<br>The rest of the player is top shelf and in all regards a superior player than the iPod.

<Date>Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>i see alot of ipoders flaming sammy here as anywhere else... basically both are nice mp3 players. both have working software accompanying hardware. both are from competent electronic producers. now design wise, yes apple got &quot;IT&quot;. it is so cool to look at ipod. however i got the sammy because of the FM recording capability and FM transmitter. OH YES! it is so awesome. i have no idea how i ever lived without these two features. (remember bart simpson and the FM radio mike? i have so much fun with this...) and all the special radio only mixes that i have in my collections. these stuff you just cant buy!<p>now to sum it up, i'm pretty sure ipod is good, if you want just a basic player. however if you know you way around electronics and want a extra features that you'll grow on, choose sammy. it may be little pricey but hey when you are using it every single day, almost every hour, who cares!

<Content>I made a mistake and bought into the Apple hype. I overpaid for the ipud and luckily learned of the Samsung Napster player which works with Napster. i did not know fo the player before I bought the ipod and then I realized that the Ipod only uses some proprietary Mac format that did not work with Napster. Also the ipod lacks the extra features of the Samsung Napster player like the FM tuner and the car adapter and voice recorder.<br>All in all I was luck in that I managed to return my ipud  the next day for this great player.<br>I am now enjoying Napster!

<Title>Excellent MP3 player
<Date>Fri May 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Look - it's inevitable, so let's get the comparisons to the iPod out of the way right away. This is not quite as stylish; you cannot create playlists on the fly or play games; and...and...<p>Right.<p>If you are buying an MP3 player to be stylish, you are kind of weird anyway and form over function is a poor choice in technology.<p>If you want to play games, get a cell phone with games or something.<p>IF, however, you want an MP3 player that plays MP3s and WMAs, has massive storage capacity, is lightweight, offer easy control of functions, and at least for me has so far worked flawlessly, look here.<p>iPods are overpriced. Simple fact. Plunk down the money for an iPod and you get a pretty little piece of mp3 player that can't play WMAs, gets annoyed if you try to circumvent iTunes, and has a battery that will most likely die on you in a few months (look it up, it's true). Oh, but that's ok - it's backed up by Apple's legendary customer service. By which I mean atrocious and feared customer &quot;service.&quot;<p>Get the Samsung. It's a good player. I admit that the FM transmitter is wimpy, but I didn't buy it to play mp3s in my car - and even if I want to, I have a tape adaptor from my satellite radio that works fine with the headphone-out jack on the YEPP. FM reception is great and you can record directly from another digital source with the line-in jack...and they include the cable! (something iPods do not), along with a (albeit meagre) carrying case, FM transmitter antenna, surprisingly decent earbuds, and the USB cable.<p>Go ahead and get it - I highly recommend.

<Title>No more CD clultter in the car!
<Date>Thu Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Samsung/Napster player is my first MP3 player ever. I compared it to others in the market, most notably the mini iPod and finally took the plunge. I am very pleased with the player.<p>The Napster software that accompanies the player is user-friendly and the user manual is very clear and informative. My only complaint is the FM transmitter function. The sound quality is good, but not great, and there is static between tracks. You will need to find the best EQ setting for the music you're listening to or else get way too much bass pumping through your car speakers. <p>Not being able to change playlists on the go could be a hang up for some people, but if you're using it to commute, it's perfect!  <p>If you're a windows guy/girl, I recommend this player for you!

<Title>Heartbroken -- I really WANTED this to be a great product.
<Date>Wed Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>There are a b'jillion MP3 players out there.  I have wanted one for about a year, but this one had an FM transmitter, which is what really seperates it from the pack (well, that &amp; the integration with Napster, which didn't matter to me).  I wanted to be able to listen to this in my car, at home, wherever.  And the FM transmitter should make that easy -- you don't have to carry anything else; just the unit.<p>Without going on too much, here's why I'm returning it:<p>1) The FM transmitter is very poor.  It's not just that the range is short (which it is), it also has crackling static all the time, regardless of which station I selected, and regardless of how close I put the unit to my receiver/antenna.  This was the case both in my car and on my 2 home radios.  I could hear my music well only if I turned the radio way up and had the unit within 1 foot of the receiver.  Even then there was an annoying static noise going all the time.<p>2) I had to reformat it -- twice -- and I only had this thing for about 36 hours.  When I downloaded my MP3s to it, everything seemed fine, but then when I would try to disconnect the device I kept getting &quot;Cannot disconnect right now&quot; messages.  The software said it was finished transferring -- I waited another hour, nothing happened -- so I shut down my PC &amp; disconnected.  None of my files were on the unit.  I could see them in Win Explorer, but they wouldn't play on the unit.  Reformatting fixed this, but wiped the drive clean &amp; I had to start over.  Second time worked with a transfer of 100 songs.  Then when I tried to transfer the rest -- another reformat.<p>3) You can only load music (even your own MP3s that you ripped from your own CDs) through the Napster software, and the Napster software sucks.  It froze on me several times, wrote corrupted files to the MP3 device, and is generally slow.  I did upgrade the software which improved the speed &amp; stability a bit.  But now that I'm returning the player, you can bet that I'll be removing Napster from my PC.<p>Anyway, that's it.  I'm really disappointed -- all I was looking for was an MP3 player with a (decent) FM transmitter.  If I was just a little geekier I could probably make this at home.  I hate that the only player on the market with a transmitter is so unreliable &amp; has such poor sound on the transmitter.

<Title>Sadly, I'm Abandoning Napster Because of This Product
<Date>Sat Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a reconditioned YP-910GS from an Amazon dealer.  Unit works fine (although I agree with other reviewers that the FM transmitter's too weak); problem is that the current edition of the Napster software won't recognize it (though an earlier edition did, which permitted me to load some songs).  Customer Service made an initial attempt to solve the Napster software problem, then went silent.  Since the Napster software interferes with all attempts to load even Napster-purchased tracks onto the unit via WMP or any other way, I'm stuck with $90 worth of Napster songs that I can't get onto the unit.  I've thrown my hands in the air and downloaded I-Tunes (which, of course, doesn't like the Napster tracks, either).

<Content>To start the FM receiver is weak and the tramsmitter is even worse. I can have the player next to the antenna and it still gets over powered by local stations. I never got any downloads from napster and didn't care for about all of the songs that came preloaded. I had to send it back to Samsung because I had problems tranfering music files. It won't do some tranfers unless your logged on to Napster. There was no mention that you needed to be logged on to transfer music. When I got it back I still had trouble tranfering files. One of the worst purchases I have made. The only good thing is that Samsung has good tech support and customer service personel.

<Title>Do not waste your time
<Date>Mon Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This gets 2 stars because I really liked the hardware. Problem is, the software is from Napster and the hardware is from Samsung and even though they say they are in "partnership" the software doesn't work with the hardware at all.  Simple things like ripping a CD to the Samsung is a nightmare. The software acts like it's pulling CD data from CDDB, but it's not. You either get a garbled mess, or nothing. Even though the manual says that you can build a play list on your computer and then drag and drop it to the Samsung, you can't. In order to do practically anything, you have to sign in to Napster first.  And, of course, when you call for technical support, Napster blames Samsung and Samsung blames Napster. Both are pretty clueless.  Just get a standard MP3 player and forget about this Napster/Samsung stuff.

<Content>I was almost convinced to get an ipod by some friends of mine. They all say the ipod is &quot;awesome&quot;. Well, its not, its just an overpriced storage device that some people think looks cool.<p>Its large and costs too much. So does the Napster player BUT, if you are going to shell out this kind of money you might as well get the S. Napster player as its sturdier, has fm, a car adaptor, voice recorder, fm recording capabilities and works with Mp3 and WMedia files instead of the iTunes format.<p>I got my Napster player as a gift so I am happy but I almost ended up asking for an iPod.<p>I would never spend this much just to listen to music. A Gateway  or Samsung 256mb keyring player for around $100 is a fra smaller player and a better bet unless you are planning on using your device as your primary storage component, in which case the Samsung Napster player almost justifies the price while the Ipod is a blatant ripoff.

<Content>I have an Ipod, and I decided to buy a Samsung player as well (I know, I'm one of the crazies who buy gadgets instead of eat!).  While I love my ipod for storing CD's, I LOVE this new player for the simple fact that I have tons of dance mixtapes from about 1984-1999, and I wanted to be able to digitally record them onto one central location.  This can be done with the ipod, however it takes a LONG time (you have to record onto CD, then put the CD onto itunes, etc), and with the Samsung you can tranfer your tapes right onto the device.  Sound quality is not magical, but at least I have everything stored on one device now.

<Content>The Napster Samsung player in addition to being player/storage device like the iPod it ALSO acts as a recorder for all media. <p>The line in/out feature allows you to digitize your entire audio library including CD, old cassettes and Lp' s. It also plays FM and can transform the player into a car stereo with the FM transmitter. In short, the Napster Samsung player can act as you entire stereo system by just adding speakers.<p>Also the Napter service is great. Many people don't understand the benefits to the Napster premium service. They call it renting music (as if renting was a dirty word-people rent houses, cars videos!).<p>First of all on Napster you can buy individual tunes and albums just as you can on iTunes so you don't have to rent. <p>The Napster premium service allows you to listen to almost all songs in the Napster catalogue-the ENTIRE songs not just 30 second clips. You can make playlists of these songs or even download them for playing them off line. The radio stations are also customizable allowing you to skip, delete or add songs (from you own collection or the Napter library) to the 30 + pre set radio stations. All this for just $9.95 a month and you have access to the vast majority of all great songs available on line.<p>With the Samsung Napster player and the Napster premium srevice you have all you music needs met!

<Content>All this iPod and iTunes vs Napster debate is kinda funny. It seems like the only people posting reviews for this product are Apple and Samsung empolyees. Nothing can be this good or this bad. I can tell you what I do know though. The iRiver ihp-120 offers all the features of the Samsung in a package just as small and even lighter than the iPod for a price fifty bucks less than both of these products. In my experience with digital audio, iRiver is the company to go with for both value and performance. Even if the player is extremely difficult to get your hands on, its worth it to check out. By the way, firmware upgrades will soon support the .aac used by iTunes.

<Title>A Word Of Caution
<Date>Sun Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Any product with music controlled by WMA may be lost if the service providing it goes under. Right now, Napster 2.0 is outsold by the iTunes store by a 5 to 1 margin. If Napster 2.0 never gets any traction and goes under, you may lose all the music you bought because Napster will not be there to authenticate it. If you buy this player, I'd only use MP3's with it. Of course, if you are really going to spend this kind of money, I'd stick with the best and get an iPod. No WMA worries with music from the iTunes store.<p>Before using this player for Napster songs, please learn more about Napster and WMA/DRM at Napster's "Terms An Conditions" Site. http://www.napster.com/terms.html<p>Be sure to read and understand the portions about "Napster may at any time lose the right to make certain Tracks and/or Materials available. In such event, you will no longer be able to obtain these Tracks and/or Materials or to utilize the "Sync/Restore" function for Purchased Tracks."<p>and <p>"Any security technology that is provided with a Purchased Track is an inseparable part of it."<p>Learn more about iTunes DRM at http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/<p>Digital Rights Management is new to many people, so it pays to learn about it before spending alot of money on anybody's player. <p>I do like the 10+ hours of battery life on this player, the iPod is only 8+ hours.

<Content>Just read the ridiculous Mac mentality pro ipod review. it says not to buy the Samsung Napster player because Apple is going to put Napster out of business!.<br>Even if this Mac fantasy were to come true, its irrelevant to the player's usefulness. Any songs that you buy in WMA format will continue to play on the Samsung Napster player (and the more than 400 other players made by Gateway,Dell, Rio,Iriver etal). You can also easily transfer WMA files to mp3 files using Roxio or Real Player software.<p>If you have bought the WMA files they are untethered and do not require any authentication from Napster or any other service.<p>The Napster Samsung player is far superior to the ipod and for the price you get far more features (fm tramsmitter and recording capabilities)<br>The Ipod is a closed system that does not function with WMA.

<Date>Tue Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ok, I figured this would be a good idea, since I am using Napster for all my downloads now, why not get an MP3 player directly from them. And the 20 free songs was a good way to finally get me to purchase this item for the insane price of 400 dollars at the time (8/2003). Ok down the to nitty gritty. The idea is nice, when it actually decides to work, which is rarely, it works really well and relatively easy. Download a song into napster, right-click the song on napster and it automatically downloads into ur MP3 player, disconnect the player from the computer, and boom, instant music. Good Concept right? Yea for the first 2 months. After that it kept crashing, losing every song Ive downloaded into it, and just stop working all together. I had to replace it twice! Thank God for Best Buy. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT PLAN. Or better yet, just dont buy this item. Save yourself the headache. If you do decide to buy this item, be prepared for the thing freezing on the opening page with the little napster logo mocking you as you cant get the thing to start. Get ready for all your songs to automatically dissappear for no apparent reason, and be prepared for the annoying problems when you connect the USB to your computer and it keeps disconnecting for no reason. Its just to much of a headache. I have 2 more returns for this thing then they give me my money back. Im going to bring it back again tomorrow since it froze on me again. Only one more to go. I give it one more month. DO NOT BUY THIS!

<Content>The antenna is worthless.<br>Transferring songs MUST be done through the Napster software and it reuploads the ENTIRE list everytime you want to update music. It's a real pain. You cannot just copy and paste mp3's to the player.  Song lists cannot be created on the fly and this is needed for a player that holds 5000 songs

<Date>Sun Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was my second hard-drive player. The first was the HP-Iriver 20gb and I returned that one. This one is also going back. I was looking for a device that would work with Windows Media Player and Napster's new music service, so the Samsung fit the bill. Unfortunately the device doesn't play playlists. The best you could do is play all the music on your device, or individually select songs. Neither of those are handy. You can play recently transferred songs which suffices until the songs you want no longer show up in that list. Support from Samsung is poor. The radio reception is also poor even when you are outside and expect decent reception.

<Title>YP-910 ROCKS
<Date>Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I Found this player to do everything it says it will. The software is simple to use and easily found all my tracks and set them up in the Napster program. The FM transmitter is a very nice feature. It works great it both my vehicles. No more cd&quot;s flying around the car. The FM radio works great also. My battery meter looked as if it was going to die after only 4 hours, but I set it down and let it play for 3 1/2 more past the last bar on the meter. Plan on 8 to 10 hours playing time with no downloading.If you follow the instructions on plugging in the USB and disconnecting you will have no problems. Some reveiws claim you cant make playlists,when you can make as many as you want with over 200 songs in each playlist. The Napster Yp-910 works with Napster or Windows media player. You can find these units for around 200.0 dollars now, way less than IPOD. The Dell jukebox is 15 gig for 200.0. The only thing missing is ripping software in the Napster player. So far this has been a very easy to use and quality player. I bought a cell phone belt clip and took it to the shoe repairman and had him sew the male end into the belt loop of the case that comes with this player. It makes it alot easier to unclip it to search for tunes or put away than undoing your belt. Also, Radio Shack sells an armband that is used for small walkie talkies that fit this unit perfect on sale for 1.50.

<Content>This is the EASIEST WMA player EVER!! I am completely computer iliterate and this is by FAR the best on the market. I tried out and returned the MPIO and the iPOD. The Samsung Player is the best 20GB on the market and is a VERY reasonable price compared to the iPOD. The iPOD is more expensive, and it doesn't come with the FM transmitter.   The reviewer who said that you could not add playlists, must be completely blind. You can drag and drop playlists from your Napster account to the portable device and I have numerous playlists on my device. They each hold up to 300 songs.  Check it out!!

<Content>The Napster Samsung was the first player Ive bought,and I have been using it now for 4 months. I have not had ANY problems with this unit. Dont believe this crap about uploading only with napster software, I have used my musicmatch, media player and the napster software to upload with and all have worked fine. With any players storage size you will have some used for the operating software, so as it states a 20g you only get about 17.5g for storage. Battery will last for 10 hours of continious play with a recharge in a couple hours.(let the player go dead for full recharge) Fm  will only pick up a very strong station,Fm transmitter works ok. Remote works well for what it can do,mostly for volume adjustments. The only problem was the headphones,will not stay in ears so upgrade to a pair of sony's . For the price of this player compared to what else is out there you cant go wrong !

<Date>Sun Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Was pretty impressed with the player. Have an IPOD, but missed the extra stuff - fm radio for the health club, fm transmitter. The FM transmitter is a little weak, but it does play quite well in the car. The FM radio reception is strong also picks up a lot of stations, that other portable radio's never do (KROQ in LA is crystal clear) The only weak point is the navigation, the song selector dial is on the side and sometimes it takes 2 tries to change the song, but liveable when you have got playlists.

<Date>Mon May 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I thought the hardware was most excellent, except for not being able to ever remove music from the player, and even though it seems to act like another hard drive in Explorer, if you transfer music to it from Explorer the unit won't see it.   The Napster software interface is pure junk, everything seems to work fine on my work computer but does nothing but lock up my home computer no matter what I try, un-re-installing drivers/program etc. The tech support from Napster is slow to respond and cannot give me suggestions to make this thing work. In their favor they do actually reply with suggestions on what to try. I also don't like having to be registered with Napster and online with them to be able to transfer music to the player.   Really thought I had a winner here, works at work, not at home. Sound reproduction is excellent though.   You can create playlists in the Napster software, but if you have 2 playlists and they both contain the same song, that song is then listed in your player twice. Napster interface is crap! There should be a way to use this thing without having to use the Napster software. It lists the songs in your hard drive library. Move the songs to another directory, and it still thinks they are in the old directory and continues to list them, with no option to refresh the list.   It has also yet to allow me to do a sync/restore, which is the only way to copy music back from the player. USB 2 is what it wants, which locks up my computer until I unplug the player. USB 1 sees the unit in Explorer, but does you no good. They need a simple interface that works, or allows you to use Explorer to move your music back and forth.

<Title>Ok if you are not looking for WAV files
<Date>Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>So I bought this thing because I saw all of the glowing reviews and because frankly I'm not a huge apple fan (my father has worked for IBM my whole life). The main reason why I bought a portable music player is so that I can transfer my Live Phish (and other jamband) discs onto one machine and not have to carry around 10 cd's to listen to 3 shows.  Well as it turns out, this player doesn't support WAV files.  So now I am forced to encode it into MP3, which is a lossy compression scheme and degrade the quality of the music I listen to.  This is an unacceptable practice amongst the live taping community and I am disappointed that I will be unable to transfer WAV files to this player.  I went to the IPOD site and they support WAV files.  I did some more research and found out that the Napster YEPP supports .WMA files.  This is a loseless compression scheme.  Even better yet, if you download Windows Media Player 9, you can easily encode any cd to WMA, by clicking the copy CD to hard drive button.  So in a few easy steps you can copy any .WAV cd into a .WMA files and toss it on your Napster YEPP.  In a few hours, I already have 50 discs on this handy player.  It's a little bulkier than an IPOD, but the extra features are worth it.  Given, it doesn't have the modern/futuristic kitchen cabinet look that IPOD has, but you win some and lose some.  Who really cares what the outside looks like, the inside is great.

<Title>The whole truth and nothing but the truth..
<Date>Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Unlike most other reviewers that wrote negative reviews for the Samsung Y-910, I do not own an iPod, never will either... I tried the iPod, and sound wise; it's really not that great. <p>I decided to give the Samsung/Napster a try because of its many features and Napster's vast music library. <p>At first the sound was rather mediocre, very hollow, and none of the equalizer settings could remedy that. It turns out that a pair Sony Fontopia earbuds makes all the difference, sound quality after spending another $49 was actually pretty good.<p>Unlike a lot of other reviewers I did like the player's controls and solid feel. The remote however is indeed not very user-friendly; and yes it feels cheap and flimsy..<p>I decided to dump my entire CD collection onto the player. At my first attempt I uploaded some 1000 songs to the player, which went pretty smooth, but slower than expected. <p>So what's wrong with it? It turns out that the Napster/Samsung combo doesn't handle bulk deletes very well; I decided I wanted to remove all songs since I didn't like the way they were showing on the players display. Removing the songs took many, many hours. Somehow it left 15 `ghost tracks' behind in the players track list. Samsung support blames Napster, Napster support blames Samsung.. I managed to remove them after I uploaded the same files and re-removed them.<p>Since I don't plan on deleting my tunes very often I decided I could live with that. (I really tried very hard to like the player.)  Next I uploaded all my 3500 songs. Looks like it doesn't like bulk uploads either; it took all night to upload! Given that it's a USB2 connection that is plain crazy. The Napster Client seemed the culprit; it was eating up my system's entire CPU capacity, and way to much of my memory.<p>It gets worse: After the upload finally completed my player refused to boot. All I got was the Napster cat staring at me. Resets didn't help, so again I called Samsung support; Same story.. It's a Napster problem... Called Napster: It's a Samsung problem..<p>End of story, I returned my player.

The remote is of little use too.<p>All in all you get for $299 you get 20gb, recording, fm, and Napster, musicmatch, dell, buymusic compatibility.<p>A great choice.

<Title>Better to go for the best...
<Date>Tue Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>So, after having using an iPod for a while, I tried out the Samsung. It feels much akin to going from a Mercedes to a Chevrolet. You've got to figure out what you're buying your player for and go for the device that works best for its most intended purpose. The Samsung isn't bad, but it comprimises real usability for features on a bullet list. The iPod's synchronization function is bar-none the best there is, the interface on the iPod is far superior (the Samsung takes far longer to find a song and play it), and the general feel of the Samsung player (and the Creative jukeboxes) is cheap.<p>I harken back to the day when Walkman's were all the rage and I went to Target and got a Mura FM radio. It was small, and did the job, but it just wasn't good enough to use very often, and thus wound up sitting in a drawer for years. My current iPod (10 gig) is an important part of my life. Just like my cell phone and the watch on my wrist, I never want to go anywhere without it. I think if you try them both side by side, you'll see this difference and learn, as I did when trying to decide whether to upgrade or switch to the Samsung, to choose the iPod. My new 20 Gig iPod has some features the Samsung doesn't (addresses, games, contacts), lacks some features the Samsung has (FM transmitter, etc.), but for listening to music and audio-books every single day, I just don't think there's any comparison. If you do buy the Samsung, just don't ever look the other way...

While it may have some problems, that's to be expected. These problems don't mean this player is a peice of garbage, you just have to deal with them.

<Title>WASTE OF MONEY!
<Date>Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>You might as well burn the money you are about to spend on it.  This stupid gadget will cause more frustration and anxiety than its worth paying for.  Let me list the problems with this poorly developed piece of garbage.  It does not store 20 gigs of music - it stores 18.6.  The FM reciever is so weak that you have to walk around the room before you can pick up a faint signal from your area's most popular and powerful stations.  The transmitter is not any better - if you plan on using it in your car, you should bring some duct tape or fashion a mount so you can position the player next to the antenna, or else the signal you will recieve will be so weak and scrambled that it won't be worth listening to.   I had to place mine in the trunk before i began to recieve anything.  The part that cracks me up the most is the fact that you have to pay for this player to be given the right to pay some more.  Unles you are willing to go to jail for downloading songs from P2P sources, you have to pay .99c for each song you download from napster, and you have to pay a membership fee.  Also, run Ad-Aware after installing Napster and you will notice that your computer has been infested with adware and spyware.  I'm surprised you even have to pay for this piece of hardware.  This player is obviously poorly designed and was released prematurely.  It is garbage, and you might as well spend your money on something useful like a Clie.  Do not buy this MP3 player!!!!

<Title>It is the equivelent of the S word.
<Date>Sun Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I can sum this player up in one go, but I feel it is not suitable for this website. However I will let you work out the word for your self. Starts with S and ends with T and is abusive in the middle and means poo. The antenna is a pain in the behind having to take it off and put it back on again was hell. The navigation is not user friendly at all. The USB 2.0 connection. Well that is only on new computers and expensive computers around here and not all of us are rich. But even so we are and the USB 2.0 is as slow as USB 1.0. Cheap nasty crap crap crap. Napster is a painful purchasing process, and I heavily reccommend the iPod, which I replaced this stinking piece of garbage with. Also, I recommend the 20GB iPod, my model, because it is smaller and lighter than the 40gb, but still has the features and accessories of the 40gb. It is the best of both worlds, plus provides Firewire AND USB 2.0 support for Windows (a 32 bit extension of a 16 bit patch for a 8 bit operating system designed by a two bit company that cant stand one bit of competition) users.<p>Neway in conclusion get an iPod 20gb as an alternative with FM transmitter, so you can listen to your ipod in your car without cables! or anywhere else you have an fm transmitter with no input slot.

<Date>Sun Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Purchased a new Napster and when it works it's okay and the FM transmitter is a nice idea which works okay in my area with few competing stations. Very limited range.<p>The software really sucks. For $300 and with 20GB of space they should have made it so you can load software and edit the data more easily. Software hangs very easily and if anything happens while you're loading it, guess what; you get to start all, over!<br>It takes forever and a day to load too and you have to be careful because the little green bars that are supposed to be showing your songs being loaded are not always accurate. Watch the % reading over on the left in the tree.<p>Manual is lame and there is no support on-line at Samsung.com.<p>I'd give this one a no-go.

<Title>It's All Good...Except for that FM Transmitter
<Date>Sun Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The new Napster, now that they have the kinks out, kicks the Apple site's little fanny.  Format, selection, speed, downloading, etc...just one very good site.  For ten bucks a month you can listen to just about everything, including programed &quot;radio&quot; stations...you only pay if you want to burn or transfer to your portable.  Enter the Samsung Napster player.<p>The Napster player, once they solved that freeze-up glitch -- and the new models have fixed it completely -- works like a charm.  <p>This little 20-gig number can be had for about $270 from some sites, so shop around.  But if you buy it, you'll get a very nice package indeed.  Great sound, better than Ipod to my ears, with the same good set of 'phones.  Easy, basic navigation, for those of us who are not interested in programming our little jukeboxes (we just want to listen to 'em).  Excellent little holster for wearing while walking or working out, with all the key controls easy to get to without looking...especially nice large volume control on the side, for when your shuffle mix seques from Bach to bass 'n' drums.<p>This is my 10th mp3 portable...and by far the best of the hard drive players I've used.  The seamless integration with the great Napster site is just a big plus.<p>That FM transmitter???  What were they thinking?  Almost completly non functional.  If you want to listen in your car, buy a better transmitter.  Or, better yet, run a little patch cord from the headphone jack to a female auxiliary on your auto's head unit.  If you don't have one, your friendly local car stereo expert can install one for about $50 max.<p>Otherwise, the Napster Player is highly recommended...and available at a big bargain right now if you shop.  Especially if you'll be buying tunes online, this one makes a great deal of sense.

Playlists can only be created and managed from the PC, and then copied to the player where it actually recopys the songs to the player - a very dumb and time-wasting thing.     2) For some reason, the tracks I setup in playlists stopped displaying the Album names after I transfered the playlists to the player     3) You cannot queue multiple selections (albums, genre, artists) to play. Only one selection can be queued at a time. The only way to achieve this is by creating playlists (yeah..right!)     4) The Now Playing screen does not use the space well to display the Album and Track details - a lot of space is wasted with animated wave effects, and poor fonts size. You end up with a cramped area and very difficult-to-read scrolling text. What were the design guys thinking?     I read a lot of reviews, and concur on most of the pet peeves about the weak FM tuner and transmiter, but I still think that the player could still be great without the playlist limitations. When you use a player a lot in the field, it justs irkes you when you have to run back to the PC for every little change. I am hoping that the folks at Samsung realize very soon that they have a potentially great product and provide the necessary firmware upgrade to address these limitations.     I do not see how having Napster provide the software can be in their best interest; as Napster is interested in selling songs, not MP3 players.     Otherwise, I feel I may have to shop around for a more friendly/usable player soon.

<Title>Good performance overall
<Date>Fri Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this a month ago from Amazon and I enjoy it so far. <br>My general rating of 4 stars out of 5 is based on the following:<p>Reliability in use: 5/5 -so far... (absolutely no glitches)<p>Feel and look: 4/5 (I don't like the white carrying case and  wish it came with an armband. The aluminum/plastic hardcase of the player is a good protection against &quot;accidents&quot;.)<p>Battery life: 5/5 -I get at least 10 hrs. (never waited to drain it completely-maybe you get more)<p>Built-in controls: 4/5 -solid feel, they do their job, but not a perfect layout<p>Sound: 5/5 but after using a set of good earphones. The ones that come with it are average quality. <p>&quot;Remote&quot; control: 3/5. I wish it had more features and I'm afraid the plastic might break in time. I haven't used it much, though.<p>Charger and USB cable: no problems here. A charging cradle would have been nice....<p>Audio formats: MP3 and WMA. Two formats are better than one....<p>Napster interface for music transfer: 4/5 - Registration required, but free; interface similar to Windows Explorer. I use it to download to the player either music from my CDs (ripped to WMA or MP3 first) or the tracks I buy from Napster. When you download music to the player, the interface tends to &quot;freeze&quot; a bit and then comes back when it's done. The download speed is about 2 sec/track or so with the old USB 1.1 I have. The player is recognized as a hard disc drive in Internet Explorer and you can also transfer files directly to it in IE and use it as a portable HDD. Note: ALWAYS click &quot;disconnect USB device&quot; before unplugging it from the PC....I suspect many users forget that and then they blame somebody else.<p>FM radio receiver: 3/5 - but depends how close you are to the FM stations and RFI sources<p>FM transmission: 1/5 -you have to be within 10 in. radius from the receiving radio antenna...I am not using this feature in my car, but instead I plug the car audio jack in the player and the music played is flawless. I wish they had also a holder for use in the car and a car adapter kit for those who don't have one. Would have been much more useful than the FM transmitter...<p>MP3 encoder: 4/5 -works well with the line-in cable supplied to record from a CD player (I suspect it works with an external mike, too, if it has the right jack size - that would make it a voice recorder)<p>MP3 recording from built-in FM radio: 5/5 --good for its purpose, but I don't find it useful at all when the radio reception is far from crystal clear<p>Equalizer: 3/5 - only five settings...<p>Overall: 4/5 --many features, price under $300 for 20GB, everything works as expected (except for radio transmitter), robust and 100% reliable if you use it properly, could use some design tweaks here and there and some extra accesories. Good value for the price.

<Title>There are probably better products out there for the money
<Date>Mon Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>There are a lot of 20GB MP3 players out on the market for around the same amount of money.  There are two features that swayed me to buy this one:  1) Built-in FM transmitter.  2) 20 free songs from Napster.<p>The built-in transmitter is worthless. I returned my first one because I just assumed it had to work better than it did.  I was wrong - the second one is just as weak. It's like I'm trying to pick up a radio station 100 miles away.<p>I couldn't find any documentation in the package to enable me to redeem the free songs.  Another review in Amazon provides that information - but nothing in the package does.<p>My last gripe is about the software.  This is an MP3 player that doesn't come with any software to transfer my own CD's into MP3s. It comes with the Napster software (free download anyway) and the Windows Media Player 9 (free download anyway).  If you want MP3 format, you have to buy a plug-in for the media player - that expense offsets the free songs.<p>The player itself works just fine so far - but given my frustrations with the FM transmitter, poor documentation, and the lack of software - I can't give this product high marks.

<Title>Ipod Alternative
<Date>Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A great alternative to the Ipod, this player has all everything the Ipod has and more. The player comes with an fm reciever and transmitter already, instead of buying a transmitter and connector for a grand total of, well... a lot of money(I'm not aloud to mention price).  Ipod doesn't even have  a reciever! Plus, with the Napster player, you're able to record straight from the radio into your song library!  Songs are the same price, the storage capacity is the same, but this player has way more stuff that comes with it, and, depending on where you buy it,  you could save yourself anywhere from (a lot of money) to (a lot of money). Don't worry, the Napster player also comes with a recharger, carrying case, earphones, connector and remote, just like the Ipod. Your choice, but my experiance with both the players has led me to buy the Napster player. And... I love it. So check both of them out, (or others) compare them, and see what you find.

<Title>Working very well
<Date>Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After recieving a Creative Zen Xtra that did not work at all and crashed my computer, I decided to try and find an iPod after returning the Creative player. I could not find the 20gig Ipod that I wanted anywhere, but came along the Napster Player. So far it's worked great, had no troubles uploading songs or playlists and the FM radio reception comes in clear. The sound quality is very good, especially with these Bose headphones I picked up a month ago. The napster software has worked very well for making my playlists and organzing and finding music. Transferring tracks goes by quickly; the longest upload I've ever had was copying and pasting a ~2gig movie file onto the player. <p>The overall interface and design of the player seemed very intuitive to me, I had no trouble picking it up and using it at all. The Ipod, though, still has a certain aesthetic that is superior to the Napster player.<p>Of my complaints, the only thing I've had a problem with is the FM Transmitter, since on the frequencies that are available, there is only one that is unused in my area. I can get pretty clear transmissions about half the time, other half of the time, not so clear.

<Title>Definately consider this player
<Date>Sat Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you're looking for an mp3 player, definately check this thing out! There's nothing that any other company has that this doesn't. <br>    Several major plusses:<p>  1.)The napster samsung player is fully compatible with the napster online service. Napster is, by far, the best, and most user friendly music store on the web, and, you can organize your entire music collection directly from it.<br>  2.) Most mp3 players have a similar setup, and Napster is no exception. It's as easy to use, and find songs on as anything.<br>  3.) The Napster player comes with more stuff!! It has an fm reciever, recorder and transmitter all in one. I haven't tried to use the transmitter, but the reciever and recorder are just great! You may have a little trouble finding radio stations though. But this is explainable. Any radio needs an antenna, or something to recieve radio waves. The player is really small. I found that the earphone wires serve as an excellent reciever, and now get perfect reception. Also, with any other mp3 player (cough, cough, Ipod!) fm recievers cost a lot more money!<br>4.) The last thing is the price. It's not hard to find deals that save you about 100 dollars more than other twenty GB players.<p>The basic needs of an mp3 player are all here, plus extra goodies, that come with the player, and yet you can still save lots of money! From my own experiance with this player, it's easily recommendable!

<Title>Terrible FM transmitter, no 12volt adapter available
<Date>Thu Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The FM transmitter is worthless.  There isn't a 12 volt cigarette adapter available in the US per Samsung.  Mine didn't work with songs purchased from Napster, a real problem.  The backlight is not adjustable and too dim to really help in a car at night.  Would not recommend.

<Title>Looks good on paper but the "extras" don't work
<Date>Mon Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a 6GB Archos Jukebox back when they first came out and have loved it to death (literally).  I introduced my friends at work to MP3 players and they all bought an Archos Jukebox 6000, too.  When my jukebox buttons wore out and my hard disk died I decided it was time to move up to a more modern player.  I looked at the IPOD, of course, but didn't care for the weird touch wheel and a few other things about the display model I checked-out.  I really liked the look and feel of this Samsung model, though, and decided to take it home.  I decided that the FM Receiver, FM Transmitter, and Line-in recording were really great extras for the money (a rebate available at the time made it equivalent in price to all the cheaper 20GB competitors). <p>But when I took it out of the package I was quickly disappointed.  No DC adapter available.  FM Receiver only picks up a couple of strong stations in our city.  As terribly as the FM Transmittter works they might as well have left it out.  The unit appears as a hard drive in Windows, but you can't drag music onto it or it won't be able to play it.  You have to use the included Napster 2.0 software to put music onto it, and that crashed horribly under XP every time I tried to load new tracks.  You have to make your playlists in Napster 2.0, also, and when you copy that to your player it re-copies every track (and often crashes in the middle).  The buttons all worked ok once I figured out that where one intuitively would assume the volume and track selectors were located had actually been implemented in reverse.  The final blow, however, was the browsing interface.  You can't browse by either filename or by genre.<p>I'm returning this as soon as possible and getting an iRiver iHP-120.

<Title>Once it got working, it's great!
<Date>Thu Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Took me a bit of effort to get it working the way I wanted it to, but once I got all of those little problems worked out it's been a champ ever since.  Very happy with the unit *AND* very satisfied with Samsung's technical support which has been excellent.<p>It was no challenge at all to set up and get the 20 free Napster songs - in fact the biggest challenge has been finding 20 songs I really wanted that I didn't already have on CD.<p>If you want to read more I've written a bit about my experiences with this device on my technology blog at http://schorrtech.blogspot.com.<p>-B-

<Title>Not what I hoped for!
<Date>Sun Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This device did not live up to my expectations. <br>It takes a very long time to upload or download music to the device, several hours in fact for about 10 gig of music and my computer was worthless for anything else while this was in progress and this computer is a a new box with 512mb of mem. <br>I could not get the FM transmitter to work well enough to listen to in my car no mater where I put the device. And the player froze on me way too often.  You better bring a pin with you no mater where you go because you need it to reset the player. There is a tiny pin hole on the side to reset, kind of a ctrl-alt-del for the player and I have had to use it almost everytime I use the player.  On several occasions after rebooting the player, I recieved a warning on the display telling me there was a problem with the software and to reconnect it to the computer to correct.  That was the last straw when that happened the second day into my week long vacation to the Carribean.<br>The Napster software and service in not much better.  I entered the code number for my 20 free songs but the software would never download the songs when I try.  A call to Napster told me I had 20 free songs credited to me, but the problem was with my computer, but they were never able to help me isolate the problem.  I still cannot download the free songs, and will not put up with being sent to hold one more time.  I bought it at Best Buy and after two weeks of pure fustration it goes back this afternoon.
