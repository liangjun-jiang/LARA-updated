<Title>Excellent product!
<Date>Sun Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my Muvo 4GB player for 3 weeks now and have been extremely pleased with it.  This player fit my very specific needs.  I have a large number of files that are MP3 and WMA (the latter purchased online), so I felt it was best to NOT get an iPod.  <p>My previous mp3 player was a MagicStar 256MB, but wanted to upgrade because I found my commute to be longer, spent a lot of time in the car or metro, and became bored with listening to only the same 60 some songs over and over again.  Plus, I go to the gym, and specifically wanted something durable and not have to worry about a huge spinning hard-drive.  I wanted a player that was light, small, unnoticeable, but could deliver big on functionality.  The Muvo definitely hit the spot with its 4GB Toshiba Micro-drive (v compact, durable, and high capacity).<p>First, this thing is SMALL and LIGHT... it fits perfectly in the closed unused ashtray of my car, keeping it out of site from prying eyes. I compared side-by-side with the new iPod 4GB, and the muvo is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller, lighter and compact. It probably weighs as much as my Siemens C56 cellphone.  I currently have 500 songs loaded on there with 3 different playlists, and have used less than 2GB so far.<p>On the metro and in the gym, I use the included belt holster.  Its very well structured and shock-proof, but the only drawback is that the buttons are inaccessible.  I can overlook that drawback since I tend to use playlists or continually shuffle my music.<p>The buttons are small, and people with large fingers may have some difficulty.  I have not had any problems manipulating the directional button (vol up/down, prev/next track), nor accessing the menu (push button straight down).  A slightly annoying factor is that you need to hold the PLAY/PAUSE button down for 5 seconds straight in order to power on/off.<p>The menu is small but readable, but I don't really read it all the time since I'm always on the go.  The backlight is blue, and ID3 tags for the songs scroll across when playing.  The menu includes tools, playlist, playmode (shuffle, repeat, etc), EQ, delete, radio, and microphone.  You navigate using the directional button. For my basic needs, I use playlist and shuffle.  I delete files using Windows Explorer.<p>I ditched the included earbuds and use my own Koss Plugs.  I did use the included earbuds for the first couple of days and found it to be sub-standard in sound and uncomfortable.<p>The sound from this unit is great... many different equalizer settings, but I set mine to Rock and don't use the other ones.  With the right set of earplugs, the bass is nice and heavy, and the sound is very crisp.  I use a cassette adapter in the car with the Muvo, and it sounds just as good.  I've noticed a little hissing or distortion, but that's either because of the cassette adapter, not having the player set at the proper volume, or your unit needs is almost out of juice.  Just play around with the unit to find the right balance.<p>The unit comes with a rechargable lithium ion battery.  I was spoiled before because my last player was able to recharge via USB port.  This battery gets a full charge in about 3 hrs with the included AC-adapter.  I haven't really pushed (nor paid attention) to the full claimed 10 hour charge.  Let's just say, I recharge every 2-3 days of my everyday activities.  I recommend plugging in your unit to the charger when doing large song transfers; those tend to eat a lot of juice. Oh, and the battery COMES OUT, meaning that you can replace or buy an extra one if needed.  The iPod batteries are non-removeable.<p>I use MusicMatch and am able to do file/playlist transfers using the &quot;import to portable&quot; function in MMJB. It takes some getting used to... I initially would set up playlist folders on the Muvo using Windows Explorer, and import my playlists into each discrete folder with the proper m3u file.  If I did not set up playlist folders with the m3u files, the unit would randomly read any existing mp3s in its memory regardless of playlist.  I've toyed with the included Creative MediaSource software, and it is a little clumsy with too many frames and windows going on.  Stick with what you're comfortable with because everything is drag and drop. You could just use Windows Explorer to drag and drop your files and m3u's directly to the Muvo, but if you do a straight drag-and-drop of your music files only, the player will play them alphabetically according to ID3 tag. File transfer by USB 2.0 is SUPER FAST. I was able to transfer my current 2GB of files on there in about 10 mins or so. I wasn't paying attention to exact duration because I was getting ready to leave and needed to do this on the fly before I left!  It did the job superbly.<p>I ran a recovery once on the unit because it froze during a transfer and the drive became undetectable to my notebook. When in doubt, there is a small pinhole in the back of the unit that will reset your unit to original state.<p>I do recommend that you upgrade to the the firmware: http://www.nomadworld.com/downloads/firmware/ <br>User manuals, support, etc are available on this website.<p>PROS:<br>- extremely small and light (moreso than the iPod)<br>- Great sound<br>- Huge capacity with a very durable and dependable microdrive (I've dropped this thing a few times with no probs at all)<br>- Long battery life<br>- Works with MMJB<br>- Inexpensive compared to other comparable players<br>- its not an iPod! Be different!<p>CONS:<br>- Small buttons take some getting used to<br>- Small screen<br>- does not support AAC files (for iTunes users out there)<br>- Playlist transfer (.m3u files) is not intuitive unless you play around with it and properly set up the folders just right<br>- Does not charge via USB (there aren't many out there that do that to begin with, and I was spoiled by my MagicStar)<p>I am extremely happy with this item and highly recommend it to people always on the go (commuters, gym, school, driving) and for people who are tough on their toys (toss in the bag, car, drop, etc).  Great value. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars for minor quirks.

<Title>Hacking the Muvo for the 4gb Microdrive
<Date>Mon Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The really interesting thing about this MP3 player is that it uses a Hitachi Microdrive for it's storage.  This same drive at 4gb sells for over $400.  <br>If you are in the market for a large capacity micridrive your best bet is to purchase the Muvo and &quot;harvest&quot; the drive.  Takes a little work but you save yourself some cash.

<Title>Good MP3 Player + Portable Storage
<Date>Fri Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I seriously considered both the Muvo2 4GB and the iPod Mini before making my buying decision. My needs are that I listen to a smallish music collections (about 4GB or ~800 songs), I wanted a small MP3 player that can serve as a portable storage device, and my budget was under two hundred dollars (Feb. 2004). The Muvo2 4GB fits the bill as a small MP3 player and it is recognized by Windows XP as an external drive once connected via USB (1.1 and 2.0 compatible). I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars and here's why:<p>The Muvo2 4GB isn't smaller than the iPod Mini as one reviewer mentioned. Volumetrically, it's 1.5 times as large the Mini. The Muvo2 measures 2.6" x 2.6" x 0.8" or 5.4 cubic-in. The Mini measures 2.0" x 3.6" x 0.5" or 3.6 cubic-in. However, the difference is minute because they both easily fit in any shirt pocket. Both weigh (light!!!) about the same: 3.2-oz (Muvo2), 3.6-oz (Mini).<p>The Muvo2 comes with the Hitachi (not Toshiba) internal CompactFlash II compatible harddrive. For a new unit, battery duration is as rated: 14 hours. I've tested the claim to hold true as I use the unit through out the day and it hasn't once run out of juice on me. I do charge it at the end of the day. You can charge the unit via the supplied AC adapter or via any self-powered USB port (not PCMCIA card). You do need to right-click on the device under My Computer (XP) and select "Eject" in order to charge it via USB. Otherwise, XP just treats it as an external drive. The Muvo's rechargeable battery is user replaceable and costs less than the Mini's. <p>I can drag-and-drop music and other data files to the Muvo2 from my computer with ease without the use of any additional software (simply plug and play). This is one of the reasons I chose the Muvo2. However, you can still use the included MediaSource software to manage your music collections. For the iPod, I believe you need to use the iTunes software to transfer music files.<p>If you compare the Muvo2 against the iPod Mini, the look of the Muvo2 feels a little cheap because of the plastic enclosure but it feels sturdy nonetheless (if you don't drop it). The Muvo's ergonomics can stand some improvement. The two smallish navigation buttons don't feel right. The larger joystick type button has imprecise navigation. The 3-second-hold-and-release in turning on/off the unit is annoying. After holding the smaller on/off button for 3 seconds, you MUST release the button before it turns on/off (meaning you MUST visually pay FULL attention to it when turning it on/off). Counter-intuitive comes to mind. Hence the 4 out of 5 stars.<p>As one reviewer suggested, you should download the latest firmware to make the unit function a bit more intuitive (the root folder and playlist are now the two first choices under the menu). The latest firmware also adds support for the optional (must purchase separately) external remote/FM tuner/recorder.<p>Why I selected the Muvo2 over the iPod Mini was entirely based on my own needs:<p>1.) very small, very portable MP3 player<br>2.) 4GB (800 songs) of music collections<br>3.) portable external storage device w/o need for additional software (just plug and play)<br>4.) two hundred dollar budget<br>5.) user-replaceable battery<p>Suggestions for improvement:<p>- need to mimic iPod Mini ergonomics (better navigation, better buttons)<br>- need to incorporate more software functions like the iPod (song rating, time(date), calendar, contacts, games :D)<br>- need sexy aluminum (real) enclosure<p>Overall, the Muvo2 sounds great, feels very small, priced right, and meets my needs. Nothing fancy or sexy, however.<p>March 2004

<Title>How much music do you listen to?
<Date>Wed Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This MP3 Players works well where all MP3 players work well--it is compact, cheap, and sounds great.  There is really nothing about this device though that puts it ahead of the crowd.  The biggest drawback of this device is its very small hard drive (only 4 GB), this is okay for someone who either only likes one type of song and doesn't need space for any variety or for someone who likes to erase music off of their MP3 player in order to put new songs on it.  Now, these limitations are the same as those of the new Mini iPods, so I wouldn't suggest getting those either.<p>The regualr small iPods with 40 GB or space are the way to go.  You can quickly and easily download your entire music library onto this device and take every song you own with you everywhere you go!  No other company I have every seen has come with as many peripherals as Apple has for the iPod.  Paired with iTunes 4 (or GarageBand if you are creating your own music to take with you) is the best way to go.  If you don't believe me--check out Apple.com before you buy any MP3 player and let them work their magic on you.<p>The iPod is more ergonomic, the buttons are exactly where you need them, it is attractive (either in your hand, on your arm, or in your car), comes with great features such as song ratings, date and time, and a contacts list (it even has games for when you need to occupy the kids on short notice).<p>If you are looking for a little handheld device that can suit your needs as a casual music listener, then this MP3 will work just as well for you as any other without any problems.

<Title>Perfect
<Date>Sat Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This unit is all you need out of a portable mp3 player. What truly sets this unit apart from the rest of the high-storage market is the battery. The shelf life of an average ipod is two years -- integrated non-replaceable battery. With the muvo you can buy extra batteries; if you take care of the device it should last a a few years. I don't have proof of course, I just bought mine two months ago, but I have been enjoying high-end sound quality and a good variety of tunes everywhere I go for that entire period. Great price, great design, great software, et al. I can't thank the wizards at creative enough for giving me a viable option to a flash mp3 or &lt;shudder&gt; an ipod which would have cost and extra $200 (!). For those fetishists who freakishly need 20 to 40 GB of space for their music - and need to have it everywhere with them - go ahead and spend the extra couple hundred, for the rest of the population I recommend this product both for yourself or as a gift etc. Cheers.

<Title>Small Hard Drive
<Date>Mon Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Nomad player adds nothing new to the table and as one of the previous reviews points out if you buy this device with harddrvie seperatly the price goes way up.  Overall I guess this could be a good deal if you planned on selling it on Ebay, but as for the player I would just move onto the IPod.<br>Everything this device does well the IPod does better sorry Nomad...

<Title>The good plus the bad
<Date>Wed Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got this player a few days ago so hopefully my review isn't too premature.  I am overall very happy with this player, though it's a real devil to find at the moment.  Anyway, on to the review.<p>The bad:<p>* The design, feel and interface is far inferior to the Ipods.  There's no comparison.  It feels pretty cheapy and the controls are way small.<br>* You can't get to the buttons through the case.  Instead you have to buy the FM remote, which is rather expensive (and you have to do the firmware to get that to work).<br>* You need to get USB 2 to get the files transfered quickly, if you don't already have it.<br>* You'll probably want new headphones too.<p>The good:<p>&gt; It sounds fantastic.  I'm not kidding.  It really does sound amazing.<br>&gt; The microdrive seems sturdier than the larger mp3 hard drives.<br>&gt; It's really small.<br>&gt; It can do wma's which is a great benefit.<br>&gt; With USB 2, it's fast as hell.<br>&gt; I have XP and the installation/setup couldn't be easier.<br>&gt; The removable battery is great (I got a cheap one on Ebay).<p>All in all, I'd say it beats the Ipod mini, which is the chief competitor.  To me, it came down to WMAs, the battery and sound quality over the interface.  If you care more about the interface, you should get the Ipod.

<Title>Pretty good, but not perfect.
<Date>Thu Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My first impression of this unit was WOW, it's LITTLE!<p>That's a good thing; the Muvo is small enough to fit (very comfortably) in your front jeans pocket; it's about the size of half of a bar of soap, and thinner, too.<p>Volume is pretty good, and so is sound quality, though a simpler &quot;bass boost&quot; without having to fudge about with an equalizer would have been nice. Battery life also appears to be pretty good. The unit is as silent as can be in operation, even though there's a hard drive inside.<p>Kudos: uses compactflash storage (even though you have to open the unit and void the warranty to get at it), so theoretically if 8GB or 16GB compactflash cards ever become available, the unit should be easy to upgrade. The USB 2.0 is a nice touch, as is the fact that the unit works just like a USB hard drive; plug it in and copy files as fast as you can.<p>Complaints: the navigation system isn't terribly convenient, and the screen and controls are almost painfully small. No remote is included; it's optional. Given the size, I suppose it couldn't be any other way, but the unit doesn't feel altogether very &quot;robust&quot; -- if you accidentally sat on it, it would definitely need replacing.<p>All in all, a solid four stars out of five.
