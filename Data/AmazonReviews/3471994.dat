<Title>Better than a Nano
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an excelent media player. It's a copy of the Nano, yeah, but improved.  First of all is the big, brilliant 2.4" TFT screen that is a pleasure to watch. It's the only media player that has a touch strip besides the Nano itself. But it also has FM radio, voice and radio recorder, and video player. None can be found in the Nano.  It's also very beautiful. The Meizu is shiny and looks like a black marble. The back of the player is like a mirror (surprise) and it's very scratch resistant thanks to a protective film layer.  The Meizu plays MP3, WAV, WMA with DRM, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC, with good sound quality. Video is in AVI format and is converted with a software included, looks nice in the screen, together with pictures. Files are transferred by MTP or drag and drop. Battery life is indeed very good. Charges with any USB port, including USB chargers like that used by the Nano or the Motorola RAZR.  On the downside, it has some quirky interface details that are not difficult to get used to, and could be solved with the next firmware update. I'd buy this player anytime over the Ipod and in fact I've bought many of these already.

<Title>Would not even turn on
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Absolutely the worst digital product I have ever owned. It never even turned on, only the screen would flash. I plugged it into the computer and nothing happened. I wish I would have read the forums before I got this because many are complaining of this problem and the "forum admins" are helpless: "Just try again.."  I've owned Apple, Sony, Sandisk and Creative players and they all worked! I will avoid all Meizu products because of this experience.

<Title>Works Great... When it Works
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this about four months ago and have mixed feelings about it.  The sound quality is great, the overall quality is fine.  The video quality is great.  It's quite user-friendly and moving music files is as simple as click and drag.  It's a great size and is easy to carry in the tiniest of pockets.  The video conversion software is a snap.  Overall  It does have a few major flaws, though.  The biggest gripe I have is that it seems to get confused easily and 'locks up'.  If I'm at all inaccurate while scrolling and accidentally touch multiple buttons, it locks up and nothing works, even the power button.  If there were a reset button, then I wouldn't care.   But there isn't and I have to wait until the battery dies, which can take 14 to 15 hours.  Also, the accessories on the Dana-Elec website are all 'Available Soon'.  I've been checking since I bought this thing and 'soon' doesn't seem to have come yet.    I'd advise against the Meizu.  I'm greatly annoyed that it's so easily confounded and is useless except as a shiny little paperweight until the battery dies.  Add a reset button and I'll be happy.  Lacking that, I'd advise against this product.
