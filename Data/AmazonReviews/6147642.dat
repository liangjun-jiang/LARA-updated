<Title>DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
<Date>Sat May 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the worst piece of junk I have ever bought.  We have an Iaudio MP3, which is fabulous, and an Ipod, which is OK.  Although the unit is cool, the software is absolutely terrible.  It is incredibly difficult to rip CDs and to manage the files, and only works through Windows Media Player 10, which only runs on XP.  I strongly suggest that you buy either the Ipod or the Iaudio.  This is really a loser.

<Title>Quite good.
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well to say the truth i expected more of this product, but it's working great. Battery is lasting for a very long time, the quality of the sound is great and you can adjust the EQ for yourself. On the background u can a put your favourite photo of your girlfriend, boyfriend, family, etc. The sound recorder is GREAT. it's even more the just GREAT. The sound is clean. It's possible to record songs from built-in FM-Tuner,which is kinda rare in the MP3 players. The thing i don't like is that if u push the butten, the screen lights up after a while. Video quality is pretty good, but in order to convert it into the needed format and size you have to download the program called IRIVETER. That's all i can say

<Title>A very nice player and smart choice!!! I just love it!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did an big research of mp3 devices last season....I was trying to find one decent mp3 player at a reasonable price. Believe me, this one is the perfect choice.  A friend of my family brought this from the US (I live in Perbut you can choose also friend's place in USA to be delivered then he can bring it to you, it works great! :) )  To you, my personal conclutions:  PROS: -Size, it's the size of a business card but it's kindda thick. Anyway it is still small and fits in any of your pockets. -The display is so so cool. Everyone who sees it get impressed by it. awesome click system! -Has lots of features, radio, text!!!,games, and beats the iPod...'cause yes! you can watch video!!! using the iReverter software from the iRiver website! -Price: today US$99.- WOW!!! -And the most important thing, the iRiver sound...just awesome!!! lots of features, eq modes, and a personal one to set. -I use it with a USB1.1 port and, despite of the extra-time in file transfering, it works fine!!  CONS: -Finger prints in the display, anyway the screen seems to be very solid it's difficult to scratch it(never tried though! :P ) -While in text mode you can not change the song played...yeah this one if you are very very exigent. -i'd like it better if it has more than the 40 volume top. -NOwadays you can consider it a little heavy. -I'm still looking for some sport adapter(arm-hanger or something) in my country...I think i'll get that cheap one from amazon :S, considerin' the way i get the goods it will take some time.  I can say I love this U10... Considering the cost-benefit this one beats any other product in the market TODAY.

<Title>Excellent, but the Clix is Spectacular
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I now own both the U10 and the Clix. While the U10 is an excellent Mp3 player, the Clix is spectacular. They look similar and operate in a similar fashion. However, the Clix has better graphics and a greater range of FM station options. The labels are bigger on the U10 than the are on the Clix. Also, unlike the Clix, the battery in the U10 does not have to be completely drained before you can recharge it. That is a plus. The Clix can show cover art. The U10 can not. The U10 has a boost function. The Clix has a WOW function. The big point, however, is that per MB the U10 is a much more expensive player than the Clix, which is now available in a 4 GB version for $199 at iRiver's Web site. As of this writing, the 4GB Clix is sold out, but iRiver has posted a new shipment date.

<Title>Poor life span
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 512mb model u10 right after if came out and after about 8 months began to have problems with it deleting songs on its own, or when I would delete them the songs name would stay in my playlist and would stop playing whenever it came to the song.  I have another u10 which is the 1GB model and after about 8 months it is doing the same thing, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy an iRiver product and if you have one take it back now because it will self destruct. IRiver isn't the only company who seems to have problems with their MP3 players lifespan, average life of a much more expensive IPod is only 18 months.  Until someone steps in and insists these electronic companies make a reliable product I am sticking with the cheaper products that services like Napster and Urge offer.

<Title>Good Video + Audio Hard to Install
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had problems installing and attaching the U10 with Window Media player 10. Called the help desk and it took 3 tries to get someone that Knew how to handle the installation.  Most of the people on the help desk have no idea how to help. They told me to return the product and get a new one that had the same problem.  Had to make a change to the regastry.  Then it worked as promised.  However, I had to reinstall the operating system and loaded Windows Media Player 11 and the devise work just by plugging it in to the URL.    Earphones are cheap so I replace them and the music sounds great.  Pictures show up chrisp and clear.  Games are lame.  And I have not been able to convert the anything to the required video format.    Pictures and video need their own utility to download.  The ability to use the frame around the unit to for most of the controls is east to use following the promts that show on the screen.

<Title>Excellent device...
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iriver u10 is an excellent device and has features that no other mp3 player can have all together.   Some of the features I love:  -built-in radio (ipod or similar doesn't have) -record sound/radio/linein directly to mp3 (amazing..., can record hours and hours...) -video -connect as a usb storage and you have the freedom to directly copy/rename/delete any file in it as its another folder in your computer! And you are not bound to an application such as itunes... -have different settings for song listings (such as list artists, albums, titles) BUT my favorite is that, it allows also you to browse the filename lists (not available in ipod) as in your computer. This is best if your mp3 tags are not well organized!! -Memory is flashram, so no need for extra careful handling -and finally; battery life is really long...  only problem might be the capacity (1gb). If you are the one that want to carry all his audio in a device, go for a hdd based device... Otherwise, enjoy u10...

<Title>Most certainly DOES NOT rule!
<Date>Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok so this little player in concept looked good. However just because the compnay says its has great video, does not mean it does. The video is blocky, sound is poor and this long battery life the manufacturer is saying, just isnt there. I took this back and bought a video iPod and was very happy.   I should have known anytime you see a "kid" saying it "rules" it most certainly does not rule. A child would have nothing to compare this to and therefore would think something this small was just too cool for school. Im sorry but it really is a piece of absolute garbage.

<Title>Another iPod knockoff
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, yes it looks nice (physically) but that is just because it borrows HEAVILY from the look of an iPod.  From the flat surface display to the four way directional control scheme to the hold button etc. etc.  Need I go on?  It's a knockoff.   And it's missing one of the coolest features the iPod has, the click wheel for scrolling.  Though controls from the display seems cool at first, it seems very counter-intuitive having to move your hand from one side of the screen to the other just to scroll.  And who wants finger prints all over the display?  Most importantly there is no iTunes compatibility.. The battery stinks, the video quality is poor, It's too expensive and there is not enough storage space... You get a hell of a lot more value with an iPod. Because of these reasons, this will flop..  Haven't all these iPod clone companies realized yet that emulation will never beat innovation... That is the one thing you should be emulating about Apple they are INNOVATORS.  Even the flash demo intro for this player on iRiver's site...,  I mean come on... Could it be any more Apple iPod like?  A white background with colored silhouettes dancing around?  I'd be surprised if the scene where the silhouette does a head-plant isn't lifted directly from one of the iPod commercials.  iRiver, give us something original or give up already.

<Content>The guy saying this is an ipod rip off is an idiot.  How this is in any way like an ipod because you move in directions to select things is beyond me.  How else would you choose?  To say it rips off ipods, then say it sucks because they dont steal the click wheel is just stupid.  Anyway, this thing is pretty cool and sounds good, but is just not worth the money.  Simple as that.  A nano really is a better value.

<Title>Fantastic little device
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first thing I noticed about it is it's size. I have fairly big hands and can almost totally enclose it in one hand - can definitely palm it. Next is the operation, the D-click system is very easy and kind of fun. Fingerprints are an issue but not a serious one unless you are a slob and/or like handeling your electronic stuff w/grubby/greasey hands. The screen is very bright and visually appealing. There is one multi-pin cable that attaches the unit to your computer via usb2 (wouldn't want to lose or break it). You can charge or do your information transfers or both via the cable. The unit offers an option for charging only or charge and transfer. Since I hate WMP I drag and drop my mp3's via windows explorer -which works fine. It takes a little more work if you want to create playlists, but that's a fair trade off to me to avoid WMP.It does of course have that great iRiver sound quality. The games are OK, but not my thing. After playing around w/iriverter I got video via drag and drop fairly easily and they look good on the 2.2" screen. A larger rendition would not be very good. Transferring photos requires iRiver's Picture Plus software which comes on a cd w/WMP10. It works fairly well. but is a bit slow. Also unless I missed something it seems to only load the photos into "playlist" folders, but high resolution photos (a lot of mine are 6 or 8 megapixels) look very good. AND you CAN view photos while listening to music. When previewing the photos on the player it shows all pertinent camera info, which is nice. So, overall it is a well made, fun to use functional player. The rub for me is storage space. Most of my mp3's are 192 or 224 so I'm not going to put much music on it. I can probably have 5 or so cd's, a movie and an unknown amout of pictures as it is difficult to determine how much space they occupy after iriver's compression software.  What all this boils down to for me is if I want to use it much, it would require a bit of effort in adding and removing music and or movies. For $175.00 I am happy with it but think of it as more of a gadget than a serious player. I will get the dock from misticaudio and will definitely consider getting one with whatever ends up being the largest storage capacity. It is however without a doubt a ground breaking awesome player. There is nothing even close on the market today. If iRiver can find a way to dramatically increase storage space without sacrificing too much size and weight, it is a real winner.

<Title>Swiss Army Knife, if small in storage
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my second iriver MP3 player, replacing my ipf-190t. I purchased this even after reading some negative opinions on this and other forums. A month later I'm still quite happy with the product.  Initially I had trouble getting it to sync properly. I emailed iriver (a month ago) and still haven't heard from them. Perhaps they never got it, as most places give you an immediate autoreply. Anyway, I reflashed the firmware and ever since it works like a charm. I'm a playlist guy, and it syncs with Windows Media Player 10 nicely. I also listen to the radio, so it's nice to have one built in. Occasionally I have to record meetings, and once again, the U10 shines. My main reason for upgrading to a multimedia player was to have a high-tech photo album in my pocket. I have a still gallery and a couple of movies of my kids on it. In short, this cute little player does everything I want it to do.  Yes, I would like to have more storage, and will probably upgrade to a 2- or 4-Gb U10 if/when one comes out, but I don't need to carry my entire music collection with me, nor do I ever plan on watching an episode of "CSI" on any screen this size, no matter how nice the resolution is.  My Raves:  Does everything. Looks cool doing it. Great battery life.  My Rants:  Not easy to carry. (You have to lock the "mouse" before you put it in your pocket, or you'll change tunes simply by walking.) The included carrying case doesn't close securely or have a belt clip.  Instructions don't tell you how to transcode movies.  Screen should be anti-glare.   A comment on other reviews: I have a 30 Mb video on it and it plays full screen, just fine.

<Title>Wow!
<Date>Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is great!  Seriously, I just got mine a few days ago, and it is wonderful.  The sound is pretty good, and the interface is very usable.  It has many many more features than other players I was considering, and the video isn't as bad as others make it out to be.  I mean, the screen is 2 inches, how high quality do you need!  To make the video usable, you're going to need to download a tool called iriverter which is free and very easy to use.  The only drawback is the storage size, but I'm just too impatient to wait until they come out with something bigger.  This is really great even with only 1GB, and so tiny!  I'd say this is much much better than a nano.

<Title>The BEST Gadget in the World's history - the New King.
<Date>Thu Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I start, let me tell you this:  The iPod brand was COPIED from iRiver!!!  Good! And remember that. Anyway, after receiving a U10 for review from iriver, I have written a big review about it: enjoy Very Happy  There's an interesting story behind the U10. Apparently, the head honcho at iRiver got together the whole design and engineering team back at base in Korea and told them to that they needed to change their thinking. He told them to go back to the drawing board and come up with something new - to make a complete U-turn with their thinking. U-Turn - U10, geddit. It was a sensible idea. iRiver's range of largely me-too MP3 players were dull but worthy but there was no chance that these types of products were ever going to make any inroads on Apple's market share. Having said that, last year's N10, was one of the most stylish players ever, so there were previous signs that iRiver could come up with special products..    And if there's one thing the U10 is, it's certainly different. The player is an oblong shaped device and measures 69 x 47 x 16 mm. It's thicker than an iPod nano but shorter. Compared to the 42g nano, it is bulky though and at 70g, noticeably heavier. The first time you plug in the player it will charge, taking one hour to fill up to 50 per cent, and 2.5 hours to charge fully. Playback for audio only is rated at a chunky 20 hours    The intrigued aspect of it is that the device has a 2.2in, 320 x 240 screen that can display 260,000 colours - and that's it. Rather than being festooned with myriad small buttons to small to press, all the navigation buttons are part of the screen. You press at the top of the screen for left, at the right to move right and guess where to move up and down. It's a similar concept to the buttons integrated into the iPod's click-wheel. One issue though is that the size of the screen is actually deceptive as the edges are devoted to the buttons and frame the 320 x 240 resolution screen. The only thing is that with the constant pressing on the screen, you almost need to carry a cleaning cloth with the player at all times otherwise the screen gets covered in finger prints.  There are some buttons - the power switch on the right and beneath that a button that toggles the screen between landscape and portrait mode and two small buttons for volume up and down. Underneath there's a hold button, and a small reset switch, which I didn't have need for during my time with the player. To get advanced options you press and hold on the right button and you do the same to get back to the currently playing track when you're in a different menu. For a flashed based player it does take a tad too long to turn on, and the animations make navigation a bit on the sluggish side, though there is a setting to speed this up.    The player is undeniably awash with features. On the audio side first and foremost it will play MP3, WMA, ASF and the ultra efficient OGG. Only the Apple flavoured AAC is conspicuous by its absence, though that's hardly surprising. It can also record to MP3, either from the built-in microphone or from the built-in FM radio, a feature only just released by Apple and even then, only as an external accessory. It can also play back video, though admittedly only at 15 frames per second. However, for all its good work in features, design and navigation, iRiver falls down for the same reason that every other PC focussed manufacturer does - getting content onto the device itself. The U10 uses no less than three different methods.    Firstly, music is transferred over using Windows Media Player. To be fair, this works quite well. WMP might not be as good as iTunes, but once you get to know its quirks you'll be transferring your tracks in no time. However, if you want to transfer pictures you have to use the supplied application called Picture Plus. This is because pictures need to be converted to a proprietary format rather than just copied over. The software does enable you to place pictures in their own folders and when you copy your pictures over the EXIF information contained in the file is displayed too.  Video's on the other hand are copied over using Windows Explorer. For some inexplicable reason the video folder is not a sub-folder of the Media folder, but is in the Data folder. Surely, video is media? The iRiver can only play back video in a very specific avi format and rather short-sightedly, no utility is supplied to convert video. There is however, a third party app called iriverter, available , here, that will do the job. It doesn't yet have any profiles for the U10 but if does work. Choose a profile for one of the other devices and set the resolution to 320 x 240, the fps to 15, the video bit-rate to 384Kbps or less and the audio to 128Kbps or less. Having done this, a 693MB movies was converted to 320MB, so you can fit a couple of movies on the 1GB player and have room for music and pictures. However the screen is so small, so watching shorter things like the Simpsons might be more suitable.    FM radio quality was as good as can be expected and navigating stations was easy. Press up and down to scroll through the frequencies manually or hold down to switch between presets. Recording was easy but there was no way of playing back the recording on the device itself - it could only be accessed once connected to a PC. There are six flash games on the device and while there not exactly PSP quality games, they are mildly diverting fodder, such as a Space Invaders clone, Sodoku, and one where you have to keep a fat man from falling off a log. (That's not a metaphor, that's literal). They are though, better than the ones on the iPod.  Sound quality wise I was as impressed as ever by iRiver and the U10 sounded loud, clear and accurate. The screen was also good, with bright, vibrant colours for photos and text is clear. However, this is only if you look straight on. Angle it either up or down or to the side and the colours immediately become washed out. It could also do with a touch more contrast and dark scenes in videos are hard to make out.    In addition to the player itself, iRiver has an optional cradle that costs ?40. With the U10 housed inside it looks very much like a miniature television from the 50s. The cradle has a remote control and if you plug some speakers into the line out, you can listen and control your music from a distance. There's even a line-in on the cradle and the U10 will then encode direct to MP3. a cool feature is snooze button on top of the cradle so you can use it as alarm clock and wake up to a track or the radio.  There's no doubt that the U10 is a player brimming with features. I can't think of anything this size that can do so much. However, you have to pay for the privilege. The 1GB player is ?140, the same as a 2GB iPod nano and ?20 more will buy you an 8GB Creative Zen MicroPhoto, though that has a small screen and can't play video. Feature wise, the iRiver wins with FM radio and video playback, but with the latter, the 2GB version would be more useful and that will set you back ?190 when it's released. While the U10 itself scores highly for usability, as ever, the non-Apple product loses out as a complete user experience. iRiver needs to sit down and create an iTunes rival to consolidate the three different applications and Windows Explorer that are currently required to get content onto the player.    This issue means that while the U10 might be eye catching, you'll need to be on the techie side to actually make the most of this player. Buy this for your non-techie Dad for his birthday and you'd do well to include the receipt. For the more technically confident and patient though, this is a great alternative to the nano. It looks good, it sounds great and is the more capable device. And ever since, `Thinking Different' meant thinking the same as everyone else, it even has greater gadget appeal. Verdict  The U10 has an innovative interface that works well and is feature laden, with music, pictures, video, text, radio and games in one tiny package. The downsides are the relatively high price for the capacity and the clumsy method of getting content onto the device. Get past those, and the U10 is a winner that just might take a few sales from the iPod nano.

<Content>I own iRiver iHP-120, 3rd gen Ipod 40gig, shuffle(I wonder what Apple was thinking making this without display), and finally U10.  My iHP-120's is the oldest one yet still being used the most and best one compared to Ipod junks until this U10 came along.  Wait until you get a hold of U10 in your hand.  It is really small in your hand yet can't belive how extreamly easy it is to use.  Ipod's scroll and click stuff seems very cool but actually it's not that easy to use especailly when you're driving in the car.  Only thing I'm missing is a remote controller came with iHP-120 where iHP will always sit inside the glove but then again U10 is little bigger than the iHP remote. :)
