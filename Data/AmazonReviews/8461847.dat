<Title>I'm loving it!
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got this delivered today, and so far I love it!  I have been using Rhapsody for a while now, and so this is a great way to get all that music and take it with me, without having to go through the computer first.  I've already discovered new music that I like - and that to me is the real reward with this guy.  Just pop on rhapsody - it really feels built in and not like some extra step - and look at your playlists or their recommendations or search for something.  Then while you're playing it, find other music by artists like that one.  Even subscribe and download podcasts right from the device.  Very cool!  I like the quality of the screen and menus, too.  Now for the reality of it and the reason it didn't get that last star from me:  Sometimes it hiccups a little and freezes for a few seconds, and the wifi antenna isn't as powerful as it could be - My computer can see my network, but the ibiza can't right now.  The touchpad and entering text, especially on the web browser, could be improved.  Sometimes I miss the line I'm trying to hit.  I'd like to be able to rate albums and artists like you can in Rhapsody (but I can always do that from my computer).  And the looks aren't top-notch, but I am happy with the general feeing of the construction.  I expect to be listening to my new music on the ibiza instead of my ipod.    I just wish I knew how to pronounce the name!!

<Title>nothing but praise
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm so happy I purchased an Ibiza. Subscription-based Rhapsody has always been a better fit for me than iTunes, and I love having it with me wherever I go. Any time I think of a song or album I want to hear, I connect to Rhapsody and I'm listening to it in no time. When I don't have access to a wireless network (my office for example), I have thousands of downloaded tracks to keep me entertained.  The interface is great too. The designers did a nice job of anticipating what someone might want to do next, and the display is crisp and attractive. The only item on my wish list so far is to have the ability to view albums by genre.  I haven't experimented with the other options such as video, photos or Internet, so I don't know how well those measure up to the music feature. But bottom line, this is the MP3 player I've been waiting for.

<Title>Product Arrived DOA
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Like all things in life there is good and bad news about this product. The good news is that it represents the best bang for the buck in terms of features right now. This is true if you subscribe to the Rhapsody streaming music service. the units strength is its the ability to stream music and take advantage of most of the Rhapsody website without requiring a computer. The graphic user interface for streaming is very nice and the ability to transfer tunes to the unit both through hard wire USB cable and wirelessly is what sets this unit apart from the current competition. Unfortunaely, my unit arrived essentially DOA. It frooze during the intial firmware update, while streaming music from the Rhapsody service, and while playing tunes from the units internal hard disk. You can see from the Haier Support Forum, although this unit has only been available for a limited time, many consumers are having reliability problems (at least with the hard disk version of the player). When I spoke with Hassan at Haier support he spent most of the call telling me how many tech support companies he has worked for and bad mouthed Dell computers rather than addressing the issue with the defective Ibiza. When I pointed this out to him he agreed the unit needed repair. He did not offer to send me a new replacement unit. He also mentioned that it would take about 3 weeks to get the unit back to me. I also needed to send a fax to the Corporate department with my receipt before they could begin the authorization process. Don't get me wrong, I love the promise of what the Ibiza can deliver. For that reason I spoke with Amazon and they immediately agreed to send me a replacement unit. They even said they would send out the replacement before they received my defective unit in the mail. Now that is customer service. I am just keeping my fingers crossed that the repalcement unit is problem free.

<Title>Amazing player with great features!
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received the Ibiza for Christmas, and not having much experience with MP3 players other than the Ipod wasn't sure what to expect, but since I used Rhapsody to download music and burn CD's I was delightfully surprised when I unwrapped this little gem, I had no idea there was a device for Rhapsody users, and having bought Haier products I knew it would be well made, just how well made was an even more pleasant surprise!  The Wi-fi feature makes it so easy to download and listen to music from the Rhapsody site, the bluetooth is awesome, I bought a headset that works simultaneously with my phone so when I get a call it automatically pauses the Ibiza so I can take my call!  It comes with different free airskins so you can change the background on the screens as well.  It comes with a 30 day free trial of Rhapsody, but I already had the service and just upgraded to Rhapsody-to-go, which for only $14.99 a month you get unlimited downloads, nothing more to purchase.  I haven't tried the video feature yet, still enjoying the ease of use of downloading and enjoying all the music I now have at my fingertips, whether it be through the website or ripping from my own cd collection.  The Ibiza makes the Ipod obsolete, in my opinion, I'm with the one reviewer who is wanting accessories:  so am I!  Please come out with a docking station and a holder/case, there is a really nice looking holder/case on the Haier website but I can't find it anywhere online, this is fairly new so I'm being patient, but hurry up!

<Title>Closest thing to perfect
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been using this player for about a week now. For players in the "Rhapsody compatible" category that I've tried - this is hands down the best. I've gone down the list of iRiver alternatives - all the way to the first gen Clix. They all pale in comparison. Dealing with the "plays for sure" cluginess quickly became ridiculous.   Right out of the box I was able to connect to my Rhapsody account and start streaming music in just a couple of minutes. The player is immediately ready to use when plugged in to the wall charger. The user interface is extremely intuitive. While you are listening to a streaming tune - there's a one click option to store it to your device via wireless connection. Simple as that - no jumping through hoops! You can even download entire albums at a time.   For mass downloads i.e. downloading your entire Rhapsody library - you'll be better off connecting to a PC. The USB transfer rate and drag and drop interface make it the only sensible way to do this. I moved over approximately 8GB of my rhapsody library in just over  3 hours - much of the time was spent by Rhapsody downloading the tracks locally before it made the transfer to the device.   The touch pad was surprisingly effective. I was skeptical at first but after using it I can honestly say it rivals the iPod wheel.   If you are looking for a Rhapsody compatible player - there really is no other player that can compete with the level of integration the ibiza has. "Plays for sure" was a nice idea - but to get to where the user experience is on a level with the iPod and iTunes - this is appears to be the way to get there.
