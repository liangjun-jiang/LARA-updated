<Title>Good, not perfect
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched lots of hard drive mp3 players before buying one a year and a half ago. All the reviews I read said the Carbon was the best value for what I was looking for, so I decided to go for it because I-pods seemed over-rated and too expensive. I had no problem with it for about 7 months and then it stopped working for no good reason. Tech support sent me a new one and now all is well. It works fine, but there are some little quirks. The interface is not the most user friendly, and the clock refuses to work on mine, for example. Those things being said, I still give the carbon 4 stars because they aren't that annoying.  On the plus side, it can play lots of different types of files, has a built-in microphone and a long-lasting battery, which lasts twice as long and takes exactly half as long to charge as an ipod mini. It has a sleek look,fits easily in my pocket and doesnt feel fragile. I like the Carbon wheel better than the I=pod wheel. Someone on this site said they have had 3 different players and the wheel broke on all of them. I simply can't believe that that person wasn't just really really dumb. The wheel is perfectly sturdy. The case they give you doesn't have a belt clip and you need to take it out of the case to press the buttons, but you can buy a better one.  Rio seems to have really good tech support. I think they realize that their products are a bit quirky and they don't give you a hard time about getting a new one (this is based on my experience and that of one of my friends). All in all, I know four people who have a carbon (including me) and two of them broke and were replaced, so guess you just get lucky or you don't. That said, I know a few people who have I-pods that just cut out for no reason and/or don't charge properly, and they dont have good customer service to even it out because I-pods are so popular. So, in conclusion, this is not a perfect player by any means, but I'm happy with mine, and it's still a good value.

<Title>My third Rio product - this was a super deal!
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apparently unlike many of the reviewers here at Amazon, I have been pleased with Rio products thus far - first one was one of those little 126k MP3 players, then moved up to a Cali 256k.  I'm very accustomed to using Rio's Music Manager software as a result.  Anyways...I've been wanting to get a player that would be compatible with Napster2Go, but until recently most of the subscription-based players have cost $200 or more...too pricey for me :) so when I saw the Rio Carbon selling for $99 here at Amazon I jumped on it, and boy am I glad I did (granted, I've only had it for a week or so).  While I did have some issues installing the software and getting my PC to 'see' the Carbon I got a great deal of assistance from the forums at riovolution.com and rioworld.org - including a link to version 3.02 of the driver for the Carbon.  Once I uploaded that, it was smooth sailing...so far anyway.  The carrying case could've been better (what no belt clip???) but fortunately there are compatible cases out there - it would have been nice if the case that came with allowed the user to view the screen and the controls without having to take the player out.  Anyway - so far so good, in fact I'm considering buying another one for the hubby - being able to use Napster 2 Go is totally awesome!  I've downloaded 150 songs so far and barely used any of the Carbon's storage room...

<Title>0 stars - piece of *%$&
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've probably used this thing for 10 minutes in all the time I've had it and spent hours trying to get it working. Don't bother wasting your money.  First, it didn't power up at all.  then, it powered up but the pc no longer recognized it.  I finally got it all working AND charged up the battery, upgraded the firmware, etc.  Unplugged it to listen to it and what do you know?  None of the buttons are reponding.  It looks like it's cycling through the songs but can't hear anything.  Now it doesn't get recognized by the pc OR the power adaptor.  Nice.  Pushing the reset button does nothing.  If you do buy this, make sure you start TRYING to use it right away so you can get your money back.  I waited too long til the warranty was over.  I spend my whole day dealing with computer problems.  This was supposed to be a "relaxation device" for me!!!! :)  Just posting this as a warning - take a look at all the people who have problems with this.  I'm buying an Ipod.

<Content>I managed to get this player brand new for $69.99 during a clearance sale.  It is great for long commutes and work.  It works as advertised and I get about the stated battery life depending on current volume.  The only thing they should have changed was the carrying case.  You can't use the main buttons when the player is in the case.

<Title>I love it, and would buy another...
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 Player has given me hell.  But don't get me wrong... it's a love-hate relationship. It's incredibly attractive with a sleek and shiny back and an easy-to-maneuver front. It's lightweight and hold's in your palm nicely. The sound quality is great and I play it for long hours and it has lasted for a long time.  That being said, I've had my Rio for 10 months, and I've dropped it a few times (no practical protective case, really). Problems I've encountered have been it shutting off and bearing the message "Upgrader" not allowing you do anything. The best remedy I've found for this problem has been to plug it in to the charger, and it will typically take care of the problem. This was a recurring problem, but it has quit being a pain, and I've had practically flawless play with it the past few months. However, I dropped it recently and the wheel broke, which means I can not turn the volume up or down on the Rio, only through the output device (speakers). That's my own fault though.  You get interesting comments when listening to the Rio... "What's THAT?"... mainly because people are so used to the Ipod, but I would choose the Rio over Ipod anyday. Ipod's overrated.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player!
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It has been two years since I purchased my RIO carbon, 5MB player.  I drop it at least once a week, it spends 25% of the time rolling around in my coat pocket while commuting back/forth to work, the other 75% is spent rolling around in the bottom of my purse.  Although it came with a case, it's not really practical.  You have to keep taking the whole thing out to change or search for different titles.  An improvemnt would be to have an opening which allows you to change your opions easily. Anyway, I dropped it one last time thsi week and the volume button came out and it won't work anymore. I'm buying another one! I see there is a 20GB Rio that has my name all over it!

<Title>Great Player!!
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Both my wife and I have each had a Rio Carbon for over 2 years now.  Mine gets dragged (and dropped) everywhere.  I have wireless FM in my car so I can even listen to it while driving.  Neither of us have had ANY problems with our players, other than occasionally forgetting to recharge it.   I've dropped mine many many times without any problems.  My 7 year old borrows it all the time and it keeps on ticking.   I have firmware version 1.43.  I have 1,508 songs on it (WMA variable bit rate) and still have 20% of my hard disk left.  Haven't touched my CDs in years!  I like the long battery life and I fly overseas to India and Japan quite a bit.  It's nice having a long life MP3 player with on the flights so I don't have to listen to the canned airline music.  And I can recharge it off of my laptop when I'm in my hotel room or at work.   I have had no issues with the menu button or the little selection wheel.  If this one ever dies, I'll buy another one without any hesitation!  The only negatives I can say is (as others have mentioned) the case sucks and is worthless.  I also wish I could create play lists without having to use the Rio Management software.  I have gotten around this by using the `genre' as play lists.   I use Media Tagger 1.3.5  (which is freeware) to re-write the tag data on my music files.  Also as a side note, always have your songs backed up on a hard drive some place.  Even the best player can get lost or stolen and you don't want to have to re-rip, and re-download all of your CDs and songs you bought on-line!!!

<Title>Way better than iPods and half the price!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband bought this mp3 player for me as a birthday present. It's a whopping 5 GB player and you'd have to put down at least $250 if you want an iPod with comparable storage. It holds an amazing number of songs and I especially like the recorder feature. It's great for undergraduate and graduate students because you can record lectures and listen to music with one little device! Both the device and the software are straightforward and easy to use. I agree with the other reviewer because it is a tiny bit annoying that you can only create playlists when you're hooked up to the software, but it's really a minor flaw and definitely not a big enough problem that I wouldn't recommend it to others. Even if I hadn't been biased against iPods before this because of their ridiculous marketing strategies ("Buy our products because they look cute and come in flashy colors! Never mind if they're quality products or reasonably priced!"), I still would have thought this product was 10x more efficient and reasonable.   My only complaint is that mine broke easily. I see that others reviewers have dropped it multiple times with no problems, so I guess I got the token dud. I only had it for a few months and I dropped it once at the grocery store, and now it's broken and unresponsive to anything I do.   Here's my personal plea: It looks brand new on the outside and I hate to buy a new mp3 player for $100 when I know there's someone/someplace out there that can fix it. I checked Rio's website and they no longer fix their players, so does anyone know of other companies with websites that I can check with? If not, do you have any general suggestions as to where I could start? Any type of stores or business that might offer this service? Thanks and I'd appreciate any help!

<Content>Very frustrating!  The Rio Carbon comes in an industrial strength plastic package.  I spent over 15 minutes trying to get it it open -- it is too thick to cut with scissors or slice with a razor blade.  Once I got it cut, I gashed my hand on the plastic.  I am no wimp -- this packaging is just crazy!  It could serve as the shipping container.

<Content>What a great little player (once my dad got the crazy package open).  It's about 3/4" shorter than the iPod mini, but about 1/2 wider.  Similar thickness, but more rounded.  Similar weight.  Like carrying another cell phone.    The rubber grip is nice too -- fits great in the hand.  One complaint: the shiny chrome case collects fingerprints and scratches like crazy.  After 2 days, the back is pretty scuffed just from sliding it across the table.  The iPod Mini has a brushed metal case, which hides scratches and fingerprints.

<Title>Incredible product
<Date>Sat Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Carbon for about two weeks now, and I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase. First off, kudos to Rio for the sleek design; it's amazingly small and light, travels very well, and looks very, very stylish.   There are minor annoyances associated with the Carbon though. First off, if you buy this, make sure to have a set of good headphones / earbuds of your own with a gold plated plug. The packaged earbuds are crap, and anything uncoated apparently produces a lot of static due to some design error. Secondly, the back of the Carbon and the touchpad collect fingerprints like mad; being the neat freak that I am, I spend quite a lot of time polishing the bugger (annoying!).  Beyond these small grievances of mine, the Carbon trumps the iPod in both storage / battery life. Beyond the obvious 1gb increase, I'm never concerned about the remaining battery power (although I haven't tested the claim of 20 hours, I've never ran out of power, and I use this thing all the time). If you do buy the Carbon, make sure to upgrade the firmware; lots of small fixes and charging while connected via USB = plus.

<Title>Cool product - needs a little more thought put into design
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been a big fan of Rio/Sonic Blue products since their inception. The Carbon does have a lot of storage space for music, it the perfect size and weight (I use mine while working out and running).  Also, cool metalic backing like the iPod.  Ease of use.  Dislikes: battery goes fast!  6-10 hours of use before it needs to be recharged.  Also, battery guage is crude and not all that accurate.  Not precise.  Also, NO HOLD BUTTON!  That is probably the biggest design flaw - I keep hitting the buttons and pausing/forwarding/reversing songs unintentionally.  Lastly, the leather carrying case, while very cool, does not have a viewing window so to fast forward songs you need to remove device from case and manually fast forward.  Really needs to be a "cut out" to view buttons and the screen display!!!!  A note about RIO products: while cool products, good size and weight, they do tend to break rather quickly.  I'm not that rough on the equipment but previous 2 Rio products had problems that required fixing.  I bought my first Rio at Best Buy (yeah, they ripped me off) but got a cool protection plan that allowed me to trade in if product breaks within 3 years (for an extra $39).  You can return for same product or upgrade to the latest and greatest!

<Title>Great so far
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I chose to pick up this guy over the ipod mainly because the ipod uses itunes and aac. I'm one of those "bad" guys who prefers to pick up my tunes from p2p networks without the hassle of converting to apple's format.   Some pluses about the carbon: -Supports wma, this works really well with j river media center which allows you to upload and convert to wma on the fly. -great battery life, some people are complaining that they want a removable/replacable battery, but by the time the battery goes dead the player won't be worth keeping by then. -I personally like this design better than the ipod; as one reviewer said, I think the design appeals more to a male audience that finds the ipod a bit too toy-like. -I use this to also listen to audio books in the car (via the Belkin Tunecast II). The carbon supports the audible format, but I just rent audio book CD's from my local library and upload them onto the player.  -the 5 gig seagate harddrive can be removed, and it actually works in most devices that use type II compact flash (yes, it's that small). But from what I hear there are bugs with replacing a CF card back into the carbon.   Some cons about the carbon: -Like any other mp3 player, the stock headphones do not bring out the potential of the player. There are alot of earbud headphones on the market, but I recommend the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia for those on a budget (amazon has it for 27 bux). These earphones appear to be nearly identical to the MDR-EX71LP's, but the 71's have only a 15 inch cord because it's designed for players with a remote. The 71's come with a one meter extension, but the adapter looks bulky and the overall length becomes too long. Also, if you get static just put some clear nail polish around the base of the earphone jack to prevent direct contact with the metallic casing. of the carbon.  -the playlist feature cannot be edited from the carbon itself, and mine takes a bit long to process the playlists but only after I've uploaded new songs. (not a big deal, only about 10 more seconds and that's only after i've synchronized).   Overall, a very good buy considering the features, performance, and price. Plus, you avoid becoming an ipod clone.

<Date>Wed Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I waited at least a month after the Carbon came out to see what others thought, would it hold up, what bugs are present ect..  Then i made the plunge.  Overall its GREAT.  the battery life does last 20 hours.  You can even use a usb card charger i got for my palm to charge in the car with the included mini usb cord.  Holds a good amount of cds and love the fact i can listen to my audio books.  Any negatives are the power button.  With in the first 3 days the unit fell and the power button stopped working.  BestBuy exchanged it no problem but i made sure to get the 2 year warrenty extention with the new unit.  And this needs to build play lists in the fly.  I never used playlists untill i got this. But it would be nice.  How ard would it be to add this?   This looks so much better then the mini ipod and takes up very little room in a pocket.  If u use this in your car get the belkin tunecast II.  It powers via car charger.  Im tired of buying batteries for the tunecast I.  Carbon lasts longer then it does  UPDATE.  Im on my 3rd carbon.  This is the last try.  Love the player but something happened to unit and it wont power on.  Didnt drop it but did have a hard jolt.  IS ANYONE ELSE HAVING THIS PROBLEM? If this one fails then i guess i get an ipod.  But damn it works so well.

<Title>A dissapointing purchase
<Date>Thu Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Prior to buying my Rio Carbon, I spent days searching the web for both professional reviews from major and smaller consumer electronic device reviewing sites, as well as many consumer reviews of the Rio Carbon. After reading all the hype and glamor everyone had to heap upon the Rio Carbon, I decided that it was time to finally get one myself.   Though the price was quite steep (around $270 after s/h), I was still very happy and satisfied at purchasing what I thought was a superb product. Upon receiving the Carbon, my first reaction was awe. What a cool looking device! Very sleek, thin, and fits comfortably in the palm of my hand. I then proceeded to carefully read the maunal and follow the directions step by step before even turning on the player itself. I charged the player for 3 hours just like the manual told me to do. Then went online to Rio's site and downloaded the latest version of the Carbon's firmware. I then proceeded to plug the USB cable into my USB port in my computer and followed all proper installation procedures to upload the firmware into my Carbon. One really neat thing that I noticed at this point was that when the USB was connected to both my Carbon and my PC, it would actually take that time to charge my Carbon through my PC's USB port! I then proceeded to take out the Music Manager CD that came with the Carbon, installed it onto my PC, and then surfed the web to update it to the latest version. Then started the task of uploading all my MP3s onto my little player. It was then, FINALLY, after a good excruciatingly long 7 hours after I had received the Carbon in the mail (after all, I wanted to make sure that I didn't do anything that might damage or deter from the directions laid out for my little expensive player), that I FINALLY turned on my Rio Carbon.   It was definately worth the wait. For as I turned on the Carbon, I was greeted by very cool red glow from the Rio logo on top of the player. And as the menu lighted up and displayed all the little neat functions of the Carbon. Such as voice recording mode, music/voice/audio playback, stopwatch, and a few others tweaks and settings.   However all little neat features aside, this was after all a MP3 player. And the whole reason for purchasing it was to play.....you guessed it......MP3s! I quickly pulled out the earphones that came bundled with the Carbon, plugged them into the player, and pressed play.  Much to my dismay, the sound quality was HORRIBLE! Maroon5 sounded like either a girl or a guy with a VERY high pitched voice. And my other MP3s didn't fare too well either. I couldn't understand if my player was just defective, or that this was normal for the Carbon. It occured to me that maybe a few of the MP3s may have gotten corrupted somehow during the transfer from my PC to the player (though I don't see how that would be possible). But the fact that ALL the MP3s didn't sound the way they were suppose to quickly ruled that possibility out of my mind. I pulled out my flash drive, uploaded all my MP3s onto it, and then transfered them onto my laptop to make sure the original files wern't the cause. And as I suspected, they played perfectly on both my PC and laptop through Realplayer, as well as Windows Media Player. Which left me with the conclusion that something was wrong with the Carbon. At $270, I was not overly eager to ship it back to receive a replacement that might give me the same results. So instead I opted for a full refund.   Overall this player had a great design, was a very good idea, but ultimately it failed where it counted the most. In its ability to actually play MP3s.

<Content>Great small player.  Price was well within reason for what it provides (I got mine for 250 online)  Pro's:  Small, light, sleek.  Real easy to charge (USB).  I've so far been happy with the sound (be aware, if you use an all-metal plug for headphones, it may cause distortion! Design flaw).  Thumbwheel and buttons all well placed and easy to use.  Been jogging with it several times without any skipping (very nice)  Con's:  Case.  Okay RIO, just why do you make a case that neither has an arm band nor a clip? Plus you can't access any of the controls while it's in it. Someone just wasn't thinking! The music software that comes with it is adequate, but watch the defaults if you like a specific way to load your music.    Small nits:  Playback.  I would like to be able to playback music by directory as well as "artist" or "genre". Yes, I know I could make playlists, but I'm lazy. RIO made some nice features including a clock and a stopwatch.  I wish they went the one extra step of adding an alarm to the clock (to wake me up) and a countdown timer to the stopwatch (for jogging).

<Content>I've had my Rio Carbon 5GB for over a year now. The feel of it is very sleek and comfortable. The user interface is excellent and easy to get used to. My son had a Dell Jukebox and now has an Ipod Nano, the Rio Carbon is much better than the Jukebox and just as good, if not better than the Ipod interface. The thumbwheel is effortless and is easily manageable with one hand. You can't do that with the iPod! The AC - USB power charger is great. I haven't seen other MP3 players with this type of capability. (I.e. the USB cable plugs into an AC to USB adapter.) Battery life has been very good. An excellent value!!

<Title>Rio- Good but cheap
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had a Rio Carbon for about 8 months. So far I've gone through two of them. I don't know whether I've gotten bad ones or what because the first one after about 2 months wouldn't do anything but display an "Upgrader" message and the second one's volume wheel became dislodged and doesn't work anymore. Now the company wants 100 bucks for another one. No one should have two go through two MP3 players or more.Thats why I think that it's JUNK.  I'm now thinking about getting an iPod because they don't have external parts besides the headphones. The overall design is good and the storage and software is satisfactory but I mean come on...  How many products are you supposed to get? Last time I checked it was 1.

<Title>The worse buying experience of my otherwise happy life
<Date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> This is an ultra-inferior product. The little wheel on top of the player is as cheap as they make em'. Mine has broke 3 times now (in just 9 months) and this time RIO says they won't replace it - probably because they know it will just keep breaking and they will have to send me a new one every 3 months. The third time I tried not to even use the wheel as much and it still broke! Also, this player creates more jack noise than you can imagine. I lost an eardrum last month just trying to plug in my headphones to the player. 3rd - the system crashes quite a bit, and unless you carry around a tiny sewing needle, forget about resetting the thing.  Bottom line - don't waste your time or money on this hunk of junk. It will only lead to misery and despair.

<Title>Lovin' It
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Rio Carbon for about two years now, and though I had some initial issues, I was able to iron them out, and it works flawlessly now even though it has seen fairly heavy use.  I did have to put a piece of tape around the earphone connection, because the unit is made of metal and the earphones would crackle when the metal ring on the earphones made contact with the metal case.  The other problem was the player would go in about 50 songs, then shut off.  When I restarted it, it would be back at the first song.  In order to get past the 50th song, I had to run it to the 54th song, before it would play through the rest of the songs.  Fifty songs is a lot to thumb through one by one, so I realized it was an issue I would need to fix.  The neat thing about the Carbon, is it will pull up on your computer as another hard drive.  So I just right clicked on it and did a reformat.  That did the trick, when I loaded the songs back on, no more problems.  This feature also makes it so you don't have to use the Rio software to load the songs onto the player, you can just drag them over, though the software is very simple to use and probably loads the songs as fast as dragging them over.  The unit does have some improvements over the Rio Nitrus, for instance, instead of having a separate power cord, the Carbon charges with the same cord that hooks it to the computer.  Also the buttons used to scroll through the songs are sturdier than the one button on the Nitrus. Unfortunately, not all the changes were good.  Changing from a plastic case to the metal, caused the problem with the earphones that I mentioned above, and also, they took off the lock switch that was on the back of the Nitrus, which kept the settings from being changed while it was in my pocket.    The Carbon does have a case, unlike the Nitrus, but it's pretty worthless for anything except protecting the unit from getting scratched up, because it has nothing to hook it to your belt. However, the unit is small enough to fit easily into your pocket, so no big deal.  One of the most annoying things about the case is you have to pull the Carbon out of the case if you want to do anything more than turn it off or turn up the volume.  That's pretty lame, but nothing I can't live with.  I'm not sure exactly what the battery life is, but I know I've listened to it for eight hours straight and the battery life is down maybe half, so the 20 hour claim is probably not far off, which is pretty awesome.    By and all, though the unit could stand some improvements, it has served me well and if I ever have to buy another MP3 player, I'd definitely go with a Rio.

<Title>don't waste your money
<Date>Sat Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player less than a year ago and it is already broken.  I researched all MP3 players and this Rio Carbon received great reviews and seemed to have everything that I wanted.  It was great for about 8 months, although it would occasionally turn off randomly when listening to music. Then one day I turned it on and it had "UPGRADER" mode written on the screen.  I went to the Rio website and tried to install all versions of firmware which is suppose to rewrite the hard drive (and erase all music files on the player).  This did not work, and either did the countless phone call to Rio's support team.  All they could offer me was a refurbished player for $99. Do not waste your money on this MP3 player, I am not the only one with these problems either, there are lots of reviewers that have the same problem, and tapping it on the back doesn't do anything. If you do decide to get this MP3 player, I STRONGLY suggest getting the warranty.

<Title>Some times it needs to be restarted...
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>... but at least the files inside the HD remain intact! Some times when you turn on you need to push the reset button,  so your configurations (volume, equalizer, etc) are lost. The files inside the internal disk aren't affected but this bug. Just because of that bug it will not receive 5 stars.  Even thought, it's much better than any iPOD. You can put any type of file inside. It recharges directly from the USB. AND IT'S CHEAPER than an iPOD!

<Title>An almost perfect little MP3 player
<Date>Sat Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Rio Carbon is the first MP3 player I bought. I was first intrigued with the Apple iPod Mini that my nephew had, so i decided to look at other MP3 players.   The Carbon is almost perfect, and I feel a bit better than the Apple Mini iPod. It has 25% more capacity. I have placed over 800 songs on it and used only 60% of the hard drive. The unit is a bit smaller than the Apple unit but looks a lot cooler. The red backlit logo and rocker pad looks very svelte. The back chrome plate is prone to fingerprints and smudges. As previously mentioned, the only design flaw is that some headphone jacks causes static when it touches the stainless steel edges of the unit when plugged in. This is easily fixed by painting a layer of fingernail polish on the exposed headphone plug (but it should not be necessary). There is a lock function on the Carbon (it pays to read the manual) by holding the MENU button in and pressing the center button. The carrying case is very snug because of the odd shape of the Carbon and does not have a belt clip. The ear phones while sounding good, do not fit well in smaller ears (too large) so I had to buy a separate headset. I find the interface very easy to use with a tactile feel to the wheel. I find no problems using it. The battery charges either from the USB port of your PC or from an adapter that uses the same USB cable. The display is very legible for its small size and longer titles constantly scrolls laterally across the screen (cool!).  The Rio Music Manager is very easy to use. Unlike from what I read before, you CAN do mass corrections to the ID3 info tags. Select all the songs you wish to edit and open the properties and change the fields. The one thing I find to be an issue is that if you update any fields in the Rio Manager, it does not update the info on the Rio if the file is already in the Rio. The software just synchronizes songs that are not on the Rio, not if there are any changes to the ID3 fields.  The easiest way was to delete all the files from the Rio and resynching the unit. It is best to update the ID3 fields before synching the Rio.

<Title>Number 1 mini HDD MP3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>You've probably been hearing all about ipods (unless you've been locked in a cupboard for 3 years) and how they are the best and only MP3 player out there. Well, they're not (either) with the Rio carbon being THE player to get.  Compared to the ipod mini, for $50 less, you get 1gig more space, a plug and play interface (just plug it into any computer with win 2000+ and transfer files in explorer), a 20 hour battery (2.5x apples at least), better sound quality (I think anyway) and the list goes on. Better compatibility with audio formats (MP3, WMA, WAV), can use loads of music stores, not just crummy iTunes, a better navigation system (the non tactile everything is annoying). The wheel on the carbon is great, as you can just change volume like that. It's also more stylish I think, and will show that you're not a clone who has to get an ipod.  Other players are good, but just don't compare, with the Creative muvo2 having an awful navigation system, and the zen micro again going the all non tactile route (even for volume). Some players may be decent, but are double the size of the carbon (another one of its huge advantages). If more space is essential to you though, I suggest the rio karma, which is amazing value, playback, sound and navigation.  The one minor issue is the static issue many people mention, but I think it has been resolved now anyway, but a bit of nail varnish on the jack isn't that hard, but most earphones come with the plastic part as far as I've seen. The case is also not the best I've seen, but vaja make a superb custom designed case for $40 or so, which you can get for saving all that money from not buying an ipod!

<Title>Rio Carbon and Rio Karma
<Date>Fri Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had a Rio Karma for a year and a half.  My wife has a Rio Carbon.  I am writing in response to several bad review.  Sound quality: the Rios do a bad job on bad MP3/WMAs.  That's right, the problem is their files, not the player.  I have 2800 files on my Karma and the only ones that sound wrong are the ones I got years ago off the net.  Yeah, I can tell the difference on my $10k theater system.  Then again if you want hi-fidelity, wouldn't be playing through a lossy format like MP3s or WMAs.  There is the lack of lower frequencies, but through portable headphones the lack is barely noticable.  Quality:  I have dropped my Karma (20 gb hd) while it was on well over 20 times.  I have yet to have a failure.  Firmware updates worked fine and added lots of features (not just bug fixes) along the way.  Syncing has never been a problem.  I have been syncing using both Windows Media 10 and Rio's software with three computers since I bought it.  The ability to sync with more than one computer was the reason I went Rio over Ipod in the first place.

<Title>Carbon vs ipod mini
<Date>Sat Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like most I probably spent over a week visting every web site that had reviews of mp3 players and read every review on amazon for all of the various players. All signs pointed to the Carbon as the right player.  My one concern was the ever mentioned design flaw with the metal casing and how with some headphones static whould be induduced due to direct contact with the metal.  A trip to the local store change my views. I found that all of the players that I saw looked and felt VERY cheap. I was actually disappointed with the Carbon as well.  What did catch my eye however was the Apple ipod Mini.  The feel and look of these players can not be ignored. I feels sturdy and yet not heavy. I thought there is no way I'm going to by an apple product when all I have are Windows machines. However the more I read on line the more I decided to strongly consider this unit. I was worried about the player not supporting wma files. However I downloaded the itunes software and was pleased to find that when you import a wma file it will convert it. The software lets you convert it to several formats (ACC, mp3). The default is ACC but I decided to go with mp3 even though they are larger then ACC mainly because I wanted to be compatible with playing files on other windows machines that didn't have the itunes software installed. I ended up going with the ipod mini and thus far feel it was the right choice. Great sound and a user interface second to none. I encourage anyone thinking of spending money in this range to go see the players in person and see if you like the feel of the players in your hand. You will see that the majority of these players look and FEEL very cheap even though they are highly priced. I was also wanted a way to clip the player to my pants, something that is not provided by the Carbon. In summary don't hesitate to consider the ipod mini even if you are a windows die hard.

<Content>i wasn't sure between the rio carbon 5gb or the ipod mini...they were the same price, but rio was 1gb more, so i got that.  when i used it...1. i had trouble transferring the songs into rio....the 2 arrows kept spinning and then it said done...but my songs weren't in there...and then it froZe.  2. i'm not sure..but the sound quality wasn't very good....i don't know if it was just how the songs should sound or it was the earphones or just its quality.  the songs i tried to listen to were the few songs already in the machine.  I wasn't familiar with them so i am not sure how they should sound, but what I heard was unclear static music.  I looked up the songs online, and they did sound more enjoyable online, so i think maybe it is the machine itself.  Did this happen with anyone else? Were the songs supposed to sound like that or was it the machine?

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Wed Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Rio Carbon is a superior alternative to an iPod mini.  I checked around, read lots of reviews and wavered slightly before going with the Rio Carbon.  I have never looked back.  The playback and storage space is phenomenal.  I listen to audio books constantly and this little player holds a WHOLE lot of books.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I think that the Rio music manager software sucks.  I have not been able to get it to work at all.  It gets hung every time trying to scan for files on my computer.  If I stop the scan it works okay to transfer files but not good enough for my satisfaction.  I have problems with static in the headphones but am hoping that the nail polish trick works.  Battery life is incredible and recharging is quick.  With the firmware upgrade, the player can be charged through the computer via USB which is really really nice.  Highly recommend this product!

<Title>Better than iPod Mini
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I own both the Rio Carbon and the iPod Mini.  Personally, I prefer the Carbon.  I'm sure many of you out there are deciding between the Rio Carbon, the iPod Mini, and the Zen Micro.  As far as I'm concerned, the offerings from Dell and Gateway aren't nearly as competitive.  Here is why I bought the Rio Carbon (for myself).  I got an engraved iPod Mini for my girlfriend because it was shiny and pink.  Pros 1.  20 hours of battery life (Manufacturer estimate) - way longer than Mini or Micro (Micro has removable batteries though, but you'll need 2 of those batteries to equal Carbon battery life) 2.  5gigs of memory - 1gig more than Mini, does not need partitioning for file storage like Micro 3.  Drag and Drop interface - easy to load and unload than Mini or Micro 4.  Does not need Drivers - transfer files to or from any computer 5.  Smaller/Lighter than Mini and Micro 6.  Nicer looking (unless you like the different colors) 7.  Microphone for recording!  Mini lacks this function.  Micro has it plus radio! 8.  Plays WMA files.  Mini lacks this function.  Micro has it! 9.  Cheaper than Mini and Micro (street price)  Cons 1.  No radio 2.  Laggy interface 3.  Just one color 4.  No engravings 5.  Static when using metal plugged headphones (can be fixed)  Battery life: I haven't gotten around to timing the battery life, cuz I never need it for 20 hour straight, but it definitely lasts me through the longest days.  (about 14 hours or so)  All the battery life you'll really need if you recharge while you sleep.  The battery can be charged by USB, which is very convenient if you need that extra juice.  The usb cable also plugs into the charger (like the firewire cables for ipods), so you only need one cable when you need to travel around.  File transfer and storage: The claims about it being drag and drop are true.  It is so easy to put music in and take music out!  However, you'll probably want to use the software included on the CD (or from the website) to sort and organize the music and for mass editing of ID3 info.  The drag and drop feature allows you to use the whole hard drive as a portable storage device.  That's up to 5 gigs that can be used to store personal files!  (Way better than the Zen Micro's half-baked max 2 gig partitioning system).  File transfer speed seems standard fare for a USB device w/ a MiniHD.  Look and Feel: The overall quality of the Carbon does not quite match up to the Mini, considering the Mini uses a fully aluminum shell.  Keep in mind, the Carbon is by no means a cheap feeling device.  The back of the case is a shiny chromed metal (shiny, but scratches and smudges easily like iPods).  The sides of the case is rubberized, which is very effective in keeping the device safe in your hands.      The front shell is a glossy plastic.  The top and the buttons are also chromed, but I think those parts are plastic instead of real metal (I could be wrong).  Overall the player looks very sophisticated.  I was amazed by how thin it is, about the same as the Mini, if not thinner.  It's lighter, shorter and rounder, and fits in my hands better than the Mini.  I have less fear of dropping the thing when I'm holding it!  My friends are amazed at the size and weight.  The display is sharp and bright when backlit.  The red lights are cool too!  The fake leather case that comes w/ the player is poorly designed though, it could use a hole on the side for access to the buttons and display.  I took a razor and cut those holes myself!  Sound Quality: The head phones that come with the Carbon is pretty bassy.  I've found I need to pump up the mid range to compensate, but overall, sound quality is crisp and clear.  Please note that I am not an audiophile off any sort and not very good at judging this.  The reports that using headphones w/ metal plugs causing static must be true because Rio has thoughtfully included plastic extension wires for headphones to keep metal parts from contacting the metal in the shell.  The voice recorder is decent.  I've used it for class and it was able to record the lecture pretty clearly, although I had to set it close to the teacher's podium to do so.    Voice files are recorded in .wav files, pretty large...so keep that in mind when recording for long periods of time.  The high pitched whining the internal hard drive can be heard on the recordings, which is a nuisance.  User Interface: Rio must have decided to use a cheap processor in order to extend the battery life.  There are many times during its use when the user interface lags behind my inputs.  Keep in mind that the music has not yet skipped on me.  But there were several times when I would try to jog the volume or switch between songs and the display would fail to keep up w/ my inputs.  I was spoiled by the iPod's relative quick response.  However, this only happens when a new song is being played, which is understandable because the player has to search for the song and then read it into memory.  However, the lag is a tad frustrating, especially when you're trying to change settings for a new song.  As far as I have used them, it never occurred in iPods I've used.  The button layout and functions are very intuitive and easy to use.  The jog wheel is just as functional as the overhyped touch wheel on the iPods.  I've found touch sensitivity can be difficult for people without a delicate touch.  Overall a great buy.  Better than iPod Mini in my opinion.  I haven't tried the Zen Micro so I wouldn't make that comparison safely.  The Dell and Gateway players don't appeal to me.  So the Rio Carbon just might be the best miniHD mp3 player on the market right now!  P.S. about clipping electronics on your belt... Don't do it...It looks real dorky~

<Title>Excellent product for my needs
<Date>Sun Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After doing a lot of research on MP3 players I decided to go with the Rio Carbon.  I've waited a month before writing this review, and so far I have not had any problems with it.  Here's what I like about the Rio Carbon:  It's small.  It literally fits in the palm of your hand and it's half the depth of a cellphone, so it can easily share a pocket with something else.  It's lighter than a cellphone too, you wouldn't even know it was there if it weren't for the tunes.  Being one of the smallest harddrive devices, it's still 5GB, more than the iPod Mini.  Using and carrying the device is simple.  The scroll wheel is conveniently located for your thumb to use and it's easier to use than the iPod's wheel, which can be very touchy.  Playback features include an equalizer, repeat, shuffle, playlists, and lock-mode.  It also looks damn good.  Here's what I don't like: As far as I can see, there is no way to build a playlist from inside the player, they must be transferred from your computer.  When hooking up a pair of Sony MDR-V600 headphones, the Rio shutdown.  Why?  The plug has metal around it which made contact with the Rio, which I assume caused it to short-circuit.  Luckily it was fine and I tried again, getting it in without the metal making contact.  The sound quality was noticeably flatter than what comes out of the computer, which would have been a huge disappoint if I purchased the Rio Karma for home use (20GB is nowhere near enough for a FLAC player) - but I opted for a travel companion instead, and thus perfect sound quality is not necessary.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, I can hear the bass.  It's just not as good as an Audigy2 soundcard.  I would never disrespect someone else's opinion, however another recent review included some plain false information.  The Rio Carbon includes a protective carrying case, a USB cable, free songs, and a free 2-month trial subscription to the Audible network, which carries eBooks.  Overall, the price, size, weight, storage, and ease of use of the Rio Carbon make it a winner.  If you want to check it out, I've seen it in a few large retail stores, but wary the price, it's cheaper online.  Hope this helps.
