<Title>Creative Zen 8 GB is the bomb!!!
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been waiting for the device that could keep me from having to buy an I-Pod. This is the device. The only thing the I-Pod has it beat on is memory (and I imagine that will change as new models come out).  It plays more files, has as good if not better video playback and I don't have to use I-Tunes to deal with my product.

<Title>hmmm...pretty good
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So far I really like this product. It has plenty of space for all the music that you actually listen to and still have space left over instead of paying a hundred more to carry around music you never listen to. I think it has good features, though i dont use them. The interface is simple but it seems to be a little slow scrolling through the menu. this really isnt that bad cuz its like a .1 second delay. disregard that bc its no big issue and will not dtract from the products quality. The materials are good. The buttons feel a little cheap but not bad overall. Overall awesome mp3 player. The software that comes with it is very annoying and stupid. Just use a different program to transfer and there are no problems.

<Title>Other than freezing up, a great player
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like the dimensions, screen display, and sound. The recording function works very well, too. The only problem I have is that the screen occasionally goes black and the player freezes. It stops responding to anything and I have to let the battery drain. Once it's drained and I recharge it, it seems fine. I can't find a reason or pattern for the freezing. So far, it's happened 3 times in a month (once after I unplugged it from the charger, once when I tried to play a song I'd listened to already and once when I tried to turn it off). I sometimes wonder if I should have gone with the iPod just for the stability.

<Title>Sound Quality is Superb
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first player I've ever owned for more than a month.  I know some people look for good video playback on players (which this one has), but my focus was sound quality.  And I'm amazed at how this player produces such an incredible sound, even with the packaged earphones.  I'm convinced that this is the player to keep for the next few years.

<Title>Was the perfect anniversary present for four days...
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>**Update: decided to take advantage of the GREAT Amazon return policy and got a new one overnight.  Has worked fine for a week.  Also purchased the clear case (good) and the AC power adapter (an absolute must).  Features, screen size and quality, and control scheme all rate very high. **   I agree with pretty much all of the features and benefits mentioned by other reviewers and let me add my annoyance at the short USB cable - apparently they assume everyone has a USB hub on thier desk these days.  Wife loved it for her anniversary present (I bought this as a delivery vehicle for an edited version of our wedding video) and was enjoying having her country music collection for her commute...for four days.  I gave it to her on Friday, on Tuesday it died. Won't power on, no charging light shows when plugged into the USB cable, nothing.  Tried all the reset operations recommended on the Creative website, no joy.  Called Creative support and after going through giving them all their requested information as well as telling them all the things I'd tried, my cell phone dropped the call.  But guess what - as soon as I hit the redial button, I got the "we've gone home" message (just after 6pm Oklahoma time).  So, I don't know yet what to say about the product reliability or the helpfulness of thier support staff - I'm hoping for the best, since feature/function-wise this was the pick of the crop and my wife really liked it.  I'll update this when I have a resolution.

<Title>Why people buy Ipods?.
<Date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a mp3 player user since 1998, when you had to assemble your mp3 playerusing PC parts, then I bought the first Rio player, the first creative, the first archos, the first Ipod.   This is the best deal ever in a mp3 player.  The sound is outstanding betas the Ipod 10 to 1.  The use is so easy and flexible adaptable to what you really need.  I adujsted the menu to show only the functions I use. The browsing of artist, album using the letter at the right of screen is exactly what I need.  I  am creating a library of SD cards with my favourite music ( just as I did 20 years ago with cassettes) , so I can selct which 4 GB of musci I will use additional to the 8 GB of the player.  So far, because of my SD cards library, the virtual capacity of my ZEN is 36 GB, soon I expect I will have my complete colletion of mp3 in SD cards, classified as I want.   The quelaity and color of the videos and pictures is the best in the market, but the screen is too small to me.

<Title>creative zen review
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i bought the creative zen 8GB mp3 player recently. i love the fm radio feature. the stations come in surprisingly clear most of the time. the battery lasts a pretty good amount also. good sound quality. i really like the earbuds that came with it. very small and light. holds about 1600 songs if there aren't any videos/pictures on it. but has room for additional memory card if wanted. i also like that it is compatible with napster. very convenient. but you have to sync up to the computer every couple of days to update. (small drawback) the only thing that i don't like too much about this product is the fact it sometimes turns off unexpectedly and for no reason. it doeasn't happen all that often but it's still irritating. overall, though, i think this was a very good buy. i would definately recommend this little guy.

<Title>Very Good player
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had read reviews about problems with battery life and freezing, but I also read very good reviews so I was scared if the player would be bad or good. But after it came, I charged it for 4 hours before first my first use. It was automatically a hit for me. Very good player. pro- sound quality!, design, screen, interface, size, sd card, battery has been above 90 for the last two days of use ( not continuous!)  con-back light turns off only after hold, cant add to playlist, but you can make them.  PS. other people said it froze on them, I have the same firmware. It only froze once, my fault, when I was installing the software AND adding songs when I abruptly disconnected the player.

<Title>Good Sound - carry a paper clip. 
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My new Creative Zen (8gb) sounds great with other earphones. Updating the firmware was quite easy to do - download the program from the Creative site, attach the Zen to the computer via the USB cable and run the program. Easy. Adding music was quite easy - I used Windows Explorer. Then I tried using the SD card to play music. I was able to do so. However, I accessed the menu system while playing an MP3 from the SD card. The system locked up requiring me to find a paper clip to stick in the reset hole. Now I am leery of using the SD card unless I have with me an object to push the reset button. Locking up the player during my first 5 minutes of use is not a good sign.

<Title>Few flaws, many pros
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>IMPORTANT NOTES FIRST:  YES, it is iTunes-compatible, and YES it is compatible with Yahoo! Jukebox, BUT ONLY THOSE TRACKS THAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED AS "BURNABLE". In other words, you will not be able to transfer your Subscription or Stream tracks to this device, which is only fair (for that, you have to have Yahoo! Music Unlimited To-Go, which is an invite-based service and thus uncommon). Needless to say, you can import tracks from any CD quickly and painlessly, and/or copy any wmv/mp3/mp4 or whatever that you already have on your hard drive: the device is browsable with Windows and all you need to do is copy/paste to the right folder.  Now for the review.   THE GOOD:  ++ Compatible with an amazing variety of file formats, without conversion, unlike iPods. Whatever is not compatible the software will convert for you if at all possible. This is a HUGE plus for the computer-illiterate.  ++ Great sound quality, a bare minimum requirement for a music player.  ++ Sleek looks, IMO superior to the trite iPod-like, spin-wheel design. It certainly got more looks and comments than the iPod I had previously. Also, it's more pleasant to hold in your hand: small but not too tiny, and very sturdy/solid (which, if you'll handle it 8-10 hours a day like I do, is a huge plus).  ++ The included software is fantastic. It's fast, reliable (never froze), and lets you manage files and create playlists quickly and painlessly. Basically, anything you can do with the player's built-in software you can do with ZEN Media Explorer from your computer. So, go for it.  ++ Many complained about the interface, but I actually like it very much. The built-in software is easy to understand and utilize. The buttons are a tad tricky, but all you need to do is play around with them for ten minutes before you're able to find them blindly by just sticking your hand in your pocket (something you certainly cannot do with iPods, whose interface is more visually-driven).   THE SO-SO:  ++/-- The SD expansion slot is both a pain and a pleasure. Yes, you can basically make this a 16Gb with an SDHC card for a few bucks--but it's true that only SOME content will run off of it, and that while you are playing content from the SD card you cannot navigate the built-in flash memory. So, caveat emptor... but if you know what you're getting there's no reason to complain. How many times do you really browse your music while you're already listening to something else anyway?   THE BAD:  -- Perplexed about battery life info: "25 hours of continuous listening"? I don't think so. More like 10-12, which is on par with similar devices.  -- The shortest USB cable ever bundled. Buy a cheapo extension from Monoprice right away, unless you already own a USB hub. Otherwise, your player will lie on the floor or, worse, hang by the cable while it's being charged and sync'ed, neither of which is good.  -- The joystick buttons make a slightly annoying clicking sound, not when pressed but when released. However, this does not happen on my friend's ZEN, so maybe I got a "bad" unit?  -- AWFUL packaging! What were they thinking? Not only is it one of those impossible-to-open blister packs, but if you use scissors it's relatively easy to harm the contents... not the player, thankfully, which is in full sight, but the manuals and CD and bundled cables. So be careful.   OTHER THOUGHTS:  ** BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR! Apply it immediately. The screen will collect dust (and thus scratches) within hours, like any LCD. ** BUY A CASE OR SKIN! Piano-black finish is attracted to fingerprints like flies to s__t. ** 8Gb is perfect for the serious music listener with varied taste. Buffs and pros want to go for 16Gb. Occasional listeners will do well with 4Gb. Media moguls, of course, need not apply: that's what the Vision is for.   Overall, one of the best entry-level portable music players on the market. The price tag may well be the deal-breaker here: it is cheaper than any other brand music player, and it does the same things AND, in my opinion, more and better. Support by Creative is also famously good, so I see no reason not to buy a ZEN.

<Title>Good when it is working
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen is a very good mp3 and video player.  You have to convert every video to 320x240 wmv format, which takes as long as the video length to convert.  My main qualm with the player is that it has a penchant for restarting sometimes when it is attached to my computer.  One time it turned itself off when it was charging and subsequently never turned back on (it had basically a full battery).  Pushing reset of the power button yielded no result.  So I sent it back to Creative and got a "new" one.  This "new" one had the battery warning on the back in French (it came from the RMA facility in Stillwater, OK).  The day after I got it back, I (stupidly) decided that it would be a good idea to update the firmware.  Upon restarting for the upgrade, the player got to a state from which it has not returned.  Upon startup, it displays the initial creative screen and subsequently goes blank.  There is supposed to be another Zen screen followed by the ability to actually use the player.  In other words, it does not turn on again and is unusable.  I have not seen any real difference between the firmware versions on the player (I have updated it many times).  My advice would be to stick with the version you have.

<Title>The reviews aren't exaggerating, unfortunately
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The reviews aren't exaggerating.  I consider myself rather tech savvy and thought that perhaps the bad reviews were from people who didn't really know how to be careful with complicated hardware.  But I was wrong.  This is a beautiful player with a lot going for it, except for the fact that it's extremely buggy.  The first one I received had the "white screen" bug -- it started at white screen right out of the box, nothing I did could make the display change, and Creative was completely unable to fix the error.  I sent it back (to Amazon -- see my postcript below), and received another one.  The second works much better than the first, but goes to white screen when I "lock" and then "unlock" it again.  I have to turn off the player, then restart it to reset the display.  Bottom line: I really want to like this player -- enough that I will try it a bit longer and wait for one more firmware update (if it arrives).  But it sounds like many of the problems are hardware rather than firmware.  I fear that it's a lemon, which is disappointing.  Purchase with caution.  P.S. Five Stars for Amazon's customer service!!  It's so nice to know that I have protection from getting burned by Creative's manufacturing problems -- something that will keep me coming back to Amazon as a regular electronics customer.  ***UPDATE*** And it's not good news: 24 hours later, I try it out again, and it won't play music.  It just freezes.  Not good, Creative Labs.  Not good at all.  I will give it 48 hours -- if there is not a firmware upgrade in that time, I'm back to Ipods.  Man, I really want to like this player, too.

<Title>disappointed
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, I purchased the Zen (8gb)from Amazon. Their service has always been outstanding. I feel that Creative didn't make a good player because I had to return the replaced Zen because it also stopped working. The first one stopped responding while I was trying to charge it for the first time. The second unit broke in two weeks. Both had the same problem: little blue light on the power switch comes on, and the screen does not turn on. I researched a lot before buying this product. Too bad it's got problems. I would buy it again if I could finally get a non-defective product.

<Content>I bought this because it had the exact options I wanted in the price range I wanted.  The reviews looked good and the problems with locking up seemed to be few and far between.  I was wrong.  I received the ZEN and, after charging for 4.5 hours, I started loading music into it.  As soon as it finished loading, it shut itself off and never restarted.  I've now returned it and went with the Ipod because of it's better reputation for reliability.

<Title>My best effort for a comprehensive review
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, I'll try and be as comprehensive and thorough as I can be.  I've got the 8gb Zen and I've had it for about a month and a half now.  Currently, I'm using the 1.13.01 firmware and that clear case with key ring that Creative sells.  Given that this is a music player first and foremost, audio quality is priority number one.  While I do not consider myself an audiophile, sound quality is nevertheless important to me.  The Zen comes out with honors here.  The sound right out of the box is fantastic.  However, it can get even better with the equalizer and sound options.  Hey, after all, Creative has just a little experience with computers and audio equipment and they get it really right here.    I've listened to other players that are on the market and I must say that I believe that the Zen is near the top if not at the top in terms of sound quality.  Also, there is talk that they will be introducing X-FI to their players which is just going to put them head and shoulders above the rest.  Battery life has improved.  Initially I was not getting the advertised 20 to 25 hours playtime, but with the firmware updates, this has improved greatly.  Not sure if it's at 20 right now, but its acceptable.  The Zen easily gets me through a couple of days before needing to be recharged.  The included USB cable is, uhm, convenient if you are traveling and using your laptop?  Maybe?  Fortunately, Creative is not using proprietary stuff here and I just switched out that USB cable for a longer one that I already had and I'm doing just fine.  There are actually two schools of thought with how Creative implemented the SD Card and I've become somewhat on the fence with this.  First, I know that a lot of people would like to see the SD Card fully integrated (which is where I was), not all features are available for the SD Card.  However, as a portable flash drive, it is great!  Drag and drop with no hassles with the ability to still use it as extra storage for videos and music.  And if 4gb, 8gb, or 16gb is not enough for you, just wait.  Creative is coming out with a 32gb - don't know when though.  The other features are nice and I can't complain really about any of them.  There's a FM radio, Calendar, Clock, Organizer, Contacts List, Microphone and plenty of customizable options.  I just wish it could work better as a PDA (alarm and modify daily tasks) and then I would be completely satisfied!  But hey, I got this for playing music not as an organizer.  The included software is really easy to use.  Drag and Drop if ya want!  The video converter works well, but may take a while to convert your video to an acceptable format.  I just watched Battlestar Galactica: Razor on my Zen and it looked and sounded great!  However it took over an hour to convert and put it on my player.  There are other programs to use.  All in all, I have been more than happy with my Zen.  Great, size and looks and sound quality is top notch with some nice features added on.  There are somethings I would improve, but those do not keep me from enjoying my player.  It does everything I ask of it.  I highly recommend this one.  If you are considering the Apple Nano, take a look around.  There's a reason the Apple Fan Bois are squirming.  There are better options around and this is one of them.  Lastly, just remember, get your hands on one and decide for yourself.  The vast majority of people that are happy with something are not going to come to the forums to brag about it.  That kind of distorts the image more than just a little.  There have been bumps in the road, but Creative is really good at fixing stuff and I'm sure whomever wanted to rush this out in time for Black Friday and all that stuff has been fired...

<Title>Main memory can't hold many small photos but SD can
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In general I like the player. Works well for music and videos and you can fill up the full memory with these type of files.  For me, I wanted my Zen 8 GB to hold tens of thousands of photos of small photos. I found out you cannot do this! If you use small photos (say 640x400), they typically take less than 100 KB space each. On a 8 GB unit, you should be able to hold somewhere around 80,000 photos (give or take). But I found that the unit could only hold 8,000 to 9,000 photos before complaining it had INSUFFICIENT memory. This is despite the fact that the Zen (and the provided PC software) says the unit STILL HAS MORE THAN 6 GB FREE MEMORY! With many small photos, my 6 GB "free memory" also CANNOT be used to store any music! So, if you load lots of small photos, you cannot use anywhere near the units memory capacity!  If you use high-resolution larger photos (a few MB each) you CAN fill up the entire 8 GB of memory with photos but who need giant photos on a small screen (i.e., it is useless). Also, you can only put a few thousand large photos on the unit and I want TENS of thousands.  After about 4 rounds of Creative tech support, I gave up trying to get these photos in main memory. Tech support claims there is NO LIMIT to the number of files or folders that can be placed on the machine and that many people are putting this many files on their machine. I went through numerous rounds reloading firmware, formatting, clearing memory etc., but the results did not change.  If there is even ONE person using the Zen 8 GB for tens of thousands of photos (and using all of the main memory) let me know by writing your own review. Maybe my unit is defective, but I honestly think there is some kind of design problem limiting the number of photos if they are small.  Next, thank goodness for the SD/SDHC card slot! I am VERY GLAD it does NOT integrate with the main memory, because the SD card CAN hold as many photos as I want, limited only to the maximum memory of the card. If the SD card was integrated into the main memory system, it too would probably be of very limited use to me.  For someone wanting zillions of music files, it would of course be better to have the SD memory look like the main memory. To each his own :)  A nice firmware upgrade would let the user be able to choose whether to use the SD slot as it is now OR to extend the main units memory and be able to use all the nice features that entails.  For those that don't know, files stored on the SD slot cannot use all the nice features that are available to files stored in main memory.

<Title>MUCH Better than the Microphoto!!!!
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to have a MicroPhoto Zen 8 GB but it was stolen so I replaced it with this. This is so much better and easier to use! Navigating the player is intuitive and you really don't need to read the manual to understand how it works. The sound quality is amazing and I really love that I can expand the memory with an SD card.  The battery life is not spectacular and the face scratches easily, so I suggest you get a case to protect the face and a spare backup battery if you know you're gonna be using this a lot. Also, if you leave it plugged into your computer for too long, it may freeze up but that's what the RESET button is for.  In all, a very good product!

<Content>an excellent media player, if you have the time for it. i am one of those people who likes the convenience of itunes and how its so user friendly. the  transition from an ipod to the zen was a painful process im afraid. the problems are not limited to that of the Player, in fact my problems lie almost Entirely with the software that must be used to transfer music to The player.  Creating playlists is not what it used To be with itunes where one can just drag a song to the list. now you must find the file on your computer, make sure its not protected, then see if the file Is supported on the player. the video converter is decent however time consuming but it doesnt Support real player files!!! this devastated me due to my collection tv shows in real player format, so unless you want to Spend an extra 30 to 40 $ on a shrink program due to all Your real player files, dont buy this player. i also cannot put music files that have been bought from itunes music store because they Are 'protected'. this Fact is extremely depressing because a Large amount of people out There are buying Loads of itunes files under the impression That they can use them on other music players.  much of the unfortunate things that have occured might be easily Solved, however not being a very patient person, i couldnt find the various solutions.

<Title>Awesome MP3
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I especially like the ease of navigation, the size, and the ease of loading files.  I use it to listen to recorded books while driving in the car. I use a cassete tape adapter connected to the headphone port. It is compatable with downloaded books from my local library, and books loaded from CD's. It was the only unit I found to use SD memory chips which I use to store books. What a fun way to carry around my favorite pictures of my grand children. I am still learning about other features and uses.

<Title>The Good Outweighs The Bad
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just received this product refurbished yesterday and so far, I am very satisfied with it. I will update this review as necessary (some of the experienced problems may not arise until a few weeks into use). There are many reviews that report freezing, but these issues seem to have been alleviated with the later shipments of the Zen and the firmware updates. So far, I am very satisfied.  The Good -size: credit card sized, light weight -performance: excellent quality audio and visual output -software/interface: both very easy to use -battery life: almost as long as advertised -problems so far: none  The Bad -software/interface: converting video takes a little time  ---  Three Week Update  -no freezes, no news, that's good news

<Title>Good MP3 player in small package
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Small & beautiful Mp3 player. I had initial jitters as it did not power on. Then I was able to use the Charger of Motorola Bluetooth headset charger for charging this device overnight. After that this has been a great MP3 player. I need to use the PC for creating all the playlists. The free audiobooks was not a good option.  I am happy with the MP3 player. I was able to convert some videos to wmv format with Zen organiser & my wife saw the movie in the player.  We are happy with the player now.

<Title>Good product, bad software
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The overall product is fine, but the software that supports the player is not strong enough to perform its functions.  I would not recommend purchasing this product until Creative solves the software problem.  This player is relatively inexpensive in comparison with other players, so if you are software savvy and have the patience to deal with frozen screens and constant resetting, then this could still be a good option for you.

<Title>great little player

<Content>Love it.  It's interface is similar to the zen micro, which I love and adore.  I bought the clear plastic keychain case and that prevents fingerprints from taking over the screen.  Overall this is a gem of an mp3 player.

<Title>Full of Features But Has A Major Flaw
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>About a month ago, I decided to buy a MP3 player. I'm a college student who is very tech savvy and wanted something very portable, and after much research I bought the Creative Zen 8GB because of it's immense features and beautiful screen. However, the honeymoon did not last long.  The Creative Zen does give a lot of bang for your buck. It's relatively cheaper than the competition and comes with FM Radio, voice recording, and has a beautiful 2.5 inch screen for video viewing. The audio quality is extremely good and you can even customize the equalizer. The Zen is highly configurable, as you can reorder your menus and it even has a programmable shortcut button so you can go straight to your playlist, your videos, or even the date and clock.  But the Zen has major flaws, specifically with Microsoft Windows Vista. I run Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate on my Dell laptop, and I prefer to use Windows Media Player 11 to sync with my music since the bundled Creative Music software is, to say the least, primitive and ugly. At first, the Zen works fine: I synced all my music with great ease and the album art transferred over. However, after multiple syncs, the Zen would occasionally lock up and turn black.   As other reviewers have noted as well as many other frustrated customers in forums, the Zen has a major syncing problem with Windows Media Player. Although this can simply be solved by resetting the device, it becomes cumbersome to constantly restart your device everytime you connect it to the PC. Another proposed solution is to stick with the Creative software, but it feels outdated compared to the simple Itunes or the sleek Windows Media Player.   On top of the Vista problems, the Creative support is laughable. The website does not even acknowledge the problem, let alone provide a solution. Despite the software and firmware updates, the Zen still does not function well. I tried every solution, from using the recovery option to formatting my Zen to reloading my firmware and nothing worked. In many forums, the Zen in general has many problems, not including the sync problem.  You may say that I'm extremely picky, giving a score 2 stars just because of the Windows Media Player. But I had high expectations, and after owning an Ipod before this (which gave me absolutely no headaches), I have come to a conclusion that this product isn't worth the hassle. The player itself is a treat; the shoddy software and its incompatibility with an universal program such as WMP is unacceptable. After a month of using the Zen, I plan on returning the player soon.

<Title>Creative Zen MP3
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first MP3 player. I wanted something to take on trips and use at the gym.  The software is easy to use and I copied CDs in a matter of minutes.  The sound is great (although I am using different ear phones than what came with the player).  The size is good for me; it is small enough, but not too small.  I purchased a separate accessory package that includes chargers, cases and screen cover to protect the player.  So far I am very pleased with the Zen.
