<Title>great mp3 player !!!!!!!!!!!  good value or money
<Date>Fri Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3 player as it was a great value for money and after comparing it to the ipod shuffle I thought it had many exciting features such as an equilizer, superquick battery charge , fm radio  and a reasnable 1 gb storage space it could also be used as a flash drive . The software sonicstage is reasnably good but lacks the user friendliness of iTunes overall i would rate this player 9 and a half out of 10 and i am very happy with it !!

<Title>Beats the iPod by a longshot!
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great MP3 player. It sounds, looks, and feels better than an iPod. The storage capacity is huge. There are only 2 problems. 1)The screen is really hard to see in the sun(this might only be with silver, I don't know). 2)The software is great, if you're used to it, but, is a little slow compared to Windows Media Player of iTunes.  Overall, it is worth more than you pay for. Just buy it!

<Title>Cool little MP3 player! Software is NOT!
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this little cool MP3 player yesterday. It is a fun little toy, filled with features. The LCD is simply beautiful. Battery was fully charged in 30 mins. Installed the software and it's importing music files into it's library automatically from my hard drive. Plugs in the player and it transfered songs in automatically too. Then it stopped after transfered 40 songs. Well, now I have no idea how to transfer more songs as it isn't user friendly at all. Maybe I'll do it again when I have time to go through the manual. Bottom line is, it is a cool little music player but the software sucks!

<Title>Awesome little thing!
<Date>Mon Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Somehow, I really really like this mp3 player. I like SONY audio in general and they have done a great job at this one too. I have NO problems with their software or hardware. It works even on my 10 year old computer with USB 1.1. For such a small thing, this thing has a nice display screen, which makes it easy to browse the songs. The FM is great, it doubles as a thumb drive. It's got a sports timer, equalizer and so many features.I was considering iPod shuffle first, but didn't like the fact that it don't have a screen.  The headphones are great and I can easily hookup to my home pc speakers for a great sound! The only negative thing I see is that the USB  cap provided with this player isn't attached to the player body and it's easy to lose, but that's not really a problem, just got to be a little careful. I'm surprised why some people have written about 'user-unfriendliness' of this player. I was able to do pretty much everything with it, and I haven't read the manual (nor probably will ;-)) . A much better buy over iPod shuffle.

<Title>wow this is so kewl 
<Date>Sun Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this player. It is tiny and feels very durable . Youll love the display screen which you can type messages onto using your computer . You really cant see the display in the sunlight though , it works great in the dark or shade. It plugs right into the computer and charges as you transfer cds and music files to it, so neat! The software lets you catagorize all the songs so you can search by album artist or song on the player. I loaded cds onto it , and files from windows media player already. I worked a 9 hour day at work and had it on the whole time and it still showed a full charge. The nice thing is , is that it has a radio bulit in too. The headphones i got with it are wierd , the right wire is so long and the left is so short , not sure if this is a defect or what. Anyway its real sleek and easy to put songs on and use. A real good buy!

<Title>If it wasn't for the awful software...maybe
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player seems to work only through Sony's SonicStage music management software, but even that failed to recognize the player. In short: the gizmo looked good, it was even kind of cute, but since I wasn't able to make it work, it is going back to the store.   It was supposed to replace my 20BG iPod, which has a nasty tendency to freeze up during workouts. At least Apple's "pride" can be unlocked with a bit of trying and I can add music through iTunes - which after trying out SonicStage seems like a breath of fresh air...  There must be some better mp3 players out there. Does ANY manufacturer produce an mp3 player (flash, or HD) that lasts and doesn't lockup? Any suggestions?

<Title>looks nice but software is very fustrating to use
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the sony walkman looks nice and has alot of nice features but the software that you are forced to use to convert mp3's to atrac is very fustrating.  I sent the following to sony:  I have recently received a Sony walkman nw-e003.  I liked everything about it except for the fact that I am forced into a license agreement to use software that I do not want to install on my pc and the fact I can not play mp3's but have to convert then using lame software.  What were you thinking!?  furthermore it is very frustrating to use this software and arrange my music files.  It should be drag and drop! That simple. You took a great product and totally foobared it by forcing people to convert their mp3's.   Time is money and you have already cost me more money than what your product is worth so I am returning it to get a real mp3 player.  By the way, what good is to have the ability to hold so many music files when managing them is a complete nightmare?

<Title>don't buy
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The "player" only works with Sony Sonic Stage. The player is not bad, but what good is it if you struggle to load music. Let me begin, Sonic stage 4.0 kept crashing my dell pentium 4 running XP Pro. Upgraded to 4.3. 4.3 sonic stage will not run. Called sony support, did what they said, still will not run. I am now stripping my computer down and resetting it up. Will it run? I have now vowed not to buy anything made by sony.

<Title>Better Than My SANSA! 
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had one of these and lost it at the gym. In a panic, I went a bought a Sansa Media Player...which I can't stand and after two weeks, decided to purchase this one again.   The principal reason? I listen to a lot of techno/dance/circuit music. Sony's software doesn't put in a "soft blank" where one track ends and another begins, as does Windows Media software, even when you reduce cross-fading. When you're running or working out, I want my music constant, seamless, as it was intended to be heard.   Another reason I like this product is the long battery life. It seems as if I have to recharge the Sansa every two days. With Sony, it's more like two weeks.   While I haven't received the merchandise as of this date, I have no doubt I'll be pleased with it.

<Title>Could have been great.....
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nice design, good sound, and decent interface.   Pros: Lightweight Holds a surprising amount of music Feels like it could take a beating Pocketsized  Cons: Finger print laden SonicStage software is horrible to use with Vista (not much better with XP) No accessories available Display was hard to read No expansion slot  I really would love to say how great this is but the Software doesn't work, AT ALL on Vista! SonicStage is the only program you're able to use to transfer your music with, no drag and drop. After a week of trying to make software work, I boxed it up and exchanged it for a Sansa 250e. The Sansa was $30 more and will aloow you to drag and drop files with no software required.  Sorry Sony you screwed up, you should know better than this!

<Title>Great MP3 Player//Booo Sonic Software
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have 3 of these great little machines.  They are very small and sound great. It took many tries to get the software to work the 1st time.  It actually shut down my computer & it took days of trouble shooting to get it to work.  Everything is running smoothly now.  My kids 10 & 8 and I love it.  Very Quick charge up.  Do not upgrade to the sonic 4.3 or whatever it is.  It will mess up your computer & the original program will not work.  Shop around for the best price.  I paid full price for the 1st one and 1/2 price for the 2nd & 3rd.  Downside...no accessories.  I found one wrist belt for 25.00...too much.

<Title>great design, great sound, poor execution on software
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not to beat this to point to a pulp, but as many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the flaw of this player is the lack of "drag and drop" capability. Also, the lack of ability to charge on the road (unless you have a portable computer with USB, or a computer where you are going) this thing is dead in the water on a car ride. All my other players use alkaline batteries or can use a cord. I own 4 mp3 players now, and this is the only one I can not just drop an mp3 format file onto it and play. you are forced to use the clunky sonic stage program which makes uploading a pain in the rump. you have to import a track, then transfer it to the player. Not exactly the fastest way to do things (basically doing everything twice). the battery charging thing is a pain also. I have a GPX player, and Two Coby's and I am more satisfied with those than this. But I got this for Free, so what can I say, can't complain too much. This also has a nice FM tuner (take that I-pod with your clunky software and proprietary garbage). For those who have to purchase, please look elsewhere first (like the Sandiscs, gpx, coby, rca, or comparables). All of those other ones are drag, drop, go. not this.

<Title>Looking for a nice and simple MP3 palyer ? try somewhere else
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm more than happy with my Apple nano iPod, however, my wife insisted of buying a different player.  Her requirements where quite plain and simple, let it be a USB key, simple drag and drop files and if it would be a little stylish that would make it even better.  Trying to stay away from the cheap looking no-names USB players, we're were happy to find the shiny Sony player with its (really) nice display.  Unfortunately, we did not make enough research, and since we were blinded with the hype of the Sony brand name (got a little weaker lately, isn't it ?) - we've bought this piece.  I wouldn't say anything here about its sound quality or ease of use (after you've uploaded the songs) - they are just fine.  The horrible SonicStage (or what ever they call it) software you have to use in order to transfer songs to the device is just horrible ! After getting used to the superb iTunes, or even Window Media Player, why would you have to use a new confusing software to manage your media ?  No simple file drag and drop like we really wanted (still don't understand why), very confusing warnings about copyright or whatever and so on.  It's 2007, we're so over those crappy and disabled interfaces (I hope), and I really find myself frustrated when I'm being told to do things in a way I'm not supposed to (for reasons known only to Sony).  But I guess we deserve it after we didn't learn the lesson  from our Sony Ericsson cellphone with its clunky and horrible software...  So, if you want a simple player ? buy a simple cheap one, want a slick shiny player ? look somewhere else

<Title>Very Happy
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having used this player for a few days, I'm a bit mystified over the negative comments regarding the software...it's neither daunting or difficult to quickly transfer mp3 files to the Sony. I did immediately download/install the latest version of the Sonic software, which is 4.3 as of the writing...perhaps that's the reason why no difficulty was experienced, I honestly don't know.That having been said, I'm pleased with the NW-E003. Audio quality is very good, battery charging time is astonishingly fast, and the player is fairly easy to learn to use and operate. Best of all, unlike my last mp3 player (a Curtis model), the Sony remembers where you stopped listening when the player is turned off, and resumes from that point when power is reapplied. This makes it perfect for lengthier programs, such as radio broadcasts or audiobooks. The player has accompanied me to work for the past couple of days, and I've been enjoying an audiobook of "Apollo 13" during those drives, thanks to it.This is a lot of player for very little money. Two minor complaints--the display is washed out/useless in any sort of sunlight, and I do wish that Sony would offer a faster audible scan function in future models. Otherwise, I'm quite pleased.

<Title>Software freezes the entire computer
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Started importing music from CD's. My computer froze. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still freezes. I mean freeze where you have to cut power. Called Sony and we check my operating system XP, ram, service pack, etc... Did everything they told me to, and still freezes. Deleted and uninstalled it, and now I'm on my way to return to the store. I bought this yesterday. It looks great and the FM tuner sounds fine, but can not get past the software to load my music. I seen the negative reviews but I thought this is SONY. Tried it anyways and now I have a headache.

<Title>Great little product at an excellent price.....
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3 player from Circuit City for $40.00.  I love it!  Using the ATRAC format, I can get well over 200 songs on the player.  The ATRAC format quality sounds great (i.e. I can not tell any difference in the quality between mp3, wav, and the ATRAC formats).    The software takes a little practice.  The biggest problem I have had with the software is grouping a group's different albums under one title.  When I add the music to the software it wants to group by album title under the artist.  The only other big issue is the lack of ability to drag songs to a different location.  You need to retitle the group name to move the songs.  Other that, I am very pleased with the player.

<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I read a couple of reviews, i guess i didnt read enough, this is the worse mp3 player i have ever had, every other mp3player i had was drag and drop and thats it, sony's NW-E003(cap)....Crappy A#% player, is so hard to add songs on, I've missed the gym twice trying to put songs on it, I've talked to customer service for 2 hours and they still couldnt help, buy a cheap coby mp3 player from meijers or something works better than this junk, nice features but the sonic program made sony lose a lot of money and made me lose a lot of time, instead of working out and gaining muscle, I'm getting fat in front of the computer trying to make this player work, bottom line......buy any mp3 player besides sony, if sony owns Apple, Id probably buy a microsoft zune, i dont think i want anything sony after this................buy it if u like wasting money!!!!!!

<Title>Sonicstage, Hate it! Does not work with Windows Vista
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Last Sony music player I'll ever buy. I had to use the restore feature in Windows to boot after the changes Sonicstage made, and had to uninstall the program.  Cannot use it without Sonicstage, sonicstage will not work on my computer. I think I'll stick to players that will actually play MP3 files, instead of converting them into Sony's proprietary format.

<Title>Nice Player, Bad Software.
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am what you might call a newbie when it comes to mp3 players. I've been an avid mp3 downloader for years but have always just played them off my PC or burned them to CD for my car. I have recently decided to make my music more mobile and I have to say that I'm not completely thrilled with this mp3 player.  When it comes to the operation of the player and the sound I'm more than happy with it. Once the songs are on the system it's easy to make it do what I want it to do. As for the sound quality it seems to be great just as long as you buy a different set of head phones (at least for me), as the ones that come with the system are ear buds and are horribly uncomfortable and fall out constantly.  The only thing I don't like about the mp3 player is a great downfall. As I stated before I'm a newbie and thought that you could just plug this guy in then 'drag and drop' the mp3's you want onto it (like a thumb drive), oh was I wrong. They include this "Sonic Stage" software with the player and you MUST use it to get the mp3's onto your player and oh my does it suck. First thing I hate is the fact that It does not display my song library the way it should and instead has it all jumbled into a knotted mess. Next is the fact that this thing only seems to agree with my desktop running windows XP and not my laptop which unfortunately running Vista Ultimate.  In the mean time I will keep this player but when I get the chance I'm going to get one that doesn't have such horrid software.

<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>like i said, i have no complaints about the player. once you get the music on there, it's amazing. however, getting the music on there is a rediculously confusing process. the software experience on most computers with Vista operating systems ranges from considerable hardships to not working at all. also, even if you get it working(good luck with that) you'll still run in to insane restrictions as far as ripping from cd's goes. don't bother buying this. spend a little more to get an iPod or even a sanDisk... my experiences with those brands have been 99% better.

<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You buy an mp3 player to play your mp3's, right? Well, this player does not play your mp3's.  This is a cool little player. The invisible readout feature is cool. The fact that it charges by plugging into your computer's usb port is cool.  However, it claims to play mp3's and wma's. It does not. It can convert your existing files to play, but it can't play them. So, if you already have files, and you want to load them onto the player, you will have to convert them with sonicstage first, then transfer them on. This is very inconvenient, and will take up double the space on your hard drive.  If you don't already have mp3's or wma's, or if you are already using sonicstage, this is a good player. Otherwise, it does not do what you are buying it for.

<Title>Symphonic Makes Walkman A Great Player
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a small sleak player that definitely lands in the cool category.  I was very disappointed when I first go the player because I thought I would have to use Sony's SonicStage software on Windows.  After some searching on the internet I found Symphonic, http://sourceforge.net/projects/symphonic/, which is Java based and works on Linux.  A simple tutorial can be found at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Music_Player_%28Device%29  Symphonic is much faster than SonicStage and makes putting files onto, and taking files off of the Walkman a breeze.  Overall the Sound Quality is great, it charges fast, and the capacity is decent, but it is Sony's fault that simple software such as Symphonic has to be downloaded instead of SonicStage so I have to give it a three star review.
